ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson [00:01:12] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for coming back Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I note that you are coming back to the 
commission for the second time in regard to Eskom but you 
are actually coming back to the commission for the third 
time if one counts when you came for the SABC last year. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but thank you for coming back. 
DR NGUBANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson Mr 
Ngubane’s legal represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just to place himself on record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please do so. 
ADV 
MKHABELA: 
Good 
morning 
Chair 
the 
name 
is 
20 
Mkhabela I represent Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Mkhabela. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Well Chairperson for 
Dr Ngubane we are still using Eskom Bundle 09[A]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  09[A]. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 5 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And 09[B]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry 09? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And 09[B] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [A] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  09[A] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mainly 09[A]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dr Ngubane you will have the same 
bundle in front of you – Eskom Bundle 09[A] 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – that is the bundle that contains 
your affidavits and annexures thereto.  Dr Ngubane we are 
going to try to finish off on the suspensions today because 
you did testify on your – on the last occasion on the 
suspensions but we could not finish it off.  Is that alright? 
20 
Oops – and just to recap in regard to your evidence 
given 
in 
your 
affidavit 
and 
testimony 
on 
your 
last 
appearance and I want to start off with what you say were 
your relations with the Gupta members – family members, 
Mr Salim Essa and Mr Nazeem Howa.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 6 of 289 
 
So we understand from you evidence that you came 
to know Mr Howa if I may start with him during the TNA 
breakfast meetings when you were at the SABC. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that we find on just by way of 
reference Chairperson for the record on page 40 of Mr 
Ngubane’s affidavit and page 40 I am using the black 
pagination Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  14 or 40? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  40.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it reads: 
“I knew Mr Salim Essa and Mr Nazeem 
Howa from past interactions with each of 
them before I was appointed to the Eskom 
board.  I came to know Mr Howa when 
attending the New Age breakfast meetings 
during my time as chairman of the South 
African Broadcasting Corporation.” 
 
And 
Mr 
Ngubane 
you 
could 
confirm 
to 
the 
20 
Chairperson that the time that you were the chairperson at 
SABC was it from 2010 to 2013? 
DR NGUBANE:  2010 to – no 2103. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To 2013? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 7 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  10 to 13 – 2010/2013.  So you would 
have come to know Mr Howa at the time during that time? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  And in regard to Mr Salim Essa you 
say: 
“I 
also 
knew 
Mr 
Essa 
prior 
to 
my 
appointment at Eskom.  I had met him for 
the first time during 2011 or so when I was 
at the SABC.  Mr Essa was on the board of 
Broadband Infraco SOC Limited.  I used to 
10 
attend meetings with various state owned 
entities including BBI which is Board of 
Broadband Infraco as I attend meetings with 
the various state owned entities including 
that as part of the SABC delegation where 
we were discussing digital migration for the 
country.  There were some of the occasions 
during which I interacted with Mr Essa.” 
And then in 2013 you talk about meeting him at JB 
Rivers at Melrose Arch.  That is where the oil deal gets to 
20 
be discussed which leads to you and him becoming 50% 
partners in a company called Gade Oil Gas, correct? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you have your interaction with the 
Gupta families.  You deal with that on page 42 of your 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 8 of 289 
 
affidavit.   
“I knew members of the Gupta family” 
Paragraph 8.7 Chairperson. 
“I knew members of the Gupta family when I 
was chairman of the SABC.  I often met 
members of the Gupta family together with 
officials of the New Age Newspaper at the 
business breakfasts.  Business breakfasts 
which were arranged by the New Age and 
broadcast on the Morning Live Program of 
10 
the SABC.  My relationship with them was 
social but not business related.  I used to 
receive invitations for social events at their 
home in Saxonwold and attended some.” 
Then you talk about your invitation to the wedding 
at Sun City that you were – you were invited and you 
attended and you were still at the time a member and 
chairman of the SABC board. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So there is lots of interactions 
20 
between you and Mr Howa, the Gupta – you say members 
of the Gupta family.  Will that be the three brothers or is it 
beyond the three brothers? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well at different events they would be 
there.  Not always together. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 9 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Okay.  Now it seems to me as I 
was taking you – now thinking back about your testimony 
last time and you can tell the Chairperson because what is 
– what emerges from the documentation and I want to go 
specifically to the email that are prepared – well the emails 
that I exchanged between Mr Howa and Mr Essa putting 
together a draft statement that was meant to be read out 
by you or released by yourself. 
 
Mr Howa exchanged a document with Mr Salim 
Essa.  I think it is in Bundle – Eskom Bundle 09[B] the 
10 
smaller bundle.  The page reference is 764.1. 
DR NGUBANE:  It that U19? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja are you on page 764.1?  I am using 
the black pagination on the left hand corner – top left 
hand.   
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry just say that again please. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is page 764.1 you will see an email 
from Mr Howa on the 31 March 2015.   
DR NGUBANE:  No I do not think I find this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you assist Dr Ngubane please. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are there Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:  I have got it now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So this email is from Mr Nazeem 
Howa sent on Tuesday 31 March 2015 at 07:46 and it is 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 10 of 289 
 
sent to Mr Salim Essa.  Subject line is Statement from New 
Board March 31 Salim Bhai he writes: 
“Salim Bhai – B-h-a-i as amended version 
for your approval the statement is on the 
next page.” 
 
And the Chairperson did go through the statement 
last time but this statement – the contents of the statement 
are remarkable.  And if you turn the page to page 764.2 it 
says: 
“Statement by Dr Ngubane Chairperson of 
10 
Eskom on behalf of the board.” 
 
You see that statement? 
DR NGUBANE:  I see the statement yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  The statement and details what is 
happening within Eskom and this is you would recall after 
the – what is it the resignation of Mr Tsotsi on the 30 
March 2015.  And so it reads:  
“Nearly a month has passed since we took 
the decisive step to ask four of our most 
senior executives to step down from the day 
20 
to day roles to allow the board to appoint 
independent persons to assist us to develop 
a plan to ensure that Eskom is able to 
deliver a sustainable, secure and efficient 
supply of its consumers.” 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 11 of 289 
 
 
And it says: 
“Yesterday.  At a meeting of the board it 
was decided – it was decided…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka and I am sorry Dr 
Ngubane.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to ask something about that 
first paragraph before Mr Seleka continues.  You will see 
Dr Ngubane that in that first paragraph the statement says 
the executives were asked to step down.  Now when I read 
10 
that term ‘step down’ I remember ‘step aside’ as opposed 
to ‘step down’. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Mr Tsotsi when he was giving 
evidence talked a lot about stepping aside as opposed to 
suspension you know.  Saying – he was saying he saw 
suspension as implying some wrongdoing and he preferred 
to say they should be asked to step aside.   
 
I 
wonder 
whether 
one 
should 
attach 
any 
significance 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
whoever 
prepared 
this 
20 
statement thought that the board had asked the executives 
to step down as opposed to step aside. 
 
Or maybe one is just reading too much into the 
term.  Do you have some comment to say?  It is like they 
have been asked to leave. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 12 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. Well Chairperson we counselled 
against suspension.  We said they should take special 
leave.  We were told this cannot be done for investigation 
purposes so we decided that they should step aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  For three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And – and you used step 
aside not step down? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
is 
your 
understanding 
of 
the 
10 
difference between step aside and step down the same as 
mine namely you step aside if it is temporary – you step 
down if you are leaving? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so in your mind this person 
writing here is not correctly describing what you – your 
decision about the executives at the time. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  The statement 
20 
then carries on Mr Ngubane. 
“Yesterday at a meeting of the board it was decided – 
accepted it.” 
 
Now that is the wording of the statement decided – 
accepted. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 13 of 289 
 
“The resignation of Mr Zola Tsotsi as both 
chairperson and a director.” 
 
Now that is remarkable because that indeed did 
happen the night before on the 30 t h Dr Ngubane.  The 
acceptance of Mr Tsotsi’s resignation in fact did happen 
the night before on the 30 March. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“The board has once again reaffirmed its 
approach around its board – its broad 
10 
ranging investigation and the request for 
key individuals to stand down in order for 
the process to take place without fear or 
favour.  We are convinced on the basis of 
information we have gathered so far that 
this approach is the only way forward to 
provide a long term strategy to resolve the 
current issues at Eskom.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second again Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dr Ngubane just remind me I seem to 
think that the meeting at which Mr Tsotsi resigned was one 
held in the evening or in the night? 
DR NGUBANE:  Of the 30 t h? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the 30 t h. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 14 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your recollection of how late in 
the evening or how late in the night?  Around six, around 
eight, around ten? 
DR NGUBANE:  No it was some minutes after twelve 
midnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some minutes after twelve midnight. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so that – it is quite remarkable that 
this person the following morning already knows that 
something that happened so – so late.  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might be – you might wish to say 
something in response? 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja.  Chairperson those days with the 
SABC information was leaking like a sieve? 
CHAIRPERSON:    You mean at Eskom? 
DR NGUBANE:  At Eskom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  So SMS’s were doing the rounds.  So this 
person being a media person I am sure he had source of 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He [00:19:09] way.  Ja.  Okay thank you. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 15 of 289 
 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I interrupted you I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no, not at all Chair.  And just on 
that Dr Ngubane in fact the meeting of the 30 March 2015 
according to the minutes took place at 20:00 – eight 
o’clock at night and it ended at 22:00 that night.  The email 
is exchanged at 19:46 even before the meeting could start 
at eight o’clock that night. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  I am not sure that 
10 
I follow you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The Reference Bundle Chair.  The 
meeting starts according to the minute eight at night. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right 8:00 pm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  8:00 pm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And according to the minutes it 
ends at… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It ends at 22:00. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At 10 pm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 10 pm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The email – this email we are looking at 
Chairperson. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 16 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one sending the statement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The time stamp it is 7.40 is it 46 – yes 
7.46.  So that is even before the meeting could start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. Where do you get that from? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The time stamp on the email Chair.  
Tuesday 31 – oh I beg your pardon – I beg your pardon.  
That is after – that is on the 31 s t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is the following morning yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no it is the following morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is the following morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is he following morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja. 
 
But 
you 
just 
mentioned 
that 
according to the minutes the meeting ended at 10 pm.  Dr 
Ngubane recalls the meeting as having ended a few 
minutes after midnight on the 30 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Midnight 30 t h into the morning of the 31 s t.  
Dr Ngubane you seem to be – to be something to have a 
clear recollection of that?  And maybe because of the 
events of the evening you – it would remain in your mind. 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no Chairperson.  Probably the official 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 17 of 289 
 
meeting might have ended at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  But the discussions… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continued. 
DR NGUBANE:  Carried – continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because at one stage I went – I think it 
was with Mr Pamensky or Romeo Khumalo to actually talk 
to Mr Tsotsi.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Not to force a vote. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Of loss of confidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No confidence. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because he had said if you do that then 
you are destroying my chances with other boards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because my only source of income. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Is earning board money. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  On different boards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  So we were saying to him is unanimity in 
the board that a vote is going to be passed against you.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 18 of 289 
 
Now to save the situation that you complain about just 
resign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  And then there is no vote. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  And that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  But that took a very long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So – so the minutes might 
reflect the formal meeting as having ended at ten. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
there 
were 
discussions 
which 
continued up to – just after midnight. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And ultimately he resigned. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you – thank you Chair.  I think 
my – my time allocation was confusing this meeting with 
another meeting which we will come to later.  So the 
20 
statement then carries on with remarkable detail which 
reflects what transpired at Eskom – reflecting it with 
astounding accuracy.  It says: 
“The board has once again reaffirmed its 
approach 
around 
its 
broad 
ranging 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 19 of 289 
 
investigation.” 
I have read that. 
“We 
are 
convinced 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
information we have gathered so far that 
this approach is the only way forward to 
provide a long terms strategy to resolve the 
current issues at Eskom.  We are relieved 
too by the recent decision of the Labour 
Court on their appeal of the suspended 
CEO.  None of the board’s decision are 
10 
taken lightly but rather in the spirit of 
meeting our obligations.” 
 
Mr – Dr Ngubane you know I am reading fast. But it 
seems to me that paragraph I read about the recent 
decision of the Labour Court and the appeal of the 
suspended CEO can only refer to Mr Matona. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is one of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [00:24:24] suspended CEO 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.   
20 
“None of the board’s decisions are taken 
lightly but rather in the spirit of meeting our 
obligations as the board’s response – the 
board 
responsible 
for 
the 
utility 
which 
needs to support our country’s economic 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 20 of 289 
 
growth and the overall wellbeing of our 
nation.  The board spent much time over 
the past few weeks to discuss and debate 
the process around the investigation and to 
finalise 
the 
key 
areas 
of 
work 
to 
be 
delivered as a matter of urgency by the 
team we have appointed.  As a board we 
have spent time since our appointment to 
assess 
the 
business 
and 
to 
get 
some 
understanding of some of the key issues 
10 
facing Eskom.  We were saddened by the 
recent 
decision 
of 
SNP 
to 
downgrade 
Eskom.” 
 
So indeed Eskom was downgraded? 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We believe this decision – Ms Klein has 
said that much as well.   
“We believe this decision is based on a lack 
of understanding of the current conditions 
at Eskom and our comprehensive plan to 
20 
ensure 
a 
stable 
and 
reliable 
supply.  
However the board will redouble our efforts 
to meet the …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not intend reading the whole 
statement Mr Seleka do you? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 21 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair let us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can just go to the main features that 
you want to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not have to Chair.  I do not have to 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Dr Ngubane I do not have the read 
the whole statement because I think you deal with this in 
our affidavit. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And if I may refer you to that affidavit 
in Eskom 9 – Eskom Bundle 9[A] from page 21 to page 22.  
You deal with the – you go back to the thicker bundle.  T21 
Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:  It is a document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No your affidavit.  I am referring you – 
in the file.  In the file. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Alright.  Page P21.

ADV SELEKA SC:  21. Ja the black numbers.  Is this – is 
10 
the dictation Chair that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Mr Seleka I do not know how 
good your IsiZulu is but what I just said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Means that you speaking English in such 
a way that we cannot hear now.  Maybe – maybe speak it 
like the real English people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Ja page 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dr Ngubane it starts from paragraph 5. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found it Dr Ngubane?  Page – 
black numbers – black numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will give you the paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 21. 
DR NGUBANE:  Oh. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 23 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Black numbers ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you – if you are at page 21 that is 
fine because it begins – I am not going to read all of them 
but paragraph 5.7 it starts there.  It starts before that but 
we could pick it up from 5.7 the minutes that accepted Mr 
Tsotsi’s resignation. 
“And during the AGM held on 31 March 
2015 the minutes they announce Mr Tsotsi’s 
resignation.”   
10 
So you deal with that in the preceding paragraphs.  
These paragraphs and let us go to page 22.  Page 22 
paragraph 5.9 then you say: 
“On the 31 March 2015 I issued a press 
statement on my appointment as acting 
Chairman.  In it I also thanked Mr Tsotsi for 
his service to Eskom. I did not personally 
prepare this statement it was provided to 
me by the Company Secretary Mr Phukubje 
Malesela.”   
20 
Mr Phukubje Malesela was the Company Secretary 
at the time.  Then you go on to say: 
“I hasten to…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry for convenience you – do we 
have the statement – the media statement that Dr Ngubane 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 24 of 289 
 
ultimately issued as per paragraph 5.9 in the bundle 
because of – I seem to think that it was different from the 
one that was sent that we were looking at but I would like 
to see it if it is here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair there is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not want to disturb what you are 
planning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would – if you know that it is at 
page so and so I can just go there while you ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, Chair.  Page 764.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Seven... page 764 ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point 5.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And as you... that needs to be clarified 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That cannot be the same bundle, h’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is bracket B. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is this one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, bracket B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   764 ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   This file?  The second file? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second file. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 25 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   764.5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The Chairperson is going ahead of 
us, Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is needs to build line-by-line, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We need to build it line-by-line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  That is fine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is just for my purposes.  Then you 
10 
can go back to your plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the affidavit then Dr Ngubane is: 
“I hasten to add that as a matter of practise, I did 
not prepare my own speeches or press statements 
at Eskom.   
They would be provided to me by the company 
secretariat or Corporate Affairs Division.   
I did not have a meeting or conversation with 
20 
Mr Salim Essa regarding Mr Tsotsi’s resignation 
from Eskom, nor did I have any correspondence with 
Mr Essa 
regarding 
any 
appointments 
and 
resignations and movement of any employees within 
Eskom.” 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 26 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This cannot be the... it does not look to 
me as the chairperson’s media statements. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like an article. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hence, I was going to say Chair.  We 
need to build it line-by-line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if there is a statement, you should 
have directed me to the statement, not to the article.  
[laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, there is a reason for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am must be patient. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a reason for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay alright.  Okay let us 
go step-by-step. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 27 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I was just too curious for my own 
purposes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Dr Ngubane, you would recall what 
you are dealing with in these paragraphs of the affidavit? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it was questions in relation to 
this, Mr Howa and Mr Salim Essa’s email and the statement 
there attached. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And this is the only statement we 
have and you could tell the Chairperson whether was this 
statement ever published or was it simple read because you 
do say.  You say: 
“I issued a press statement on my appointment as 
acting chairperson.  In it, I also thanked Mr Tsotsi 
for his service to Eskom.  I did not personally 
prepare that statement.  It was given to me by the 
Company Secretary, Mr Phukubje.” 
20 
 
And then you go on to explain: 
“Well, I did not have a meeting or conversation with 
Mr Essa regarding Mr Tsotsi’s resignation..” 
 
Because that is what they are dealing with there.  So 
could you explain to the Chairperson whether was this an 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 28 of 289 
 
issued statement or simply a read-out statement?  It is in... it 
is unclear to me. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson in my last appearance 
here, there was a shorter statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought I had seen it too. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, there was a shorter statement which 
was shown and that is the statement that I used, not this 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I thought I had seen it too. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I thought I had noticed or somebody 
had said that it is shorter ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...than the one that was sent.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We can go into it, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we both mistaken, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we can go into it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That page reference I gave to the 
20 
Chairperson, Dr Ngubane which is page 77.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] [microphone not switched on] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That looks like an article. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 29 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   764.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You need to assist Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have got it, Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   Eskom ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   “Eskom Board and chairperson agreed to 
part ways.” 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Dr Ngubane, this is exactly what 
the Chairperson was pointing out.  This is not a statement.  I 
know in your appearance previously you referred to this as 
the statement you issued when the Chairperson asked you 
that question. 
DR NGUBANE:   This short one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But in fact, it is not a statement.  It is a 
report by a media person, talking about what you and Mr 
Tsotsi addressed the people to be saying.  Let us read it.  It 
says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It says dated 30 March. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 30 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   30 March 2015.  It says: 
“Tuesday, 30 March 2015.  After much deliberation, 
the Eskom Board today accepted...” 
 
Now that is a significant indication of the difference 
between the two statements.  It does not say yesterday.  It 
says today.  And you finished nearly, as you say, nearly 
about twelve o’clock.   
“The Eskom Board today accepted the presentation 
made by the Chairperson, Mr Zola Tsotsi.   
The board and the chairperson, thereafter, held a 
10 
constructive 
discussion 
about 
charting 
a 
way 
forward for the power utility.   
Following this discussion, Mr Tsotsi agreed to step 
down as a director and chairperson of the board.  
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Tsotsi indicated that 
the board had unity of purpose and that his decision 
to step down was in the interest of the company and 
the country and was done in order to allow the board 
to focus on the core issues facing Eskom.   
This step, the board believes, will ensure that 
20 
Eskom can focus on the challenges facing it and 
sets the company on a new path to regain the 
confidence...” 
 
And so on.  Let us read the next... the last paragraph.  It 
says: 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 31 of 289 
 
“...speaking on behalf of the board...” 
 
So somebody is reporting ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...about what you and Mr Tsotsi are 
saying.  Now it is you speaking on behalf of the board.   
“Dr Ngubane thanked Mr Tsotsi for the selfless 
decision he has taken been placing the interest of 
the company and the nation first.   
Dr Ngubane also thanked Mr Tsotsi for his valuable 
service to Eskom over the years and wished him 
10 
well in his future endeavours.” 
 
So you see the differences?  It is a media reporting, 
reporting here as opposed to you giving a speech. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe it is something that appeared 
or that was intended for an internal publication at Eskom.  I 
do not know.  It might not be an article in the newspaper.   
 
Maybe it could be an internal magazine within Eskom.  
Whoever is writing, is maybe writing for that kind of 
publication to tell everybody, you know, current news or 
20 
important news.  That is how it comes across to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson, the session with the 
evidence leader and the Commission investigators.  During 
the break, I asked Mr Kopatha(?) to please scan the media 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 32 of 289 
 
and find out exactly what statement I released.   
 
When we met again, they said there was none.  That is 
why at the last meeting, I said I thought this matter was off 
the table.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because they have said there was none. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I never received the statement from 
Mr Howa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   So I am not sure if it was sent to someone 
in Communications or... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But let us just get to finality 
about whether there is another... there is as media statement 
in the bundles that we have got here because I also was 
under the impression that last time we did... our attention 
was drawn to a statement that was shorter. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was said to have been issued by you 
and it was said that... I think you said you did not issue this 
20 
long statement that had been sent. 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So now, both Dr Ngubane and I seem to 
remember that part of last... his last appearance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I ...[intervenes]  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 33 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have the same recollection or are 
you saying that which what we were talking about, what we 
saw was this and not something else? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  So we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your recollection Chairperson is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That there was reference to two 
statements and Dr Ngubane said he accepts this shorter one 
to be his statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is the only shorter statement.  
So there is not another statement.  You have the long one 
which see you attached to the email of Mr Howa and Salim 
Essa.   
 
And then, Chairperson specifically asked:  Oh, but you 
accept this one?  Which is on page... the shorter one.  Dr 
Ngubane then said yes.  As though to convey that that is his 
statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So those are the only two, to answer 
your questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So your recollection is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 34 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the clarification is only in respect of 
which one is the shorter statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it this one or is there another one? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is the only one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, what is your recollection Dr 
Ngubane?  Is your recollection that there was a statement 
that... a media statement that you issued and it was not this 
article we are looking at here?  Or is that you have no 
10 
recollection whether you did issue a media statement on this 
occasion? 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, when I go before the media 
for official purposes, there is always a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you bring with you? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  There would... it was important, you 
know, event, the resignation of the chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   It is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the media had to be told. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct.  But not this, no.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not the one that appears at 764.5? 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And you also accept that when last 
time you appeared here, what we saw was this one that we 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 35 of 289 
 
thought was the media statement? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  But you said something 
earlier on.  Was it to the effect that you previously asked 
some people to look for the media statement that you issued 
and they said they did not find, they could not find it? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ms Seko(?) and I think Mr Riley, we talked 
about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Are those people from the 
Commission or...? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Those are the... Dr Ngubane is referring 
to investigators ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...in the Eskom, were extreme Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I will have to deal with that aspect 
and... but maybe to do so, I need to canvass the point with 
my learned friend for Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that fine? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I give it to you to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to deal with it in a way you see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 36 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  It ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want us to be on the same page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to where we are. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because there is correspondence which 
may have to be brought to your attention in regard to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I noted that in your statement... 
Dr Ngubane did say that you normally did not prepare these 
statements yourself.  They would be prepared by, I think, 
Communications.  You need in Eskom and so on.  Is that 
right? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I assume that attempts were 
made to talk to that unit to see whether they could find 
20 
anything.  So.  But I am sure at the right time I will be told. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Chairperson, can I give you a hint? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you look at the affidavit of Dr 
Ngubane, that page 22, paragraph 5.9.  Dr Ngubane says to 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 37 of 289 
 
the Commission: 
“On 31 March 2015, I issued a press statement.” 
 
I issued it. 
“On my appointment...  (and so on).  I also thanked 
Mr Tsotsi for his services.  I did not personally 
prepare the statement.” 
 
Now that gives you the impression that Dr Ngubane is 
aware of the statement he is talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He did not prepare the statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “It was provided to me by the Company 
Secretary, Mr Phukubje.”  Mr Phukubje was the Company 
Secretary at the time.  And then he goes on to say in 5.11: 
“I did not have a meeting or conversation with 
Mr Salim Essa...” 
 
So Dr Ngubane is answering certain questions there 
Chairperson and that is why I want to canvass ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Dr Ngubane’s attorney so that we can 
20 
overcome this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  And I take it that all 
concerned in regard... in this regard have been interviewed 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 38 of 289 
 
or if not, they have been interviewed including the company 
secretary what he knows and so on and so on.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So Dr Ngubane, you will 
recall that the issue regarding the removal of Mr Tsotsi, it 
comes, at least formally, for the first time in the boarding 
meeting of 19 March 2015.   
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you were present in that meeting.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you were present in that meeting.  
You remember that? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the 19t h of March... actually, may I 
enquire whether the attorney for Mr Ngubane has been 
provided with the Reference Bundle? 
COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Yes, because the minutes 
20 
are in that Reference Bundle Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the page number? 
COUNSEL:   Excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   I think I have responded rather prematurely.  He 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 39 of 289 
 
understood that the bundle that miss ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
COUNSEL:   ...was speaking to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Or may I just clarify that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you do not have? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have the one called Reference 
Bundle? 
COUNSEL:   I have only one bundle that ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
COUNSEL:   ...we have been running with presently.  I am 
not sure there is another... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair we can use the minutes as 
they appear in Dr Ngubane’s bundle as well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That should resolve that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we do not need to go the Reference 
Bundle? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We do not need to go to the Reference 
Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So the minutes in Dr Ngubane’s 
bundle, the one of the 19 t h of March are on page 297.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 40 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   What paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   297... okay ja, the minutes already Dr 
Ngubane, yes.  I will go the paragraphs.  So the members 
present are there.  So you are the second on the list of those 
present.  Mr Zola Tsotsi at the time is still the chairman.  
Then go please to page 299.  299.  Turn the page, Dr 
Ngubane.   
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So after the paragraph:  Resolve 
that.  There is the bolded part where Mr Romeo Khumalo 
10 
joins the meeting.  You see the middle of the page? 
DR NGUBANE:   Resolutions.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, do you see when Mr Khumalo joins 
the meeting? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just above ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just above Resolutions by the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Resolution by the Board.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then there is a break and resumed 
20 
at twenty to twelve, before midnight.   
“The chairman was excused from the meeting.  Dr 
Ngubane was elected to chair the meeting.” 
 
And then followed deliberations about Mr Tsotsi and the 
board’s intention to bring charges against him.  You will 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 41 of 289 
 
recall?  I do not want to read it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, at the bottom of it, you will see it 
was agreed that: 
“- 
Supporting documents or should put to... 
should be put together to indicate failure to get a 
board approval.   
- 
Matters considered as aggravating actions of 
10 
the chairman.   
- 
Preparing and distributing media statement in 
the name of the board without board approval. 
The 
board 
resolved 
that 
Mr 
Khumalo 
is 
the 
delegated media person in the ARC, which is Audit 
and Risk Committee and Dr Ngubane is appointed 
as acting chairman of the board.   
The board must be prepared to take risk of whatever 
the minister might decide.” 
 
And then the chairman came back to the meeting at 
20 
twenty-three minutes to one.  This is after midnight. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This board was working out.  [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This board was hard at working Dr 
Ngubane.  [laughing] 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 42 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   [laughing] Well, these were monumental 
events Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what we have found Dr Ngubane.  It 
is a remarkable pattern in regard to the issues pertaining to 
Mr Tsotsi and the board’s resolution.  There is another email 
on the 19t h of May.  19 March.  I beg your pardon.  2015.   
 
And this email, it is also exchanged between Mr Howa 
and Mr Salim Essa.  Also talking about the board’s 
acceptance of the resignation of Mr Tsotsi.  You are aware of 
10 
that? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, not that email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it was again a statement... 
Chairperson, this one I have to go to the Reference Bundle.  
So I will have to provide my learned friend with the 
Reference Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Thank you, Chair. 
DR NGUBANE:   Is it in my bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in... I think you... Dr Ngubane will 
have the Reference Bundle.  It is not in your bundle.  It is 
20 
page 434.  434 in the Reference Bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you told us what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, page 434.   
CHAIRPERSON:   434? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   434.  The black pagination.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 43 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you are still on the point that is 
connected with the minutes on the 19t h? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because... so what I am saying to 
Dr Ngubane.  We kind of see the same pattern in regard to 
the resignation of Mr Tsotsi.   
 
Mr Howa and Mr Salim Essa exchange a draft statement 
that details the events within Eskom in anticipation or as 
though... wait.  Either in anticipation of Mr Tsotsi’ resignation 
10 
or after the month of his resignation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   This time it might be in anticipation 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   In anticipation.  Chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like it.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is the one.  You see Dr Ngubane?  
So the email on page 434, it is from Nazeem Howa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 434 on the... on Eskom Bundle 13 
which is the Reference Bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must keep on saying bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom Bundle 13 because that is the 
official one, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am indebted to you, Chair. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 44 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there is an email on page 434 in that 
bundle.  It appears to be... to have been from Nazeem Howa 
at nazeemh@tmamedia.co.za. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was sent on Thursday, 19 March 2015 at 
19:46 addressed to Mr Salim Essa and the subject is:  
Statement from New Board.  And attachments, Statement 
from New Board docs or docx docs. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says: 
“Sirs, a first draft.  Let me have your thoughts and I 
will work to polish further.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then... you see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that email? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, but I am trying to see how it differs 
from the previous one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 45 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Are you looking at the statement 
itself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, actually.  When you say the previous 
one, you mean the previous one that we have dealt with 
because in terms of time ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...this one comes first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  The other one comes later.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, I think the one we saw in 
regard to the 31 s t of March, relating to the departure of 
Mr Tsotsi from Eskom, if I am not mistaken and it seems to 
be a final. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems to be attaching a final statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whereas, this one says it is a first draft.  
The statement that seems to have been attached, it was 
meant as a first draft and not a final draft. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because Mr Howa seems to say:  Let me 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 46 of 289 
 
have your thoughts and I will work to polish further.  He says 
sirs but he addressed it to one person.  So, ja.  Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, ja you are busy 
reading the statement itself? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Is there anything that you want to 
tell the Chairperson about it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know whether maybe before 
10 
you ask that questions, we need to note the main features of 
the statement that was addressed ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the statement, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us rather do that.  So 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me place it on record, sir.  Dr 
Ngubane, so the statement itself is on page 435.  It says 
state... the heading is:   
“Statement from New Board represented by its 
chairperson on behalf of the board.   
20 
It is now a week since we took the decisive step to 
ask four of our most senior executives to step down 
from their day-today roles to allow the board to 
appoint independent minds to assist us to develop a 
plan to ensure that Eskom is able to deliver a 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 47 of 289 
 
sustainable, secure and efficient supply to its 
consumers.” 
 
So this person writing, knows about the executives.  The 
next paragraph it says: 
“Yesterday at a meeting of the board it was decided 
to release Mr Zola Tsotsi of the chairpersonship due 
to growing lack of confidence in his leadership and 
increasing discomfort particularly around the grain of 
his role as a non-executive the tension it was 
causing within the business.” 
10 
So then again …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would allow you to read further, you 
know? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the other one I stopped you but I will 
allow read a little further. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  But then, again, Dr 
Ngubane, this person knows with remarkable precision the 
details within the board: 
“The board once again reaffirmed its approach 
20 
around the investigation and the request for key 
individuals to stand down and it is convinced on the 
basis of information they have gathered so far.  But 
this approach is the only way forward to provide a 
long term strategy to resolve the current issues at 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 48 of 289 
 
Eskom.  None of these decisions were taken lightly,  
Rather in the spirit of the meeting our obligations 
as the board responsible for a utility which needs to 
support 
our 
economic 
growth 
and 
the 
overall 
wellbeing of our nation.  The board spent several 
hours yesterday to address...” 
And that is also remarkable, Dr Ngubane, is it not, the use 
of the words several hours yesterday. 
“...to address the process around the investigation 
and to finalise the key areas of work to be delivered 
10 
as a matter of urgency by the team we appoint.” 
I could go on but I am interrupted by that thought and the 
question which I need to ask you, Dr Ngubane, is that this 
person is not drafting a media report so I am informed by 
Mr so and so that this is what the board has done. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Like we see in regard to the shorter 
one where he says: 
“Dr Ngubane said..” 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “Mr Tsotsi said…”  This person is 
writing a statement for the Chairperson who would read it, 
the Chairperson of the board.  Is this not remarkable?  
Where would this person get all this information from to 
enable him to prepare such a detailed statement?  What 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 49 of 289 
 
can you tell the Chairperson?  Is it not remarkable to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry, Mr Seleka, I am going 
to be inconsistent.  I think read the whole statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I read the whole statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, read the whole statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least this one is one and a half or two 
pages. That other one was like four pages.  I think read the 
whole statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Should he not come in first, 
10 
Chair, before …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should Dr Ngubane come in before I 
move on? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Dr Ngubane, you can read it, it 
might refresh your memory as well, if you want to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let – I will read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you happy to read it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read it, Chair, let me carry on. 
Yes: 
20 
“As 
a 
board 
we 
spent 
the 
time 
since 
our 
appointment to assess the business and to get 
some …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are now starting somewhere in the 
middle.  Maybe just start from the beginning so that even 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 50 of 289 
 
in the transcript here is a place where one finds the 
complete statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
DR NGUBANE:   I have read quite a bit of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have read quite a bit, ja.  Okay, no 
that is fine.  But I think I just want it to be in the transcript 
because it might – this statement and the one of the 31 s t 
might prove to be quite important. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the statement reads, I am starting 
at the beginning again: 
“Statement from new board represented by its 
Chairperson on behalf of the board.  It is now a 
week, a week since we took the decisive step to ask  
four of our most senior executives to step down 
from their day-to-day roles to allow the board to 
appoint independent minds to assist us to develop a 
20 
plan to ensure that Eskom is able to deliver a 
sustainable, secure and efficient supply to its 
consumers.  Yesterday at a meeting of the board it 
was decided to relieve Mr Zola Tsotsi of the 
Chairpersonship 
due 
to 
a 
growing 
lack 
of 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 51 of 289 
 
confidence 
in 
his 
leadership 
and 
increasing 
discomfort particularly around the growing of his 
role as a nonexecutive chair and the confusion it 
was causing within the business.  The board once 
again …[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, yes? 
DR NGUBANE:   This email is 19 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Tsotsi had not been removed as 
10 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is one of the remarkable things. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, that is the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, the email, if it is true 
that this statement was attached to the email, the email is 
sent and a statement has been prepared before Mr Tsotsi 
is removed. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is already talking about him having 
been removed so it is one of the remarkable things.  I think 
20 
he will be asking for your comments on that. 
DR NGUBANE:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is exactly the point.  Where 
do I start again?  Should I carry on?  The second 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 52 of 289 
 
paragraph …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I said start at the beginning.  
Okay, I will not disturb you now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it was not you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where were you reading? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just continue where you were 
when you… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second paragraph says: 
“Yesterday at a meeting of the board it was decided 
to relieve Mr Zola Tsotsi of the Chairpersonship due 
to a growing lack of confidence in his leadership 
and increasing discomfort particularly around the 
growing of his role as a nonexecutive chair and the 
confusion it was causing within the business.  The 
board once again reaffirmed its approach around 
the investigation and the request for key individuals 
to stand down and is convinced on the basis of 
20 
information they have gathered so far that this 
approach is the only way forward to provide a long 
term strategy to resolve the current issues at 
Eskom.  None of these decisions were taken lightly, 
rather, in the spirit of meeting our obligations as 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 53 of 289 
 
the board responsible for a utility which needs to 
support 
our 
economic 
growth 
and 
the 
overall 
wellbeing of our nation.  The board spent several 
hours yesterday to address the process around the 
investigation and to finalise the key areas of work 
to be delivered as a matter of urgency by the team 
we appoint.  As a board we have spent the time 
since our appointment to assist the business and to 
get some understanding of some of the key issues 
facing Eskom.  We were saddened by the decision 
10 
of S & P to downgrade Eskom.  While we believe 
their decision is based on a failure to understand 
the 
current 
conditions 
at 
Eskom 
and 
our 
comprehensive plan to ensure a stable and reliable 
supply 
the 
board 
will 
use 
this 
opportunity 
to 
redouble our efforts to meet the challenges faced 
by Eskom.  The board once again confirmed the key 
challenges impacting on Eskom and its ability to 
provide 
a 
sustainable 
secure 
and 
efficient 
electricity supply.  These are, as constraints at the 
20 
utility, an overburdened energy system leading to 
unprecedented load shedding; an aging fleet and a 
seriously flawed maintenance programme rapidly 
increasing price of electricity, delays and cost 
overruns of the new-build programme; overpaying 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 54 of 289 
 
for major procurement items and consumables.  It 
was against this backdrop that we took the step to 
launch the inquiry so that we, as a board, are able 
to understand what has caused this sad state of 
affairs and to develop strategies to begin to remedy 
the situation.  As part of this process it is planned 
to benchmark costs and structures required to run 
Eskom efficiently.  It is our express desire that the 
investigation 
determines 
whether 
the 
current 
situation was exacerbated by incompetence, ill- 
10 
informed 
decision-making, 
mismanagement 
or 
untoward actions.  We will also look into the current 
operating policies and processes and the business 
structure to understand how we can introduce 
further efficiencies and best practices to get Eskom 
to be the utility we all wish it to be.  Our aim of this 
element of the investigation is to secure the supply 
of our primary energy inputs so we can align our 
outputs to the demands of our economy.  We will 
use this investigation to: 
20 
To plan …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think read 1, 2, 3s as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes.  Thank you, Chair. 
 
“We will use this investigation to: 
1. To plan and correlate a holistic fleet management 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 55 of 289 
 
programme to ensure operation efficiency of our 
current fleet. 
2. To review and analyse our new-build programme 
to ensure energy is generated soonest.  This will 
include 
all 
contracts 
and 
performance 
agreements. 
3. Introduce checks and balances to mitigate any 
fraud and manipulation within our operations. 
4. Analyse and restructure of our balance sheet  
and all our incumbent debt instruments. 
10 
5. Realign key performance indicators for senior 
leadership to ensure better performance aligned 
to the board’s current strategy. 
6. Introduce 
an 
effective 
demand 
site 
solution 
aimed at reducing the need for load shedding. 
7. Review current noncore assets and look to sale 
and lease options to fund further requirements at 
the utility.” 
New paragraph: 
“The board spent many hours yesterday reviewing 
20 
our strategy so far and confirming the way ahead.  
We 
know 
that 
there 
is 
no 
alternative 
but 
to 
implement several radical solutions and we call on 
all South Africans to assist us in dealing with the 
challenges at Eskom.  The board has adopted the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 56 of 289 
 
position that it will not tolerate incompetence, 
tardiness, any dereliction of duty from any member 
of the Eskom team.  Our priority is to deliver an 
efficient and reliable service to our consumers and 
we will expect each of our executives to step up to 
plate to deliver on this commitment.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the end of the statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is the end of the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think we should take the tea 
adjournment and when we come back then we can deal 
10 
with it.  Okay, we adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like you might be too far from 
the mic that seems to work, Dr Ngubane.  I wonder whether 
there is a way of moving out of the way some of the files 
that he might not be needing immediately?  I see you do 
not have a lot of space in front of you, Dr Ngubane and 
then they can be brought back as and when they are 
20 
needed. 
DR NGUBANE:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the one that we are at is the one 
with the statement that was read just before the break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson.  We are still in – 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 57 of 289 
 
that is the reference bundle, Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry?  I think we took away the wrong 
one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The reference bundle was open. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we have read through up until 
page 436 which is the last page of the statement.  Do you 
see that, Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And yes, my question was with such 
10 
remarkable detail about the fact relative to Eskom and the 
board decisions it is astounding that this person would 
have known this information from nowhere. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it does sound like that because 
these events predate when actually it happened.  So I 
mean there were documents I presume that the consultant 
had drawn up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Linnell? 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Linnell.  I do not have those 
documents but he said he had drawn up documents so I am 
20 
not sure about the originals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja and these ones are specifically 
drafted for the Chairperson in regard to the removal of Mr 
Tsotsi so they could not have been drafted for Mr Tsotsi 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 58 of 289 
 
otherwise it will not make – it will be double irrational that 
Mr Tsotsi would cooperate and act in concert with these 
people to have a statement like this drafted about him. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, the charges against Mr Tsotsi were 
drafted by the audit and risk committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But I do not think [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was before?  The meeting of the 
19 t h , when it took place, the charges had not been drafted 
10 
yet or had they been? 
DR NGUBANE:   I think the charges were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, they were already there. 
DR NGUBANE:   But they are not this what is written here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, yes, yes.  And – yes.  Well, I 
think the first point is the one that Mr Seleka raises which 
you have recognised.  This is somebody who seems to 
prepare prior to the meeting of the board a statement that 
is intended to be issued after the meeting and that is 
intended to reflect what the meeting would have decided by 
20 
the time it is issued. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the first thing, in the second 
paragraph he says: 
“Yesterday at a meeting of the board it was decided 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 59 of 289 
 
to relieve Mr Zola Tsotsi of the Chairpersonship due 
to a growing lack of confidence in his leadership...” 
Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now we do know that when the meeting 
did happen, that did happen, is that correct? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if that is correct as well as maybe 
other points that in the statement, it seems that the person 
or persons drafting the statement were either told by 
10 
somebody what the board was going to decide before it 
decided, before it even met or this person or the persons 
who were working on the statement were the ones making 
decisions that they believed the board would make or 
would 
go 
along 
with. 
 
Would 
you 
agree 
with 
that 
reasoning? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chairperson, I do.  However, it is 
just that I do not have the charge sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka should be able to assist. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because that probably would throw light 
20 
on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka, do you want to help Dr 
Ngubane and tell him where the charge sheet seems to be 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly, Chair. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 60 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that he can make his point with the 
advantage of seeing the charge sheet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Dr Ngubane, we have the 
charges listed in the minute of 30 March 2015.  We do not 
have the charge sheet itself but the minutes are on page – 
we have the next – page 301 in Dr Ngubane’s bundle, 
Chair.  They follow after the minutes of the 19 March, 301 
and the charges are listed on page 303. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will that assist you Dr Ngubane, just 
seeing what the charges were? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Page 1: 
“Director 
procure 
the 
services 
of 
an 
external 
consultant Mr Nick Linnell, a consultant to provide 
consulting 
services 
to 
the 
company 
without 
following the company’s prescribed procurement 
processes or informing the board of his actions.  In 
doing so, the director crossed the line from being a 
nonexecutive director to exercising executive power 
without the requisite authority.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understood you to want to see the 
charges in order to make a certain point in response to my 
questions. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If this does assist you that is fine. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 61 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, it does not seem that this document or 
letter was translated into the charge sheet.  That is what I 
was trying to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you talk about the letter? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, the email …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, oh, the statement? 
DR NGUBANE:   That we have been reading, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement. 
DR NGUBANE:   It does not seem that it translated into the 
charges. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  I do not think it talks about 
the charges.  It does not talk about charges but it does say 
Mr 
Zola 
Tsotsi 
was 
removed 
from 
his 
position 
as 
Chairperson because of dissatisfaction with leadership, 
blah, blah, blah, blah.  It does say that but as I recall, it 
does not say anything about charges. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I was coming to the point, 
Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   …that this email seems to have no effect 
20 
in terms of what actually happened in [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the charges. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, no, no, no.  No, it certainly 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 62 of 289 
 
does not refer to charges as far as I recall.  But the – you 
said you accept the reasoning that when you look at that 
statement prepared by Mr Howa it reflects either somebody 
who had been told what was going to happen at the 
meeting of the board or somebody who knew – who had 
made a decision together with whoever he made certain 
decisions that he expected the board to go along with.  
That part you accept. 
DR NGUBANE:   I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That seems to be the case, one of the 
10 
two. 
DR NGUBANE:   I agree, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now obviously that raises a concern, 
you know, to say if somebody told Mr Howa and Mr Salim 
Essa, whoever, in advance of the meeting of the board 
what the board was going to decide, who was that and how 
did he know or how did she know that the board would 
make those decisions?  Of course we know what happens 
in any organisation, sometimes you can have a situation 
where prior to a meeting a committee – members of a 
20 
particular committee or organisation lobby one another on 
matters that are going to be discussed and so that by the 
time the meeting takes place, whoever wants a certain 
decision to be taken knows that when I propose this route I 
will have support. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 63 of 289 
 
 
So it is possible that somebody who may have 
wanted the board to make certain decisions including the 
decision to remove Mr Tsotsi as Chairperson might have 
gone around and canvassed enough support and having 
canvassed enough support among board members felt 
confident that he or she could tell Mr Howa or whoever that 
this is what the board will decide and maybe that is where 
Mr Howa got the information from before the meeting took 
place.  But that would be very concerning. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be very concerning if 
somebody within the board or from within Eskom and I 
guess it can only be somebody within the board because 
somebody who is not part of the board, how is he going to 
know what the board will decide?  Maybe it is possible, I 
am not sure, but it would be very concerning, you know, 
that somebody goes and tells people who are outside of 
Eskom who are not in even in government about decisions 
that are likely to be taken by the board and why would they 
be telling them that, what must they do with the knowledge, 
20 
you know?   
 
Of course, it is even more worrying if the position is 
that Mr Howa and Mr Salim Essa and whoever else were 
making decisions outside of Eskom that they wanted the 
board to take and they had an expectation that the board 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 64 of 289 
 
would take those decisions because it would then mean 
that the board is not acting independently, it is now being 
manipulated by people from outside of the board of itself.  
You understand my thinking?   
DR NGUBANE:   I do, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes and you would have the 
same concern I would imagine? 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  You have no idea how this 
could have happened? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Except to say that at Eskom very strange 
things happen, you know, but the distance between 19 and 
30 March is too wide a gap for this – for someone to have 
known.  You know, that is what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  Mr Seleka, do you 
want to pursue anything? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  But the point is 
this, Dr Ngubane.  On the 19 t h the board is making the 
20 
decision. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    In regard to Mr Tsotsi.  So what we 
see here, it is a media statement drafted in anticipation of 
that decision succeeding on the 19 t h.  It comes before the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 65 of 289 
 
meeting, from a time point of view it precedes the meeting 
of the 19 t h where the board resolves to have these 
disciplinary charges against Mr Tsotsi and that is the point 
I think the Chairperson trying to – to bring it to your 
attention. 
DR NGUBANE:   But this is why, Chairperson, I was 
pointing to the lack of congruence between the email and 
the charges because if the charged were informed by this 
email, then there will be real congruence, you know?  That 
is what my concern is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand what you are saying.  
The difference, however, I think is that if this media 
statement was talking about the ultimate removal of Mr 
Tsotsi as a director but without talking about the charges 
that would be brought against him which led to his 
resignation, I would understand your point but this email 
does not, as I understand it, talk – this media statement 
does not say that Mr Tsotsi is going to be removed as a 
director.  As I understand, it seemly talks about him being 
removed as Chairperson.  You understand? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it reflects that the person drafting it 
knew before even the meeting started that the board would 
take the decision to remove Mr Tsotsi as Chairperson, it 
says nothing about him being removed as a director which 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 66 of 289 
 
happened – which came after the charges.  You understand 
that? 
DR NGUBANE:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And, Dr Ngubane, 
many things are running in my head but one remarkable 
difference between the two statements is this.  In the first 
one, you are not identified as the Chairperson on the 19 
March because Mr Tsotsi is still the Chairperson and I 
assume the drafter of the document does not know who is 
10 
going to be Chairperson but on the 19 March, in your 
meeting, we read that resolution where Dr Ngubane is 
appointed as the acting Chairman of the board.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 19 March.  The statement now 
drafted on the 31 March indicates you explicitly as the 
Chairperson of the board.  Now how would they have 
known that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I do not get the correlation because 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think – remember, Mr Seleka, that the 
one relating to the 19 t h, that is the one that precedes the 
meeting of the board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one on the 31 s t comes after the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 67 of 289 
 
board meeting.  So whoever it is who would have told the 
person who prepared that one, that media statement, would 
have told them about even holding you Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was – well, I do not know whether 
…[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   No, that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just thinking from Dr Ngubane 
being elected Chairperson but now I am thinking being 
made acting Chairperson might another decision made by 
10 
somebody else at a certain time but I thought I would just 
mention that with regard to the media statement of the 
19 t h, that one precedes the meeting of the board at which 
decisions that it talks about are to be taken.  So the author 
knows the decisions in advance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one – the media statement of 31 
March happens after the board meeting when decisions 
have been taken, nevertheless quite early, about 7.45 or 
something. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   7.46. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Quite early, so it is quite interesting but 
one cannot say there was not enough time for somebody 
who wanted to tell that person what the board had decided 
to say this is what was decided.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 68 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you may be having a certain point.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Feel free to pursue it, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  May I just add to the 
Chairperson’s point because, you see, when the document 
is exchanged, it is already drafted.  So when it is  
exchanged at 7.46, seven hours forty six minutes, the 
person is not busy drafting this statement, he has already 
drafted the statement, he is emailing the statement at that 
10 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
as 
long 
– 
he 
has 
had 
the 
conversation …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Beforehand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The report back from somebody, has 
drafted.  This person must have woken up quite early. 
DR NGUBANE:   Or was at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By extension, Chairperson, he was at 
the meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So, Dr Ngubane, the minutes of 
19, while the Chairperson is still mulling over this, that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 69 of 289 
 
minute on that page.  I refer you to page 299.  I think what 
the board deliberates on is significant, page 299, where 
the Chairperson is excused – let me wait for you to get 
there. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   299, after the Chairperson is excused, 
it says: 
“The view as that  the boards need to make a call 
about the actions of the board and the Chairman.  
The Chairman was an ordinary member of the board 
10 
and given the severity of the matter and what 
happened to the company due to the downgrade...” 
Now that downgrade is referred to also in this last  
statement. 
“…that 
the 
downgrade 
occurred 
purely 
on 
governance and this was a reflection on the board.   
“Members felt that the decision of 11 March 2015 to 
institute an inquiry was correct given what the 
company was going through.  The matter should 
now stay fully nonexecutive and that is how it must 
20 
be done.  The board cannot go back on decisions 
which have been made but the one thing the board 
had control over was the independence of the 
inquiry.” 
Sounds 
like 
double 
talk, 
you 
know, 
because 
the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 70 of 289 
 
downgrade, because of there are governance issues, this 
is reflection on the board.  
“The decisions we took about the suspensions are 
correct...”: 
But we can go back to those decisions.  We blame 
ourselves that - you know, we also think what we did was a 
correct decision.  You see there?  You see that Dr 
Ngubane? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, can I start with this question?  I 
see Dr Ngubane, that you signed those minutes on the 18 
10 
November 2016, that is more than… 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …a year and a half later. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now what did you rely on to help you 
ensure that the minutes were reasonably accurate in terms 
of what was discussed? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson, there was a whole lot 
of minutes that were signed post  facto, it was the 
inefficiency of the secretariat because they should have 
20 
presented this to the Chairperson at the time, Mr Tsotsi.  
Now comes the company secretary and says in order these 
records to be in the file they need to be signed.  So the 
reliance was on the audios, that the audios capture the 
minutes.  If there are contradictions of conflicts we can 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 71 of 289 
 
always go back to the audios but I realise now that even 
the audios, you cannot rely on them.  
 
For instance, the meeting of the 11 t h, after the 
meeting with the Minister, I have listened to the audio, it 
skips a whole lot of the meeting and starts somewhere in 
the meeting.  So now I am saying actually although one 
thought one could rely on the audio, I do not think we can 
because of what I have heard regarding the minutes of the 
11 t h.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of the minutes that you 
10 
signed, did you rely on somebody such as the company 
secretary saying I have listened to the audio, these 
minutes reflect what  is in the audio or did you yourself 
listen to the audio before signing to say they are correct? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I relied on the company secretary.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You relied on the company secretary.  
Okay, alright.  It is just that for example where it says on 
299 the view was that the board needed to make a call 
about the actions, it seems a very strange way of starting 
after the break, you know? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would expect that the minutes would 
tell you what is the issue first that is being discussed and 
then what were the main points raised, where it says: 
“The view was that the board needed to make a 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 72 of 289 
 
call..” 
Does not say where that view came from about the actions 
of the board and the Chairman, we do not know what 
actions.  So when you read there – of course, maybe when 
we go down we will get to see some of them but anyway, 
that is fine. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson, we – at least I knew 
what the actions were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You knew what…[laughs]  It is just  that 
not everybody who reads the minutes would have the 
10 
benefit of you being around.  Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Well, quickly on the 
recording, Dr Ngubane, because it is one thing what is 
recorded, is another thing that was not recorded.  So 
insofar as something was recorded we can rely on it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  We do not know who would have 
paused the recording when some critical issues are 
discussed because they did not want them to be on record. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then press the play button or the 
recording button as the meeting went on further. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, this is why, Chairperson, I say I 
always thought one could rely on the audio recordings of 
minutes but now I have been proven wrong. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 73 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we can rely on the recorded part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know but whenever in a meeting 
that 
is 
being 
mechanically 
recorded 
– 
normally, 
the 
recording will not be stopped without the Chairperson 
knowing.  If somebody wants the recording to be stopped 
they 
would 
say 
please 
stop 
the 
recording 
and 
the 
Chairperson would know and the Chairperson can say no, 
no, no, no, why?   You know?  Or, otherwise, the 
Chairperson could say please stop the recording, we will 
tell you when to resume. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Except, Chairperson, if the Chairperson 
himself or herself wants it stopped, he could do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is true, that is true. 
DR NGUBANE:   Or alternatively get a technician to erase 
afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We won’t know, so let me just carry on 
to the end of this minutes Dr Ngubane, the board cannot go 
back on decisions which have been made but the one thing 
the board had control over was the independence of 
20 
inquiry, it was therefore very important how the process 
going forward was managed by the board, at the end of the 
process the board either goes down with the process or 
survives the process. 
 
What would you say happened, did you go down or 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 74 of 289 
 
did you survive? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well we went down.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You went down, thank you Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe Mr Tsotsi went down first, 
you followed much later.   Of course Mr Baloyi went down 
too.   But Dr Ngubane let us come back to this issue.  This 
is the meeting where the Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi, is asked 
to leave the meeting, and then when you look at the 
minutes, the minutes already then say that he is an 
ordinary member of the board that is in the same page 299 
10 
if I understand it correctly.  Is my understanding the same 
as yours?   
DR NGUBANE:   That was a proposal Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was a proposal?  
DR NGUBANE:   That we – he is only removed as 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he remains as a member.  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay but the actual removal of him 
as Chairperson happened in that meeting.  
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well it is somehow I presume with a long 
discussion the board unit must resolve that it has lost 
confidence in the Chairman as a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see at the bottom of page 299 
it says: 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 75 of 289 
 
“The board unanimously resolves that it has lost 
confidence in the Chairman as a director of the 
board and recommended his removal as a director.” 
So at this stage it is dealing with him being a director.  So 
I think earlier on in the previous paragraph they talk about 
him being removed as Chairperson.  Am I right?      
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in this meeting he was removed as 
Chairperson and then the board said that it has lost 
confidence in him even as an ordinary director.      
10 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it was agreed it says: 
“That supporting documents should be put together 
to indicate failure to get board approval matters 
considered as aggravating actions of the Chairman, 
preparing and distributing a media statement in the 
name of the board without board approval.” 
So I guess that is what ended up being the charges against 
him.  Is that right?        
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so effectively in this meeting of the 
19 t h the board asked Mt Tsotsi to excuse, to leave the 
meeting and then it removes him as Chairperson of the 
board and it expresses lack of confidence in him as a 
director and recommends that he be removed as a director 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 76 of 289 
 
and the say in effect charges must be prepared against 
him.  Why was he removed as Chairperson because when I 
read these minutes here it is not very clear to me what the 
minutes say he had done wrong as Chairperson?          
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson that comes out in the 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   But I can say Mt Tsotsi’s handling of the 
board turned the board against him.  I think that was the 
general feeling that was permeating all the board members 
10 
thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we know that one of the charges Mr 
Seleka directed us to where we find the minutes which has 
got the charges.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 303 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   303? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first charge was that he procured 
the services of an external consultant Mr Nick Linnell: 
“The consultant to provide consultant services to 
20 
the 
company 
without 
following 
the 
companies 
prescribed procurement processes or informing the 
board of his actions.  In doing so the director 
crossed the line from being a non-executive director 
to exercising power without the requisite authority.” 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 77 of 289 
 
“Charge 2, the consultant commenced with his work 
to the knowledge of the director and without the 
board being informed that work had commenced 
within the company, the director was aware that no 
contract of engagement for the consultant has been 
concluded thus exposing the company to non-
compliance 
with 
applicant’s 
statutes 
and 
procedures”  
And then 3, Charge 3 says: 
“The director authorised the commissioning of a 
10 
media statement of a commission of an enquiry to 
the affairs of the company with the affairs of the 
company with the assistance of the consultant 
without the knowledge or the consent of the board.” 
And 4, Charge 4: 
“The company is in the process of establishing the 
enquiry and the director ’s actions put the integrity 
of the process of the enquiries it itself at risk.  The 
director ’s conduct has undermined the reputation of 
the board.” 
20 
5: 
“The director ’s actions did not meet the minimum 
requirements of the standard of care expected of 
him as a director of the company and a member of 
the board.” 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 78 of 289 
 
Those were the charges, now at some stage I think we will 
deal with those in terms of how justified the board was in 
preferring these charges Mr Tsotsi but I want us to 
complete the other part relating to people outside of Eskom 
making decisions for the board.           
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Mr Seleka do you want to take that 
further?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me carry on, on that 
Chairperson.  So Dr Ngubane I had asked a question this 
10 
people are outside of Eskom with inside the board within 
the premises of Eskom, the confines of the boardroom.  
This decision gets to be made on the 19 t h that you will be 
the acting Chairperson of the board.  Mr Howa does not sit 
on the board, correct?  Is that correct Mr Ngubane?    
DR NGUBANE:   Of course Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Salim Essa does not sit on the 
board? 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did not see anywhere that after the 
20 
19 t h you made the media statement that you are the acting 
Chairperson.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well I made the statement …[intervene]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 31 s t of March.  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 79 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But before then you do not talk about 
you making a media statement.  
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson this was just a decision 
of my colleagues to say you have become acting Chairman.  
It has not gone to the Minister, ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is the reason for my question.  
How would the two gentlemen have known that you are now 
the Chairperson?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does that come from Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When they make…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it come from the media statement 
of the 19 t h?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one of the 31 s t Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, where will I find it again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just go further still on – you will find 
that also in the reference bundle Chair.   
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson can I answer this without 
bothering you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
DR NGUBANE:   The minute I was acting Chairman 
20 
everybody knew, everyone knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you were the acting Chairperson? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, although the Minister had not 
pronounced it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 80 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   But everyone knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but are you saying everyone knew 
that you have been elected by your colleagues as the 
acting Chairperson or are you saying everyone knew that 
the Minister would endorse that? 
DR NGUBANE:   No Chairperson I should have brought 
probably the newspaper clips.  Right from the beginning 
the newspapers gave the accounts of what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the board meetings?    
DR NGUBANE:   I mean in the fact that Mr Tsotsi the board 
10 
had voted – taken a vote of no confidence and he has 
resigned and that I was acting Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you mean that people outside of the 
board got to know quite quickly because the media was 
reporting that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, that is right.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but let us go to the statement I 
want to see…[intervene]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chairperson if you are in the 
reference 
bundle 
you 
just 
page 
further 
to 
page 
20 
3…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Eskom Bundle 13?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 438. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 81 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   4? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   438. 
CHAIRPERSON:   438.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so this statement, this media 
statement from Mr Howa says statement by Dr Ben 
Ngubane Chairperson of Eskom on behalf of the board, and 
your point Mr Seleka?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   My question is Chair how would they 
have known that Dr Ngubane was at the time then the 
10 
Chairperson or even acting Chairperson of the board? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us start with this when did you 
become Chairperson of the board as opposed to acting 
Chairperson?  I thought that was months later.    
DR NGUBANE:   That was later much later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Much later? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   As at the 31 s t of March and during April 
of 2015 you were acting Chairperson? 
DR NGUBANE:   From the 19 t h? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the 19 t h of March.  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, to the 31 s t I was the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Acting Chairperson.  
DR NGUBANE:   Nominated by the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 82 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   From 31 s t I think the Minister had agreed 
with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then you became Chairperson 
much later.  
DR NGUBANE:   Much later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, because you see Dr 
Ngubane in your affidavit you specifically refer to you 
making or issuing a media statement on the 31 s t of March 
2015.    Do you recall that we read that part? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I take it is at that point that your 
statement will apply that everybody then came to know that 
you have been appointed as the acting Chairperson?  
DR NGUBANE:   Well as I say…[intervene]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or did they know before that.  
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson I should have brought the 
paperclips, newspaper clips which had a number of stories 
about these events.  So I do not think they only knew after 
the 31 s t.  I think as soon as the – I was elected by my 
20 
colleagues as acting I think that word went out.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so yes your statement says, I 
mean your affidavit says: 
“On 31 March 2015 I issued a press statement on 
my appointment as acting Chairman.  In it I also 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 83 of 289 
 
thanked Mr Tsotsi for his service to Eskom.  I did 
not 
personally 
prepare 
the 
statement; 
it 
was 
provided to me by the company secretary Mr 
Phukubje Malesela at the time.”  
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson is that not normal 
practice? 
 
I 
mean 
I 
could 
not 
call 
myself 
acting 
Chairperson before the 31 s t because Mr Tsotsi was still 
there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you could call yourself acting 
10 
Chairperson on the basis of your colleague’s decision, is it 
not? 
DR NGUBANE:   Which was not official Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which may not have been official but 
certainly 
you 
did 
not 
appoint 
yourself 
as 
acting 
Chairperson there was a decision by the board members 
rightly or wrongly that you be the acting Chairperson since 
we have removed the Chairperson we cannot not have a 
Chairperson but you will be acting Chairperson.      
DR NGUBANE:   Well actually I think one must nuance that 
20 
I was acting Chairperson for the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, oh okay for the duration of the 
meeting.   
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not outside of the meeting.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 84 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But once the Minister had endorsed you 
were acting Chairperson not just during the meetings but 
throughout.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay no that is fine, Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Dr Ngubane I will ask one more 
question on this I think what you are saying strengthens 
the point I want to raise with you which is how did Mr Salim 
Essa and Nazeem Howa know that you were either the 
10 
Chairperson or the acting Chairperson prior to you being 
officially endorsed by the Minister?   
DR NGUBANE:   Well I mean do not know.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not know? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me ask this question I think last 
time when you were here Mr Seleka referred you to a 
document, a document that was sent through to the – I do 
not know whether to Ms Daniels but for your attention it 
20 
was meant for you that I think either came from either Mr 
Salim Essa or Mr Howa which reflected decisions or 
resolutions that it seems they wanted the board to pay with 
regard to certain newspapers which had published certain 
articles.  Do you remember that document?      
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 85 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   It came from Businessman Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh from Businessman.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh from Businessman and of course who 
Businessman is, is an issue but it came from Businessman.   
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think the Fundudzi report you 
mentioned that they concluded that that email address was 
probably used by Mr Salim Essa.  It is important to look at 
the basis for that conclusion you know why did they come 
10 
to that conclusion for our purposes we need to look at that.  
But you indicated that you had been told Ms Daniels I think 
that it was an email address used by Mr Richard Seleke?    
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now and you did say that you put that 
document to the board and the board went along.  Is that 
right?   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chairperson but there was a context 
for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
20 
DR NGUBANE:   the Sunday Times had produced an article 
about being favourites in the Delmas area and the board 
had ordered an investigation of that allegation in order to 
find grounds for coming back to the Sunday Times.  
Subsequent to that this email came addressed to Transnet, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 86 of 289 
 
Eskom and I think Denel to take a resolution to break an 
association with this newspaper.   
What of course was probably not recognised by the 
sender of that email was that about R3.6billion had already 
been voted for media houses.  So there was no way of 
saying we now breaking off because the decision has long 
been taken to fund advertisements and all sorts of things 
with business houses but they originally complaint was that 
we need to confront the Sunday Times on its article but 
first of all do an investigation to find the truth of the 
10 
allegations.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now I just want to check is my 
understanding incorrect that last time your evidence was to 
the effect that the board did make decisions along the lines 
indicted in that document that came from that email 
address?    
DR NGUBANE:   Because it was accompanied by a ladle 
purportedly from the Minister.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but the answer is yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It made those decisions the reason why 
it made them maybe that it was accompanied by a letter 
purportedly to come from the Minister.    
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, alright.  Now you see one has 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 87 of 289 
 
got to see what is happening here to try and establish the 
facts.  Now we know you told us you knew Mr Salim Essa 
from previous interactions.  I think you said he was not 
your friend but you had, had some business interactions 
but the project that you had agreed to be partners in 
collapsed.      
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, right.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you said also that you knew Mr 
Howa I think as well.  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You knew him from the TNA breakfast 
which you use to attend or some of which you use to attend 
when you were at SABC.  
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right, ja.  Now it would seem that 
certainly from the statement of the media statement that 
was prepared similarly by Mr Howa for the 31 s t of March 
that his understanding of your relationship must have been 
that you would welcome this media statement that they had 
prepared.  Did you want to say anything about that?   
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well then it would have sent…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rightly or wrongly.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson in that case it would 
have sent it directly to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 88 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Which never happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I am wondering why somebody 
who knows me would prepare such a detailed statement as 
a statement that I must issue or for me to consider to issue 
when I can prepare that statement myself or ask my office 
my organisation to prepare that.   
Why would he think that it will be acceptable to me? 
that he being outside of my organisation must prepare a 
media statement in my name send it to me as a statement 
that I must consider issuing.  So when I think about that I 
10 
am saying whether rightly or wrongly it would seem that he 
thought that your relationship maybe such that you would 
not have a problem with that because otherwise he would 
not do that.      
DR NGUBANE:   Well he could have prepared it for the 
new age newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   You know but I do not remember seeing 
that article in the new age.  That is why I asked Mr 
Riley…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, to try and find.   
DR NGUBANE:   To track the media. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
DR NGUBANE:   To see if that statement…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did come out.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 89 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Was published.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   And they said they did not know.  
CHAIRPERSON:   They could not find it, yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   They said they did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They could not find it.  
DR NGUBANE:   But just to remind you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   Ms Daniels spoke of meetings that she 
went to at Nautilus House whether those meetings had any 
10 
outcome …[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those ones at Melrose Arch?   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, but I am saying there were lot of 
influence and intrusion into…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom matters.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   So I am saying I will not be surprised if 
people who are wanting to influence hat I say out of the 
statement.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Dr Ngubane you see 
the email of well if I go back to the Richard Seleke issue 
because you were saying that Richard Seleke is the person 
behind the email address in the portal and I showed you 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 90 of 289 
 
last time the email you produced to the Commission the 
emails 
of 
June 
2016 
and 
you 
were 
saying 
to 
the 
Chairperson this are the first emails I received from him 
and then we showed you the emails of 28 September 2015.     
DR NGUBANE:   Right.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now we got confirmation I do not know 
whether you were provided in terms of Rule 3.3 with the 
affidavit Ms Matsiese Mokolo the acting DG at the time.  
DR NGUBANE:   No Chair.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
In 
the 
Department 
of 
Public 
10 
Enterprises.  She specifically says there that she was 
acting in that position of DG in September 2015 Mr Seleke 
was not there.    
DR NGUBANE:   But I did acknowledge Chairperson that I 
had not made the link in terms of time when this info-portal 
address was used, I did indicate that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, and that Mr Seleke only 
commenced his appointment was with effective from 1 
December 2015.  The Minister signs the letter for his 
appointment on the 27 t h of November 2015 but that is an 
20 
appointment with effect from 21 December 2015.  But the 
email exchange with you in regard to contact termination 
with media houses it says to you here with as discussed.  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and I asked you the question 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 91 of 289 
 
which I do not think it was answered when Businessman 
says as discussed who did you discuss with? 
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson I said quite emphatically 
I never did discussions on that document.  So I passed it 
on to the company secretary.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you are saying…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I missed which document is 
that Mr Seleka?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the email Chairperson, let me 
take the Chairperson to…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Media statement or email? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No these are the emails from 
Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   About a document drafted for the board 
first of all on terminating contact and commercial relations 
with media houses.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, yes okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That document became the draft 
became the resolution that was made by the board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what month and year is that again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is 28 September 2015.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So part of the point you want to make to 
Dr Ngubane which I think he seems to accept is that could 
not have been Mr Richard Seleke at that time.  You accept 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 92 of 289 
 
that?  
DR NGUBANE:   The probability. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The probability.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we cannot be 100% because 
nothing is 100% in this world.  The probabilities are that it 
was not him. 
DR NGUBANE:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  And – and the findings you 
would have seen from Ms Suzanne Daniels Ruling – 
disciplinary ruling and what the Chairperson has indicated to 
you in the Fundudzi Report is that because at the hearing of 
Ms Suzanne they led expert evidence and concluded that the 
email address most probably belonged to Mr Salim Essa. 
 
At least on the evidence we have insofar as you say 
that Businessman was – who was communicating with you 
here was Mr Richard Seleke.  On the evidence we have it 
20 
cannot be correct. 
DR NGUBANE:  But I have considered that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you have – you have accepted that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 93 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if indeed it was to be found that it was 
Mr Salim Essa on the probabilities that would reflect would it 
not that he expected you to go along with what was written in 
the – in that email, is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – is it correct.  Of course you said 
there was a letter that purported to come from the Minister 
that came with that email, is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not remember it.  I see Mr Seleka 
10 
shakes his head.  I understood you a while ago maybe ten 
minutes ago to say the board went along with those 
resolutions or that – those decisions reflected in that email 
because there was a letter that came with that email which 
purported to be a letter from the Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am saying I cannot remember it.  Mr 
Seleka shakes his.  Are you sure that there was such a 
letter? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I would have to look in the files but 
20 
that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  That resolution was accompanied by a letter 
according to the Company Secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 94 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  From the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And is it a letter that you – you did 
see or you may have been told what it says and so on? 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no Chairperson it formed the basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It formed the basis of the decision? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the board. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka you say no such 
letter has been found. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is no such a letter in the 
documentation provided to us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But it only makes the matter even worse.  
If Businessman sends the boards of SOE’s this letter that is 
a proposal Dr Ngubane accompanied by a letter from the 
Minister.  So that means Businessman is working with the 
Minister to tell the board what to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr Seleka you will remember 
and well Dr Ngubane who was not here I do not know if he 
20 
was listening but you did last week refer to Ms Daniels’ 
affidavit where she said that when she met with Mr Salim 
Essa and Mr Koko on the 10t h March 2015 at Melrose Arch 
Mr Salim Essa introduced himself to her as advisor to the 
Minister.  I do not know if you – you heard that Dr Ngubane? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 95 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  I saw that in some document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So I am just saying there is that 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I got you Chair.  I got you Chair.  So it 
would not be surprising but anyway we do not have the 
letter.  But if there is a letter like that Dr Ngubane … 
DR NGUBANE:  I will have to find it and give it to my legal 
representative. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no it is correct.  It gives all the more 
credence to Ms Daniels’ evidence that Mr Salim Essa 
10 
introduced himself as Minister Brown’s advisor.  Because 
now you see even on the version of the letter which 
accompanies Businessman’s proposed resolution to be taken 
by the board and that was Transnet, Eskom and Denel.  You 
remember the document? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  All these boards are streamed along by 
Businessman as he advisor to the Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson I think there is enough 
expertise in this country to determine the domain of any 
20 
email address.  So I wish that can be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  We need to do whatever can be 
done to establish exactly what [00:06:09].  But I think it is 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 96 of 289 
 
important Dr Ngubane to address this issue fully from your 
side.   
The issue being that it may be that at some stage 
either Mr Seleka or some other lawyer will say to me 
Chairperson when you assess the evidence in regard to what 
happened here the evidence is such that you must find that 
there were people outside of this board who were making 
decisions for this board or who were manipulating this board.  
Or somebody might say you must find that this whole saga 
about and enquiry and the suspension of the executives their 
10 
removal or resignation of the charging Mr Tsotsi and his 
resignation did not just happen out of the blue.  It was 
planned somewhere.   
Maybe outside of Eskom but maybe some people 
within the board and within Eskom who might not be in the 
board but within Eskom.   
Maybe some of the – some people within the board or 
within Eskom knew about this agenda or about this plan. But 
maybe others did not know about this agenda and they went 
along thinking they were making decisions that they thought 
20 
were in the best interest of – of Eskom but actually they 
assisted people who had a certain agenda.   
And I might be told that that agenda was for 
capturing the board as well as key executives in the 
management of the company so that they would be the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 97 of 289 
 
people who would be in the board or the majority of people 
would be in the board or the key people – there would be key 
people in the board even if it is not the whole board those 
that they considered influential in the board would be people 
that would go along with the decisions that these people 
from outside of Eskom wanted to be taken.   
And the argument might be that you see if Mr Tsotsi’s 
evidence is true that around the – the day of SONA in early 
in February he was called to – by the Minister – Minister 
Brown and told that if he did not stop interfering in 
10 
operational matters the Minister would find another person to 
do his job and a few hours later same day Mr Tsotsi was 
called by Mr Tony Gupta to a meeting and Mr Tony Gupta 
said to him Chairperson you are not assisting us.   
We are the people who put you in that position we 
can take you out.  And that this happened after he had – Mr 
Tsotsi had had some interactions with Mr Tony Gupta and I 
think at some stage with Mr Salim Essa as well.  Where 
attempts were made for him to facilitate certain things at 
Eskom and he had not facilitated them according to him. 
20 
And then the argument would be that it was important 
– it may have been important to those people that the board 
at least had certain people who would be quite influential 
and critical in the agenda that they had.  And that Mr Tsotsi 
had to be removed because he did not want to play along 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 98 of 289 
 
and that it was important that the – the three executives who 
was – who were ultimately allowed to go or removed was 
important that they should go because they occupied key 
positions – strategic positions including CEO and Financial 
Director. 
And that the plan was to bring other people that 
maybe 
those 
who 
were 
pursuing 
this 
agenda 
were 
comfortable with and that they – they made sure that the 
board got rid of Mr Tsotsi.  You were made Chairperson. 
Then after the executives – the three executives had 
10 
left Mr Brian Molefe from Eskom was brought in to take the 
position of CEO – Group CEO.   
Mr Anoj Singh from Eskom was brought to take the 
position of CFO and then at that stage those people would 
have felt that we are able to get the board to make whatever 
decisions we want.  We will make decisions; send emails get 
the board to go along.   
And in the position of CEO we have got Brian – Mr 
Brian Molefe and in the position of Financial Director we 
have got Mr Anoj Singh.  And Mr Brian Molefe according to 
20 
the evidence of Mr Jonas who gave evidence before me Mr 
Jonas was told by a Gupta brother on the 23 October 2015 
that Gupta brother seems to have been Tony Gupta if Mr 
Jonas’ evidence is correct.   
Mr Jonas says he was told by this Gupta brother that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 99 of 289 
 
they were as a family – they were working with certain 
people and Mr Brian Molefe was mentioned as one of them.   
Ms Lynne Brown was mentioned as another one.  
There might have been a third one.  And Mr Jonas says this 
Gupta brother said Mr Molefe’s career I do not know what 
words he used but it is like it is taken care of.  Like he does 
not have to worry you know. 
So – so there is a good chance that I will be urged to 
look at all of this and adopt the position that these things did 
not just happen out of the blue.  They were part of a certain 
10 
plan, a certain agenda and what happened ultimately at 
Eskom may be reveals that agenda if so you having been 
chairperson after Mr Tsotsi it is important that you say what 
you are able to say.   
Whether you think if that if I am urged to take that 
line you think there is no basis for it.  You think I must look 
at these other facts along these lines which show that that 
cannot be true.  Or you say look maybe at that time I did not 
see it but with what has happened I can understand 
somebody who argues goes along those lines. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson I would have to make a 
very long statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no.  It is fine.  And if you say you 
– you would like to – to prepare something I would be 
amenable.  But you – but you can say what you can now. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 100 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  If you can allow me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  For the sake of public listening purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  We know the origin of the decision to 
suspend executives.  We know.  Mr Tsotsi told us precisely 
what he was instructed to do – who was going to do this.   
 
Mr Tsotsi told us that there was a big thick document 
in the Presidency about how this enquiry must be conducted. 
Although he never gave us or showed us that document.   
10 
 
Mr Tsotsi was involved in the suspension which we 
were opposing.  There is ample evidence that even on the 9t h 
I was one of the people who spoke about not approving the 
resolutions that he was given to make the board to accept.  
And other board members joined in that. 
 
And that we demanded that the shareholder comes to 
address us on this matter because we were not convinced.  
But when the shareholder came she emphasised that there 
was a need for an inquiry.  And she counted the areas where 
the inquiry should focus and that the people in those 
20 
positions had to step aside. 
 
We – now that is the part if there was a coordination 
with someone else we do not know.  But this is the fact that 
we know how it originated. 
 
But we also know that from what Suzanne Daniels 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 101 of 289 
 
said there were other actions on the side like the meeting at 
Melrose and so on. 
 
In terms of myself being appointed acting Chairman it 
was a spontaneous decision by members of the board.  Now 
if someone had canvassed you would have had to convince 
all the members of the board because they were unanimous 
about that and I accepted such. 
 
Going forward after the suspension of Mr Matona I 
told him at the CCMA please wait three months and come 
back to your job.  He rejected.  Later on we were given a 
10 
report that the executives were suspended want to come 
back now to their positions or else they will go to the Labour 
Court and CCMA and force that. 
 
Now Chairperson the difficulty with that for us was 
that we had set up the inquiry.  There was no funding for this 
inquiry.  So what the Minister herself directed the Audit and 
Risk 
Committee 
to 
supervise 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
investigators and the drawing up of the Terms of Reference. 
 
The Terms of Reference were drawn up but the 
investigation would depend on the task orders that would 
20 
come from Audit and Risk. 
 
So the first task order commissioned dealt with the 
systemic problems, the failure of Generation, the failure of 
maintenance, the financial challenges Eskom faced and so 
on and so on. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 102 of 289 
 
 
So under task order 1 Denton says:  
“The board has indicated that it is important 
for the information to be tested by an 
independent 
party 
without 
EXCO’s 
involvement particularly those members of 
Eskom whose areas will be directly impacted 
by the inquiry so as to lend credence to the 
reports that the independent party would 
produce.” 
 
Now the issue of the suspended executives coming 
10 
back before the end of three months was a serious problem 
for us.  Because it would scuttle the whole investigation and 
we had already committed to paying huge sums of money.  I 
think probably it was R26 million or something for this 
investigation. 
 
This was the reason why we thought we tell them that 
they cannot come back before the end of three months. If 
that is difficult for them let us settle so that we remove this 
problem.   
 
So in this I do not see any machination.  It was a 
20 
response to a reality that we faced.  Unfortunately there 
were consequences.   
 
We put in Mr Zethembe Khoza against the GE for 
Generations that Mr Tsotsi wanted to make the acting GCO.  
We said we cannot take another GE and put them instead of 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 103 of 289 
 
the suspended CEO. 
 
So we suggested and proposed to the Minister that 
Mr Zethembe Khoza was the – a non-executive director of 
Eskom becomes the acting GCO.  But obviously that had 
limitations.  Limitations in that he had no experience with 
power systems or with the power industry. 
 
So we asked the Minister we said we look to you to 
help 
us 
find 
someone 
who 
can 
understand 
financial 
management but also understand technology.  Understand 
the turning around of ailing organisations.  And the Minister 
10 
came up with the name of Brian Molefe. 
 
We said oh ja excellent you know we know his 
history.  He worked well at PIC.  He took that organisation 
from an asset base of R1 billion to an asset base of R800 
billion within I think five or seven years.  Fine let him come. 
 
He came and we saw the difference.  The whole of 
South Africa knows that we had no load shedding for fifteen 
months – him having come there. 
 
So came the issue of the Financial Director – the 
acting Financial Director Mr Velete Dlamini – Ms Velete 
20 
Dlamini.  She got a job with ITC.  She gave her notice that 
she was going and the next thing was for People In 
Governance to say how would we replace this – this FD? 
 
It was at a board meeting I am sure I have got the 
documents somewhere in my pile where the board said we 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 104 of 289 
 
task the acting chairman to enter into discussions with 
Transnet and the Minister to bring in Mr Anoj Singh. 
 
I do not know who recommended Anoj Singh as such 
but we knew that he had worked with Brian Molefe at 
Transnet and they had done well.  That is how the whole 
process of bringing Anoj Singh unfolded. 
 
I told you last time that when I started preparing my 
affidavit I was locked down in Durban.  I did not have all the 
documentation.  But last time I gave to the evidence leader 
those documents about secondment of Mr Molefe as well as 
10 
Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  Now I am trying to say the issue of being a 
master plan behind all of this could have been but what we 
acted on were documents that management had prepared for 
the board.  And those documents on the surface of it 
probably were in perfect order. 
 
Take for instance the issue of the guarantee to 
Tegeta.  Ms Suzanne Daniels came with the documents.  Mr 
Koko had written the DG of DMR saying there was a real 
20 
threat to Hendrina to Arnot and Komati Power Stations 
because OCM – Optimum Coal Mine was under business 
rescue.  Anything could happen. 
 
Could 
go 
into 
liquidation, 
could 
be 
bought 
by 
somebody else.  So he wanted the intervention of DMR to 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 105 of 289 
 
make sure that whatever happens the supply of coal to 
Hendrina, Arnot and Komati will be secured. 
 
The DMR responded by saying then pre-purchase the 
coal.  That locks in your coal supply.  Ms Daniels came with 
a memorandum saying there must a Round Robin Resolution 
to authorise the pre-payment – pre-purchase of coal from 
Optimum Coal Mines. 
 
There was no mention of the guarantee or anything 
like that.  Even further the recommendation was there will be 
no upfront payment for the coal from Optimum Mine.  Instead 
10 
the purchase will be financed through inventory working 
capital redaction from 54 months to 40 months. 
 
In other words if we still had the coal they would not 
bring extra coal.  But as the coal stock depletes we will 
[00:26:41] pay them.  In other words we will be reducing the 
working capital for the inventory. 
 
Very sound, very sound documentation.  I said okay 
call a Round Robin.  We did a Round Robin and this was 
approved.  The IFC which is the Investment Finance 
Committee which decides on emergency procurements and 
20 
purchases had already taken a Round Robin to approve the 
pre-payment or the pre-purchase of coal. 
 
So it – our board resolution – I mean Round Robin 
Resolution 
was 
merely 
confirming 
what 
the 
IFC 
had 
recommended.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 106 of 289 
 
 
The issue about the guarantee I only came to know it 
very late.  That instead of the inventory working capital 
redaction method there had been issued a guarantee to 
Tegeta via ABSA Bank. 
 
When I dug into this I got to know that Ms Daniels 
had extracted from the minutes of the Resolution and gone 
to Treasury – Eskom Treasury and they had proposed that 
ABSA – I think the financial – the FD Mr Singh I think he was 
there as well that there would be this guarantee. 
 
So I am trying to say I am not saying there might not 
10 
be other power players in between but the documentation 
that the board relied on was always sound and very clear. 
 
So I am just responding to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  The scenarios that you have drawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine.  I mean it is – it is 
possible theoretically speaking that you could have a 
situation where people outside of the board whether some of 
them inside Eskom others outside of Eskom – it is possible 
that there could even be a manipulation of situations so that 
20 
when something is put before the board it appears to be in 
order nobody can quibble with it you know. 
 
But they are working on some agenda but when you 
look at the document you say no this makes sense.  But they 
know what they are doing. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 107 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is also possible. 
DR NGUBANE:  But Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  If I can add? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  A mammoth organisation like Transnet will 
always have people who benefit from procurement of 
services, procurement of products.  It will always be there.  
So I do not know what mechanisms can be put in place to 
10 
stop this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  I mean for instance the first thing we did 
when Brian Molefe came was a decision to stop – in amounts 
that were being used by the Tsotsi board of R1 billion a 
month.  That was a decision we took.  We said we will 
maintain our old coal fired power stations.  Give them – get 
them back to order.  From a probably R67 billion budget for 
diesel it was a few million rands. 
 
A decision we took on gist.  Now who was benefitting 
20 
from the diesel purchases?  Today who is benefitting from 
burning diesel to keep the lights on?   
 
So there are issues that will always be there with 
such a big organisation.  So I presume you will have a 
lifetime work unfolding all. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 108 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well talking about Mr Brian Molefe and 
Mr Anoj Singh of course as you said when they came to 
Eskom they were coming from Transnet. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did say – you say the reports or 
what you had heard as a board was that they have done very 
well or at Transnet. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now they are yet to come and give 
evidence before me and deal with all kinds of allegations 
10 
that have been made against them.  But part of the evidence 
I have heard which they will deal with you know and I do not 
know what the finding will be but part of the evidence that I 
have been told by persons who say they were their body 
guards or protectors is evidence that they would visit the 
Gupta residence and get money which they – they took.  I 
think maybe one or both of them went to keep it in a certain 
place a thing called Knox – Knox something. 
 
Now if that is true and I – and as I emphasise that 
they are still to give evidence and deal with that. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if in the end I were to find that that is 
true then it would not be surprising if somebody were to say 
they had a hand that is the Gupta’s in them being moved to 
Eskom. But as I say if that were to be true I do not know if it 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 109 of 289 
 
is true they will still give evidence.  I have not made any 
finding I will hear everybody. 
 
But I am just saying if it proves to be true you now 
one 
may have to look 
whether the 
Gupta’s 
or their 
associates might not have had a hand in what happened at 
Eskom.  Oh I did not realise that we have gone past one 
o’clock.  We are at ten past one.  I think we must take the 
lunch break.  We will come back at ten past two and then we 
will continue.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we continue.  I just want to 
mention this.  Dr Ngubane, you... one of the things you said, 
I think, in response to the scenario that I painted.  Was that 
Mr Tsotsi was in effect pushing for the suspension of the 
executives already at the meeting of the 9 t h.  Is that correct? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I... that was put to him when he 
came back last week.  And he denied that at that meeting 
the... even the... that there was even a discussion of the 
suspensions.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 110 of 289 
 
 
He said the suspensions were only discussed at the 
meeting of the 11 t h.  And he said that in support of that, I 
think he said, one, either the executives or some of the 
executives who were to be suspended were in attendance at 
that meeting of the 9t h.   
 
So that issue should not have been discussed in their 
presence.  And I think I did see in the minutes or transcript, I 
am not sure, that Ms Molefe was definitely or seems 
definitely to have been present at the meeting of the 9 t h.   
 
But I think Mr Seleka also indicated that the audios, if I 
10 
am not mistaken, the audio recording in relation to the 
meeting of the 9 t h do not reflect that discussion of the 
suspensions.   
 
Mr Seleka must just confirm whether there is something 
attributed to him that is not correct before Dr Ngubane 
response. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the top of my head.  Chair, you are 
correct in your summation.  In fact, both the executives were 
present at the meeting of the 9t h, Mr Matona and Ms 
Tsholofelo Molefe.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your recollection correct Dr Ngubane or 
do you want to refresh your memory by looking at some 
document? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 111 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, I am trying to look at the minutes of 
the 9t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minutes of the 9t h are on page 279 
of Dr Ngubane’s bundle, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of which bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Doctor... 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I have got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that has got his affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson.  That is Eskom 
Bundle 09(A). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and what is the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   279. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So page two, seven... the Chairperson is 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was saying if you are there 
Chairperson, you will see the names of those who were 
present in the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am there now. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So Mr Tsotsi, Baloyi, Carrim, 
Xhosa, Chwayita Mabude and then the other two executives.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I see the reference to the FD at page 
279. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And to the chief executive. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 112 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also it does reflect the financial 
director in the list of people who attended the meeting as 
well as Mr Matona, Ms Molefe and miss... Dan Matona(sic) 
(Marokane).  They are reflected as having been present.   
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry.  I think Chairperson the confusion 
which arose ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...comes from this statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
DR NGUBANE:   “He had been requested to request the  
10 
board 
to 
authorise 
a 
mandate, 
an 
independent external inquiry to establish 
the facts of the current difficulties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
DR NGUBANE:   “This inquiry would have to been unvetted  
by management.” 
 
I think that is how I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what... ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you ...[intervenes]  
20 
DR NGUBANE:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...accept that ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it might not have been a discussion of 
suspensions ...[intervenes]  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 113 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Nothing, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ....as such.  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay thank you.  I thought 
let us clear that, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But having accepted that.  Do you 
say that at the meeting of the 11 t h ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you did push for the suspensions or you 
10 
thought it was just on the 9t h?  You are not shifting back to 
the 11t h?  Because you are saying, he did not push as such 
for the suspensions. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you might not recall? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I do recall because at that meeting, 
after the meeting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the 11 t h? 
DR NGUBANE:   Of the 11t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Seleka can tell us where to find it 
because he might assist you in case there is something that 
you think will refresh your memory? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought we were still on the 9t h, Chair? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 114 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we have gone passed. 
DR NGUBANE:   We have moved? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have gone passed the 9t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Ngubane has said he is not insisting at 
the meeting of the 9t h Mr Tsotsi pushed for the suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says he thinks what may have 
caused him some confusion is the statement that says the 
investigation should be unvetted or something like that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so with regard to the 9 t h that is clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I only asked him the question whether 
on the statement that Mr Tsotsi pushed for the extensions 
of... or the suspensions of the executives, I only asked him 
whether that statement in his evidence falls away now that 
he realised that no that is not on the 9 t h.  Or whether he says 
no it did happen but it happened ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 11t h. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ..on the 11 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is what I was asking. 
DR NGUBANE:   I was going to read what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you say, yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 115 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are reading from the minutes of the 
meeting of the 11t h? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairman, I highlighted the view that: 
“It may be necessary for employees whose areas 
are implicated to be requested to step aside whilst 
the inquiry was proceeding.   
So there was a trust deficit and that people who may 
10 
be to blame would not want the truth to be found 
and findings made.” 
 
For me that was pushing for suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so that is what you would be 
...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...relying on to say he was pushing for 
suspensions. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make... ja.  But I wanted us to 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...deal with that because I remembered it 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 116 of 289 
 
like, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, that is important Chair 
because it should pointed out that in the minutes of the 
9t h of March, the statement says: 
“This 
inquiry 
would 
have 
to 
be 
unvetted 
by 
management 
and 
the 
board 
and 
other 
policy 
stakeholders.” 
 
Which is on page 280. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is not just management.  Well, in 
fact, 
executives 
are 
not 
mentioned 
there. 
 
It 
says 
management, the board and other policy stakeholders.  Just 
to complete the statement which Dr Ngubane was reading. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, Chairperson.  Not to split hairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Who is the management of Eskom? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would include the executives, I would 
imagine.  [laughing] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Dr Ngubane.  So the board will 
have to be suspended as well, Dr Ngubane.  [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   But Chair that is why he wanted us to vote 
to have a three men sub-committee. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 117 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...that will oversee the whole thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   He would have no role in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And that is what we objected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   One of the things, we objected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must say Dr Ngubane that when Mr 
Tsotsi was here last week and this issue about him... about 
you having said he pushed for the suspensions of the 
executives was raised and he denied and there was a 
question what was said at the meeting of the 9 t h and so on.   
 
I think there was also reference to the meeting of the 
11t h.  Now I think I did ask Mr Seleka whether there was not 
something that he had said or may have said.   
 
I seem to have read either in a transcript of minutes 
something that did suggests to me that he may have at one 
20 
stage or another spoken in a manner that can be seen as 
pushing for the suspensions.   
 
But I think Mr Seleka had not recollection that he had 
seen anything like that.  But I think since then, there is 
somewhere where I have seen at least one sentence which 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 118 of 289 
 
seemed to be consistent with him pushing.  It is just that now 
I cannot ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will find that for you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  So I thought I would mention just 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, that is in order Chair because 
the response given from my side was in relation to the 
9t h of March. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because that has always been Dr 
Ngubane’s version that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...on the 9t h of March, Mr Tsotsi 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If we go to the 11t h, of course, the 
20 
situation is different on the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The issue of difference on the 11t h, 
relates to the FD.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 119 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Mr Tsotsi had “instructions” or a 
“request” in regard to the three executives.  There he does 
not dispute that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He does not dispute that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he would have been motivated 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...for these people to be suspended on 
the basis of what he had been instructed in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  You may proceed Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So Dr Ngubane, I will 
come to that because I did not... I finished off on something I 
20 
wanted to finalise with you.  That Reference Bundle with the 
statements prepared between Mr Howa and Mr Salim Essa.   
 
Ultimately, the one of the 31s t, we obtained an email 
which shows that that document was ultimately forwarded to 
Mr Tony Gupta and that we find on page 442 of the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 120 of 289 
 
Reference Bundle.   
DR NGUBANE:   Which document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one of... we dealt with the 
19t h of March draft. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now I am at the 31s t of March draft. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi has resigned.  He tendered his 
resignation the night before and this is now the 31s t.  The 
draft is exchanged between Mr Howa and Mr Salim Essa. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About what should be the chairperson’s 
statement to the public.  And that draft of the 31 March 2015, 
ultimately finds its way to Mr Tony Gupta and that is on page 
442.  Now you are not copied in the email. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am just point out to you. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that if you have any knowledge of it, 
you can say yay or nay. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Nay. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I did not follow all of that Mr Seleka 
because I am still trying to find the page.  But I see at 442 in 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 121 of 289 
 
the Reference Bundle ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that it is an email from Nazeem Howa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   nazeemh@tmamedia.co.za at 08:17 in the 
morning on the 31s t of March 2015 and it is addressed to 
Tony Gupta and the subject:  Statement from New Board, 
March 31.  And it says: 
“Thank you, sir.” 
 
It says: 
10 
“Nazeem Howa, Chief Executive the New Agent, 
African News Network 7.” 
 
That is ANN7, I guess.  And then at the bottom of that 
page ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   31 March 2015 at 08:19 in the morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tony Gupta seemed to write, using the 
email address tony@sahara.co.za, wrote:  “Okay.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it says on 31 March 2015 at 
07:50.  Nazeem Howa wrote from nazeemh@tmamedia.co.za:  
“Salim by an amended version for your approval.”  And then 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is ...[intervenes]  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 122 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I guess the bottom one came first and 
then the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You got it right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one 08:19 ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...which said okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which might be meaning the statement is 
10 
okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Its approval. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is from Tony Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  You wanted Dr Ngubane to 
comment if he has got anything to say about that statement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems to... that media statement seems 
20 
to have ultimately gone to Mr Tony Gupta for approval. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And he said he has no knowledge.  Is that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 123 of 289 
 
right? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Dr Ngubane did having painted the 
picture 
for 
us 
in 
your 
affidavit 
of 
your 
knowledge, 
interactions and the likes with Mr Howa, with Mr Salim Essa, 
with the Gupta brothers.  Were you aware of any member of 
the Board of Eskom which you were part of giving such level 
10 
of interaction with them? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, even the company secretary never told 
me that she had been called to a meeting.  So I was not 
aware.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, but I am speaking specifically 
about the board members.  Misses ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   [Indistinct]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Klein, Dr Naidoo, Ms Carrim. 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Vente Klein. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Norman Baloyi. 
DR NGUBANE:   No.  Well, the Mail & Guardian once 
published an article, trying to link all board members, you 
know.  But I mean that was them.  I did not have knowledge 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 124 of 289 
 
of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have any information? 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay.  So as far as you are 
concerned, the level of interaction with the persons I have 
mentioned, Mr Howa, Mr Salim Essa and the Gupta family 
members, as far as you knew, you were the person who had 
that type of a relationship with them previously. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so on. 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I did not want to make that 
conclusion Mr Ngubane but that leaves one with what could 
be a conclusion that the only way they interacted or got 
insight into the board...  maybe I should... ja, I put this to 
20 
you.  Who got insight into the board’s affairs could be by 
their previous associate.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well, that is a ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am putting it to you so you can 
respond. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 125 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, that would be quite as serious 
allegation because I have had business links with many 
people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   As I said, at one stage, I was seeing about 
23 companies.  That does not, therefore, entitle people to 
be... to make me a puppet.   
 
I mean, if those associations are going to be linked with 
undue influence, that is wrong, you know.  I knew Howa 
because he was a media man.  I was not in the media 
10 
industry, you know.   
 
So, but that does not create then the condition that he 
will run Eskom through me, you know.  Just like many other 
associates would not do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And along with that proposition I am 
putting to you is the fact that behind the email info portal 
and the name Businessman, is most probably Mr Salim Essa 
with whom you had business dealings and met with him at 
SOE Boards in your previous time prior to coming to Eskom 
Board. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   If I knew Businessman prior to coming to 
Eskom Board? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think just repeat the question Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shall I repeat it? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 126 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So I am saying, along 
with the proposition I put to you about, if the level of 
knowing the people, interacting with them.  It is only 
confined to you within the board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  Well, sorry.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You want ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   I did not say it was only confined to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I was talking in terms of knowledge. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, oaky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in terms of what you know.  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so according to your knowledge 
...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...that you were the person who had 
interacted with them at a level you have disclosed in your 
affidavit.  So I am saying, along with that, that you could be 
the only person then giving them insight into the board.   
20 
 
I am putting again another proposition, so you can 
respond to the Chairperson.  That the face behind the email 
address info portal or Businessman is not... that the 
conclusion that it is most probably Mr Salim Essa seems to 
give credence to that proposition.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 127 of 289 
 
 
That the only person who would have succeeded in 
making Mr Salim Essa, have enrolled into the board, will be 
Dr Ngubane because the emails are exchanged directly with 
him, Businessman. 
DR NGUBANE:   But ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a proposition. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja-no ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just respond to the Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   It is a dangerous proposition because if you 
appear at the Zondo Commission and something is said 
10 
about you, then that becomes the living truth in the public 
domain.  So this is a dangerous proposition you are making 
and therefore I reject it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, that is fine.  Because 
remember, we are looking at the documentation before us 
and we have to test what is here with what you are telling to 
the Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   Anyway, to the Chairperson I should add. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
DR NGUBANE:   When I came to Eskom, Salim Essa – I 
20 
think it was Fabian and McKenzie ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...were very active in Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, already. 
DR NGUBANE:   They were doing on Majuba Power Station, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 128 of 289 
 
on the Top 100 Engineers Consulting Programme, on the 
corporate plan for Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   And that is what they claimed money for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   Which later on became disputed.  So if I 
say, I cannot name a board member who knew Essa, it does 
not mean that Essa did not have contact with other board 
members.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Because he was at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I am only confining ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...apart from the fact that the Commission 
must look at other board members as well to see what 
interactions they may have had with them.   
 
We also do know that if Ms Daniels’ evidence is true, 
there seems to have also been some relationship between 
20 
Mr Salim Essa and Mr Koko.   
 
And maybe also Mr Salim Essa and Ms Daniels as well.  
There have been some evidence.  Mr Koko, of course, has 
not testified as yet but there has been that as well. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 129 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, do not be upset Dr Ngubane.  I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But Dr Ngubane.  Ja, he is right to say do 
not be upset.  [laughing]  It will be unfair of him if he thinks 
that there may be an argument that goes along a certain line 
and he does not give you... put it to you and give you a 
chance to deal with it.  Only later on to come and argue 
before me that that is what I should... that is the finding I 
should make. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he is duty bound to say what do you 
say if somebody was to think along those lines or what do 
you say about this? 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that you can deal with it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson I fully accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   However, there are investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   His investigators ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...should check the role of Essa and 
McKenzie at Eskom ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 130 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   ...who they interacted with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   He must not rely on me giving names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  
And in fact, there will be evidence related to McKenzie and... 
ja, there are still going to be a lot of evidence in the future.  
Ja, about Eskom.  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is fair enough Dr Ngubane.  At 
this stage, looking at the documentation that we have, the 
emails of the 28 t h of September 2015, they are between 
10 
Businessman and you.   
 
The emails you attached in your affidavit of June 2016 is 
between you and Businessman.  They do not involve any 
other person.  So it is on the basis of those emails.   
 
The email also of – we are cutting ties with media 
houses, City Press, Mail & Guardian and Sunday Times, is 
between you and Businessman.   
 
So when you look at that, is what I have to put to you.  I 
cannot put it to Mr Tsotsi or to Ms Venete Klein. 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You understand? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   When they come here, they now have 
their other aspects I need to deal with them with which do 
not concern you.  They cannot say:  Well, why do you not 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 131 of 289 
 
ask Dr Ngubane about it?  You understand?  It is in that 
context.   
DR NGUBANE:   Correct.  Chairperson, I explained that 
email commenting on my media statement.  It was sent to 
Suzanne Daniels and copied to me.  So I was not the only 
one who received emails from Businessman.  But the 
advocate is insinuating that all Businessman emails were 
coming directly to me.  That is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the important thing about the fact that 
he puts it to you is that you get a chance to correct him. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
DR NGUBANE:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you get a chance to correct them. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he did not put it to you and you would 
not have got this chance. 
DR NGUBANE:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct.  In fact, Dr Ngubane, the 
20 
email of June is sent to you and then you forwarded it to Ms 
Daniels. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It came from you.  It came to you. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 132 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So just to clarify that because you 
were saying to the Chairperson it went to Ms Daniels who 
forwarded it to you. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no, no.  Certain emails that I 
remembered Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And that is the only one until you showed 
me that one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I had not remembered that email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So the position is that the first 
one came to you. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you copied Ms Daniels. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the second one went to her. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she copied you? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 133 of 289 
 
then let us deal with other matters.  I think the Chairperson 
has already dealt with the suspension of the executives in 
regarding the version of your version, Mr Tsotsi raised the 
issue on the 9t h of March vis-à-vis his version.   
 
I will leave that aside because Ms Molefe testified here 
and said but how could... that board meeting of the 9 t h had a 
proposed resolution.  Remember, it was prepared by Mr Nick 
Linnell. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   and at the end of it, it had a list of board 
10 
members who had to sign the resolution.  Both of them, the 
names were there, Mr Matona and Ms Tsholofelo Molefe.  
She said:  How could we have signed to suspend ourselves?    
DR NGUBANE:   So but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he has accepted ja that one, the 9th. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The suspensions were not discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think the one point that I... another 
point that needs to be raised about the suspension of 
20 
executives Dr Ngubane, is the question of the suspension or 
the question of the addition of the financial director’s name 
in the list of executives to be suspended.   
 
Now, you did... I think you did give evidence before 
about it, if I am not mistaken.  But in the... at the Durban 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 134 of 289 
 
meeting which Mr Tsotsi attended, there were only three 
names that were discussed.   
 
It was Mr Koko, it was Mr Matona and Mr Marokane.  
Mr Marokane, ja.  The FD was not included.  So the question 
that has arisen is, when exactly was the Financial Director, 
Ms Molefe added?  Now Mr Tsotsi said previously before 
you came to give evidence and I think repeated when he 
came last week, if I am not mistaken, that he said that you 
told him that the Minister wanted the name of the FD to be 
included or something to that effect and he said he was 
10 
opposed to the inclusion of the FD in the list of executives 
to be suspended so much so that he says he even called 
the Minister himself, Minister Brown, to say – to confirm 
that she was the one who wanted the FD to be included 
and I guess why, you know?  And he gave evidence that 
when he phoned – I cannot remember what he said the 
Minister 
said 
but 
it 
amounted, 
as 
I 
understood 
his 
evidence, to saying give effect to that, or something like 
that.  So he was not denying that he had given – yet she 
wanted the FD to be included.  So he said he did not want 
20 
to take it too far because he was quite unhappy about it.   
And, of course, Ms Klein also gave evidence which 
might in a way be seen to maybe give credence to what Mr 
Tsotsi was saying but not maybe exactly.  But Ms Klein 
said that although she cannot say who introduced the name 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 135 of 289 
 
of the FD to the list of executives to be suspended, she 
remembers that at the PMG meeting on the 11 t h you were 
going in and out of the meeting making calls, she 
understood to the Minister or ministry.  I think that is how 
far she took it.  I do not remember that she said she head 
you say that the Minister wanted the FD to be included.   
So but I cannot recall what your evidence was 
previously when you came here about when the FD’s name 
was included, if we had come to that point.  What is you 
recollection of how and when the FD was included? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson, then Mr Tsotsi must 
tell us why he bad-mouthed the FD saying that she was 
talking to potential suppliers when tenders were being 
evaluated.  It is a very serious charge for any accountant, 
accountant must uphold procurement principles.  He is one 
who introduced that. 
 
Secondly, what the Minister said was on the four 
areas that will be a focus of investigation must step aside.  
That was directly including the FD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   FD? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Without her spelling it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   As for me going in and out of the meeting, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 136 of 289 
 
it was because some names that Mr Tsotsi raised and 
claimed that the Minister was aware and was happy with 
them was not acceptable to other board members.  Then 
someone asked me to see if I can verify this and I went out 
and phoned the Minister and the Minister said her only 
interest  - by the way, Mr Tsotsi had also talked about Mr 
Sekhasimbe who was in suspension already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Cassim?  Mr? 
DR NGUBANE:   Sekhasimbe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr Sekhasimbe, ja. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Was already in suspension, to come back 
and replace Mr Koko as technology and commercial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Those two names that she suggested 
could not be accepted by board members.  So I went out to 
check on that.  I think the first time I did not get the 
Minister but probably the second time I did and the 
Minister said her only interest was that we consult her on 
who should be the acting Group Chief Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   That is what I conveyed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So Mr Mongezi Ntsokolo was the GE for 
generation was not accepted as the replacement for Mr 
Matona.  That was the conversations that I was having with 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 137 of 289 
 
the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what you have said is quite 
important.  In part, the – your confirmation that when the 
Minister 
talked 
about 
the 
portfolios 
on 
which 
the 
investigation would focus, that she mentioned four. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that included finance. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, as you say, the idea was that 
executives who were leading the portfolios that would be 
10 
investigated should step aside. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, even if she did not mention 
the FD by name, the fact that she said there were four 
portfolios or areas and they included finance it followed 
that as far as the Minister is concerned if there was a 
basis for suspending the other three executives, then there 
was a basis as far as she was concerned to suspend the 
FD as well because her portfolio would also be the subject 
of investigation. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  I think that is 
helpful.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair because Dr 
Ngubane in your affidavit – and I have read this repeatedly 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 138 of 289 
 
to other witnesses: 
“Although the Minister did not direct the board to 
suspend the four executives, she raised concerns of 
her own against them.  The concerns related to the 
war room which she suggested the complaint was 
not 
receiving 
consistent 
information 
from 
management and therefore it could not develop 
strategies to turn around Eskom and stop load 
shedding, the Minister felt that the presence of the 
four 
executives 
might 
hinder 
the 
investigation.  
10 
After the meeting with the Minister it was clear to 
the board that government, as shareholder 
of 
Eskom, required the inquiry to proceed and that the 
four executives had to step aside whilst the inquiry 
was underway.” 
That is page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the minutes – or is that the 
affidavit of …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That Dr Ngubane’s affidavit, page 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 4.17 and 4.18.   
DR NGUBANE:    Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it cannot be any clearer than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it seems in line with your evidence. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 139 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  But, you see, 
even after the meeting with the Minister – because I just 
want the facts to be right to the Chairperson because Mr 
Tsotsi comes from Durban with a request or instruction, 
call it what you may,. that three executives should be 
suspended.  . 
DR NGUBANE:   Three? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Three 
executives 
should 
be 
suspended.  When he introduces Mr Nick Linnell to the 
10 
board, this is after the meeting with the Minister, you get 
insight into what he says to Mr Linnell, recall you then said 
to Mr Tsotsi, Chair, can Mr Linnell please introduce himself 
fully to the board?   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, then he starts introducing himself 
as attorney and so on and so forth and then Mr Tsotsi says 
please address the board, he says on the executives the 
board has resolved should be suspended but he adds, but 
maybe on the three because you were not briefed on the 
20 
fourth one.   
And the discussion unfolds after that where Mr 
Tsotsi says the position of the FD he thinks is different.  
He does not want the FD to be suspended but certainly the 
three should be suspended.  Can you recall that. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 140 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, well I have not seen the minutes of 
that  meeting.  No, it is the transcript because the minutes 
do not reflect correctly what was discussed at the meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay.  So it is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think if you can refer him to the 
relevant part of the transcript, that would help him. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  Chairperson, that could well be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   However, we had received marching 
orders from the shareholder. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And we would be in contravention of the 
shareholder [indistinct – dropping voice] if we rejected 
what she said so we had no choice but to include the four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think the – I may be wrong but I 
think the reason why Mr Seleka makes the point to you may 
well be your earlier statement that it was Mr Tsotsi who 
introduced the FD’s name and he even made allegations of 
misconduct for meeting with service providers and so on.  
It may be that he is putting it in to say but from transcript it 
20 
would 
appear 
that 
Mr 
Tsotsi 
was 
opposed 
to 
the 
suspension of the FD.  I think that is the point he seeks to 
make and he is going to refer you to the relevant part of 
the transcript and then we take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 141 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, he could very well have said he 
does not believe – if he was taking his instructions from 
Linnell, probably that is what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   However, he himself on the 11 t h said four 
areas had to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   The people in charge of the four areas 
which were the focus had to step aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think I have seen – whether it is 
10 
at the board meeting that happened after the Minister had 
left or at  the P & G meeting.  I have seen either minutes 
or a transcript where Mr Tsotsi does appear to take 
different stances in regard to either the FD or the 
suspension of executives.  So I have seen something that 
gave me that impression at least. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I am going to assist and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think we are on the FD at the 
moment. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, with regard to the FD, what at 
least appears to be clear from Dr Ngubane’s evidence is 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 142 of 289 
 
that when the Minister spoke to the board, addressed the 
board, 
she 
talked 
about 
four 
areas 
on 
which 
the 
investigation would focus and that included finance and 
she  - and the understanding, to say the least, was that the 
executives who were leading those areas would have to be 
suspended or step aside.  That is clear from what Dr 
Ngubane has said and I think another witness has said 
something similar, maybe Ms Klein, I am not sure but 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Ms Klein was not forthcoming on 
10 
that one, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe Mr Tsotsi, I am not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I read to them the transcript where 
Ms Mabude is speaking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then Mr Tsotsi responds and says 
to Ms Mabude: 
“Okay, what I understand from you, Chwayita, is 
that there are four areas that the Minister has 
spoken about.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Well, you see, as to who 
introduced the name or the idea that the FD should be 
included in the list of executives to be suspended, unless I 
can find that before the Minister spoke about four areas, 
unless I can find that somebody either in the earlier 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 143 of 289 
 
meeting of the board, or whatever, had spoken about either 
the FD being included or four areas being investigated, it 
seems to me that until the Minister comes and denies, I will 
take it for now that it is the Minister who introduced the 
fourth area, namely finance because the other three were 
there in Durban and you must remember that the board had 
meeting before the Minister came and I think my – I think I 
have looked at – whether it is the minutes of transcript, I 
did not seem to find anybody talking about the finance 
being one of the areas or the FD being included.  
10 
 
So  it would therefore seem that the first person to 
include finance as one  of the areas to be investigated is 
therefore the Minister.  If she comes and denies then we 
will take it from there. 
 
So once we have got that, it seems to resolve it to 
me because once there was that anybody who wanted to go 
along with what the Minister was saying, would say the FD 
is included because finance will be investigated as well.  
So for now it seems to resolve that part for me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely of who introduced the notion 
that the FD should be included. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  In fact, Chairperson, the Minister 
did not name the people by name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, she talked about the areas. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 144 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She talked about the areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, I accept that, I accept that, but 
you made the point earlier as well that when you say 
finance will be investigated it was obvious that the 
executive who leads finance would have to be suspended 
just like the other executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   But also, Chairperson, when next you 
meet Mr Tsotsi ask him why he badmouthed that FD with 
the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, there is - Mr Tsotsi will still 
10 
come back.  I remember that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka is there but is your point that 
Mr Tsotsi wanted the FD to be included and to that end he 
talked about allegations that she had met with service 
providers and so on? 
DR NGUBANE:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Dr Ngubane, you were paging 
through the reference bundle.  Let us go to the reference 
bundle very quickly, page 356, Eskom bundle 12, page 356.  
Now, Chairperson, to make sense of this, you could quickly 
look at page 353 and I will skip other pages.  Page 353, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 145 of 289 
 
that is the black pagination. 
 
The Minister arrives – yes it is reference bundle, 
Eskom 
bundle 
12. 
 
They 
made 
a 
reference 
bundle 
continuation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then you must just  go back to 
saying Eskom bundle what, what, what because I thought 
there was one reference bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I was looking another one.  I think 
speak to Eskom bundle 12 of Eskom bundle 14 or 
10 
whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that it is even for the transcript. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Yes, Eskom bundle 12, I 
am trying to see how is the continuation marked so that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What  page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   353. 
CHAIRPERSON:   353.  Ja, I have got it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have got it, Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   353, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Chair, the continuation is Eskom 
bundle 13, so I will distinguish between the two.  Thank 
you, Chair.  This is the arrival of the Minister which 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 146 of 289 
 
interrupts the first meeting on the 11 March. 
“I apologise to the board and to everyone.  You see, 
this is what happens when you talk too much.  
Morning, 
Minister, 
morning 
everybody, 
please.  
Chairman, I am sitting in your house.” 
 
No, no, no.” 
That is Dr Ngubane.   
Ja, I will sit next to the CE.  I will sit here.”’ 
Then there is no further recording.  The recording stops.  
The Minister has arrived and goes into a meeting with the 
10 
board.  The recording picks it up at the next meeting after 
the Minister has left and it continues here, Chair.  
 
And you turn the page, the page proceeding the 
zoom, and Dr Baloyi is going to ask for a document which 
is being referred to by Mr Tsotsi.  Let us go to page 356.  
So Dr Ngubane is talking: 
“Yes, I must make – probably make use of the term, 
forensic 
implies 
criminal 
act. 
I 
would 
say 
suspending the top layer of the organisation while 
you investigate the courses of the present problems 
20 
is probably less accusatory than us trying to find 
facts about what has happened.” 
So 
essentially, 
Dr 
Ngubane, 
the 
allegations 
of 
misdemeanours you were saying put them aside, let us do 
a fact finding before we accuse these people. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 147 of 289 
 
 
Then comes the point we are debating where Ms 
Mabude is talking: 
“Thanks, Chair, I think the Minister has indicated a 
whole lot of issues that needs to be looked at in her 
speech.  If you noted that she was saying it was – it 
is the basis for the terms of reference.  So if we can 
use that speech as a way of putting the terms of 
reference and from that speech it was indicated to 
me, indicating the critical sections that needs to be 
looked at an in looking at those critical sections, 
10 
just keep the leader in each section from what she 
was saying and if we can, if the company secretary 
can give us a summary of the first part, of the first 
five 
minutes 
of 
her 
speech 
which 
was 
more 
elaborate on what she wants to say to us.” 
It goes on on other things, the focal points, focal areas.  
You turn the page …[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, just…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay? 
DR NGUBANE:   Which paragraph are you on now? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am on page 357 at the top of the 
page. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Ms Mabude has indicated the 
Minister has indicated the issues and the four areas.  You 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 148 of 289 
 
turn the page, Dr Ngubane, to page 358.  358 Mr Tsotsi 
responds to Ms Mabude, says: 
“Okay, I think, based on what you are saying, 
Chwayita, there are four areas , there are four 
areas the Minister has spoken about.” 
And he goes on to say she spoke about maintenance – so 
now he has established that the Minister spoke about four 
areas.  It is consistent with your affidavit.  That is the first 
point.   
 
Here is the next point.  What was Mr Tsotsi’s 
10 
position?  You will find it – we are going to go further here.  
Turn the page.  Let us go to page 369.  This is in the same 
meeting and this exercise is just so that the correct facts 
go into the record.  Right at the beginning of page 369: 
“Okay, so my understanding is quite clear.” 
This is Mr Tsotsi talking. 
“:First of all, this exercise is to be termed an inquiry 
in the status quo of Eskom, right?  Number one.  
Number two, this inquiry, for it to be effective 
requires us to ask specific executives to take forced 
20 
leave or whatever you call it, to be removed from 
then from the situation.  This is not an investigation 
into individuals or wrongdoing by individuals so that 
the media has to get right.” 
Meaning get it right. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 149 of 289 
 
“It is the status quo of Eskom because there are 
definitely situations that one has to look into.  What 
is actually happening the organisation and we are 
asking that this done by non-Eskom entities, an 
independent inquiry, right?  And then we are then 
saying that the specific executives are also directly 
– who are directly involved here would be a Group 
Capital executive, Commercial Executive and the 
Chief Executive.  Well, we said the FD’s situation is 
different, is it not?” 
10 
Then somebody says: 
“No, not necessarily.”   
It is incorrectly written Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Chairperson, but you say that is wrong? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is wrong, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say that based on having listened to 
the audio? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not Mr Tsotsi speaking there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is not answering himself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  So but something needs to be 
done to make sure …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we are going to correct that.  Dr 
Ngubane, can you see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 150 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And this is after the meeting with the 
Minister.  Mr Tsotsi says: 
“Well, we said the FD’s situation is different.” 
I am going to take you to another reference.  Then I will 
take you to what the Chairperson has in mind where Mr 
Tsotsi seems to suggest that all four should be removed 
but you will see what he says still.  So you see this part? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And if you go on further, I will give you 
the page reference, page – let us go to page 388.  388, the 
10 
Chairperson says: 
“Okay, you meet before lunch, we will meet after 
lunch.” 
 
“Chair, what happens to the board meeting?” 
And Mr Baloyi speaks: 
“Sorry, Chair, let risk meet first then we will meet 
up with risk once we get their input.” 
Then you speak and then the Chairperson says:   
“Oh, I think the question is being asked here.” 
“Sorry, Chair, I just wanted to – just want last 
20 
minute…”’ 
And it is indistinct. 
“…in this process.”: 
So he answers the question: 
“The CE, the head of Group Capital and the head of 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 151 of 289 
 
Commercial are the three individuals we are going 
to ask to step aside.” 
Then Mr Baloyi: 
“Because I thought maybe then the CEO and the 
CFO are excluded.” 
And the Chairperson’s responds: 
“No, the CEO is not excluded, the CFO is excluded.  
That is what we have decided.  Okay, can I just 
make it…” 
Then there is an intervention. 
10 
 
Now that is as far as Mr Tsotsi’s position was.  Even 
after 
the 
meeting 
with 
the 
Minister. 
 
But 
when 
he 
introduces Nick, Mr Nick Linnell, which is now on page 
397, and perhaps that is where the Chairperson talks about 
– I had another reference here where - page 397.  You are 
there?  So page 397, against  line 10 – you are there, Dr 
Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say: 
“So, Nick, the purpose of what we have here, Nick, 
20 
is basically the board members.  We had the 
subcommittee meetings earlier but the rest of the 
board is here and basically I explained to the board 
that you had been asked to support Eskom in this 
whole exercise of this investigation, this inquiry, so 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 152 of 289 
 
that certainly the governance issues and taking 
care that this thing is done properly and it is done 
in a manner that cannot be challenged and cannot 
reflect badly on this issue.  Now the board has 
made some significant decisions and the decisions 
the board has made in respect of the investigation 
at that: 
1. The 
investigation 
will 
proceed 
as 
soon 
as 
possible.  
2. Those 
executives 
who 
are 
directly 
involved 
10 
...[indistinct] will be suspended and these are 
four areas.” 
Now that is clear from what we read that is after the 
Minister had been there. 
 
This is first and foremost the Chief Executive and 
then it is the Executive for Group Capital, the Executive for 
Commercial, and the Executive for Finance and the reason 
for that is because it is important that the ability to carry 
out the investigation is not compromised in any kind of 
way, and somebody asked, Ms Klein has said this is the 
20 
Company Secretary, Mr Phukubje: 
“Sorry Chair is the Executive for Finance included 
as well.” 
And the Chairperson responds, he says: 
“Oh yes four and that the work that needs to be 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 153 of 289 
 
done in respect of the investigation must not be 
compromised by the presence of these particular 
executives.  One of the two that from the work you 
have done the committee would like to know and 
needs to be updated in terms of the potential 
charges that are on the table in respect of the 
Executives.” 
And Chair if I pause there you will recall the document 
drafted by Mr Nick Linnell had only three names, do you 
remember Dr Ngubane? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And here it carries on and probably 
excludes the FD, because you were not briefed on the FD 
as far as I know but certainly on the other three 
Executives, maybe you want to take the Committee through 
that and also the processes that need to come into play for 
this to be effected, which included managing the media and 
public perceptions and all those things, Nick – should we 
just talk about those issues then, how you see the process 
going forward.  Then Mr Nick Linnell responds, 
20 
 
“Certainly, Chair”, 
 
Then Dr Ngubane comes in, you say, 
 
“Sorry Chairperson, I think Nick should introduce 
himself fully to us”, 
 
And then he does the introduction. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 154 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you want to put the proposition or 
question to Dr Ngubane arising out of these excerpts or 
have you already put it, I’ve just missed it?  Do you want 
to tell him what you – you’re putting a proposition to him or 
you are putting a question to him? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Dr Ngubane from the transcripts, 
from the transcripts we can see that – well we fail to see, 
there’s no evidence of Mr Tsotsi motivating for the 
suspension of the FD, if anything…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe, let’s put it this way.  From 
10 
the parts of the transcript that he has read, do you accept 
that those parts do not reflect Mr Tsotsi as pushing for the 
suspension of the FD, those parts? 
DR NGUBANE:   Except in this bit, if we could play the 
first part of the audio, of the 11 t h you will find that he said 
that but that has been erased. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay so, the erased part, was what’s 
there? 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
Yes 
when 
he 
talked 
about 
the 
misdemeanours of the Executives. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Chair, can I give you the page 
reference, Dr Ngubane.  If you go back to where the 
Minister comes into the meeting, go back to page 353, 
maybe you are referring to that part because that’s – that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 155 of 289 
 
was the third point which I thought, maybe, is in the 
Chairperson’s mind.  So, the Minister comes, the recording 
stops, it says, 
“No further recording on audio file 9.1 continued on 
audio file 911 proceedings resume”, 
 
Then 
the 
Chairperson 
starts 
talking 
for…[intervenes]. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry what page is this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 353. 
DR NGUBANE:   Alright. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the bottom of the page, the 
Chairperson’s talking, 
“4. If anybody wants to interfere with that, they will 
stop them from doing so. So, there are some 
serious misdemeanours that are going on in the 
business, that’s serious”. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, but that is where the audio starts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think what Mr Seleka is saying, is 
that you see before, where it says, Chairperson, at the 
20 
bottom of that page before that, it says, 
 
“No further recording of audio file 9.1”, 
 
So I think what he’s saying to you is that, maybe 
this is the part where you say Mr Tsotsi talked about 
misdemeanours in relation to the FD because when the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 156 of 289 
 
recording resumes, here, under Chairperson, he refers to 
serious misdemeanours which might suggest that he was 
talking about some misdemeanours and the recording 
resumed 
while 
he 
was 
continuing 
talking 
about 
misdemeanours and that’s why there’s a reference to him 
saying some misdemeanours.  The point is, he just wants 
to say, could it be, this is the part you are talking about 
where there is no recording but when the recording 
resumes, Mr Tsotsi is referring to serious misdemeanours? 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So, are you then 
saying to the Chairperson that Mr Tsotsi, off record, he 
would taken one position and on record took a different 
position? 
DR NGUBANE:   I’m almost convinced, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And nobody told him, but why are you 
changing our position? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well it comes out later on when he’s 
being charged. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the reference to, no further 
recording could mean that at the time of the proceedings 
the record was stopped for a certain period of time and 
then it resumed but it could also mean that the people who 
were preparing the transcript, when they were listening to 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 157 of 289 
 
the recording, came to a point where there was no 
recording and then later on the recording resumes but you 
are saying, you know that, at a certain stage there was – 
this record which is said not to be there, was there? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You listened to it, you know but it’s no 
longer there? 
DR NGUBANE:   But minutes of 11 t h also state what was 
said about the FD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so the minutes of the meeting of 
10 
the 11 t h also support what you are saying, namely, Mr 
Tsotsi did push for the suspension of the FD. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that stage yes, at another stage he 
might not but there was a stage where he was pushing for 
it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Yes, and I was 
asking the question, Chair, could he have said something, 
20 
one thing off the record and another thing on record? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, he did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then I ask you Dr Ngubane, why 
didn’t somebody tell him, but why are you changing your 
version? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 158 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, but the minutes show that something 
was said about the FD, in the minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That come more than a year later, 
these recordings are during the time of the meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   I agree. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he says, the position of the FD is 
different. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it was total economics, you know, 
10 
he was using a spacious argument that the woes of Eskom 
were not the result of inefficiency it was the result of the 
tariff not being given. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you are correct. 
DR NGUBANE:   But he doesn’t say, why did you spend a 
billion rand every month buying diesel to burn it on open 
cyclic distributor, that was the question that should be 
asked.  Why did finance and treasury continually pay 
money which was out of budget?  When we came, we were 
being asked to appeal to the Department and to treasury 
20 
for a bailout, which we didn’t do.  Those are questions – 
he’s talking here in general terms but the real fact that the 
audit, in March 2015, the audit of the previous year put the 
emphasis of matter in the findings of the auditors which 
meant that Eskom was not a going concern. Those are the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 159 of 289 
 
issues that the Minister was concerned about, about 
finance not the theoretical things about, you know, the 
treasury and the finance department is only a recipient of 
money. The question was, how do you spend this money, 
how prudent is the expenditure of money?  When we went 
to the RCA, that is the Regulated Clearing Account, 
wanting to claw back the money that was spent on diesel, 
NERSA said you did not spend your money prudently.  That 
was the decision of NERSA.  So, this issue of not wanting 
the FD to be part of the investigation is eyewash as far as 
10 
I’m concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I was going to ask the question, as 
to what difference it makes whether he wanted the FD to 
be suspended or not. Now that we seem to accept that the 
notion that the FD should also be suspended seems to 
have a reason when the Minister said there were four areas 
to be investigated and they included finance.  So, I’m not 
sure whether it makes any difference whether he wanted it 
or he wanted the FD to be suspended or not, but you might 
be able to enlighten me, Mr Seleka.  From your point of 
20 
view, Dr Ngubane, is there a point to be made that you 
want to make about it or not really?  
DR NGUBANE:   There was serious challenge in the 
finance department.  At one stage the Minister told us 
when she sat down to have her Christmas dinner, Mr 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 160 of 289 
 
Matona and Mr Tsotsi phoned her to say there’ll be no 
money to pay salaries at Eskom, in fact, the report of the 
CEO stated that Eskom was in the red, to about 3 billion 
rand but if the loans came worth 4 billion rand, then at 
least they will have space to function. So, Eskom was in 
serious, 
serious 
trouble 
and 
it’s 
there 
in 
the 
documentation. So, this is what, I think, motivated the 
Minister to say, include finance as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, I understand that if one seeks to 
answer the question, why was the FD added.  I understand 
10 
that there were problems in the finance department that’s 
why – at least according to the Minister that’s why the 
Minister wanted the finance portfolio to be investigated as 
well but my question was, whether, from your point of view, 
there is any significance in determining whether Mr Tsotsi 
was for or against the suspension of the FD? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I think he was …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether there’s any significance to 
either to whether he was for or against, whether it makes 
any difference?  
20 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
I 
think 
he 
was 
defending 
his 
administration because he didn’t want to admit, like an 
ostrich head in the sand that there was failure under his 
leadership, that is how I took it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright Mr Seleka? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 161 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Dr Ngubane to my 
question, whether somebody challenged him, but why do 
you change your version, you said that came later at the 
charges you levelled against him? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, well…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said later in the minutes of 
the meeting of the 11 t h?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, he said that the charges that 
comes later, the charges against him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Dr Ngubane? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   [Inaudible 15.24]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to put the question again, 
maybe or – ja let’s put the question again. 
DR NGUBANE:   We want to withdraw that Chair… 
[laugher] but it was a serious consideration, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, looks like the two of you are 
having some [indistinct laughing] so what is the outcome of 
these negotiations between the two of you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane, yes, the Chairperson 
wants to be drawn – that we pull him into our circle by 
20 
informing him, what are we saying. I had asked the 
question,  Chairperson, if he said something off the record 
and went on the record, said something different, why 
didn’t somebody challenge him and say, but Chair, you are 
changing the version.  Dr Ngubane’s response was, okay 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 162 of 289 
 
but that came later when we brought the charges against 
him, but Dr Ngubane now says, no, he’s withdrawing that 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I just wanted all of us to be on the 
same page. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, let me put it this way, there was a 
feeling that the Chairperson of Eskom was protecting 
certain people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Executives? 
DR NGUBANE:   In fact, if I can read what Mr Baloyi wrote, 
10 
it doesn’t say this exactly, but it has that undertone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell us first, who – from which Bundle on 
what page are you reading. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no, I’m just reading my own things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you say it’s Mr Baloyi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it an email or a letter? 
DR NGUBANE:   The emails that we are going between 
Baloyi and the Board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
I’m 
just 
going 
to 
bring 
this 
20 
undertone…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it will have to be admitted then so 
that everybody has…[intervenes]. 
DR NGUBANE:   To the questions, Chair, why we did not 
challenge him. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 163 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Baloyi says,…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just stop, sorry Dr Ngubane please 
identify the email for us, the date, who is writing to who 
and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   It is 24 March 2015 from Norman Baloyi to 
Mark Pamensky and Venette and all of us …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject matter? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   On the issue of the charges against Mr 
Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is not a long email maybe you could 
read the whole of it. 
DR NGUBANE:   It’s a bit long sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it’s long. 
DR NGUBANE:   But I just want to say the closing remarks 
by Baloyi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know,  
“I see, well done for taking him out, my additions 
would have been 1. The allegations of meddling 
with operational issues such as dealing with or 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 164 of 289 
 
writing to service providers.  2. Inconsistencies or 
misrepresentations of information that he presented 
to the Board in relation to the suspension of 
Executives and possible conflict of interest.  When 
acting capacities were handled, e.g. Generation is 
one of areas on inquiry, he said nothing regarding 
Generation.  The Executive who is not suspended 
and he raised that the Generation Executive be the 
acting CE. He also wanted the person who was 
allegedly suspended for co-signing a contract with 
10 
the Chairman, a contract of the service provider to 
be reinstated to take the acting role of commission. 
For him to release the report that was allegedly 
done about/against the suspended Executives”. 
 
These are the issues that Mr Baloyi raises. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   To strengthen the charges against the 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I’m saying, to answer you, why we did not 
20 
challenge him, there was an undertone of lack of trust 
towards the Chairman per se. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright well 1.  You’ll have to make 
that email available – oh do we have it, oh okay alright 
okay.  Mr Seleka says we have got it. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 165 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Bundle is it in? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 10, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and what’s the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The page number – there’s a string of 
emails, Dr Ngubane should refer you to, Chair.  The email 
of the 24 t h is on page – from Mr Baloyi, is on page 333 but 
the string of emails, Chairperson, starts…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s just get to that page first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, sorry Chair. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry Chairperson I didn’t mean to 
deviate you, I was just explaining why, sometimes you 
don’t challenge people directly but there’s an undertone 
inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s fine, it’s just that I had 
thought we don’t have – we didn’t have the email address 
and the email and then I would have wanted us to make 
sure we have got it but now that we have got it I wanted to 
have a look but Mr Seleka continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, Chairperson, page 333 the email 
20 
Dr Ngubane is reading from, I believe, is the one – the 
second last email from the bottom of the page, Norman 
Baloyi, 24 March 2015, the time stamp is 12:11pm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It can’t be that one because the one he 
was reading from – because he said the one, he was 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 166 of 289 
 
reading from was rather long, this one is not long. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He’s giving you a copy so if you can 
make copies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which one is it Dr Ngubane, is it 24 or 
23? 
DR NGUBANE:   24 I think, it’s there at the beginning – 
what I was reading was right at the end it’s part of that 
whole email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can go to – you can approach 
10 
Dr Ngubane, he can indicate exactly which one he was 
reading so that we are sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  No, just show her Dr 
Ngubane which one were you reading from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just show which one you were reading 
and maybe, from where. 
DR NGUBANE:   This one, yes sorry it’s from Norman 
Baloyi to Mark and other Board members, subject re: 
backup of notice of meeting, removal of Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   The date was 23 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh 23 March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then it’s page 338. 
CHAIRPERSON:   338? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 167 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s where you read the words, 
 
“I see, well done for taking him out”, 
 
I think somebody had said, 
“Please note the Chairman is on the mails, so 
please commit in Committee”, 
 
So, there’s a communicating Committee. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no it was just – he was sending it to 
all Board members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so he wanted to have the 
10 
Chairman excluded from that communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright but the point you were 
simply making was that you may not – other Board 
members may not have contracted – challenged him when 
on record he spoke as if he was opposed to the suspension 
of the FD in circumstances where, during, the off record 
part of the meeting he had spoken in favour of the 
suspension of the FD, you might not have – the Board 
members might not have challenged him because there 
was, already, this undertone of lack of trust and you say, it 
20 
can be seen from, among others, this part of Mr Baloyi’s 
email, that lack of trust? 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and Dr Ngubane I’ve just gone 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 168 of 289 
 
through the email, under paragraph two there’s specific 
references to examples of what is said or alleged to have 
been what Mr Tsotsi said, Generation is one of the areas of 
inquiries, he said nothing regarding Generations Executive 
who is not suspended, he raised a Generations Executive 
be the acting CE, he also wanted the person who was 
allegedly suspended for co-signing a contract with the 
Chairman. 
 
Contract 
of 
the 
service 
provided 
to 
be 
reinstated to take the acting role of Commercial.  For him 
to release the report that was allegedly done about or 
10 
against the suspended Executives.  I was looking to see 
whether the issue of the FD is mentioned here.  That he 
said one thing about the FD off record and another thing on 
record. 
DR NGUBANE:   But, Chairperson, as I said, this 
summarises 
the 
undertone 
of 
mistrust 
and 
in 
such 
situations at time, you let the people just go on and you 
say nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let’s go into these emails now that 
20 
we’re at them because Mr Baloyi referred us to some of 
them 
during 
his 
testimony. 
 
They 
come 
from 
that 
page…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 169 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Keep an eye on how much time you want 
to spend…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will go into the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, alright, because I’m sure Dr 
Ngubane would like to at least finish on the suspensions 
today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
DR NGUBANE:   Certainly, and I would like to ask for a 
break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay well, I have been thinking of a 
10 
break for quite some time, so let’s take the break, ten 
minutes we’ll be back at ten to. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we were talking 
just during the adjournment about correcting a statement – a 
factual position about whether it was Regiments or Trillian 
that was doing work for Eskom before 2015.  I think Dr 
Ngubane you had said Trillian was already there in 2015 I 
20 
cannot recall I did not capture it but you could … 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja well I said Trillian but I agree Trillian 
came later.  It was Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was Regiments.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 170 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you proceed let us talk about 
the way forward.  You said soon you will be moving on to the 
charges against Mr Tsotsi? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What other topic – is there another topic 
after that or is that the last topic? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – let me see what I have.  Then I 
need to put to Dr Ngubane the versions of other witnesses. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that I will simply put to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What they saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so what is your estimate of when we 
might be able to finish – five o’clock or half past five?  I just 
want to make sure all… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of us have an idea of … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  How the road ahead looks like. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair given the – off the mark 
estimations of the past I will put it at five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 171 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you suspect you might be early – you 
might finish earlier? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct I think I might be finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you do not want to raise 
expectations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thanks a lot Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us work on that basis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is important is that I think we finish 
with Dr Ngubane in relation to suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is important is that you are able to 
do justice to the various issues and to put to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some things that some of the witnesses 
may have said about him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Dr Ngubane we were at those 
emails of Ms Baloyi because that leads us right into the 
charges of Mr Tsotsi.  
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you see – and I see you have the trail 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 172 of 289 
 
of those emails and I would like you to turn to – now Chair 
this is Eskom Bundle 10.  We will have to provide Dr 
Ngubane with Eskom Bundle 10.   
DR NGUBANE:    Sorry page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja we were on page 338.  I want us to go 
to 337.  It is in reverse order of the emails.  Thank you.  
Because you will see – are you on page 337 Dr Ngubane?  It 
follows after the emails you referred to us on page 338.   
ADV MKHABELA:  Excuse Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry – yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You need that file – that bundle. 
ADV MKHABELA:  If you have – I have the bundle of emails.  
If you do not have an extra bundle you could refer to them by 
their dates I should be able to follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is this a bundle that you do not have? 
ADV MKHABELA:  Yes I have got 13 I have got 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you do not have 10? 
ADV MKHABELA:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you do not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible to lend him for – to lend him 
a bundle temporarily? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
ADV MKHABELA:  Sorry what page did you say? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 173 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  337. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 337 black numbers. 
ADV MKHABELA:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Mr Mkhabela.  
ADV MKHABELA:   I have 36 not 3 – oh okay sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Black numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  With Dr Ngubane going into this.  I do not 
need to read them – these emails but Mr Baloyi was 
concerned about the charges that the board was bringing 
against Dr – Mr Tsotsi.  So if you pick it up from the email of 
10 
the 23r d on page 337 the second email from the bottom.  It is 
an email dated 23 March 2015 at 12:04.   
 
Because the email you referred us to on page 338 is 
the same date but at 10:58 pm. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He comes back at 12:04 on the same 
day.  He says: 
“Good day, I have already spoken to Ms 
Klein.  The allegation in the letter may not 
stick in the court of law.” 
20 
 
And we know the answers already.   
“Unless we make additions with concrete 
evidence like last Friday’s one otherwise the 
board may be found wanting and acted 
irrationally.  If there happen to be a change 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 174 of 289 
 
of days/time due to 7 day notice proposal 
please note that I am not available in the late 
afternoons/evenings 
of 
Mondays 
to 
Wednesdays and possibly this Wednesday if 
I 
do 
not 
excuse 
myself 
to 
the 
other 
engagements.” 
 
Then there is an email from Ms Klein. 
“Norman we have spoken I concur you are 
free to call me again to discuss.” 
 
Then there is his email the page before because the 
10 
emails are in reverse order.  Page 336.  Now he is writing Mr 
Baloyi on the same date but at 2:25 pm.  And he says: 
“Thanks I took out Company Secretary.  So 
first Nick was endorsed by the board and 
there is no formal process of how media 
briefings of the board decisions are handled 
and there is a leak of information from DPE 
to the media.  Can we still pass a vote to the 
chairman or the proper way will be to define, 
develop proper process. This is why I am 
20 
saying that none of the charges/allegations 
will stick.’ 
 
Chairperson may I pause there?  You will recall he 
talked about this but without having to refer to the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 175 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That the leak was from the DPE and Mr 
Tsotsi did not know how the leak happened and he said that 
much in the meeting of the 30 March.  You know he was 
charged about the media statement which got leaked?  So he 
is referring to this and he is expressing concern about it.   
“So this is why I am saying that none of the 
charges or allegations will stick because I 
know there was an endorsement of Nick on 
Wednesday afternoon of the 11 March 2015 
by the board and there was every right by the 
10 
chairperson to consult with Nick and the 
shareholder as there is or was no proper 
defined process that has been developed 
such 
as 
board 
first 
then 
Nick 
then 
shareholder. 
 
Unless 
we 
add 
more 
charges/allegations we facing a losing battle 
and this will be a huge embarrassment to the 
board and Eskom.  There is no final decision 
by 
the 
board 
hence 
there 
must 
be 
representations by the chairman.  And we 
20 
have 
every 
right 
to 
add 
any 
serious 
allegation – to add any serious alleged 
transgression before we do final voting on 
Wednesday. 
 
Let 
us 
revise 
it. 
 
Add 
allegations.  Set a new date and reconvene 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 176 of 289 
 
before 
end 
of 
the 
week.  I 
hope 
you 
understand our reputation is on the line.” 
 
So this is I think what you need to tell the 
Chairperson so that he gets a whole picture of where Mr 
Baloyi was coming from.  So he is trying to help the board 
craft charges against Mr Tsotsi that if I use his words would 
stick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if one goes back to the email that you 
read earlier on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Mr Baloyi Dr Ngubane it seems that 
what he said there is reconcilable with what he is saying 
here on the face of it.  Because the part that you read he 
seemed to be saying good riddance.  And saying if he had a 
chance he would add certain allegations.  But when you look 
at this email it seems that his position was the charges that 
you are bringing against Mr Tsotsi will not stick. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will be embarrassed if he takes us to 
court. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not saying you should not get rid 
of him. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 177 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying choose what charges you are 
going to bring against him so that we are not embarrassed if 
he takes to court.  So he seems to have an idea what 
charges should be brought.  But he is saying the ones that 
you are bringing will not stick. 
DR NGUBANE:  You are right 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – is your understanding the same as 
mine that the two are reconcilable? 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And in fact he was even suggesting that 
we 
have 
every 
right 
to 
add 
any 
serious 
alleged 
transgression.  If you have got a serious one you can add it.  
But if I look at these ones you have forget it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember this at the time? 
DR NGUBANE:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair these are the emails Dr Ngubane 
has separately with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  These are the emails Dr Ngubane has 
separately with him.  This trail of emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he furnished them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No it is what he has separately with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay yes, yes, yes. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282

ADV SELEKA SC:  It was this trail of emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we – you are saying we have got 
them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have got them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And let me close with this one on this 
Chair.  Go back to page 335.  Because some – Dr Ngubane 
you will recall this is a communication between board 
members.  Some of them are kicking and scratching about 
whether Nick was endorsed or not endorsed. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Dr – Mr Baloyi comes on the second 
last Chairperson – the second from the bottom.  He says it is 
again on the 23 March 2015 at 20:26.  Now this is a busy 
day on emails on the Monday the 23rd and he says: 
“True 
the 
obvious 
thing 
is 
that 
Nick’s 
presentation was well received.” 
 
I think we did read this one. 
“Was well received and there was every 
reason to endorse him.  I wish this part is not 
20 
recorded.  Even if it is recorded the board 
can always rescind improper decisions but 
most of all we need to ask a labour specialist 
if we can add because my little labour 
knowledge is that you can always add a 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 179 of 289 
 
charge or allegation as long as there is still a 
relationship 
before 
the 
final 
decision 
is 
made.” 
 
And he say: 
“Thanks.” 
 
Now I am not reading any further Dr Ngubane.  So 
that was the exchange.  And I think this in my consideration 
of what was happening this became a red flag against Mr 
Baloyi.  And I think it was the third red flag. 
 
The board flagged this man you understand what I 
10 
mean? 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairman – Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Baloyi is a man of extremes.  I think this 
email brings it out.  He works his warm then he becomes 
very cold.  I understand that – let me put it this way. 
 
I think Nick Linnell would have been endorsed if we 
had handled the procurement process.  But because the 
Minister sent it to Audit and Risk I think they took a different 
view.  I think this is what he refers to. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but remember Dr Ngubane it was the 
board itself that said Nick you will assist TNG and Audit and 
Risk. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  True? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 180 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And after that he gets invited to 
what is that the board program committee and the P&G. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He has meetings at Mr Tsotsi’s house 
with Ms Chwayita Mabude the chairperson of Audit and Risk. 
DR NGUBANE:  Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He has – he is called into a meeting of 
the 20 top executives with Dr Pat Naidoo and Ms Mabude on 
the day of the suspensions. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he is introduced to them and he is 
asked to address them on what has just happened.  And he 
is asking the top executives to give their input into the 
drafting of the Terms of Reference.  When he meets 
subsequently with Ms Mabude at Mr Tsotsi’s house he says 
Ms Mabude the chair of Audit of Risk was now cold refusing 
to give him input from the top executives – 20 top executives 
and essentially rejecting his draft Terms of Reference 
because it included the retired judge. 
20 
 
Now given those facts you cannot brush off that 
easily the fact that the board was actually working with him 
at least a couple of days from the 11t h to the 17t h March 
when he got the email that he is no longer needed. 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson he did all those things, without 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 181 of 289 
 
a contract in his hand.  So his position was not finalised.  As 
I say we were in the process of looking at this with the 
tender board.  But then the responsibility was shifted.  So I 
cannot really talk of the Audit and Risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the – the first point Dr Ngubane 
and this goes to I think the first charge against Mr Tsotsi.  I 
do not know whether also the second charge I am not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Both of them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  This is the point.  Mr Tsotsi comes to 
the board and introduces Mr Nick Linnell to the board and 
10 
indicates what he – his role would be.  The board 
understands what the chairperson says as I understand the 
position.  The board has an opportunity if it does not want Mr 
Nick Linnell to be involved with it or to be involved in any of 
its committees or to have anything to do with the – with 
Eskom affairs.  It has an opportunity to say, no, no, no we do 
not want this man here.  Or if it says we do not want this 
man to get involved or do any work until A,B,C,D has 
happened.  The board has a chance to say that.  But on what 
I have read the board does not say that. On the contrary the 
20 
board seems to embrace Mr Nick Linnell as well as its 
committee – some of its committees and then it becomes 
strange when that same board turns around now and seeks 
to charge Mr Tsotsi about this when it was party to it in the 
sense that he was introduced to it.  It had an opportunity to 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 182 of 289 
 
say Mr Tsotsi we do not want this man here or have you 
followed processes before bringing him otherwise we will not 
have anything to do with him.  But does not do that and 
instead seems to embrace him and together with it’s – some 
of its committees wants his input on certain issues.  That is 
what makes certainly the first charge – I am just not looking 
maybe the second charge very strange to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are related Chair.   
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson unfortunately Mr Linnell ran out 
too 
fast 
forward 
like 
saying 
the 
retired 
judge, 
some 
10 
companies like ENS and putting that in the media.  I think 
this is what changed the attitude of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but now that is different from saying 
it is wrong to allow him to work.  In other words you do not 
like the suggestions as a board that he is making which 
obviously he cannot impose on you as a board, you are free 
to reject them and go along with whatever suggestions you 
like.  So – so that goes to the – the objection being to what I 
guess he brings to the table after he has been embraced to 
say we can listen to you.   
20 
We can let you make suggestions about these issues.  
So my question is more about the board seems to allow him 
to 
get 
involved 
without 
raising 
issues 
of 
whether 
procurement processes have been followed and whatever.  
They seem not to have an issue with that but then they turn 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 183 of 289 
 
around and charge Mr Tsotsi and say it was without our 
approval or it was without following procurement processes.  
That is what I have difficulty understanding. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson probably the audit people 
might answer that.  However from my point of view he 
started committing Eskom into expenses with the companies 
that he was now negotiating with without prior authorisation.  
I mean also these companies charge an arm and a leg for 
any work they do.  I think that is where the problem came in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you are saying it seems to me 
10 
that you do not take issue with the proposition that the board 
did not have a problem with him getting involved or assisting 
in whatever way.  The problem is how he went about it. 
DR NGUBANE:  I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now until the point that the board 
may have heard that he had contacted ENS or whatever, 
whatever or whoever the board would have had no problem, 
is that right? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And – well Dr Ngubane costs if you 
talking costs of Mr Linnell I think they had already been 
incurred by the time he came to the board.  He drafted the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 184 of 289 
 
memorandum which you saw.  He drafted the proposed 
resolution which you saw.  You decided to make decisions 
based on those documents and you invoked his services in 
the drafting of the media statement.  He says during the time 
you were on the phone Dr Ngubane saying Ronnie has a 
person – he will give us a name of a person who will draft 
the media statement.  Remember that? 
DR NGUBANE:  But Ronnie had already been appointed as 
the media person. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but – no you were on the phone at 
10 
the board meeting because that one is on record where you 
are telling them Ronnie is going to give us the name of a 
person to draft the media statement.  And you go out, you 
come back, somebody asked you but who is Ronnie you say 
Romeo Khumalo. 
DR NGUBANE:  But that was a board decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is my point.  And at that – at that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you should just say who is Ronnie 
Khumalo or whoever? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that from somebody from ENS or what? 
DR NGUBANE:  He was a board member Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he is a board member okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 185 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And at that very point Mr Linnell says, I 
have a draft and everybody is oh do you have a draft, let us 
see.  And he has put together a draft media release.  And he 
took you through that. 
DR NGUBANE:  That draft … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Except before I am not sure that I follow 
the point because I expect your point to be that by that time I 
thought you said by that time the board knew that he was 
using ENS or whoever.  Because Dr Ngubane’s point is as a 
board we did not have a problem with Mr Linnell playing 
10 
whatever role he was playing.  Our problem arose when he 
contracted certain service providers.  So I am trying… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To follow your point here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No correct.  Because my point was and I 
understand what the Chairperson is saying.  My point was 
insofar as you are saying he was incurring costs and you 
could not allow that I am saying costs had already been 
incurred by Mr Nick Linnell because he rendered the drafting 
of documents prior to meeting with the board.  When he 
20 
meets with the board they are told this is how the documents 
he has drafted.   
If costs was a concern before you endorsed his 
services – the invocation of his services I would expect you 
say to the chairperson, well Chair we even stopped him right 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 186 of 289 
 
there when he gets introduced to us.  We stopped him right 
there saying, how dare you draft the documents when you 
have not been endorsed by this board? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well probably I must say in hindsight one 
can come to those conclusions.  But every time you know 
Linnell looked acceptable until came the actions that implied 
that he was already employed.  You know the statement that 
was agreed was not the same statement – media statement 
that went out.  That was another gripe that the board had 
against the chairman.  Because certain things were agreed 
10 
but what was published was not what they had agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think we – we will get to that charge 
– that charge.  Well I would – I think the point that Mr Seleka 
is making is when the board allowed Mr Linnell to do some 
work starting with him producing his draft media – the draft 
statement or media statement or whatever one would have 
expected that if there was an issue about costs the board 
would raise the issue to say okay now are we starting to 
incur financial costs from this moment or are we not going to 
be charged for this?  Or something like that.  At what stage 
20 
do we incur costs?  That is one approach. 
 
Another approach is where you know that there will 
be costs but you think you know in the scheme of things the 
costs will really be minimal because you are dealing with 
very important issues here so therefore you are saying 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 187 of 289 
 
whatever costs relate to today cannot be too much.  So you 
do not bother to ask or to stop him because you have in mind 
that whatever costs really in the light of the important issues 
maybe urgent issues that must be discussed you need the 
assistance of this person and you do not think that the cost 
will be too much.  So that is what I can think of you know.  
Either you think there will be no cost or you think there will 
be cost but look that can be dealt with later because it 
cannot be R1 million.   
 
And I think Ms Klein said R18 million in the context of 
10 
Eskom really is nothing. 
DR NGUBANE:  No we are not rich – we were not so rich. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I can imagine I mean if I put 
myself in the position of that meeting I can – I can 
understand if somebody said, look I do not – I thought that at 
that stage we would not be charged for that day because 
there was still to be some further discussion about what was 
the rates and that was not going to be dealt with at the board 
level.  It would be dealt with by somebody else or a smaller 
committee. 
 
That 
I 
can 
understand 
but 
then 
the 
20 
understanding would have to be both sides - Mr Linnell and 
the board.   
But another one is to say, we did not expect him to 
work for nothing so we knew he – there would be costs but it 
was not going to be a big issue.  I mean whatever amount 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 188 of 289 
 
could not be too much you know.  So that is why we did not 
bother to ask – to stop him and ask.  That is what I can think 
of. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I am not too familiar with this 
area.  However, from what I understood from the Chairman of 
Audit and Risk is, that Mr Linnell was already contracting a 
company in England in London.  But she can explain those 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...those quarrels which happened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think what, at least for me...  Mr 
Seleka, where do we find the charges?  I want to go to the 
charges so I can... you see, I understand the first charge Dr 
Ngubane against Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 303, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of which bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Eskom Bundle 9(8).  Eskom Bundle 
9(8). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   9(8)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   9(8). 
CHAIRPERSON:   At what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Three, o, three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three, o, three? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 189 of 289 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC:   Yes. 
 
The 
board 
minutes 
of 
30 March 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So like the first charge is: 
“The director, that is Mr Tsotsi, procured the 
services of an external consultant, Mr Nick Linnell, 
the consultant to provide consulting services to the 
company without following the company’s prescribed 
procurement processes of informing the board of his 
actions.  In doing so, the director crossed the line 
from being a non-executive director to exercising 
10 
executive power without the requisite authority.” 
 
Based on the exchange that I have had with you and 
your responses to some of my questions, it seems to me that 
what you say was really a problem with Mr Linnell.   
 
It is not what is written here.  What is written here, is 
what you have not articulated as problematic to the board, 
namely 
without 
following 
the 
company’s 
prescribed 
procurement processes or informing the board of his actions.  
So, what do you say to that?   
 
In other words, this appears to be saying, the board was 
20 
kept in the dark about this man that the chairperson, namely 
Mr Tsotsi who services the chairperson procured whereas it 
is common cause that he introduced the man to the board.  
What do you say? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I presumed the impression that he 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 190 of 289 
 
imposed Mr Linnell on the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but how could he do that?  The board 
was how many members? 
DR NGUBANE:   In other words, he should have first said:  
Send a memo to the BTC or Tender Committee and say, I 
need to employ this man.  Can you do a process of 
procurement whether it is sole source or it is an open tender.  
You know.  Here was a person without any procurement 
process, just suddenly working for Eskom.   
DR NGUBANE:   That is what I think was the motivation or 
10 
formulation of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but let us take it step-by-step. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what you articulated earlier on 
...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...as what was problematic about Mr 
Linnell to the board.  You agree that it is not reflected in this 
charge.  Maybe it is reflected in another charge but I am just 
talking about this one. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I am trying to explain Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   That the way Linnell came, I would say it is 
like a Spaza Shop, you know.  Something just happens 
without proper processes.  I think that is what I reflected 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 191 of 289 
 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but that maybe what is reflected here. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is not what you said to me prior. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I agree Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree? 
DR NGUBANE:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
DR NGUBANE:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   You know, on reflection.  I cannot just bring 
a consultant in an organisation and say carry on working.  
So I think Audit and Risk must have seen it from this light 
whereas to us, generally, he was a fine gentleman.  He was 
really knowledgeable.  He was contributing good thinking.  
You know.  So let us go on with it.  But they are taking it 
from the straight and narrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now you are referring to the Audit and 
Risk Committee and I think it is not the first time.   
DR NGUBANE:   They are the ones who formulated these 
20 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are the ones who formulated the 
charges? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  But they came to be involved 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 192 of 289 
 
with Mr Linnell after the board? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Linnell was introduced to a full board 
meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And he participated in that board 
meeting, in the discussion on certain issues.. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, at a certain stage, was it said 
that the Audit and Risk Committee should be assisted by 
10 
him? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The board did not say that? 
DR NGUBANE:   The ministers appointed the Audit and Risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
As 
responsible 
for 
employing 
the 
investigator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   I think that is when this whole thing... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  But at the time when the 
20 
meeting, at which he was introduced, that is the meeting of 
the board, when it came to an end. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your recollection of what the basis 
was on which the meeting ended as far as his role was 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 193 of 289 
 
concerned? 
DR NGUBANE:   We were busy trying to fix the procurement 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   We had not gone far. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And then the minister came.  I mean, we... 
Sorry.  Probably... let me just speak for myself.  I was quite 
happy with Mr Linnell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   You know, we interacted and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But then came this change. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And then it left my lap, as it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, as far as I remember, he was only 
introduced in the board meeting that happened after the 
minister had left. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is your recollection too? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So maybe Mr Seleka might assist.  
My understanding was that, in terms of the transcript and the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 194 of 289 
 
minutes, was that by the end of that meeting of the board, 
either the decision of the board or the contemplation of the 
understanding of the board was that Mr Linnell would assist 
one or other committee in regard to matters connected to 
this investigation.  Is your understanding the same? 
DR NGUBANE:   It is the same but this was an informal 
discussion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Informal, yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  So 
now, to the extent that anybody could blame Mr Tsotsi in 
terms of processes at that stage, then the board would be 
10 
equally to blame, would it not be?   
 
Because he brought this man to the board and it was up 
to the board to say to him:  Mr Tsotsi, this is not the way.  If 
you want this man to help us, go to whatever committee or 
write a letter.  Or:  We do not want to have anything to do 
with him at all.  But it did not say that.   
 
So what do you say to the proposition that if Mr Tsotsi 
was to blame for not following any procurement processes, 
then the board must be blame too because it did not object 
and it did not say to him use proper procedures. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Except Chairperson that, as I say, it was an 
informal discussion.  We did not have the power, except 
through the Tender Board Process, or later on after the 
minister had assigned it to Audit and Risk, we did not have 
the powers to employ him. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 195 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  But what you did have the power 
to say as a board, is to say:  We will not deal with Mr Linnell 
and we will not allow him to be involved in the board until 
there has been a formal process complied with for him to be 
employed.  You did have power to say that, is it not?  And 
that was not said. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I presume this is what Mr Phule was talking 
about. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And to the extent... Well, let me get one 
thing out of the way as well.  That Mr Linnell was imposed.  
So that also falls away.  He was a fine gentleman, 
knowledgeable and we said as the board:  Let us get on with 
it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The board... [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The board, at least insofar as Mr Tsotsi is 
concerned, this board was not weak towards him.  It could 
20 
take him on.  That is why it was able to charge him.  So how 
could he impose somebody on this board? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, he came and said to the presidency:  I 
want this man to do the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Well, if you say Dr Ngubane.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 196 of 289 
 
Well, because he said the president said this is the person 
we must use.  That might be different if that... if he did say 
that but that certainly is not him imposing.  Then it...  
[laughing]  So do you accept that, it cannot be said to have 
imposed him? 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you accept?  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then here is an important, other point.  
Mr Ngubane, you are saying the minister mandated or 
10 
instructed Audit and Risk to appoint an investigator? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or investigators? 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Investigator, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well or any entity. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Any entity investigator.  Now, that 
reminds me of something.  What Ms Suzanne Daniels says in 
20 
her affidavit about the Melrose Arch meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  I am terrible sorry.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please, do not forget what you wanted to 
say.  Based... Dr Ngubane, based on the discussion we have 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 197 of 289 
 
had in regard to the first charge.  It seems to me that the 
second charge would be affected by the same answers.  Now 
the facts... the second charge says: 
“The consultant commenced with his work to the 
knowledge of the director and without the Board of 
Directors being informed that work had commenced 
within the company.   
The 
director 
was 
aware 
that 
no 
contract 
of 
engagement 
for 
the 
consultant 
have 
been 
concluded.   
10 
Thus, exposing the company to non-compliance with 
applicant’s virtues and procedures.  Mr Tsotsi stated 
that there was no contract with Mr Linnell and no 
payments have been made.” 
 
That is okay.  But that first part of the charge, that would 
also apply to the board when the board, basically, embraced 
Mr Linnell.  It new that that at time there was no contract. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you would accept that what you 
said in relation to the first or your concessions in relation to 
20 
the first would apply to this one?   
DR NGUBANE:   But of course, Chairperson.  Let us not 
forget that Mr Tsotsi claimed that the presidency had done 
all governance and legal work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 198 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   On this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But that document was not forthcoming. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   The exact... the lack of trust then coming 
up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  But in terms of saying that 
the board had not been informed of a contract or it started 
work without the contract.  The fact of the matter is that 
when he was introduced the board knew that there was no 
10 
contract yet.  That the board embraced him until he began to 
come up with certain ideas that the board was not happy 
with.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, sir.  But I am saying, behind all this 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...is the lack of trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  I understand that.  I 
understand that.  I am just looking at for now. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just looking at what was the... what 
was... how strong were these charges?  What was the...?  Or 
was there a strong basis for the charges?  Were they...?  
Was there no basis for the charges?   
 
That is what I am looking at.  So that is how I look at it.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 199 of 289 
 
But I understand what you are saying the lack of trust which 
you emphasised even much earlier.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Quickly on this.  The 
transcript Dr Ngubane shows, Eskom Bundle 12, page 424.  
For Dr Ngubane.  424 is captured there, saying: 
“Well, can I suggest that we have taken a decision 
to suspend the people.  And you then lead the 
committee that is dealing with these matters.  What 
10 
is the way forward?   
I mean, arguing all these things, whether it is 
voluntarily or what.  We have taken the decision to 
suspend the individuals.” 
 
Then Mr Linnell comes in and you addressing him when 
you say: 
“Can you then lead the committee that is dealing 
with these matters?” 
 
That is one.  Number two ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That seems to link with what I was saying 
20 
earlier on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When I said, my impression was that at 
the end of the board meeting, the contemplation was that Mr 
Linnell would continue assisting or would assist other 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 200 of 289 
 
committees.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  And it is confirmed by the 
chairperson.  Then he specifically mentions the committees.  
He mentions P&G.   
“There is also people in Governance Committee 
which committee would be doing the suspension 
issues.   
Audit and Risk will be doing the operational work 
10 
around the investigation itself but the People in 
Governance has to do the substantive HR issue.   
In other words, recall each of the executives.  Tell 
them, is there any reason not to suspend you?   
That process, we would like you to assist as well.   
 
Mr Linnell says:  Certainly, I can.  And to you he... You 
know, his response to you.  That is where he explains his 
reputation as an individual versus a lawyer who will still get 
clients elsewhere.  And you say to him: 
“But Nick, we are contracting with you.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I was saying that as an individual.  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 201 of 289 
 
[laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  But of course, you appreciate 
that, at least part of the reason why I am looking into these 
charges in a way that I am doing and that is part of why I 
think Mr Seleka is doing the same, is because for me it does 
look quite strange how the board turns on Mr Tsotsi, you 
know.   
 
We will look at the other charges but if you take these 
first two.  You have a situation where he did not do things 
behind the board’s back.  He brought the man to the board, 
10 
introduced him and the man spoke.  The board was happy 
with this man.  Was happy to work with this man.   
 
And then, but now the board turns around a few days 
later and says:  You brought this man without procurement 
processes, without the approval of the board.  It sounds 
strange.  [laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I presume that is how families break 
up.  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Continue Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, we can come to charge three in a 
20 
short while. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But look at how Mr Tsotsi addresses 
charge four and five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Charge? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 202 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Charge four and five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, let us hear first what charge 
four says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Charge four says: 
“The company... 
 
That is page 304. 
“The company is in the process of establishing the 
inquiry and addendums... 
 
Or: 
“...and the director’s actions, put the integrity of the 
10 
process in the inquiry itself at risk.  The director’s 
conduct has undermined the reputation of the 
board.” 
 
And that is how he addressed you, Dr Ngubane.  He 
says: 
“Mr Tsotsi stated that the idea of the inquiry had 
been accepted by the board.   
Therefore, 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
what 
this 
accusation was about as well as all the internal 
actions around it.   
20 
He had never done anything alone and had only 
introduced Mr Linnell.  All other actions had been 
done by the board.   
He had voluntarily consulted the board with the view 
that he was carrying out the instruction of the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 203 of 289 
 
Minister of DPE.” 
DR NGUBANE:   But I presume that will come clearer when 
they discuss the media statement, in that, people’s names 
were mentioned in the media statement which had not been 
approved by Audit and Risk and this created an expectation.   
 
On top of that, Mr Linnell had said that Mr Tsotsi would 
oversee the inquiry.  Those are some of the issues that came 
up in that discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now that you have talked about charge 
four. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us deal with it.  Ja.   
DR NGUBANE:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I want to be clear.  I do not want 
to say you said this if you did not say that.  So charge four 
says: 
“The company is in the process of establishing the 
inquiry and the director’s actions put the integrity of 
the process and inquiry itself at risk.  The director’s 
conduct has undermined the reputation of the 
20 
board.” 
 
What conduct on the part of or what actions on the part 
of the director and what conduct on part of the director, that 
is Mr Tsotsi, is being talked about in this charge? 
DR NGUBANE:   The fact that he is going to oversee the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 204 of 289 
 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   When it is very clear that no board member 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...must ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oversee. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...interfere or oversee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   It must be an external independent 
10 
investigator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, this is what this charge is talking 
about? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is what it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is that only that or something else 
as far as you recall? 
DR NGUBANE:   Even the Department of Public... I think the 
Communication people in Public Enterprises called him about 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   That is was endangering the credibility 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ..of the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay.  Basically, there is the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 205 of 289 
 
idea that he would oversee the investigation. 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he could not oversee the investigation 
unless it was the board which decided that he was going to 
oversee the investigation, is it not?  He could not take it 
upon himself. 
DR NGUBANE:   But he never asked the board about that 
authorisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he had this idea.  And what did 
he do?  Did he act on this idea?   
10 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no.  The problem is that this went out 
into the public space. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, which might mean, it might be 
a duplication of the other charge then that talks about the 
releasing of the statement because of the media statement. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it may be that it is a splitting of 
charges.  I am not sure.  But Mr Seleka, you take it from 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Well, the problem 
20 
with charge four is that, it is completely silent on what are 
the actions of the director that put the integrity of the 
process at risk.  It is completely unclear as to what is the 
conduct of the director that has undermined the reputation, 
allegedly undermined the reputation of the board.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 206 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson.  This is the danger of 
trying to craft documents like this without a lawyer, you 
know.  Because I am quite certain if it was a legal document, 
it would have been taken care of all those. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the Audit and Risk Committee included 
Ms Klein, is it not?   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It include ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  But it included ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she was P&G.  Ms Klein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She was P&G, Chair.  I beg your pardon 
for speaking over ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was she not an ordinary member at Audit 
and Risk? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There was a lawyer at Audit and Risk, 
Ms Naidoo.  Revashnee Naidoo.  She is an attorney. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Oh, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   Probably ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe she was not there on the 
particular day.  [laughing] 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 207 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  But on what... on your 
understanding Dr Ngubane of what charge four entailed.  It 
seems that it was a duplication of the charge, charge three 
or a splitting of charges in relation to the one where he was 
being charged with sending out a media statement.   
DR NGUBANE:   It is correct, Chairperson.  It says the same 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The same thing, ja.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go into that one then which is 
10 
charge 3.  Dr Ngubane, that is page 303.   
“There is the director authorised the commissioning 
of the media statement in relation to an inquiry into 
the affairs of the company with the assistance of the 
consultant without the knowledge and/or consent of 
the board.” 
 
That is the first part of the charge. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, that statement was not what had been 
worked through with P&G and Audit and Risk.  It was a 
different statement that went out. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is... that was the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, when you say that.  Are you saying 
what the P&G Committee said?  Or is it what you know for 
sure?  I am asking because Ms Klein was asked this 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 208 of 289 
 
question because she also said, the media statement that 
went out ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was different from the media statement 
that the P& G Committee had approved.  But Mr Seleka drew 
her attention to the relevant statement or statements.  I 
cannot remember.   
 
But in the end, it seemed that the statement that went 
out was or may have been the statement that was approved.   
 
So I am just asking whether, when you say the two were 
10 
different.  Is it what the P&G Committee reported to the 
board and the board then worked on that basis?   
 
Or is something you know for sure that the two were 
different? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I was told Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were told?  Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka, do 
you want to take it from there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So that first part that 
he commissioned a media statement in relation to the inquiry 
into the affairs with the assistance of the consultant without 
20 
the knowledge and/or consent of the board.   
 
It cannot be true that statement standing alone.  The 
next one is what you have been talking about Dr Ngubane 
which is the statement which gets ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  I am not sure why 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 209 of 289 
 
you say the first one cannot be true? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I want to hear mister ...  Dr 
Ngubane’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Or 
you 
are 
putting 
the 
questions 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am putting that to Dr Ngubane 
because I have related that, as you were going in and out 
saying you are speaking to Romeo about the person who 
should draft the statement, Mr Nick said:  I have one. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have drafted one. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then everybody said:  Oh, let us see 
which one it is.  Let us see here.  You can work through that 
statement.  That the board then knew, had knowledge and 
crafted the statement with him.  That standing alone cannot 
be correct.   
DR NGUBANE:   But the statement that they put out was 
different.  That is what I was told.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   It is not what had been agreed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay but that is the second part of the 
charge. 
DR NGUBANE:   They ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, why do you say second part?  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 210 of 289 
 
Because the first part also refers to the commissioning of a 
media statement or you... the commissioning in that context 
means approving? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As oppose to releasing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Briefing him to do a media statement.  
Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think that is what... so you are 
10 
saying that first statement in charge three says the director 
authorised... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it can be him authorising in the first 
place because the board did that.  Two, the commissioning, 
which is the drafting of the statement, the Board does it with 
him.   Now 3, the charge is not saying the statement that 
you drafted is different from the one we told you to draft, 
agreed with you to draft, on the drafting side.  Those are 
the drafting side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe let us put it this way.  Do 
20 
you accept that the board did approve or direct that a 
media statement be prepared? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct, okay.  Do you accept 
that the board contemplated that Mr Linnell would play a 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 211 of 289 
 
role in the preparation of that statement. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then, Chair, we can go to the next 
point.  Thank you, Chair.    
“This media statement consequently fell into the 
public domain.  The media statement contained 
numerous inaccuracies and misinformation which 
may lead to the company facing potential legal 
action from third parties named therein.” 
10 
Dr Ngubane, the first part is, the emails exchanged 
between – that you referred us to, between the board and 
Mr Baloyi, he talks about the leak coming from the DPE 
side.  Ms Klein testified – I think she writes that also in her 
affidavit, that the media statement was leaked.  Mr Baloyi 
says the leak was from the side of the DPE and he 
concerns about this charge. 
DR NGUBANE:   If someone leaks a wrong statement, well 
it does not matter who leaks it.  If I draft a statement that 
claims things that are not true, when someone leaks it, I 
20 
am still responsible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, you have to be clear in 
your mind what the objectionable conduct is on the part of 
the person concerned.  Are you charging the person with 
including in the statement certain things that he should not 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 212 of 289 
 
have included?  That is one thing.  Or are you charging the 
person with leaking the document to the media?  That is 
another thing.  Or are you charging the person with both?  
You see?  So I could include certain things in a statement 
which has not been approved but because I think they are 
good things to include but I intend to take it to the board 
and get – and see if they approve and then once they have 
approved I can then send out to the media but I could 
include things that have not been approved by the board in 
the statement with a view that I will release it without the 
10 
board having approved these other things that I have 
included and I will release it to the media for whatever 
purpose, having approved these other things that I have 
included and I will release it to the media for whatever 
purpose, you know, if I have a purpose, that is that.   
 
Now it is also possible that having included in a 
draft statement certain things that I was still going to take 
to the board, I get out of the office for 30 minutes, 15 
minutes, somebody comes in, sees the statement, takes it, 
makes a copy, goes out and then decides this is what they 
20 
will do, leak it.  That is just for argument’s sake.   
 
So it is possible that somebody other than the 
drafter might leak it.  It just depends who had access to it, 
when.   So if also you want to charge the drafter with 
negligence, that is also one thing.  If you want to charge 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 213 of 289 
 
the drafter with intentional conduct in leaking it, that is 
another thing.  You might say you were negligent, you 
should never have left the office without locking it if it had 
this kind of important document when you knew people 
come in and out of your office.  That is something. 
 
So the question is, which one was he being charged 
with? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, the issue comes with a level of trust 
because I can draw up a statement and leak it myself, so… 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, you have got to have a 
10 
purpose of reason.  One of the questions I asked Ms Klein, 
when she was saying the Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi, leaked 
the statement was but why would the Chairperson do that?  
Chairperson of the board, he knows that the board needs 
to approve the statement, why would – what would he be 
seeking to achieve because it might be a matter of a few 
minutes or an hour or two, then the board will have 
approved and what he sent out is what has been approved 
by the board.  What is it that he would have been in a rush 
to achieve and do something like that? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I cannot really say this, but in my 
opinion, the board did not believe this was an accidental 
leak. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if the board did not believe it was an 
accidental leak, I would have expected it to at least apply 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 214 of 289 
 
its mind to say - before it concludes that it was intentional,  
I would have expected it to apply its mind to say but this is 
the Chairman of the board why would he do that?  If they 
can find a rational explanation then they can accept that 
conclusion. 
 
But 
if they 
cannot 
think 
of 
a rational 
explanation, I would expect somebody to say no man, but 
why would he do that, what would he be seeking to 
achieve? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I think the board would never have 
allowed a statement which said Mr Tsotsi would oversee 
10 
the investigation to go out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the one sure way of making sure 
that he had no chance of ever doing that would be to leak 
such a statement to the media without the board having 
approved.  In other words, his chances of him overseeing 
the investigation are better if he takes this suggestion to 
the board than if he leaks this suggestion to the media 
without the board having looked at it because then the 
board would be furious with him.  So what would he be 
wanting to achieve? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, egos work in different ways.  That is 
all I can conclude. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is all you can say.  Okay, thank 
you.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The one thing, Dr 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 215 of 289 
 
Ngubane, is that the emails which are the 23 r d, seven days 
before 13 March, this meeting of 13 March.  Mr Baloyi asks 
a rhetorical question in the email of 28 t h, one of those 
emails, he says suppose Nick was endorsed by the board 
and there is no formal process of how media briefings of 
the board decisions are handled and there is a leak of 
information from DPE to the media, can we still pass a vote 
to the Chairman, or the proper way will be to define, 
develop a proper process?   That is what he asked. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I think that process had been 
10 
developed because Mr Romeo Kumalo was put in charge of 
the press issues.  So think the process was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka, what process was 
that?  I think I missed that, what was your question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, there was no process, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Baloyi is asking a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is saying suppose we do not have a 
process on how we do media briefings,. on how we handle 
20 
decisions of the board and then there is a leak at the DPE, 
can we still pass a vote of no confidence or should we first 
rather develop a process and put it in place?  That is what 
he is asking.  Dr Ngubane  …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the relevance of that process he 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 216 of 289 
 
is talking about in relation to the charge that he, that is 
that is Mr Tsotsi, either commissioned a media statement 
in relation to the inquiry without the knowledge of the 
board or consent of the board or that he leaked an 
unauthorised media statement.  What is the relevance of 
Mr Baloyi’s question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Remember - well the relevance is this, 
Chair, he is saying that allegation, he is referring to this 
allegation, may not stick because one, and his question 
seems to suggest that but we do not have a process in 
10 
place how we handle media statements to brief the media 
and suppose the leak was made at DPE’s side, can we still 
say Mr Tsotsi is to blame?  Can we still charge him or do a 
vote of no confidence in him? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is his question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but if the charge is Mr Tsotsi 
authorised the commissioning of the media statement 
without the knowledge or consent of the board, that is the 
commissioning part. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that question, on your understanding 
of the commissioning part is not relevant to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is relevant to the question of leaking. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 217 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now he is saying if we do not have a 
process 
for 
handling 
media, 
the 
releasing 
of 
media 
statements… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …can you still charge.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that the leak was not from Mr 
Tsotsi but from the DPE. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, that part I understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the process that I do not 
understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if he says what if the statement 
was leaked from DPE, how can we charge Mr Tsotsi? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How do we know? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That I would understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the process that I do not understand 
in that context because …[intervenes] 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 218 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I understand it, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if you say – I mean, I have had an 
exchange with Dr Ngubane on the question of if you say Mr 
Tsotsi leaked the statement… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, for what purpose? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know?  If you say well, there is a 
possibility 
somebody 
else 
other 
than 
him 
leaked 
it 
therefore we cannot be sure that it is him, that I 
10 
understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I read the entire paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where Mr Baloyi asked a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Dr Ngubane can then make whatever 
he wishes to make in regard components of that paragraph, 
that statement that Mr Baloyi made.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought this one about the leaking I 
though Dr Ngubane has rested his case.  Ja, I think he has 
rested his case on that one. 
DR NGUBANE:   Then that is fine, Chair.  I am not sure 
what evidence Mr Baloyi had that the DPE had leaked the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 219 of 289 
 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine.  We have dealt 
with the leading allegation, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right.  Ja because that touches 
on the board’s prior knowledge even before they make 
decisions on the charges on the 30 t h, prior knowledge that 
the possibly is that the leak could not have come from Mr 
Tsotsi’s side, could have come from somewhere else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It goes the question of who else except 
Mr Tsotsi had a copy of the statement.  Do we know?  Do 
10 
the minutes and the transcript reveal anything, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, they do not, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we can move to charge  5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But, Chair, you find Mr Tsotsi – 
we read quite extensively how he deals with the media 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I say when Ms Klein was here we read 
that portion on page 304 where he addresses the charge 3, 
that paragraph 2 on that page: 
20 
“Mr Tsotsi reported…: 
Then he goes into it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is where he shows Dr 
Ngubane that he consulted with P & G. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 220 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That charges has a lot of things written 
under it, it is a whole story. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is Mr Tsotsi’s address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So he is responding to the 
charge, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let is hear what the charge is first 
then we can talk about who says what about the chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says: 
10 
“The director ’s actions did not meet the minimum 
requirements of the standard of care expected of 
him as a director of a company and member of the 
board.” 
“Without looking at the specifics of the charge…” 
Okay, that is Mr Tsotsi responding.  Dr Ngubane, are you 
able to tell me what actions on the part of Mr Tsotsi are 
being referred to here, under this charge, 5. 
 “The director ’s actions did not meet the minimum 
requirements of the standard of care expected of 
20 
him as a director of a company and member of the 
board.” 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, trying to bring in a suspended 
official to replace an official that we had suspended was 
not proper behaviour. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 221 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is that what charge 5 was about 
or…? 
DR NGUBANE:   It was also interfering with management 
and ordering management to do certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Operational matters? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane, do you recall Mr Tsotsi’s 
– how he dealt with that?  Because that you find on page 
305 and I believe you are talking about Mr Sekhasimbe. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  At the bottom of page 305 Mr 
Tsotsi says: 
“In respect of the nomination of Mr Sekhasimbe as 
acting 
CE, Mr Tsotsi stated that although Mr 
Sekhasimbe was a good candidate, he could not be 
considered because he was on suspension.” 
I cannot be any more direct than that. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, but he is lying, I am sorry to say.  He 
did raise the issue of Mr Sekhasimbe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, sorry.  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is not Mr Tsotsi talking, this is the 
minutes taken and records what was discussed at the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 222 of 289 
 
meeting and you will see on the next page, Dr Ngubane, 
the Chair gives: 
“The Acting Chairman thanked Mr Tsotsi for his 
presentation and asked members if they wanted to 
clarify on any items.” 
And nobody says to him but you are lying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may be I misunderstanding, I thought 
what Dr Ngubane is saying when he responded before you 
came in.  Just want to follow because I was going to have 
a question.  I want to make sure we are all on the same 
10 
page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I though Dr Ngubane was saying this 
charge insofar as it related to Mr Sekhasimbe sought to 
charge – the board sought to charge Mr Tsotsi for raising 
the idea that somebody who is in suspension should be 
considered for an acting appointment.  Is that what you 
were saying? 
DR NGUBANE:   What I am saying, Chairperson, the 
nomination of the GE for generation would be Acting Chief 
20 
Executive.  When you suspend other GEs, the nomination 
of Mr Sekhasimbe to head technology and commercial, 
spoke of an agenda on the part of Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me try and understand now.  
As you understand the position, Mr Tsotsi nominated Mr 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 223 of 289 
 
Sekhasimbe. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For a certain position and what position 
was that? 
DR NGUBANE:   To replace Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To replace Mr Koko. 
DR NGUBANE:   As the acting GE for commercial and 
technology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   During Mr Koko’s suspension? 
DR NGUBANE:   During Mr Koko’s suspension? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And the GE for generation to replace the 
CEO who was suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And who was the GE for 
generation, do you remember? 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Mongezi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mongezi? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did Mr Tsotsi nominate two people? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely Mr Sekhasimbe to take Mr 
Koko’s position in an acting capacity. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Mongezi to take the position of 
acting GCE? 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 224 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now are you saying there was 
nothing wrong with him raising those names or nominating 
them, as such, the problem was that the board saw his 
conduct as part of a certain agenda? 
DR NGUBANE:   Because it could not be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it could not be done. 
DR NGUBANE:   So there should – there would be reasons 
behind those nominations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now what was the agenda that 
10 
the board thought he was pursuing in nominating these two 
men? 
DR NGUBANE:   Sekhasimbe was involved with the 
Chairman …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   With Mr Tsotsi? 
DR NGUBANE:   With Mr Tsotsi.  In some issues, probably 
the Sumitomo transformers issue.  I am not too sure, I do 
not have the document in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   He had just promoted Mr Ntsokolo to be 
20 
head of generation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But not including among the Group 
Executives that were being suspended and this was raised 
why not exclude him when generation is very directly 
responsible for load shedding.  So those were those 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 225 of 289 
 
elements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But to the extent that there was 
somebody who was not included among the executives to 
be suspended which the board thought he should be 
suspended, why would the board not on the 11 March when 
it was discussing the areas that would be investigated, why 
did the board not say but what about generation, let us 
include generation to be investigated as well because if it 
did so then the executive leading generation would also be 
suspended? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   That issue was raised, Chairperson, and 
he defended it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the board should have overruled 
him. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well…  I agree.  But he defended it so I 
am sure on the audio that should be there, that defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if he defends it and you, as the 
board, acquiesced to it, why then charge him about this 
20 
because at the meeting it means you, as the board, 
created the impression that you were accepting that - his 
view. 
DR NGUBANE:   But we stopped that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what I am saying is, it was like – 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 226 of 289 
 
okay, no, maybe I am not putting it correctly.  He defended 
it and you left it at that. 
DR NGUBANE:   No but we refused to accept it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You refused to accept it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But effectively, if you, as the board, 
wanted any particular area to be added among the areas 
that would be investigated, it was within your power to add 
that area and if you added that area, the executive leading 
that area would have been suspended as well. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, that is true, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Then, Dr Ngubane, 
there is an allegation that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you moving to put certain things to 
him? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, arising from this, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I am moving on to another point, 
they are related, about the acting appointments, that you 
20 
were on the phone the Presidency and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let – if you are moving to another 
one, I want to finish off with this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You want to finish off this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, Dr Ngubane, my impression 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 227 of 289 
 
and – it is not a final impression, witnesses can still come 
and put their evidence and I can change my impression.  
My impression seems to be that these charges against Mr 
Tsotsi had no basis really, the board just came up with 
some charges and put them to him and got rid of him.  Or 
rather, Dr Ngubane, they put some charges together, 
scared him a little bit.  [laughs] 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I wish Chairperson would say… 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then sent you and was it Mr 
Pamensky or somebody else, sent the two of you to talk to 
10 
you? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it would be better, Chairperson, if 
you said the reasons for suspending the four executives 
had no basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that too.  I have – I think I 
expressed that prima facie view to other witnesses to say, 
you 
know, 
including 
Mr 
Linnell, 
who 
defended 
the 
suspension, but I think I put to him and to – ja, I put to him 
and I think to Ms Klein that I have got some difficulty with 
the soundness of the reason for suspending the executives 
20 
and I said I have some difficulty with the soundness of the 
charges against Mr Tsotsi and I said well, there seems to 
be something also about the removal of Mr Baloyi, you 
know?  So this board was quite busy during this time. 
 
So I do not know if you want to say anything but I 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 228 of 289 
 
am just giving you the benefit of what is going on in my 
mind when I look at this charges and I look at Mr Tsotsi’s 
departure and you might wish to say something. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, the climate created by the 
suspension of the four executives became very toxic and I 
think Mr Tsotsi suffered from that toxicity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, you were saying earlier on it 
would be better if I said the suspension of the executives 
had no basis.  Is that what on reflection you have come to? 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, he has told us that in his  previous 
appearance, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He said that in his  previous 
appearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no.  I must have missed it 
then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is why I am not asking him about 
it, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it might change. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I must have missed it.  No, no, no, 
thanks, let us continue.  I mean it is important to look at 
things as far as possible objectively even if you were 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 229 of 289 
 
personally involved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Especially when there has been some 
time to reflect, it is important to be able to say look, here I 
think there was a problem, here, you know, here we feel 
strong but here we can see that there was a challenge, you 
know, maybe this should have been handled differently.  
Ja, okay, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You would recall, Chair, that is where 
Dr Ngubane said to you if they went to court the board 
10 
would lose the matter.  If the executives went to court, they 
board would lose the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I remember him saying when we were 
talking about why the board the executives the amounts 
that they paid. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I remember him saying well, if they went 
to court they could win and come back but I did not 
understand that to mean he was saying he accepted that 
there was no basis for the suspension.  I thought he was 
20 
saying look we might have thought we are on strong 
grounds but we accepted that if they went to Court we were 
at risk, the court could go this way or that way, therefore it 
was better to settle you know so that’s the context in which 
I understood it, ja.   
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 230 of 289 
 
 
Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   Dr Ngubane I won’t 
deal with the veracity or otherwise of the charges, the 
Chairperson has dealt with that but here there was an 
allegation – there is one that you on phone and now 
moving onto the Acting Executives, those who were 
appointed to act, that you were on the phone apparently 
saying that you are with the Presidency’s office on the 
phone and you came with the names A should not act, he is 
not suitable, D should be the one who ...[indistinct – 
10 
laughing] and you went down the list identifying who was 
the preferred candidate to act and who was not. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson that is a total exaggeration, I 
only consulted the Minister on the issue of the acting CEO, 
as well as the proposed GE for Commercial and Technology 
that’s what I wanted to – in fact the Board asked me to 
ascertain this.  I might have taken long because you know 
getting through to the Minister is not easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know we have to make a number of 
20 
tries to get him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   It wasn’t about names that we were 
coming from the Minister, it was to clarify the doubts that 
we had about the nomination of these two people. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 231 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where did the names of the people who 
were going to be – who had been proposed to act in the 
Executive position come from? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well what I remember whether these two 
people that I went to phone about, the there was Ms 
Venete and Mr Masangu, I cannot remember how those 
names came but I know about these two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and those two came from where, 
those names? 
DR NGUBANE:   I think Mr Tsotsi you know if I remember 
10 
well, because we didn’t even know them, you know we ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, because Mr Tsotsi said when he 
came to testify on, well when he came last time, before 
last week if I recall correctly he said he arrived at the P&G 
meeting after lunch when he was coming from lunch, he 
arrived when the P&G Committee had been going on for 
something like ten minutes discussing and he found the 
committee discussing names of people who were going to 
act in the positions of the executives.  He says he was 
surprised that the P&G committee was discussing names 
20 
because only he and Ms Mabude if I recall correctly knew 
the people who could act, new executives or managers or 
whatever because the rest of the board members were new 
people and he said he raised this to say how can you 
discuss names of people that you don’t know, you know, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 232 of 289 
 
because I think he said I am the only one who can talk 
about people who are going to act, or about these people.  
He then said if I remember correctly, Mr Seleka will help 
me, he said Dr Ngubane responded by saying these names 
came from the Minister, the Minster said these are the 
people who should act.  That – is my recollection the same 
as yours Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson it is as if you have read 
his response and you are repeating it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That – those minutes of the 30 t h of 
March where the charges are Chairperson, page 305, he 
says: 
“With respect ...” 
This is now Mr Tsotsi responding to the charges. 
“With respect to the appointment of an acting Chief 
Executive Mr Tsotsi reported that when he had 
joined the P&G meeting ...” 
 Now this is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if what he says is essentially the 
20 
same as what I have said then you don’t have to repeat it, 
but if there is something important then you can repeat it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I don’t have to Chair, he does at the 
end say he was advised that Dr Ngubane had engaged with 
the Minister of DP who had suggested the people that is 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 233 of 289 
 
the people, the acting people, and Dr Ngubane has that 
paragraph there in front of him.   
 
So this will not be news. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Except that it is important to distinguish 
between two things, I said that he said Dr Ngubane 
responded at the meeting and said the names came from 
the Minister, but from what you are reading it seems that 
he said he was told that it was Dr Ngubane who said the 
Minister provided these names. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, the Minister he says he was 
10 
advised. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes, what do you say to that? 
DR NGUBANE:   This is totally not true Chairperson, as I 
say I phoned the Minister to deal with the issue of people 
we did not want to see in acting positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes.   So the phones that you 
mentioned, two, were they people that ended up acting or 
was it people who the Board did not want to allow them to 
act? 
DR NGUBANE:   They were people that we said Tsotsi 
20 
proposed for those positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   And the Board would not accept this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So Dr Ngubane the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 234 of 289 
 
two positions of the Acting CEE was you say you knew 
about that one. 
DR NGUBANE:    No, no, no we disputed that and 
therefore I could call the Minister to ask if he had 
authorised that this happened and she said she hadn’t and 
she said she was only interested in not being consulted on 
the name of the acting CE, but she had not authorised that 
the CE for Generation should become the Acting CE.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   So who decided who should be the 
acting CE? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   CE?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, CFO. 
DR NGUBANE:   We nominated Mr Sithemba Khosa[?]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so the Board nominated him? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then who nominated the person to act 
in the place of Mr Dan Marokane?   Is that Edwin Madelane 
or ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, ja Dan Marokane was replaced by 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or Edwin Mahlangu? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, that is why I am saying that one I am 
not too clear how it happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, not it is fine.  You don’t – then 
Edwin Madelane, the board nominated him. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 235 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   No.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who nominated? 
DR NGUBANE:   I can’t remember that.  I presume he was 
nominated during the meeting, but I can’t remember who 
came with him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the last one we are left with is 
Ms Nonkululeko Dlamini, you say about you don’t know 
also how she came about? 
DR NGUBANE:   No didn’t. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know that – sorry, did you want 
10 
to say something? 
DR NGUBANE:   I say there was no dispute or discussion 
about her name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So with Abraham Massau as well there 
was no discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So whatever Mr Tsotsi might have tried 
to do he was overruled? 
DR NGUBANE:   In terms Acting CE? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, and Technology and Commission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because he has dealt with it there 
and this is where I want to go to, Nonkululeko Velete has 
testified here provided an affidavit that she had been 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 236 of 289 
 
called the day before by Mr Koko to provide  her CV to Mr 
Koko, Mr Koko who we understand from Ms Velete was at 
that time at Melrose Arch.   
 
In fact asking Ms Velete or Dlamini to come to him 
at Melrose Arch. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well I don’t know anything about that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That later that day in the evening they 
met while Ms Dlamini/Velete was going back home and Mr 
Tsotsi said to her I may be suspended tomorrow along with 
other executives, and there is a possibility that you will act 
10 
in the position of the FD.   It wasn’t Mr Koko, but you didn’t 
correct me.  So Mr Koko meets and he says to her 
tomorrow I may be suspended along with other executives 
and there is a possibility that you will act in the position of 
the FD. 
DR NGUBANE:   But the suspensions for the three came 
with Mr Linnell and Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Seleka you need to clarify 
what point you want to make and I think it may be that you 
just want to hear whether Dr Ngubane knows anything 
20 
about those meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry sir, what I am trying to get at if the 
President according to Mr Tsotsi had named the people to 
be suspended, how then does somebody else come in on 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 237 of 289 
 
that issue, because it is coming from above via the 
Chairperson of the Board to the Board, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think where Mr Seleka is going is here, 
and he is going to later come in if I am not identifying his 
point correctly.  Ms Dlamini, Velete, Dlamini? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She said Dlamini, she was previous 
Velete, now Dlamini. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 10 t h, that is now before the date 
of the meetings where the suspensions were decided, on 
the 10 t h she says she was called by Mr Koko to a meeting 
10 
in – she said Mr Koko told her and asked her to come to a 
meeting at Melrose Arch, but as I understand the position 
she was busy in another strategic session with Ms Molefe, 
the FD, and other people, so he told Mr Koko that he would 
not be able to and then Mr Koko asked her to send him her 
CV.  What I can’t remember is whether at that stage in that 
– now I think he didn’t tell her then but later in the evening 
after work the two met at a cafe or McDonalds according to 
Ms Dlamini’s evidence and they met for about 20 minutes 
and Mr Koko had not received a CV from Ms Dlamini, even 
20 
though Ms Dlamini thought she had sent it so she sent it to 
him, they talked and he then told Ms Dlamini at that 
meeting after work that they were – he was going to be 
suspended – there were other executives to be suspended 
the following day or in the next few days, I can’t remember, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 238 of 289 
 
following day, there was a possibility that Ms Dlamini could 
be asked to act in the position of FD. 
 
Is that – do you have any idea how Mr Koko could 
have known before the meeting of the Board on the 11 t h 
that there were people who were to be suspended he was 
one of them and already talking about who could be acting 
in one of the positions? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well what intrigues me Chairperson Mr 
Tsotsi got names given according to him by the President, 
how did Koko know that he was one of the people to be 
10 
suspended, because this whole thing came through the 
Chairman and Linnell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the other part which Mr Seleka was 
still going to put to you is this Dr Ngubane that Ms Daniels 
has also testified within Parliament and here that on that 
same day, the 10 t h, she was called to a meeting at Melrose 
Arch by Mr Koko and they – she waited for him in a 
restaurant, he came after an hour or so and then paid the 
bill and then took her or led her to certain offices at 
Melrose Arch where they met Mr Salim Essa, and Mr Salim 
20 
Essa according to Ms Daniels asked Ms Daniels what the 
procedure at Eskom is if you want to suspend an executive 
and Ms Daniels says she responded after she looked at Mr 
Koko and got the impression that Mr Koko was giving her 
the go-ahead that she should respond and then after that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 239 of 289 
 
Mr Salim Essa according to Ms Daniels told her that there 
were four executives to be suspended, either the following 
day or in the next few days at Eskom and mentioned them 
actually by name, including Mr Koko. 
 
Mr Daniels says when I heard this I looked at Mr 
Koko but he was cool, he was calm, he was not shocked or 
anything and then she continues, but the gist of it is that 
according to Ms Daniels Mr Salim Essa on the 10 t h of 
March already knew that they there were to be suspensions 
of certain executives but interestingly his list of people to 
10 
be suspended already on the 10 t h had a fourth person, 
namely the financial director, whereas according to Mr 
Tsotsi and Mr Linnell the two of them had come from 
Durban with three names from that Durban meeting. 
 
Now if or rather Mr Marokane confirmed that that 
day he was called by Ms Daniels and -  to a meeting and 
they met and she shared this information with Mr Marokane 
of what had happened at Melrose Arch, so Mr Marokane 
has confirmed that much. 
 
So now if this evidence is true of Ms Daniels and of 
20 
Ms Dlamini it would appear that Mr Koko may have known 
about the suspensions for the 11 t h and it seems that Mr 
Salim Essa, somebody from outside of the Board, knew 
about the impending suspensions, but also was the first 
person that we hear about who had the FD included in the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 240 of 289 
 
list so when the Minister comes to the Board on the 
morning of the 11 t h and talks about four areas that must be 
investigated and includes finance that is already in line 
what according to Ms Daniels Mr Salim Essa told her then. 
 
So Mr Seleka wanted to put this to say here is some 
evidence we have had, do you have some comments but if 
it is true this evidence it would suggest that certain people 
may have known about the suspension, certain people, or 
somebody outside of Eskom might have known about the 
suspensions even before certain members of the Board got 
10 
to know about it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well the only person probably who can 
clarify this is Mr Linnell, how the information of suspension 
oh, and the Chairman himself, how the information of 
suspension then got to other people, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well one of the things that Ms Daniels 
says with regards to that meeting with Mr Salim Essa is 
that she says Mr Salim Essa introduced himself to her as 
an advisor to the Minister.   So you have Salim Essa, if it 
is true, introducing himself to Ms Daniels as an advisor to 
20 
the Minister and already having a list of executives to be 
suspended that includes the Financial Director then you 
have the Minister coming to the Board the following 
morning and saying the areas to be investigated are the 
following and for the first time finance is included because 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 241 of 289 
 
in Durban it was not included.   That is part of the 
evidence.  
 
Mr Seleka I hope I covered what ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have covered that chair, you have 
covered that.  May I add something to that because you 
see Dr Ngubane Ms Daniels goes further to say that this 
man who has introduced himself as the Minister ’s -  the 
advisor to the Minister she says Mr Essa proceeded to tell 
me that there would be an investigation by an independent 
firm into the affairs of Eskom.  An independent firm into the 
10 
affairs of Eskom, and you said the Minister said to the 
Board the Minister instructed Audit & Risk to appoint an 
investigator. 
 
Here is another point of similarity between what Ms 
Daniels is saying she heard the day before and what the 
Minister says the next day at the meeting because we know 
that ultimately Dentons, a law firm, gets to be appointed.  
DR NGUBANE:   It is too complicated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is too complicated.    
CHAIRPERSON:   And talking about the addition of Ms 
20 
Molefe’s name among the executives to be suspended 
evidence was led some time back – no, no even recently by 
her that actually recently not some back, was led that at 
some stage she had met with Mr Salim Essa when she had 
a meeting with Mr Koko, I think they were at a meeting at a 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 242 of 289 
 
restaurant or some place and they were discussing a 
certain issue relating to work, I think Ms Molefe had made 
a certain presentation to either the Board of Chairperson, 
that was I think before your time, with the previous Board, 
and the Chairperson was not  happy with the presentation 
so Mr Koko said he and Ms Molefe would work on it, but 
then ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s Matjilla Chair, Collin Matjilla. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I am sorry, I am terribly sorry yes, it 
is the second time.  It is not Mr Koko, it is Mr Matjilla. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Collin Matjilla. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was acting CEO at some stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, it is the second time, it is 
just that the one is Mr Matjilla the other one is Machella 
Koko so I think I get confused.   So Mr Matjilla, so Mr 
Salim Essa had spoken to Mr Matjilla and arrangements 
had been made for Regiments, Mr Eric Wood had come and 
put a proposal or an agreement that they wanted to 
conclude with Eskom and Ms Molefe rejected that because 
20 
they said there was no compliance with procurement 
processes, and there was quite an issue between her and 
Mr Matjilla about that.   Mr Tsotsi got to know about it I 
think at some stage also had discussed it, but ultimately it 
would seem Mr – Ms Molefe’s rejection of that may well 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 243 of 289 
 
have caused the agreement not be proceeded with, but it 
may well be that if it is true that Mr Essa in his list had Ms 
Molefe added as one of the executives to be suspended in 
circumstances where at the Durban meeting her name was 
not included it may well be that Mr Essa remembered that 
this financial director was problematic previously, so she 
needs to be suspended.   
 
You might not able to say anything but we are 
mentioning all of these things, certainly I am mentioning 
them because they may go to the point of whether there 
10 
were people outside of Eskom, outside of the Board who 
were influencing decisions or who were ...[indistinct] 
certain decisions to be taken inside Eskom, we are 
mentioning it because it is part of their picture, yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dr Ngubane in your time, let’s deal with 
this because the terms of reference by Mr Linnell they had 
a retired judge as proposed.  The proposition to have a law 
firm doesn’t have that aspect so the retired judge seemed 
to have come from Mr Linnell, his terms of reference are 
rejected ultimately and he says one of the reasons is on 
20 
the basis that he proposed the retired judge.  I don’t know 
whether you know or not know about that. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I know that was in his statement, in 
the written statement but I don’t think that was the reason 
why he was not confirmed. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 244 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so he says Ms Mabude indicated 
that the Minister said you can appoint a retired judge, 
that’s what he says, but at Melrose Arch the meeting of the 
10 t h of March ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you want to comment on it? 
DR NGUBANE:   Just a question, is it not only the 
government that can appoint a retired judge? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you are asking? 
DR NGUBANE:   I am asking. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I know that in the documents Mr 
Linnell said the Minister said only the President can 
appoint a judge, I think, I don’t know whether on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Justice or whatever and 
whatever and Mr Linnell seemed to think that was not a 
valid reason blah-blah-blah, well I know that there are 
judges who, retired judges who get appointed to do private 
arbitrations, and when they do private arbitrations they 
don’t get appointed by the President, they get appointed by 
the parties who do those applications or by arbitration 
20 
organisations but if you are going to for example do a 
commission you have got to be appointed by the President 
if it is a presidential commission.  I think you can – there 
are provincial commissions as well in that case I am not 
sure if – I think there have been judges who have done 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 245 of 289 
 
what I consider to be provincial commissions, but I don’t 
know – I know that if a judge is going to perform what is 
called a service or render an assistance in terms of 
Section 7 of the Judges Remuneration and Terms and 
Conditions of Employment Act that requires the Minister of 
Justice and I think the President as well. 
 
So though I – maybe it depends how it would be 
done but that kind of investigation would have been I think 
for me a bit unusual for a judge to be involved in, but ja 
that’s all I can say. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I am going there, the differences 
between the two approaches in the sense that the one 
approach you have the terms of reference which has a 
presiding person, envisaged to be a judge, on the other 
hand at Melrose Arch a law firm is envisaged.  So three 
people, four people, a retired judge a law firm.  You see the 
distinction between the two? 
DR NGUBANE:  You are right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But there is a commonality of purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was a law firm mentioned by Mr Salim 
20 
Essa? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He says law firm Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So he already knows that it is going 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 246 of 289 
 
to be a law firm even before the board meets? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  An independent – may I read: 
“Independent firm”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh he say independent firm? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja into the affairs of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja it does not make a difference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this – but what succeeds seems to be 
the advice of the Minister’s advisor.  The plan that succeeds.  
10 
You understand what I am saying? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I do I mean. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  The Audit and Risk I am not sure what 
process they followed.  I think it was an open tender.  If I 
remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the appointment of Dentons? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was not. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  It was not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was not.  There is – these law firms 
were approached say they solicited request for proposals 
from them. 
DR NGUBANE:  But is that not an open – that should be an 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 247 of 289 
 
open tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I mean that… 
DR NGUBANE:  They solicit proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That seems to have been irregular itself.  
Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  I mean ten people can come with proposals. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Dentons because I do not have much 
time Dr Ngubane Dentons was disqualified twice by your 
Audit and Risk.  The meeting of the 10 t h April 2017 is 
disqualified because it lacked technical specifications or 
10 
does not comply with it.  The meeting of the 12 t h or 14t h April 
2015 
again 
the 
person 
who 
were 
conducting 
this 
solicitization of proposals they recommend that Denton not 
be appointed.  They say Joost – what is that law firm?  
Adams. 
DR NGUBANE:  Adams ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And – should be the one appointed.  So 
on the minutes they say Dentons response was evaluated 
the results of which indicated that there was insufficient 
information to determine that the supplier was technically 
20 
acceptable.  That is the 10 t h April 2015 minutes – minutes of 
Audit and Risk Committee.  Mr Khumalo is there, Ms Carrim 
and Ms Mabude is the chairperson.  Four days later the 
same committee meets and here they say: 
“The committee stated that they needed to 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 248 of 289 
 
understand” 
 
Oh I must read – first read this. 
“Dentons the contract conditions were not 
accepted.  The price quoted is not fixed.  The 
total price quoted and resources provided 
may increase based on clarification sought 
from Eskom with regard to the Terms of 
Reference.  The scope of work may not be 
concluded 
in 
three 
months 
period 
as 
indicated.” 
10 
 
So their contract conditions are not accepted.   
“The committee stated that they needed to 
understand” 
 
I am reading fast – I am skipping a paragraph which 
is important. 
“Commercial reported that on based on the 
above 
negotiations 
outcomes 
they 
recommended the following that the rates 
based contract be concluded with Savage 
Jooste and Adams.  The Chief Executive be 
20 
authorised with the power to delegate further 
to take all necessary steps including the 
signing of the agreements, consents and 
other 
documentation 
necessary 
related 
thereto.  The committee that – the committee 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 249 of 289 
 
stated that they needed to understand the 
following – following the previous meeting 
held on 10 April 2015 wherein Dentons was 
recommended as the supplier of choice why 
Commercial was now recommending Savage 
Jooste and Adams Commercial reported that 
Dentons stated that they cannot cap their 
prices they needed to – they needed to 
foremost understand the scope of the work. 
Dentons also submitted their own proposed 
10 
Terms and Conditions and stated that they 
were not comfortable with the Eskom NEC 
type contract.  Commercial sent an urgent 
email to Dentons.” 
 
Now despite the recommendation this committee 
decides that Dentons – negotiations must be pursued with 
Dentons so that Dentons can adjust its price and so on and 
so forth. 
 
After being disqualified two times.  Did you know 
about that as the board? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  No.  Well the board committees have 
delegated approval authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do they not report back on the full board 
or their chairpersons.  Do they not report back to their full 
board from time to time on their activities to say this what we 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 250 of 289 
 
have been busy with, this is what we are doing, this is what 
we should – we will be busy within the next few months or 
something like that? 
DR NGUBANE:  The practice Chairperson is that they report 
quarters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  When we prepare the shareholder’s report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  But even then it is not a full … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Report. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Process it is just a matter of this contract 
was granted or you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  That sort of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. And then they might not tell you 
whether they followed processes or not. 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would assume them to have followed 
the processes. 
DR NGUBANE:  With the delegation of authority no. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is their decision. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then Dr Ngubane Dentons gets 
appointed by letter dated 17 April 2015.  They say they 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 251 of 289 
 
commenced their work on 20 April 2015.  But that first week 
you will recall is a meeting with some of the board members 
and in fact the board in Cape Town to understand the scope 
of work. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You recall that? 
DR NGUBANE:    Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dentons starts the work which essentially 
gets stopped six weeks into their job.  And this is what we 
came to understand from Ms Klein.  The reason why you 
10 
stopped Dentons work is because the board or Audit and 
Risk ultimately came to the board said what we are receiving 
from Dentons is nothing new – nothing we do not know from 
their investigation.  You know that? 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know that you wrote a letter to the 
Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To that effect. 
DR NGUBANE:  No.  Scope – I mean the – the whole 
20 
investigation was structured in task orders.  Task order 
number 1 would start and it researched or reported on all the 
areas particularly the issue of correctness of information that 
comes to the board.  That work was done. 
 
And when they reported they had covered all those 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 252 of 289 
 
areas and actually proved that the information coming to the 
board was substantially correct. 
 
Now there was no budget for the Dentons work.  They 
could have moved to Task order number 2 if there was a 
budget as far as I understood it.  But because they had 
produced sufficient information on the issues that were 
pressing 
at 
Eskom, 
financial 
challenges, 
failure 
of 
Generation and maintenance, the delay in bringing to stream 
the new build.  You know all those areas were covered. 
 
There was no way we could go on without getting a 
10 
budget for it.  But we are satisfied that what they have 
covered would help us to change the organisation.  And it did 
change. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Over the weekend because we went 
and did a search Dr Ngubane after we heard the testimony of 
Ms Klein.  Ms Klein’s testimony was unequivocal and she 
repeated this to the board – to the Chairperson that the view 
was that there was no new information coming from the 
investigation. 
 
There is a letter we have obtained and I – I see it has 
20 
not been included Chairperson in the second – Eskom 
Bundle 13 which is the Reference Bundle.  I will provide you 
with that letter because there you write to the Minister and 
you talking about – 
“There 
is 
nothing 
unfamiliar 
coming 
out 
of 
Dentons 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 253 of 289 
 
investigation.  Nothing that we are not familiar with.” 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I would like to see that letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Mumbling and talking over one another]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I will show it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Is it – is it here? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is – a copy is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh somebody was looking for it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They will print it out Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We are at four minutes past six. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am alive to the fact that it has been 
a long day Dr Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are we in relation to finishing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja let us – Chair I could finish off in 
fifteen minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And basically those parts where you just 
want to let him comment if he has a comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might not have a comment you can … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just put it to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go through it – put it to him. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 254 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he has a comment he will comment if he 
does not he does not have a comment he will not have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So I should finish then quickly.  So 
Dr Ngubane the impression that gets created here is 
1. The appointment – well the engagement of Mr Linnell is 
phased out. He gets removed. 
Dentons gets appointed and Dentons the intention is to 
appoint it for three months but Dentons only works for six 
months and a bit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Six weeks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Six weeks thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or seven weeks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They say about seven weeks and 
according to how – what I have seen it is even hardly seven 
weeks and they are stopped.  And they are stopped the 
timing of the stopping is interesting because they are 
stopped on the 11 June 2015 and they are told please 
provide us with a report.  From then on they say they 
concentrate on drafting the report.  By that time you had 
20 
signed a settlement agreement with Mr Matona and with Mr 
Dan Marokane.  
 
Mr Matona 15 May 2015 then Mr Dan Marokane I 
think is 25 May 2015.  You are still negotiating with Ms 
Tsholofelo Molefe. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 255 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well you know if I remember well Dentons 
officially stops somewhere in July. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but in their report they explain.  You, 
the board said on the 11 June 2015 received instructions 
from you that provide us with a draft report.  Then they no 
longer do the investigation.  They concentrate on drafting the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they – after the six week – seven weeks 
they were preparing their report until sometime in July? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In July. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words what they are saying is 
initially you as the board said three months. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess that three months would be 
part investigation and part preparation of the report?  But 
they say within six or seven weeks of them having started 
investigations the board told them to stop and prepare their 
report.  And now that is like that – the investigation they had 
done had taken less than half – or maybe it had taken half 
the period… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well [00:14:14] 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had taken less than half the period. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of three months.  Am I right?  My 
mathematic might be. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 256 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but your thought – the principle in 
your idea Chair is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The investigation took less than half of 
the period that was agreed with them which is three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is what the Chair is saying. 
DR NGUBANE:  But they finished Task order number 1 – 
they completed that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  The report they produced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the idea would be that if you had 
told them you have three months to finish this job.  Finishing 
the job included submitting their reports.  You as the board 
would have no business going to them within that period 
saying stop what – stop what and prepare the report.  
Because the period you would have given them your interest 
would simply be we want a report by the expiry of three 
months.  So whether they used most of the three months 
investigating and less of the time in preparing the report or 
20 
most of the time preparing the report and less time 
investigation you said to them you have three months to do 
the job and the job means investigating and submitting a 
report.  But now you as the board came back to them and 
said, stop investigating now, prepare your report. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 257 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it is difficult to answer that without 
going back to the documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   They were not reporting to the board 
directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   They were reporting to Audit and Risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think Ms Klein’s evidence was along 
10 
the lines that I am suggesting, namely... or that Mr Seleka is 
saying but at the end of seven weeks after they had started, 
whether it is the board or Audit and Risk on behalf of the 
board but one of them said stop the investigating now.  
Prepare your report.  And then they prepared their reports. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, if I remember well.  I think 
there was also the issue of money.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   I am not sure about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   But I think Audit and Risk can answer that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  Seemingly, somewhere the issue of 
money crept in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 258 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I did not want to belabour the point 
about Dentons’ report but according to Dentons in the 
Reference 
Bundle, 
Eskom 
Bundle 
13, 
the 
affidavit 
is 
contained there.  And Mr Noor Kapdi specifically says that: 
“We were not able to full investigate aspects of the 
terms of reference relating to national key points.  
IN addition, we were not able to corroborate and 
verify certain information provided to us in the 
course of interviews and in certain reports that were 
provided to us.” 
10 
 
But we have dealt with the contents of the report when 
you were here the first time. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That it was a mid-point report.  
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  You remember the deep-dive-
shallow-dodge scenario? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But this is the impression that is created 
Mr Ngubane.  The impression is that the investigation was 
20 
never the intention of the board or whoever wanted the board 
take an investigation.  Mr Linnell is struck out.  Six weeks 
into the job, Dentons is struck out.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess you can add... you can add to that 
what Dr Ngubane also said.  Dentons is given the job to do 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 259 of 289 
 
this investigation when there is no budget for this job. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   Exactly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   I mean, we were ordered to do the 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But no budget was provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   And Eskom was in dire financial strains. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, continue Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And the stoppage of the work by 
Dentons, as directed by the board, comes conveniently after 
the settlement agreements have been achieved.   
DR NGUBANE:   No.  No.  No, I really do not think that was 
the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you need to say something about it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if one seeks to test the 
20 
proposition that there were people who were outside of 
Eskom who had a certain agenda at Eskom and wanted to 
have certain people removed and certain people brought in.   
 
And if you test that proposition and say:  Well, in the 
board there may have been people who knew about that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 260 of 289 
 
agenda but there may have been people who did not know 
about that agenda who thought they were just doing their job 
in making certain decisions.   
 
Then you do say, it is quite strange that these 
executives gets suspended on the basis that there is a need 
for a three-months’ investigation.  It is very serious.  They 
get suspended.   
 
And then two, six or seven weeks into the investigation, 
the investigation gets stopped.  There was no budget in the 
first place for this investigation.   
10 
 
So why did Eskom embark on an investigation without a 
budget?  Did not somebody say:  Hang on!  We cannot do 
this.  We do not have a budget.   
 
And then the next thing you say.  So even the 
investigation appears not to have ended up being a full 
investigation that was contemplated at the beginning.   
 
And then you say, the way the executives, those three 
executives depart from Eskom has question marks too.   
 
And then you think about Mr Brian Molefe who comes in, 
Mr Anoj Singh who comes in against the background of the 
20 
evidence that I said I have heard about them which I say 
they have not yet dealt with because they have not come 
here.  They will come and deal with it.   
 
You wonder whether this idea of an investigation was not 
where it originated.  Was not simply an excuse to make it 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 261 of 289 
 
look like there was a good reason for the suspensions and 
ultimately the removal of the executives and then bring in 
other people.   
 
And some of the people made within the board might not 
have been party to this but maybe others were party to this.  
You think about the role of Mr Salim Essa.  If Ms Daniels’ 
evidence is correct.  Meetings on the 10t h of March.   
 
You say:  How come he knows about this because as at 
the 8t h of March, the people that we know to have known 
about these suspensions of the executives where, according 
10 
to Mr Tsotsi and Mr Linnell... Just Mr Tsotsi.  It was not Mr 
Linnell it was Ms Dudu Myeni.  It was former President Zuma 
at the time.  It was Mr Jabu Maswanganyi who was at the 
meeting.   
 
Those are the people who knew about the suspensions 
of executives but at that stage only three, not three.  And 
that at the end of that meeting, according to both Mr Tsotsi 
and Mr Linnell, the former President said to Mr Tsotsi:  You 
go and test this idea with the board.  I will talk to the 
minister.   
20 
 
You know.  So then that is the 8t h.  Then there is the 9t h.  
On the 9t h, at the meeting of the board on the 9 t h, the 
question of the suspension of the executives does not get 
discussed.  And then on the 10 t h.   
 
That means that the board members might have not 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 262 of 289 
 
been told yet about the suspension of the executives at the 
time before the meeting of the 11 t h.   
 
But on the 10t h, if Ms Daniels’ evidence is correct.  Mr 
Salim Essa knows about this thing.  He even knows a friend 
that would or that the investigation will be conducted by a 
friend.  He might not know the identity of the friend.   
 
So you... it might not be very farfetched to think maybe 
somebody somewhere or a group of people were working on 
something 
that 
they 
sold 
to 
the, 
you 
know, 
to 
key-
stakeholders or key-people within Eskom.  Sold to the 
10 
president to Dudu Myeni and to Mr Tsotsi.   
 
And Mr Tsotsi came back.  Well, the president, after 
buying into it, told the minister and Mr Tsotsi after buying 
into it, told the board and then the board made decisions.   
 
So you might not be able to say anything but it is 
important that you should know what is going on in one’s 
mind. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that you can, if you have something, 
you can say.  If you do not, you do not. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, what I can definitely say Chairperson.  
I do not remember a single board member on the 9t h wanting 
to approve those resolutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   And that was the reason a meeting with the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 263 of 289 
 
minister was demanded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And it is only after the minister confirms. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So it cannot be the board members 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...who were generating this stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  It might not be the board 
members because they might not have known about the 
10 
suspensions at that time. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They might have been told about the 
investigation but not the suspensions yet. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question is.  The people who knew 
about suspensions as at the 10t h, as far as we know.  It was 
Mr Tsotsi.  It was Mr Linnell.  It was Mr Zuma.  It was Ms 
Myeni.  It was Mr Jabu Maswanganyi.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But we do not know also whether the 
idea of an inquiry and suspensions came from Mr Zuma or 
Ms Myeni or whether those ideas came from somebody else 
who put these ideas to them and then they liked the ideas 
and ran with them.  We do not know. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 264 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it is a pity that the executives did not 
want to wait for three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because that would have created a totally 
different scenario. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Well, actually it is good you 
have mentioned that because, you know, when you were 
here last time, we talked about the idea of what the position 
was about them.  You said as far as the board was 
concerned, the board had no problem with them coming back 
10 
...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...after three months.  Mr Marokane told 
me about the letters that he or emails that he wrote to the 
board soon after he had been suspended, trying to get to 
understand why he was suspended and so on and so on.   
 
Talking about a milestone that he had helped achieved, 
Eskom achieved under his portfolio on the 6 t h of March, two 
days before his name was included in the Durban meeting.   
 
He said, ultimately, when the board did not respond to 
20 
his letters – I think there may have been two – he came to 
the conclusion that he was not wanted.   
 
And he said because he knew you, he decided to reach 
out to you and say:  Look... I do not know whether he said.  
He said it looks like one is not wanted or whatever but he 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 265 of 289 
 
talked about separation or an exit.   
 
He says you adopted a positive attitude towards it.  And 
I think within two days or so or within a day or so, there were 
discussions being held with him.   
 
Ms Molefe said that she wrote to the board and Mr 
Romeo Khumalo and Ms Klein - I do not know whether plus 
Mr Zethembe Khoza or yourself, I am not sure, met with 
her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Ngubane. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Mr Kumalo and Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniel was also there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, she says Mr Romeo Kumalo was the 
first one to raise the matter of why the meeting took place 
and he said the board – something to the effect that the 
board understood or they understood that she had written 
letters to the board wanting to negotiate or discuss a 
separation package or something like that and she said 
she immediately told him no, no, no, that is not what the 
20 
letters I wrote were saying, I did not write letters that say 
that 
and 
therefore 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
she 
had 
not 
approached the board to talk about separating or leaving 
Eskom but she said Mr Kumalo said look, something like 
even though you might not have written with that purpose, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 266 of 289 
 
you know, the investigation might take quite some time, 
maybe we should talk about a separation and that is how 
they ended up talking about a separation.  That is what he 
said she said but she said at some stage Mr Kumalo met 
with her privately and said he was meeting with her in his 
personal capacity but the idea was to try and talk to her 
about accepting settlement or reaching an agreement to 
leave and she says she threatened to go to court to 
challenge the suspension and Mr Kumalo said something 
like you do not want to take on the state of litigate against 
10 
the state or something like that.  But ultimately, she seems 
to have been paid much more than the maximum of 12 
months’ salary that the board seems to have given as the 
maximum to the committee to negotiate with and she was 
given about I think one year six months or something like 
that in terms of …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 18 months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   18 months’ salary to leave, then she left.  
So you might wish to say something but it does not give 
the impression of a board that wanted them back.  To say 
20 
the least it seems to give the impression of a board that 
was happier if they left but, of course, in the case of Mr 
Matona you remember that it was put to you that he said 
he certainly wanted to go back to his job but he was told 
that was off the table.  So we have Ms Molefe who says I 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 267 of 289 
 
have not said I have not said I want to talk about 
separation but Mr Kumalo pushed that line, so we ended up 
talking. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson, what we knew was that 
all the suspended executives wanted to come back – well, 
not all, the three wanted to come back immediately, which 
was not possible because of the process that had started 
and that is the understanding I had with going into those 
settlement negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course if they wanted to come back 
10 
immediately and they went to court because you did not 
want them to come back immediately, you could have been 
advised that if the won you could appeal and the three 
months for the finalisation of the investigation would 
happen in no time and even if you had to appeal then you 
could say now we can settle, you can come back because 
we have no need to kick you out of Eskom anymore, it 
would not have been a big problem it seems to me. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Mr Dan Marokane said that he could 
not miss other opportunities and wait for three months.  
20 
That was the gist of our discussion.  So I said well, I will 
arrange that we finalise your settlement so you can move 
on.  That was a very amicable discussion.  I do not 
remember very well with Tsholofelo but I think it was again 
the same issue that we could not get her to come back 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 268 of 289 
 
before end of three months.  Well, she is saying something 
else but that was not my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Of course what does remain is if 
the board – if the board’s position was look, we are paying 
you, you are not suffering any financial prejudice and it is 
only three months and we are happy to have you back, if 
the court decided that they should come back then it would 
be the court that would have decided that and it would 
have decided that having heard everybody.  It would have 
had your reasons for wanting to keep them away but if it 
10 
did not regard those reasons as sound, that would be the 
court’s decision. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
DR NGUBANE:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we ready to finish? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair, and we are at a critical 
moment in our session.  I would like us to finish this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we take five minutes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I do not know about five minutes, 
Chair, let me see if I ask one question …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there one question that you might ask 
and then that might dispose of everything?  If so, ask that 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 269 of 289 
 
question.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you are not sure? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what do you want to deal with? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will paint a picture to Dr Ngubane 
and he can comment on that picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would that be the last…? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That should then end everything, Dr 
Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, as I do that, Dr Ngubane, the one 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will put whatever proposition you 
want to put. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The one executive who went to 
court immediately was Mr Matona.  Mr Matona then went to 
the CCMA. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the CCMA – Chair, I am building up 
to that, it is taking – getting off the way these other issues.  
You write in your affidavit that: 
“Prior to that…”’ 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 270 of 289 
 
Dealing with the CCMA.        
“…I had been asked by the board to attend the 
CCMA proceedings which Mr Matona had instituted 
against the board.” 
So remember last time it was whether you were authorised 
to go there by the board or whether you went there on your 
own, you sat in the gallery.  Well, in your affidavit in fact 
you had said – or have said the board asked you to do it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Kapu writes letters and he writes 
10 
letters at your instance.  Before going to the CCMA, 
advising of the strategy and after coming to the CCMA and 
he places you at the scene of the CCMA, that he was there 
with you.  Mr Jerry Kapu.  I want to be quick – do you want 
to see the letters? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I do not remember that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, please get the letters.  Then 
…[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   But I mean, look, I am not disputing it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
maybe 
tell 
him 
what 
the 
20 
proposition is in the end and he might say that is not true 
or that is true. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or he might say I am unable to respond 
until I see the letters. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 271 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   All I am saying is, you were 
involved in that process regarding Mr Matona’s labour 
dispute, so I am correcting what you had said last time by 
the evidence which is in your bundle. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the letter from …[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   Was it not P & G that was dealing with Mr 
Kapu? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe Mr – I am not sure how 
important Mr Kapu is because you have accepted - Dr 
10 
Ngubane has accepted that he was asked by the board to 
go to the CCMA in regard to Mr Matona’s matter. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he has accepted that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is alright.  Now this is where I am 
getting to, Dr Ngubane.  The executives – negotiations with 
them were taking place in May.  The first  negotiations is 
20 
on the 4 May 2015. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next – well, that is in respect of 
Ms Tsholofelo Molefe in respect of then Mr Marokane says 
he called you around about 20 May 2015, after a silence 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 272 of 289 
 
from the board in respect of his letters.  Around about 20 
May 2015 his contract is signed on the 25 May and it 
makes him effective separation on the end of May and he 
said he leaves on the 1 June. 
 
If you say to the Chairperson the executives wanted 
to come back immediately, at least you can say that only in 
respect of one executive, who took you to court, which is 
Mr Matona. 
DR NGUBANE:   Matona. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you cannot say the same about Ms 
10 
Molefe 
and 
Mr 
Marokane. 
 
In 
fact 
they 
requested 
information  from you especially about the terms of 
reference, we want to know what is going on …[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, Chair …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:    We want the terms of reference. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, Chairperson.  Those letters never 
came to me, I do not know who they wrote the letters to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, at least Mr Marokane seems to 
have written to the Acting Chairperson or Chairperson or 
20 
not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, that not till – the first 
letters are written on the 18 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are addressed to Mr Tsotsi. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 273 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Phukubje. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is neither here not there, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because on the 19 March the board is 
sitting in a meeting and they accept that they have 
received these letters from the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is neither here nor there who they 
wrote to.  Ultimately, it is to you, the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but the point that Mr Seleka is 
making, Dr Ngubane, is the only time that Ms Molefe and 
Mr Dan Marokane are communicating with the board or with 
Eskom with a view to going back or whatever, it is in May, 
is that so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in May, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in May.  So what he is suggesting is 
that there is no evidence that soon after they had been 
20 
suspended, apart from Mr Matona, who went to court, there 
is no evidence that they demanded to be allowed back.  
What do you say about that?  
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I can only talk about the reports that 
we …[intervenes] 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 274 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that you received. 
DR NGUBANE:   That they wanted to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And not wait for three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Which would have meant, if they went to 
court and won the case, then the whole investigation would 
be over. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those reports, who was giving the board 
those reports?  Is it …[intervenes] 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I think it was P & G, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because essentially I was a member of P 
& G but I was not always at the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   But the whole settlement thing was run 
through P & G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But at least in terms of what one 
has heard it does not look like at this stage there is 
evidence supporting those reports namely that Ms Molefe 
20 
and Mr Dan Marokane wanted to come back soon after they 
were suspended.  At this stage there seems to be no 
evidence, maybe somebody from P & G, maybe Ms Klein.   
She did not tell us that either. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Her evidence …[intervenes] 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 275 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what she did say actually – this is 
interesting, Dr Ngubane, what Ms Klein said was that the 
reports that the board was getting – I think she said the 
board, maybe she meant – she said the P & G, I do not 
know, but she said the reports that they were getting was 
that the suspended executives actually wanted to leave, 
not that they wanted to come back [laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I said to her now but you may have 
said the same thing to Dr Ngubane when you were here 
10 
last time, because I said to her but now if they want to 
leave on their own why do you give them so much money, it 
doesn’t make sense to me, because in any company if 
somebody wants to leave they put a resignation and they 
leave, so why give them money. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sir I said we knew that if they went to 
court they will win. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is what you – ja you did say that 
you know and I did say something but I might not 
remember exactly what I said but part of it might have been 
20 
to say but you knew from your side that if you knew that 
you had not done anything wrong number one, number two, 
you were paying them while they were on suspension their 
salaries, so what is the worst that could happen if they 
come back, if the court says they must come back.  Well I 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 276 of 289 
 
have just said now you could appeal and while the appeal 
was on the investigation would continue, the investigation 
ends you say now we now need to keep you away, we 
withdraw the appeal and you can come back, and I said 
well apart from the threat of them coming back it is unlikely 
there would be any financial implications for Eskom, in 
other words any award of compensation from the court or 
CCMA because they were not financially prejudiced, they 
were being paid, so why would you want to spend so much 
money when really all of this could be handled? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course some of this you might say 
well – a lawyer might say look at it that way, but you would 
have had access to lawyers? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well our concern was not getting 
problems with the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay, alright, Mr  Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then – thank you Chair, Dr 
Ngubane if you say they refused to wait, let’s look at Ms 
Tsholofelo Molefe, when you stopped the investigation on 
20 
the 11 t h of June 2015 you are still in negotiation with her.  
You only signed the agreement with her on the 25 t h of June 
2015, so you had a window of opportunity to say look Ms 
Molefe you know we have stopped the investigation, there 
is no wrongdoing in any event in the scope of the 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 277 of 289 
 
investigation against the suspended executives, come 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words at that stage, because 
the investigation had been stopped, all that was left was 
the writing of the report, they couldn’t have investigation if 
they came back, even before the end of three months. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes but as far as I remember the real 
stoppage happened in July and we had to submit that 
report to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but in order for the report to be 
10 
submitted in July the investigation would have had to stop 
at some stage, for the preparation of the report, so there 
were – that’s just speaking in general but we have 
evidence from Ms KIein who says no six weeks into the 
investigation or seven weeks into – within seven weeks 
after they have been investigating we stop them, so which 
means during the time that Mr Seleka is talking about when 
those 
negotiations 
were 
being 
held 
there 
was 
no 
investigation that they were going to interfere with if they 
were allowed to come back, so which goes back to the 
20 
question why was the Board giving them money to go away. 
DR NGUBANE:   But Eskom does that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom does that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing], okay Mr Seleka are you 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 278 of 289 
 
about to finish? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Shouldn’t we finish then on that note 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shouldn’t we end on that note? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No further questions?  That is the note 
then, Eskom does that.   
DR NGUBANE:   I mean there were two people in my time 
who were paid a lot of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, at Eskom? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes, precisely ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from these. 
DR NGUBANE:   Apart from these. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course Eskom also paid Dentons 
what – R27million or whatever. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who is that Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   How many millions, Dentons, how much 
were they paid? 
ADVE SELEKA SC:   Oh they were paid ...[intervenes]  
20 
DR NGUBANE:   But chair they wanted more money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They wanted more money. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
they 
paid 
R27million 
for 
...[intervenes]  
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 279 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Twenty for six weeks torture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no to go to order, test order number 
two they wanted more money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They wanted more money yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   They wanted more money yes, and we 
didn’t have the budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
But 
here 
is 
another 
highlight 
Chairperson, here is another highlight.  If we take Ms 
10 
Klein’s evidence to the Chairperson, which is in this letter 
Dr Ngubane that the issues Denton was coming up with 
were not new to Eskom, if you take that and you look at 
what Mr Marukane was offering to the Board, he says I 
want to help you with the issues that have already been 
reviewed by external parties, if you genuinely want to 
resolve the issues I am here to help you.  If you look at the 
position of Mr Mathona he was giving the turnaround 
strategy, a report on his turnaround strategy in the meeting 
of the 11 t h of March 2015 before the Minister comes there. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   But that is why we did not want to 
suspend them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You didn’t want to suspend them but you 
suspended them.   You suspended them. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ultimately. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 280 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you didn’t want to suspend them who 
made you suspend them?  [laughing]   Well that question 
remains unanswered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Chair let me add, let me conclude, 
because when they are given a chance doctor, if they were 
given a chance to carry on with – now instructed you which 
is the CFO, to help you, Dr Ben Ngubane, in the 
investigation of these issues which are said to have not to 
have been unfamiliar to you, then they would have done so 
without any more cent to Eskom.  You would have paid 
10 
them their normal salary, and you wouldn’t have paid any 
more to them.   
 
Now what you did is this, you kicked them out, you 
pay them for staying at home, for doing nothing.  You get 
Dentons to do an investigation, which on the face of it, if 
you at the totality of the evidence, is a farce, and you pay 
them R20million six weeks into the job.  So you pay 
double.  You paid three people to stay at home, you bring 
Dentons to start an investigation that is never going to go 
anywhere, and you stop it six months down the line 
20 
because by that time the Board had achieved the mandate 
of whoever was directing it to do it, you had signed the 
settlement agreements and you signed it Dr Ngubane, and I 
need to test this.  Ms Klein, in her affidavit, says the Board 
had authorised the chairperson of P&G with the power to 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 281 of 289 
 
delegate 
further 
to 
take 
all 
the 
necessary 
and 
all 
immediate steps to give effect to the above, including the 
signing 
of 
any 
agreements 
or 
other 
documentation 
necessary or related thereto. 
 
This is after she says that the Board authorised the 
three of you, Dr Ngubane, Ms Klein and Mr Kumalo, to 
negotiate settlement agreements of up to 12 months, but 
she doesn’t sign the agreements, you sign two of them, Mr 
Sithembile Khoza signed the one of Mr Mathona. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Molefe. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No I have seen them chair, I have 
looked at them now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC;   Dr Ngubane signs Ms Molefe and Mr 
Dan Marokane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and is it Mr Sithembile Khoza who 
signs – he is acting as a CEO in the position of the person 
who is signing him out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson there was a clause we said 
“and can delegate further” in that resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But she didn’t. 
DR NGUBANE:   In that resolution? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but Ms Klein didn’t delegate. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 282 of 289 
 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She was here Dr Ngubane.    
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what she said. 
MR NGUBANE:   No, you see she was moving out of P & 
G, I think that is how I came to sign, Ms Mabude was 
coming into P & G, there was some movement in the 
committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see when Ms Klein was giving 
evidence I found this quite interesting, or strange, that she 
knew that in terms of the delegation from the Board she 
10 
was the one who was supposed to sign the settlement 
agreement with Ms Molefe and she did not sign it.  I think 
at that stage we were under the impression it was signed 
by Mr Sithembile Khoza. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now Mr Seleka says you signed it 
and I was saying – and then she was saying she did not 
know the amount in terms of the settlement agreement that 
was to be paid to be Ms Molefe and then it turns out that 
the settlement agreement exceeded the 12 months laid 
20 
down by the Board, so I was saying to her, one the person 
who signed must have known that you were the person who 
were authorised to sign, so why did that person sign 
without your knowledge, two, the amount delegated amount 
was exceeded and why didn’t you after the settlement 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 283 of 289 
 
agreement had been signed why didn’t you want to know 
what the settlement agreement said or what the amount 
was, and then she said well it could be that she was no 
longer Chairperson of P & G as at that date and we – I 
think further investigations were still to be done to 
establish whether she was still chairperson of the P & G 
Committee at the time and maybe Mr Seleka does have the 
answer already whether she was or she wasn’t. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I found a different fact Chair, a fact of 
a different kind, that on the 2 n d of July the Board has a 
10 
meeting, 2 n d July 2015, and they refer to what P & G has 
discussed and is recommending to the board, an 18 months 
settlement agreement is referred to, the Board ratifies that 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It ratifies, Ms Klein is in that meeting, 
Ms Klein is also in the meeting of P & G that took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I think she was correcting it that it 
is not on the 1 s t of July, it is the 2 n d of July, whatever date 
20 
it is, it is neither here nor there, but what you see there is 
that a settlement had been achieved with Ms Molefe, at 18 
months, it goes to the Board, the Board ratifies it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ratifies it yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And they use the word ratify. 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 284 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but at least the – because when 
she was giving evidence here she was saying she didn’t 
remember the settlement agreement with Ms Molefe being 
brought back to the Board so I was saying that would be 
strange that, one, that settlement agreement is signed by 
somebody who is not authorised to sign it, two, it exceeds 
the authority given by the delegated authority – given by 
the Board, three, the person who has exceeded that 
authority doesn’t bring the settlement agreement back to 
you to see and the agreement is not brought back to the 
10 
Board to ratify, so – but at least if it was brought to the 
Board that is fine, but what it does mean is that the entire 
Board endorsed the document in terms of which Ms Molefe 
was paid much more than the others. 
 
At a time when to their knowledge there were no 
further investigations and therefore if Ms Molefe wanted to 
come back she could come back. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well some explanation must have been 
given to the board to endorse that settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well the investigations were going 
20 
to – steps were going to be taken to look at whatever 
minutes 
but 
arising 
from 
Ms 
Molefe’s 
evidence 
the 
explanation may well have been this that she said to me 
she was not prepared to agree to leave Eskom on the basis 
of 12 month’s salary.  She wanted much more because she 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 285 of 289 
 
thought that was not enough for her and I think it must 
have been in that context that according to her Mr Romeo 
Kumalo had a private meeting with her to try and maybe 
persuade her to settle, but she was resisting reaching a 
settlement agreement on the basis of 12 months, that is 
why it was increased and the question is why does the 
Board, why did the Board increase that amount, why didn’t 
the Board say we actually have no problem with you, you 
can come back if you don’t want 12 months come back. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson I have said ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have said what you can say. 
DR NGUBANE:  And that at Eskom these things happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughing] but at that time remember 
you 
were 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
Board, 
you 
were 
the 
Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, people can put very persuasive 
arguments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair this is my last. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then Dr Ngubane you say in your 
affidavit, this is under the heading “the appointment and 
early retirement of Mr Brian Molefe”, I just want this 
paragraph.  It says: 
“After 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
four 
executives, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 286 of 289 
 
including Mr Mathona, who was the GCEO there 
was a serious vacuum in the leadership of Eskom.” 
That is Eskom Bundle 9A Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that, I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   After the suspension of the four 
executives, including Mr Mathona who was the GCEO there 
was a serious vacuum in the leadership of Eskom.   Now 
who caused that vacuum, but not the Board Dr Ngubane?   
And when you have a vacuum like that Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know this is a serious matter, but 
10 
sometimes you can’t afford not to laugh at this. 
DR NGUBANE:   Let me say this Chairperson, the script 
was written for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughing] who wrote the script Dr 
Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:  Mr Tsotsi came with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean you have – that is one example. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is another one which we are not 
covering here where apparently, I don’t know whether it 
20 
was towards the end of 2014 or 2015 apparently Eskom 
came 
up 
with 
a 
programme 
for 
voluntary 
severance 
packages and said a lot of employees who wanted to take 
voluntary retrenchment packages could take them and 
allowed people with skills that Eskom needed to also take 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 287 of 289 
 
voluntary packages now.  In any company if a company 
comes up with a voluntary retrenchment or severance 
package to say those who want to leave can leave on an 
agreement they always put a rider to say the company has 
the final say whether any particular individual maybe, or 
they might say the following categories are not eligible, 
because they know they need their skills, but in Eskom it 
looks like from what I have read people with skills were 
allowed to go and after they had gone it was said we don’t 
have skills now, we need a company to do A, B, C, D.   
 
10 
 
So you say what was going on.  It is ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   That was before our time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But this is a mirror image in your time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is like they did – the previous Board 
did what they did and when your Board came you said okay 
“if they can did it, we will did it” – it’s like they did their 
part, we will do our part, and when I say if they can did it, 
we can did it, people who were old enough during 
apartheid, 1980’s will know what I am talking about when I 
say that, but basically the previous Board did its own thing 
20 
about the severance packages and allowing Eskom to lose 
a lot of skills and then here comes this Board, it gets sold 
this idea of an inquiry and the suspension of executives, 
they get suspended, the inquiry starts, get stopped, 
settlement agreements are signed, they are given money, 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 288 of 289 
 
they go and then says now there is a vacuum in leadership 
we must look for leadership, then they go to Transnet and 
get certain people to come on board. 
 
It is – honestly it is a very serious thing, it is 
taxpayers’ money and it is really regrettable.   But anyway 
let’s – are you done? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, in our next phase chair we are 
going to start at this vacuum and how it gets to be 
addressed and we go into the transaction that follow that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the secondments? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is our next stage, Dr Ngubane 
hopefully before the end of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you very much Dr Ngubane 
for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very 
much.  We have taken long because we wanted to at least 
finish this part of your evidence.  I see it is already seven 
o’clock. 
 
We will ask for you to come back with regard to 
20 
other matters in due course, but thank you very much and 
thank you to your attorney as well for all the cooperation, 
thank you. 
DR NGUBANE:   I presume harm can happen despite good 
intentions.  Our Board had very good intentions for this 
13 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 282 
 
Page 289 of 289 
 
country and we worked very hard to make sure that the 
lights were on, make sure that the expenses at Eskom were 
reduced, 
we 
even 
managed 
to 
sell 
power 
to 
the 
neighbouring states.  You know I wish that  the country can 
acknowledge some of the good things that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, well look in the end it is 
important that a balanced view be taken of matters, so 
where 
good 
things 
were 
done 
they 
need 
to 
be 
acknowledged and where wrong happened that needs to be 
also highlighted so that what can be done to make sure 
10 
those things don’t happen again can be looked into. 
 
Okay, thank you very much, we are going to adjourn 
now.  For the sake of the public I just mention that 
tomorrow and for the rest of the week and next week I will 
be hearing evidence relating to Transnet. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 14 OCTOBER 2020
