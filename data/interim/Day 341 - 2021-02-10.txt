Page 9 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   Dr Naidoo the issues 
of suspensions have been extensively traversed before the 
commission.  What we would like you to focus on if really 
on the issues of transactions which is the pre-payments 
decisions that were made by the board relative to either 
OCM Optimum or relative to Tegeta. 
DR NAIDOO:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So just by way of introduction we 
have seen from your affidavit that you confirm your 
appointment of the board of Eskom in December 2014. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:  Correct so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That – could you tell the 
Chairperson whether that was your first service on the 
board of Eskom?  Were you – was that your first 
appointment to serve on the board of Eskom? 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Sir that is the appointment to serve on 
the board of Eskom.  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And when as you speak yes face to the 
Chairperson.  Had you sat on any other board before that? 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Sir.  Chairman my career with Eskom 
20 
commenced 
in 
the 
– 
with 
the 
Electricity 
Supply 
Commission.  This was in the early ‘80’s and I concluded 
my career with Eskom in 2010 as an employee. 
 
During that period I served on the boards as Eskom 
representative, on the board of Motraco the Mozambique 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 10 of 294 
 
Transmission Company, on Wesco as the Western Power 
Corridor Company and I also served in the capacity as 
official on the Eskom Holdings board. Thank you Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Dr Naidoo.  Dr Naidoo did 
you have any relations or interactions with your board 
members – any of your board members prior to your 
appointment on the Eskom board? 
DR NAIDOO:  Certainly not – no one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No one.   
DR NAIDOO:  No one. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  With Mr Salim Essa? 
DR NAIDOO:  No Sir.  I do not even know the gentleman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do not even know him.  With any of 
the Gupta brothers? 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Sir.  Atul Gupta.  Some – at almost two 
decades 
ago 
2003 
I 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Eskom 
Delegation that accompanied then President Mbeki on his 
inaugural state visit to India.   
 
 
In India Mr Atul Gupta International introduced 
himself to us as an investor in South Africa.  He was in – 
20 
coming to invest in ICT and he had then at that stage 
launched Sahara Computers.  And he invited us the 
business delegation to come and have a factory visit – 
Sahara Computers in Midrand. 
 
When we returned to South Africa he had scheduled 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 11 of 294 
 
a visit for us to visit his factory.  We attended that visit and 
he conducted that visit personally.  So that was the second 
time I met him.  That was in 2003 as I documented in the 
affidavit.  Thank you Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Did you have any 
interaction with him during your appointment – I mean 
during your service on the Eskom Board. 
DR NAIDOO:  Certainly not – certainly not.  Even during 
2003 I had no interaction.  It was in a public setting he had 
introduced himself and even at the factory visit it was in a 
10 
public setting.  We had no interaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Any prior interaction or relations with 
Minister Lynn Brown? 
DR NAIDOO:  Certainly none. I met Minister Brown first tie 
when I attended the – when I was inducted into the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  With the former President Jacob Zuma? 
DR NAIDOO:  Certainly not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
DR NAIDOO:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me just give you a sequence of how 
20 
I would like you to lead your evidence.  There is what has 
been referred to as the Cooperation Agreement concluded 
between 
Eskom 
and 
OCM 
in 
2014 
with 
the 
Fourth 
Addendum 
paving 
the 
way 
through 
emending 
their 
agreement between the two entities.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 12 of 294 
 
 
That is on the one hand.  On the other then it will 
be 
the 
submission 
that 
is 
made 
in 
December 
2015 
regarding a pre-payment decision. 
 
Let 
us 
start 
with 
the 
Cooperation 
Agreement 
because the Cooperation Agreement as you would recall it 
was an endeavour between Eskom and OCM to revise the 
terms of their agreement an existing. 
 
That Cooperation Agreement came to the BTC on 
the 15 t h of April 2015.  The BTC did not decide it; it 
referred the matter to the board. 
10 
 
Were you a member of the BTC at the time – April 
2015? 
DR NAIDOO:  No Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were not? 
DR NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The matter then came to the board on 
the 23 r d of April 2015.  You recall that?  You recall that? 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  The board too did not decide the 
matter and I would like you to briefly tell the Chairperson 
20 
why did the board not decide the matter and what it did – 
what did the board instead do with the matter in the 
meeting of the 23 r d of April 2015. 
DR NAIDOO:  Thank you.  Thank you Advocate.  Chair 
Advocate is referring to an operational document between 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 13 of 294 
 
Eskom as the company and OCM as the supplier.  I had no 
details of the operational content of that – or no part in its 
structure or in its promotion. 
 
Chair I want to reflect a little bit on Optimum Coal 
Mine, on Hendrina Power Station and give you a little bit of 
a background if I may?  Thank you.   
 
Chair Hendrina Power Station and as you will Chair 
sorry I was an employee of Eskom so I have been to 
Hendrina many times.  Hendrina Power Station in the 
category of lowest cost producers of electrical energy.  It is 
10 
in the company of Koeberg the Nuclear Station in the 
company of Cahora Bassa the Hydroelectric Station that 
brings us power from Mozanbique. 
 
Very, very low cost power.  The station was built in 
the 70’s and its coal supply agreement then commenced 
with the miners.  And the coal at Hendrina Sir is on the 
ground.  You literally scoop up the ground and you feed it 
into the 00:14:24 that is how simple it is. 
 
It is continuous operation 24/7 365 for many 
decades.  And over the time period almost 50 years it has 
20 
generated a lot of electricity for South Africa – lowest cost 
electricity and that is what gave Eskom that sort of lowest 
cost position.   
 
And it was very much an agreement that benefited 
all parties Eskom, a mine, the community.  Everyone was a 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 14 of 294 
 
win-win type agree.  The design of the power station of 
Hendrina was such that it consisted of ten machines of 200 
megawatts.  So small capacity but lots of it.  So that it can 
take in the sort of very, very low quality coal, virtually the 
ground and make electricity. 
 
And during the term of its agreement there were 
one or two addendums attached to that agreement and one 
of the addendums I recall was the addendum around 
hardship.  A supplier can say to Eskom I have got hardship 
and he can declare hardship. Because the price is very, 
10 
very low. 
 
And then Eskom in its – in its methodology of 
setting up the mine at all initially prepaid for all the capital 
infrastructure.  So that is where that whole pre-payment 
concept comes in. 
 
So 
the 
mine 
supplies 
the 
coal, 
the 
capital 
infrastructure is all prepaid and in all of those addendums 
Chair Eskom allowed the mine to export the higher grade 
coal to international or to 00:15:55 so that they could make 
more cash. 
20 
 
And that gave Hendrina the position of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if I can ask… 
DR NAIDOO:  Please do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it like part of the deal that you will 
charge us low prices but in return we will allow you to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 15 of 294 
 
make money. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the export section of the mine? 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to make up for whatever losses you 
may suffer on the domestic side. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:  But – and that gave the mine an export 
allocation quota at Richards Bay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NAIDOO:  On the MLO Richards Bay coal line that high 
grade coal will then go into the export.  Eskom made that 
allowance and that is part of the- one of the addendums 
Chair.   
 
But again the price was kept low.  And then Chair 
as the – the agreement was coming towards a closure I 
recall the agreement was scheduled to end December 
2018.  So this is a development now in 2015 and the 
Optimum Coal Mine then said I need a higher price of coal. 
20 
They want to reset the base price because there is a 
potential that is a new agreement could be reached post 
2018 for another ten years, twenty years, thirty years at a 
higher price. 
 
And I was part of that discussion at the investment 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 16 of 294 
 
and finance committee and I knew a little bit of the history 
of this all and I said no ways we cannot adjust that 
because then we are changing the design of the power 
station, we changing the whole model that we put on the … 
 
When 2018 concludes you will have an opportunity 
for both parties to decide on a new contract going forward.  
And Eskom can decide whether it still wants to operate 
Hendrina or do not operate.  
 
That was basic where the push came and where the 
resistance from Eskom came in terms of not allowing the 
10 
higher 00:17:50. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well 
the 
hardship 
clause 
as 
you 
understand it or as you understood it at the time was it 
meant to cater for a situation where it would appear for 
example that Glencore did not do a due diligence before 
taking this contract over and it looks like later on when it 
was complaining about the coal price being too low and 
suffering hardship that seems to be at least in part 
because it did not do what it is supposed to have done 
from the beginning because one would have thought that if 
20 
you want to take over somebody else’s contract such as 
this one of the things you would look at particularly when 
you talk about the – such a long term contract is – is there 
a provision in the contract for the escalation or the 
increase of the price annually or at whatever intervals 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 17 of 294 
 
because the problem seems to have been that the parties 
were locked into this price that had been determined a long 
time before. 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when it complained about 
hardship one gets the impression but if you had done your 
– your homework and you had raised this issue you would 
not be in this situation. 
DR NAIDOO:  Certainly Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you can enlighten me maybe there is 
10 
something I – I do not understand but that was one of my 
queries about Glencore’s OCM’s so called hardship. 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Chair if we reflect it was a very 
long term contract.  If it is 2018 built in the 70’s it is 
almost a fifty year type contract.  It is coming towards the 
end now 2018 it is almost sort of days to ending.   
 
The boilers at Hendrina as I said earlier Chair they 
were designed to burn this ground literally not coal call it 
the ground here or there.  And – and that whole model was 
packaged around it.  If you changed – change that model 
20 
then the whole thing falls apart.  And again Hendrina was – 
was a cash machine – a cash machine for Eskom.  It made 
a lot of cash for Eskom.  A lot of electricity sales.  And you 
do not want to disturb that model Chair that is basically 
what it was and that is why that price was fixed long term. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 18 of 294 
 
 
And again this hardship clause was introduced and 
an addendum to that effect was introduced to give the 
supplier relief export on the coal mine. 
 
And around 2015 Chair the external coal market 
also collapsed so you could see where Glencore’s position 
was or the shareholder of OCM position was.  He was not 
making money on the export market and not making money 
on the domestic market incurring costs. 
 
And again saying to Eskom I need more cash, I 
need more cash.  That sets the basis for that pre-payment, 
10 
that then arrived thereafter.  So that is it the foundation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but is your answer that the hardship 
that OCM while it was under Glencore complained about 
was not largely due to it not having done its homework? 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:  That is very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:  That is very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:  I fully agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
DR NAIDOO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr – Dr Naidoo so 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 19 of 294 
 
you saying that hardship experienced by OCM and the 
request by OCM for an increase in the purchase price 
would have set the ground work for the pre-payment? 
DR NAIDOO:  Correct.  Correct Chair.  In fact there an – 
another 
development 
before 
pre-payment 
that 
was 
business rescue. The shareholders of OCM then put the 
company into business rescue and now we are dealing with 
business rescue practitioners and again the – the message 
conveyed to Eskom jobs will be at stake.  We are going to 
stop the production; people are going to lose jobs.  And 
10 
again when I reflected on that particular position of the job 
Chair I said power stations has been there for fifty odd 
years it has created jobs for the community.  It is a matter 
of days before it is going to stop working and again it has 
done its share for the community so let us not make jobs a 
particular issue to focus on.  Let us focus on the – on the 
national grid security and make sure the machines are 
working, make sure there is continuity of operations. 
 
And 
again 
Chair 
during 
that 
business 
rescue 
operations unknown to the business rescue practitioners 
20 
Eskom had been in deep distress, load shedding was at its 
all time high – there was – there was a lot of disturbance 
within the operational end of Eskom.  But unknown to them 
we 
had 
already 
commenced 
the 
recovery 
of 
Eskom 
Generation. And Eskom Generation Energy availability 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 20 of 294 
 
factor 
was 
already 
on 
the 
recovery. 
 
We 
could 
accommodate 
one 
or 
two 
machines 
being 
disturbed 
because remember these are small units 200 megawatts.  
So if you do bump it you are going to bump 1 200 or 2 200 
or so but not all of them.  And we could accommodate that 
disturbance on the national grid without disturbing security 
of … 
 
We knew that and that is why we sort got into a 
little bit of an entrenched position regarding this price of 
coal.  And we said we would like to hold onto the - this - 
10 
whatever is in the contract – you, me renegotiate that end 
of December 2018.  And we feeling comfortable we will 
manage national grid security.  We were very happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you talking about the period 
where OCM/Glencore was pushing for an increase of – on 
the coal price? 
DR NAIDOO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you are talking about? 
DR NAIDOO:  Correct Chair correct.  So they were pushing 
on the increase of the coal price and then simultaneously 
20 
they 
throwing 
business 
rescue, 
simultaneously 
they 
throwing loss of jobs for the community.  So it is 
compounding itself.  It is getting more and more difficult.  
 
But again at that time Chair I was very confident 
that we will maintain national grid security that was always 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 21 of 294 
 
my reference.  Are you going to hold national grid security 
before we break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I asked you a question earlier on 
and 
you 
gave 
an 
answer 
but 
I 
think 
although 
the 
information you gave me was I think useful it did not go to 
the question namely whether what – whether the situation 
that Glencore/OCM found itself in when it invoked the 
hardship clause was the situation for which the hardship 
clause had been created? 
DR NAIDOO:  Well   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words was it – did it fit within as 
you 
understood 
the 
kind 
of 
hardship 
that 
was 
contemplated? 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes Chair in fact the hardship clause I think 
was initiated by the commencement of the agreement.  
Never really …ever really … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:  Pertained to any particular supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NAIDOO:  It was there it was embedded in the original  
20 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NAIDOO:  Because of Eskom holding the price of coal 
delivered to its lowest level and Eskom agreed we will 
prepay for the capital infrastructure to mine the coal and 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 22 of 294 
 
deliver it throughout. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course ultimately OCM did not 
pursue the arbitration process to the end arising out of the 
invocation of the hardship clause.  As I recall you – if you 
invoke the hardship clause if the parties meet and cannot 
reach agreement you go to arbitration. 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it correct that Eskom’s position was 
okay you have invoked the hardship clause we can go 
through it and let the arbitrator decide? 
10 
DR NAIDOO:  No Chair it did not go arbitration.  I think 
Glencore… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no but what I am saying is I think you 
– you agree and I wanted you to confirm that once a party 
to that coal supply agreement had invoked a hardship 
clause. 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The hardship clause. 
DR NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The route ultimately if the parties could 
20 
not reach agreement. 
DR NAIDOO:  Is arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is arbitration. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But I am saying as I recall the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 23 of 294 
 
matter ultimately never reached arbitration. 
DR NAIDOO:  Never, correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am asking whether Eskom’s position 
was that you OCM have invoked the hardship clause and 
we are happy for that to take its course. 
DR NAIDOO:  Correct.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so to speak we will see what 
happens. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is your right to take that route. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed.  Agreed – correct Chair that is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  So – so OCM to the 
extent that they may complain about Eskom having taken a 
hard line on the issue of – on their request or proposal for 
an increase of the coal price on the basis that they were 
suffering 
hardship 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
Glencore/OCM 
criticised Eskom’s hard line.  One answer from Eskom 
would be but if you thought we were unjustified in taking 
the hard line that we took you had a remedy. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely to pursue arbitration up to the 
end. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if the arbi – if you pursued 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 24 of 294 
 
arbitration and the arbitrator found against us as Eskom we 
would comply with the award of the arbitrator. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not pursue that line. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it may well be that the reason you 
did not pursue it because you realised that you were not 
going to have a strong case. 
DR NAIDOO:  Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:  Chair and I want to also add Chair.  Had the 
arbitrator ruled in the favour of the supplier rather than in 
Eskom’s favour we would have rearranged the operation of 
the power station such that we reduce the quantity of coal 
that we get.  We would have shared that load across the 
fleet of power stations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:  So instead of burning X volumes at Y price 
we would have adjusted the volumes to burn at that price 
so that we can keep the cost to the company constant. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I want to make sure I understand 
what you have just said because I want to understand 
whether it amounts to saying we would not comply with the 
arbitrators award if he or she found in favour of OCM or 
whether it says we would comply.  We would just need to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 25 of 294 
 
make certain arrangements in order to handle the situation. 
DR NAIDOO:   Agree.  We will comply Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   But we will make operation requirements to 
handle the impact on the company.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The operational arrangements that you 
would make, would they not result in OCM’s victory in the 
arbitration awarded being an empty victory? 
DR NAIDOO:   Chair, ja it could result in them seeing it as 
a victory but in terms of the net or the focus costs to either 
10 
company, it will be constant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I am sure you might not make 
look into it further but yes I am concerned whether you 
would effectively be saying:  Well, let us go to arbitration.  
If you win, we know how we fix you. 
DR NAIDOO:   That is the name of the game. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
DR NAIDOO:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that is what Eskom was 
planning. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why they were saying:  Okay, go 
to arbitration.   
DR NAIDOO:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 26 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Dr Naidoo, let us go back to the 
meeting of the 21 s t.  So the Coal Operation Agreement is 
before the board and the terms you are proposing in terms 
of the 4 t h Agenda.  Just tell the Chair how the board dealt 
with that matter. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair if I may.  I think the decision that 
there was not taken to board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   Was it not cancelled out again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was transferred to ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   To the Chief Executive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the Chief – the new Chief 
Executive. 
DR NAIDOO:   To the new Chief Executive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That was Mr Brian Molefe. 
DR NAIDOO:   Mr Molefe, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So this is a meeting on the 
23 r d of April.  It is at the same meeting that the board 
20 
approves the secondment of Mr Molefe.  
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To be with effect from the 20 t h of April. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he is new at Eskom. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 27 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Is there a reason why the matter 
was not referred to the team, back to the team that was 
negotiating the transaction? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair it would go back to the team but 
via the Chief Executive.  It is an operational accountability.  
Sorry, Chair.  It is an operational accountability.  It goes 
back into the organisation and the point of entry into the 
organisation as the chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   But that is all that it was.  And again, as the 
earlier discussion we had.  There are lots of complexities 
around it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we have seen from various 
affidavits of board members who are yet to testify including 
yourselves, that there was an expectation that Mr Molefe 
will come back to the board on that issues. 
DR NAIDOO:   I would expect so. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But he would report back. 
DR NAIDOO:   He would report back, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  The question was then asked 
which you addressed in your affidavit, whether were you 
aware as the board...  Well, let me ask you whether – did 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 28 of 294 
 
Mr Molefe come back to the board?  You have any 
recollection of him coming back to the board? 
DR NAIDOO:   Specifically no sir but the Chief Executive 
does report to the board on a monthly basis.  At the board 
meeting there is the Chief Executive’s report.  I am not 
sure whether it was contained in that report.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Let me ask you this then.  
We have seen from the evidence that he terminated the 
negotiation and corporate agreement with OCM.  Was the 
board aware of that termination? 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prior to it happening, you were not 
aware? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, that is an operational accountability. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now, so there is – the parties are 
trying to negotiate a new agreement, a new term, increase 
the price.  The matter is given to Mr Molefe who has just 
arrived at Eskom.  He ultimately terminates that process in 
July 2015.  You are saying the board is not aware of it.  
Can you recall when the board does become aware of it or 
20 
you personally? 
DR NAIDOO:   Chair, the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you cannot recall, you cannot recall. 
DR NAIDOO:   No, I think the – the best I can give you 
Chair is.  At the Investment and Finance Committee when I 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 29 of 294 
 
made that – when I chaired that committee, there was this 
issue 
of 
the 
prepayment 
and 
in 
that 
prepayment 
conversation, my best understanding was that Glencore 
was still the owner of OCM.   
 
And I did make my comment in that conclusion of 
that meeting that given the two parties to come to some 
agreement, Eskom and OCM, that the chairman of Eskom 
and the chairman of Glencore should make a joined 
statement of that effect.  I made that and I put it in my 
records. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Okay Chair that – Chairperson, 
that accelerates the matter.  So let us go into that. 
DR NAIDOO:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Naidoo, let us go into that. 
DR NAIDOO:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the termination is made of the 
negotiation process between the two parties, Eskom and 
OCM.  In December 2015, the 8 t h of December 2015, the 
board gets an email from Ms Suzanne Daniels. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About the request for the board to 
consider a submission for a prepayment of R 1.6 billion. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now that submission and that is where 
you are. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 30 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tell the Chairperson what you 
understood the submission to request the prepayment to be 
made?   
DR NAIDOO:   Right.  Thank you, Chair.  Chair, this was – 
this did not come to a formal meeting.  We got a request 
electronically.  It was an emergency request.  It came 
through electronically.   
 
And I was a member of the Investment and Finance 
Committee.  That is where it came to.  And the chairperson 
10 
of the Investment and Finance Committee recused himself 
and I found myself in the chair now chairing this meeting, 
not in a formal setting but on a Round-robin resolution.   
 
And 
I 
looked 
at 
the 
request 
of 
prepayment.  
Prepayment 
for 
coal 
from 
Optimum 
Coal. 
 And 
the 
prepayment value of R 1.68 billion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It was how much? 
DR NAIDOO:   R 1.68 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, billion rands? 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja.  Ja, that was there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   And when I looked at it and I looked at the 
submission 
that 
was 
tabled, 
it 
motivated 
firstly 
this 
agreement between Eskom and OCM.   
 
Remember they had a strained relationship, they 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 31 of 294 
 
have now come to an agreement.  They are happy together.  
OCM requires cash in advance to give them liquidity so 
that they can get on with their business.   
 
Deliver the coal to Hendrina Power Station plus 
also take the coal and sell it to the export market and they 
will make more money of it.  That was there sort of 
motivation.   
 
And they also said they are in the process of 
taking on more Black Economic Empowerment in terms of 
their 
contractual 
relationships 
within 
or 
shareholder 
10 
relationships within OCM itself.   
 
And they have got some support and we could 
assist them with this R 1.68 billion.  We will ensure 
security of delivery of coal to Hendrina Power Station.   
 
Also, 
they 
extended 
the 
delivery 
to 
another 
national power station, Arnot.  And they also said they will 
secure the jobs of the people.   
 
So when we looked at all that we said prepayment 
is certainly an industry practise.  Eskom does this all the 
time, not just on the coal side, even on the electricity sale 
20 
side.   
 
You can be a prepaid customer to buy electricity.  
And when we looked at it we said the security in terms of 
that R 1.68 billion, the security and the inventory – as I 
said the coal is at Hendrina’s, not to anyone else’s.  It is 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 32 of 294 
 
right outside.  We have got security on that inventory 
against that R 1.68 billion.   
 
And we said the R 1.68 billion prepayment would 
be absorbed by operations within a few weeks literally.  So 
that we be used.  And it is a win-win situation for Eskom 
and for OCM.   
 
And it is in that response, I said towards the end 
of my note, this is a positive development given the 
distress of where we coming from.   
 
And I think the chairman of Eskom and the 
10 
chairman of Glencore should make a joint statement to this 
effect that we both came together and we working together. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  Thank you for clearing 
that out.  So Dr Naidoo, your understanding was that OCM, 
which is one owned by Glencore, was – there was going to 
be this prepayment. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The relationship has – the soured 
20 
relationship is now revitalised. 
DR NAIDOO:   Agreed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we are going to assist OCM, come 
out of business rescue, safe jobs, supply ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Agreed. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 33 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Hendrina supply and Arnot. 
DR NAIDOO:   Agreed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so on.  So that is the IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was the...  It is quite clear from what 
you say, what you have said, that as far as you are 
concerned, your intention – and you may go further and 
say you think it was the intention of all the board members, 
I am not sure, you can deal with that just now.  Your 
intention was that Eskom was granting or the board was 
approving prepayment to OCM under Glencore. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not to Tegeta. 
DR NAIDOO:   Not to Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   No, there is no Tegeta Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   And Chair, this was done in my apartment in 
Parktown.  I am at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   I am not in a boardroom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:   And that is why I wrote down those points 
and I have communicated that to my fellow colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   I said:  Colleagues, this is the reason why I 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 34 of 294 
 
am giving the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   And I was now in the chair of the Investment 
and Finance Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
DR NAIDOO:   That is the reason I tabled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, just by way of reference.  
Dr Naidoo, maybe you should go to Eskom Bundle 18 
10 
because that note you are referring to is to be found in 
18(A). 
DR NAIDOO:   18...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bracket A. 
DR NAIDOO:   Please help. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody must assist him to get to the 
right bundle. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  It is 18(A) Chairperson, page 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They will identify the bundle and give it 
to you Dr Naidoo. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page Mr Seleka? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 35 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is page two...  It starts at page 281.  
Just... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 281.   
DR NAIDOO:   Right.  I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have got it?  Okay.  Ja, stay on 
281. 
DR NAIDOO:   Okay, I got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. Because I want to refer you to 281 
and 286.   
10 
DR NAIDOO:   And 286? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And 286. 
DR NAIDOO:   Okay, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
DR NAIDOO:   Right.  I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, that is my note.  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Confirmed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you gents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the Chairperson the document on 
page 286, Dr Naidoo as well, that is the submission that 
came before the board, also served before the IFC.  If you 
...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 36 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, yes.  I have seen it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright.  You have seen it. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And the page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which document are you starting with, 
281? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   281 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He has just confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is the submission that served 
before the IFC and the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Motivating for the prepayment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he – the submission that he has 
confirmed as having served in both, is it the one 281 or the 
one 286? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both? 
DR NAIDOO:   Both. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, 286 is a different document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, this is my document here.  It is my 
response. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 37 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us do ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Chair, if you look at the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...one at a time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Probably – should we not start with his 
document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would you know.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  He has confirmed the 
submission.  Let us go to his document.  Your document Dr 
Naidoo on 286. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. Because you are explaining to the 
Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka.  Maybe you are 
right.  We should start with his submissions because you – 
20 
as I understand it, his note was made after ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct, after the submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Let us start with what persuaded 
him. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 38 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What told him what this was about.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Naidoo, you understand the 
question? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That the Chairperson...  Ja, you can 
10 
simply just point out to the Chairperson what made you 
...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Why I went that direction? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes.  Chair, on page 283, there is 3.2.21 
highlighted yellow.  I think this was my highlighting of 
yellow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, this is – because on my note I say:  
Salient point were noting.  Are highlighted in yellow on the 
20 
tax submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Dr Naidoo.  You are too fast. 
DR NAIDOO:   Sorry, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you were starting at page 281.  
Now I hear you are talking about 283. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 39 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   No, I migrated to 283.  Starting at 281, we 
skipped all of that, we have gone to page 283. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:   3.2.1 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we must start first.  Oh, you must 
tell me what this document is that starts at 281. 
DR NAIDOO:   Oh, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   281.  How did it come before you and 
what was it about. 
DR NAIDOO:   Oh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you can take me to 283. 
DR NAIDOO:   Right.  Chairperson, the – let me go to 279, 
a little bit before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
DR NAIDOO:   279.  This the minutes of the Special 
Telephonic Investment and Finance Committee held on 
9 December 2015 at 08:30 in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   The chairperson had recused and Dr Naidoo 
is the acting chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Right, Chair.  That is the document.  And 
then the submission, the Round-robin submission to the 
Board of Directors, page 281. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Just for the sake 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 40 of 294 
 
of completeness.  What you were reading at 279 was the 
heading which is the minutes of that meeting that you 
mentioned. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us say what the meeting was 
about. 
DR NAIDOO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Matters for approval. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There, 6.1. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   6.1, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A request to approve the pre-purchase of 
coal from Optimum Coal ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Optimum Coal (Pty) Ltd. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...(Pty) Ltd. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the subject. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct.  Just one agenda item. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
DR NAIDOO:   And the submission for that agenda item 
20 
was – is on page 281. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   The Round-robin submission to the Board of 
Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 41 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Submission.  Pre-purchase of coal of 
Optimum Coal Mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
DR NAIDOO:   Right.  Ja, the same submission.  I am 
going to jump and go to page 283 and highlighted 3.2.1: 
“Optimum is formally declared not to be in 
business rescue as required by the provisions 
of the Companies Act.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   That is the point highlighted in yellow. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
DR NAIDOO:   Then 3.4.1 highlighted yellow: 
“The advanced purchase of R 1.68 billion will 
secure future supply of coal to Eskom and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You are reading from 3.4.1? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Just restart afresh. 
DR NAIDOO:   Right. 
“The advanced purchase of R 1.68 billion will 
20 
secure future supply of coal to Eskom and will 
be funded by a reduction of Eskom’s coal 
stockpile from 54 days to 40 days.” 
 
So that is the benefit there.  And 3.4.2: 
“OCM will seek the unsupplied portion of coal 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 42 of 294 
 
under 
the 
pre-purchase 
agreement 
as 
security.” 
 
And then I go ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you did not mention or unless I 
missed it, which is important just to say at 3.4 deals with 
benefits of the advance purchase of coal. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, yes.  That is...[intervenes]   
CHAIRPERSON:   And 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 that you have just 
read ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Oh, ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is heading, the benefits. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes.  Then Chair...  Oh, sorry Chair, let me 
go a little bit slow.  At 3.6 we talk about risk including 
environmentally 
legal 
or 
contractual 
risks 
and 
other 
considerations.  We go to 3.6.1: 
“Operational and Supplier Risk Mitigation by 
pledge insertion of coal practise.” 
 
3.6.2: 
20 
“The proceeds of R 1.68 billion prepayment of 
coal are to be used by OCM to distinguish 
existing liabilities to ensure that the business 
continues as a growing concern.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 43 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   3.6.3: 
“The 
proposed 
purchaser 
will 
lift 
current 
empowerment ownership from 30% to 51%.” 
 
That was the point I highlighted in my note dated 
9 December and this is on 286.  286 Chair before the 
following page.  9 December 2015, Eskom Board of 
Directors, 
IFC 
(Investment 
Finance 
Committee) 
proceedings.  December 2015, Round-robin resolution.  
Title of submission:  Pre-purchase of coal from OCM. 
“The resolution has submitted, it is supported 
10 
and approved. 
Salient points were noting are highlighted in 
yellow on the tax submission document.” 
 
That is what we have done.   
DR NAIDOO:   I have just read to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   One: 
“OCM and the Companies Act: 
The Board of Directors’ approval will support 
and allow OCM to migrate from the status of 
20 
business rescue to that of a growing concern.” 
 
That was very important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
“Their 
full 
rights, 
responsibilities 
and 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 44 of 294 
 
accountabilities will be as per the Companies 
Act. 
They plan to use the pre-purchase proceeds to 
address the liability and liquidity challenge. 
This will be a positive development, both for 
OCM and for Eskom. 
It will address the present day contractual 
obligations and create the platform for the 
future sustainability of mutual take, business 
and job continuity for fellow South Africans.” 
10 
 
Point 2: 
“As 
part 
of 
the 
proposed 
solution, 
OCM 
undertakes to increase their transformation 
accountability and responsibility from 30% to 
51% ownership. 
This is a positive development. 
It is noted and acknowledged.” 
 
Point 3: 
“The business case for pre-purchase of coal 
for both Hendrina and Arnot is robust and 
20 
strong. 
The cash flows are managed and absorbed by 
good inventory management of stockpile. 
A 
reduced 
holding 
base 
has 
not 
risk 
to 
electricity production. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 45 of 294 
 
The profitability of the proposal is noted that it 
should be ring fenced and reported when it is 
realised.” 
 
Point 4 Chair: 
“The 
positive 
outcome 
from 
the 
joint 
management solution of Eskom and OCM is 
noted and acknowledged as a nationality. 
It allows for business continuity and security o 
jobs, 
security 
of 
electricity 
production 
at 
national key-point power stations, Hendrina 
10 
and Arnot. 
And so South Africa and our customers will 
send their...” 
 
Point 5 Chair: 
“A further recommendation is that the chairman 
of Eskom and the chairman of Glencore jointly 
communicate 
this 
achievement 
to 
South 
African 
and 
the 
international 
community.  
Thank you, Nath Naidoo” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you very much for handing this.  
Thank you.  I could not find it.  But thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, members of the ISCS(?) Board of 
Directors. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 46 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka and Dr Naidoo it quite – 
a lot of things... [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is important to – for the sake of 
business. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To just go back to the minutes of the 
Investment and Finance Committee that he referred to. 
DR NAIDOO:   279.    
CHAIRPERSON:   279.  And say this is the outcome of the 
10 
that meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if the reasons for that outcome are 
set out there to articulate them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was now – or then the question 
of the minutes of the board where the approval was given, 
where would that be? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The board itself Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The board itself, ja.  Because I am 
assuming that ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   This is a recommendation from IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the Investment and Finance 
Committee has ...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 47 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...has come to this conclusion, it must 
be the recommendation or ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or its decision must go to the board 
for approval. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
DR NAIDOO:   Can I read that resolution Chair from the 
minutes? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uh... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, we will find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they will ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will find it Chair. 
DR NAIDOO:   Oh, you are find it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. [laughs] 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will find the page because Chair the 
board did not need – the board sent approvals by Round-
robin. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is fine.  As long as we get to 
say 
here 
is 
the 
formal 
approval 
by 
the 
board 
and 
confirming what was before the board, whether it was the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 48 of 294 
 
same documents that were before the Investment and 
Finance Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, thank you.  Ja, I will get the page 
reference of the Chairperson. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me ask this question while 
Mr Seleka is looking at whatever he is looking at.  Dr 
10 
Naidoo... 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to say, having been part of 
that telephonic meeting of the Investment and Finance 
Committee that the understanding of the committee was 
that it was recommending approval of this prepayment on 
the basis that the prepayment was for OCM/Glencore? 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are able to confirm that? 
DR NAIDOO:   Hundred percent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are the chairperson of the 
committee. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 49 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you have said that this executive 
summary starting at page 281, served before both the 
committee as well as the board.  When you look at 
paragraph 2.1.2 on page 281, that is that summary, that 
submission for Round-robin. 
 
That paragraphs makes it clear that the Group 
Chief 
Executive 
of 
Eskom 
together 
with 
the 
Group 
Executive for Generations and Chief Financial Officer, I 
suspect that those were Mr Brian Molefe and Mr Koko and 
Mr Singh, were being authorised to negotiate and conclude 
10 
a pre-purchase of coal agreement, not with the owners or 
current owners at the time of OCM but with the proposed 
owners. How – did you see that at the ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair I saw that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you saw that, how could you and 
your committee think that you were authorising prepayment 
to Glencore?  Because the proposed owners of OCM were 
not Glencore? 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir  This – in terms of this, the Business 
Rescue Practitioners were still present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
DR NAIDOO:   So the ownership of OCM was still in that 
sort of greyish area but for now the record speaks very 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 50 of 294 
 
clearly that the contractual relationship is with Glencore, 
not with anyone else.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   No, but I appreciate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that but I am saying the 
words in paragraph 2.1.2 ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...were starring you in the face and they 
were not saying the request is that you must authorise 
these three officials of Eskom to negotiate and conclude an 
10 
agreement with the owners of OCM.  Owners as at that 
time.  It was saying you are requested, you are deem 
requested to authorise these three officials of Eskom 
...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to negotiate with and conclude a pre-
purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners.  
Who was the proposed owners at the time? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, we had no details of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   We had no details of the proposed owners.  
It was still, in our mind, Glencore is the owner and in the 
submission it states that the proposed purchases – 3.6.3: 
“Proposed 
purchaser 
will 
lift 
current 
empowerment ownership from 30% to 51%.” 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 51 of 294 
 
 
So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But that makes it worse for your case 
because you should be asking:  Why is this submission all 
about proposed owners when we are being asked to 
authorise payment to the current owners? 
DR NAIDOO:   Let me answer it this way Chair.  The 
agreement, the Coal Supply Agreement is between two 
companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Eskom and OCM. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at that stage, OCM under Glencore. 
DR NAIDOO:   Under Glencore.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, that is correct.  But there is something 
happening in the background ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   ...that we do not have details of that.  We 
only stayed within the contractual boundaries between 
20 
Eskom and OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but I am saying to you.  How could 
you think along those lines when in black and white the 
executive summary, the Round-robin submission that was 
placed before your committee ...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 52 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and before the board made it quite 
clear what you have been requested to authorise, that this 
submission, this summary did not ask your committee or 
the board to authorise the three officials of Eskom to 
conclude an agreement with the owners of OCM because if 
it 
had 
said 
owners 
of 
OCM, 
it 
would 
have 
meant 
Glencore/OCM because those are the owners.  It said 
proposed owners. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am asking how you could have – 
you said you did see this, if I understand ...[intervenes]  
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you so decide, why did you not 
raise an issue to say:  Hang on.  Why are we – why are you 
saying we must conclude a contract with proposed owners 
when there are current owners that we should be dealing 
with? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair.  The contractual, as I said Chair 
is still Eskom/OCM, OCM, that is the contract.  The 
20 
contract is not between Eskom and Glencore.  The contract 
is not between Eskom and proposed owners.  The contract 
is not between Eskom, Glencore and maybe more BEE 
partners, the contract is Eskom OCM, so that is what we 
focused on, Eskom OCM. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 53 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I am putting to you, Dr Naidoo 
…[intervenes] 
DR NAIDOO:   I know, I see that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I am putting to you is that 
precisely the point you are emphasising counts against the 
decision that you took.  It counts against the version you 
have 
given 
that 
you 
were 
intending 
to 
authorise 
prepayment to the Glencore/OCM because that is what I 
should be saying to you, to say but why did you not say 
change the submission …[intervenes] 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …because we cannot authorise the 
conclusion of a contract with proposed owners when they 
are current owners, what we are going to authorise is the 
conclusion of a contract with the current owners, you must 
change the submission. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair, you are correct, Chair.  That 
word proposed opens a big door. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, you see, it makes it difficult – it 
raises the question how was it possible that x number of 
20 
members of the investment and finance committee all did 
not see this point?  How is it possible that the entire board 
also did not see this point because Dr Ngubane I think also 
gave evidence along the lines that you have given. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 54 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how could none of you say but hang 
on, change this submission. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, it should have been, Chair, I agree with 
you.  Should have had, with the existing or current owners 
of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because now …[intervenes] 
DR NAIDOO:   But the heading is correct, the title of 
submission is correct, pre-purchase of coal from Optimum 
Coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may well be that somebody might say 
10 
well, despite the fact that your committee and the board 
did not raise this issue about proposed owners.  When you 
look at the final resolution maybe it was worded in a way 
which made it clear that you were authorising prepayment 
to Glencore/OCM and not to Tegeta but those who asked 
your committee and the board to authorise payment would 
be entitled to say it was there in black and white, we did 
not mislead you, we wrote it there and you said we should 
go ahead but now you are turning around and say all of 
you are now saying but as far as we were concerned we 
20 
were authorising prepayment to Glencore but they say it is 
there, it is black and white, how come? 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, you are correct, Chair, you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I found the page reference for 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 55 of 294 
 
the board resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the matter.  In the same bundle, 
Eskom bundle 18(A) page 352.22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the board can we go to the 
investment and finance committee decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go back and let us see whether 
there is anything there that suggests that they were not 
approving what had exactly been placed before them by 
10 
way of the submission or executive summary. In terms of 
the outcome they specified – they said something that 
suggests quite clearly that there were not authorising what 
they had been asked to authorise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, those minutes. 
DR NAIDOO:   The minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are on page 279. 
DR NAIDOO:   279.  And the resolution is on page 280. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. I do have the signed minutes, 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because those ones are not signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are further down on page 584. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 56 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just before – I take it that they are 
the same as… 
DR NAIDOO:   Same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me just… 
DR NAIDOO:    
“It is recommended that board approves the  
transaction as set out in the submission to the 
board relating to the pre-purchase of coal from 
Optimum (Pty) Ltd.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it does say Optimum (Pty) Ltd. 
10 
DR NAIDOO:   Ltd. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the minutes at 279 and 280 there 
does not appear to be anything that suggests either way. 
DR NAIDOO:   Either way, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you say I must also look 
where, Mr Seleka? 
DR NAIDOO:   The signed minutes, page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is the signed, Chair, so what Dr 
Naidoo was reading …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The signed one is exactly the same. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it is exactly, it is on page 584. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The resolution is the same, page 584. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just get there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the minutes starts there at page 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 57 of 294 
 
584, the resolution is on page 585. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And then let us go to the board to 
see – we know it was the same submission that was placed 
before them, ja. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But what Dr Naidoo wanted brought to 
your attention, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It said the resolution does read pre-
purchase of coal from Optimum (Pty) Ltd. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but that was not going to change, is 
it not, because it is a question of whether you talk about 
Optimum 
coal 
under 
Glencore 
or 
Optimum 
Coal 
…[intervenes] 
DR NAIDOO:   Under Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tegeta, that is the – still OCM but 
…[intervenes] 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Still OCM, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  The question is under which one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, except, Chair, a distinction might 
have to be made when you add (Pty) Ltd at the end 
because then it relates to the entity. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 58 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Changing the shareholding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I beg your pardon? 
DR NAIDOO:   Changing shareholding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it relates to the entity as opposed 
to the mine itself. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after Tegeta took it over did it not 
remain and Ltd but as a subsidiary of – I do not know 
whether Oakbay or Tegeta? 
DR NAIDOO:   I do not know whether they changed the 
10 
name of the entity but they purchased shareholding in OCM 
and they carried calling it OCM and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not remember seeing anything 
saying they changed the name. 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, because, Chair, the contract is still the 
supreme document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NAIDOO:   You see, the contract, the supply contract, 
that is the supreme document, it still refers to this also. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So it is a question of who was in 
control of the entity. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it Glencore or was it – so but let us 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 59 of 294 
 
go to the …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The board resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is page 352.22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is by round robin, Chair, and the 
resolution, resolution required.  So what you – the 
Chairperson will see there,  is what was required from the 
board on the first page, page 352.22.  On the next page 
the – and I believe it is Ms Suzanne Daniels, would have 
10 
populated the table to indicate which of the board members 
send their approvals.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, before that I am just looking at the 
resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, with the board, their resolution 
is quite clear because they take paragraph 2.1.2 of the 
executive summary that I read earlier on, they take it as it 
is.  So what they resolved was in 2.1.2: 
“The Group Chief Executive together with Group 
20 
Executive 
for 
Generation 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
are 
hereby 
authorise, 
negotiate 
and 
conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the 
proposed owners of OCM, coal supply agreement.” 
Now the investment and finance committee, when you go to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 60 of 294 
 
their minutes, as I indicated, it could go either way. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this is clear and categorical. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the board approved was not the 
conclusion of an agreement, a pre-purchase of coal 
agreement between the owners of OCM at the time and 
Eskom but it authorised pre-purchase of coal agreement 
with the proposed owners. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – and you were part of that board. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, that was just a cut and paste proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   That is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And again – and Dr Ngubane also gave 
evidence along the same lines as yourself. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is troubling me is how it is 
possible for so many members of the board not to have 
seen what is written here in black and white.  That is what 
20 
is troubling me. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair.  Yes, I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NAIDOO:   I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The board was about how many people 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 61 of 294 
 
at the time, about 12? 
DR NAIDOO:   10 – 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About 12? 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And some of the board members were 
people with high qualifications. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know? 
DR NAIDOO:   Ja, Chair, this is the point where I think 
trust and integrity comes to the fore, you have to have 
10 
trust and integrity otherwise it is very difficult because you 
are working in a high-pressured environment, volumes of 
work coming through very quickly and coming through in 
high speed, you need trust and integrity.  Without trust and 
integrity it does not hold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you see, when you serve in a 
body such as the board of an entity such as Eskom, or any 
board… 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are playing a kind of supervisory 
20 
role over the executive management. 
DR NAIDOO:   Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have oversight. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have to put the interests of the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 62 of 294 
 
entity at the forefront. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever decisions you take you have 
got to ask yourself the question is this decision in the 
interests of this entity? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, obviously, all decisions you 
take must be lawful and comply with the law, you know? 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is – I mean, when I read that this 
10 
executive summary for the first time but now I do not know, 
maybe he drew my attention to it but I think I picked up 
this proposed owners, negotiate and put an agreement with 
proposed owners, that sounded strange, you know?  But 
maybe it was because of the evidence that I had heard for 
some time. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it troubling me that a board, 
members of the board of such an important state entity 
know that they are being asked to authorise payment to an 
20 
entity of a very large amount. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1,6 billion. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they do not take the trouble to make 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 63 of 294 
 
sure that they are authorising the conclusion of a contract 
with the right entity. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They do not take the trouble to say let 
us make sure that this money goes to the right entity or the 
right person, it must not go to somebody we do not intend. 
DR NAIDOO:   No, Chair.  I think, Chair, I just want to 
raise this point.  The supreme document, as I said here, I 
is the coal supply contract between Eskom and Optimum 
Coal.  The money will go from Eskom to Optimum Coal, 
10 
that is where.  But again what happens thereafter, Chari 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, no, no, Dr Naidoo –
and we have been dealing with this point.  If the money 
goes to Glencore and your resolution says it should go to 
Tegeta then whoever sends it to – the money to Glencore, 
is doing something contrary to your resolution and they are 
not allowed to do that, they must comply with the 
resolution of the board. 
DR NAIDOO:   Agree, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see? 
DR NAIDOO:   Agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a great responsibility… 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the board when it deals with monies 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 64 of 294 
 
and other decisions and I am saying particularly when you 
are being asked to authorise payment of such a large 
amount from Eskom to somebody else, there is a greater 
responsibility for you to scrutinise the documents placed 
before you to make sure that there is proper justification 
for this money to be authorised, there is payment to be 
made, is it being – are you authorising it to be paid to the 
right person and so on and so on?  And certainly what is in 
the resolution of the board here suggests to me that to say 
the least the board was very negligent.  It may well be that 
10 
it is much more than that but I am not saying that at this 
stage and it may well be that within the board it was 
negligence on the part of some members but on the part of 
some other members, maybe they knew more than others, I 
do not know.  But it is troubling. 
DR NAIDOO:   Agreed, I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that. 
DR NAIDOO:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. Okay. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, we have gone past quarter 
past. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not know whether you would like 
to complete the evidence of Dr Naidoo, it depends how 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 65 of 294 
 
much time.  I am easy to adjourn now, we continue with 
him or complete with him if you are not far from finishing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It just depends how much you have 
covered of what you intended to cover. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think I have covered sufficient.  Dr 
Naidoo, the next question is about the guarantee because 
this pre-purchase was not made to either Glencore – oh 
well, in fact not OCM at all.  Do you know that?  Chair, let 
me gather my thoughts, we could adjourn, I can finish in 
10 
five minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that is fine.  Let us take the tea 
adjournment now.  We will resume at twenty to twelve.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to round off from my part, Dr 
Naidoo.  So your situation is not that you did not see that 
20 
you were being asked to authorise the three Eskom 
officials to negotiate and conclude pre-purchase of coal 
agreement with the proposed owners, you did see that is 
what the submission said but – and you did not raise an 
issue. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 66 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But somehow you say you thought that – 
or your intention was to authorise the conclusion of pre-
purchase of coal agreement between Eskom and OCM as 
owned by Glencore. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and – but if somebody says how you 
could have thought you were doing that in the light of this 
clear statement, are you able to explain how you could 
have 
thought 
along 
those 
lines 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
10 
statement?  In other words, I just want to have your 
explanation. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, Chair.  Yes, Chairperson, our 
understanding was that the – as I said earlier, Chair, the 
supreme agreements, the coal supply agreement between 
Eskom and OCM, Optimum Coal Mine, as owned by 
Glencore.  The change of ownership of OCM had not yet 
occurred. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I have made – I have said 
what I have to about that reason, ja. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that I think we have taken longer 
with Dr Naidoo than you had planned but that is probably 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 67 of 294 
 
my fault not yours, I have had quite a number of questions 
to ask but I think it was important evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Dr Naidoo, we will finish off 
because – may I just – let us take it further because the – 
you have made, as the board, as IFC, made a decision for 
a prepayment. 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And in your understanding it is a 
10 
prepayment to OCM owned by Glencore to come out of 
business rescue, supply to Hendrina, also probably supply 
t Arnot and save jobs. 
DR NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That decision is made on the 9 
December 2015.  Did the board know what happened 
insofar as the execution of the decision was concerned? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that on the 10 t h, the next 
day, after you have made that prepayment decision, a 
20 
guarantee was instead prepared?  Did you know that? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that the guarantee was ultimately 
issued in favour of Tegeta on the 10 December? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 68 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not.  Did you ask the 
executives – we made a R1.6 billion decision the other day, 
what is the position, what is happening? 
DR NAIDOO:   Chair, there will be feedback back to the 
board.  At the next board meeting we will receive feedback 
and I think that the feedback that we received was to the 
effect the coal was procured, the coal was used up and 
that whole prepayment has been completely absorbed.  So 
we bought the coal in advance, we received the coal, we 
burnt up the coal, we made electrical energy and that 
10 
whole prepayment concluded.  That was basically the 
feedback.  Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so – but did they give you the 
details of who was supplying coal? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  Okay.  There was another 
prepayment made in April 2016.  I know that you have not 
dealt with that in your affidavit but do you know anything 
about that prepayment of R659 million? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir, not. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  It was made – it was a decision of 
the BTC.  Are you saying it did not come to the board? 
DR NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was not reported to the board. 
DR NAIDOO:   No. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 69 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Chair that – well, I – you know, 
there was evidence here – and I do not know whether you 
will 
know, 
evidence 
by 
Ms 
Mosilo 
Mothepu 
on 
how 
McKinsey, Regiments were appointed at Eskom. 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you have knowledge of meetings 
that are allegedly – were allegedly held with Mr Anoj Singh 
prior to him coming to Eskom? 
DR NAIDOO:   No, sir, I would not have knowledge. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You would not.  Okay, that concludes 
10 
my questions for Dr Naidoo.  Dr Naidoo says he is a 
professor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says he is actually a professor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NAIDOO:   No, thank you, thank you, Chair.  No, thank 
you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are entitled then to the title of 
professor and I think if you were in Germany you would be 
called Professor Doctor. 
20 
DR NAIDOO:   Yes, that would be in Germany yes. That is 
fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Professor Naidoo, 
we appreciate you coming to assist the Commission, you 
are now excused. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 70 of 294 
 
DR NAIDOO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson, the next 
witness is going to be Ms Venete Klein and as per the 
arrangement yesterday and the request from her, she will 
testify via video link. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Do I need to adjourn to 
allow something to be set up or not necessarily? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think a five minute adjournment 
would be preferable, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I adjourn? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A five minutes adjournment, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, let me adjourn for five minutes.  
We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:   Good morning Chairperson and Advocate 
Seleka. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Welcome back even though you are not 
here physically, welcome back to the Commission and 
thank you for coming back to continue with your evidence.   
 
Registrar please administer the oath of affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 71 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:   Venete Jarlene Klein. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MS KLEIN:   No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:    Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth.   If so, please raise your right hand and say 
10 
so help me God. 
MS KLEIN:   So help me God. 
VENETE JARLENE KLEIN:   [duly sworn, states] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Ms Klein.  Chairperson we 
are going to use Eskom Bundle 2, and just before we go 
into it Ms Klein is testifying not for the first time before the 
Commission.  Last time when she appeared, we dealt with 
the issues of suspensions of the executives and we ended 
well, when we adjourned her testimony we were dealing 
with the removal of Mr Tsotsi and the reasons given by the 
20 
Board for that removal or vote of no confidence. 
That 
matter 
has 
extensively 
been 
traversed 
Chairperson, we were from there going to go into the 
removal of Mr Norman Baloyi and that would have been the 
issues in regard to the suspension it would have covered 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 72 of 294 
 
those issues and what we would have been left with are 
the transactions, which is what we have been dealing with 
now.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the bundle Chairperson is Eskom 
Bundle 2, Ms Klein has provided three affidavits so far, the 
third of those affidavits deals with the transactions.  The 
first affidavit Chair – well now the pagination Chairperson 
on my side because this is an old file. It has a red 
pagination, only the red pagination it has a red pagination, 
10 
only the red pagination, yes.  It changes later on in the file 
to the black and the red. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you 
propose to use the red 
pagination? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No I can use the black because the 
main affidavit we would be dealing with on the transactions 
has the two paginations.  But what I wanted to do was I 
see the first affidavit does not seem to have been admitted 
as an exhibit to have them all three admitted and then go 
to where I need to be. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the first one which I said page 7 
black numbers, page 2 red numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That one deals with the suspension.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the suspensions only. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 73 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but will you remember what exhibit 
number it should have been? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be you U14.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what should have been done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and she confirmed everything? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She would have confirmed it on the 
first occasion when she appeared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein you follow? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   I am trying to, so where are we now, which 
page are we now Advocate? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 2, Eskom Bundle 2 page 7 black 
numbers or page 2 red numbers, your first affidavit.  The 
affidavit that comes first in that bundle.  Yes, you did 
confirm previously that this is your affidavit and that the 
first signature at page 29 black numbers, page 24 red 
numbers is your signature, is that right? 
MS KLEIN:    I am going there now, that is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  You want to admit it as 
20 
exhibit U14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As Exhibit U14.1, thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Venete Klein’s affidavit starting at 
page seven black numbers, page 2 red numbers in Eskom 
Bundle 2 is admitted as Exhibit U14.1.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 74 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is together with its annexures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  The second affidavit is on 
page, black pagination 400.1, 400.1.  This one is new 
Chairperson.  Ms Klein are you there on page 401.1?  
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, between ten lines, you see the 
words supplementary affidavit by Venete Klein? 
MS KLEIN:   I will find it, yes I see that there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and go to page 400.5.  
10 
MS KLEIN:   Okay, ja I am going there 400.5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, your name appears…[intervene] 
MS KLEIN:   I have got it, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, your name appears there Venete 
Jarlene Klein above that is a signature.  Do you confirm 
that 
to 
be 
your 
signature 
and 
the 
affidavit 
is 
dated…[intervene] 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you see us on the screen? 
MS KLEIN:   No I cannot actually, I just see myself on the 
20 
screen here but can you see me?  Okay there I see you on 
the screen now.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so the affidavit is dated is it 18 
or 15 January 2021, 18? 
MS KLEIN:   Looks like 18, hey. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 75 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is 18, do you confirm that to 
be your affidavit? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I beg leave to have this 
affidavit admitted, as Exhibit U14.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Venete Klein starting 
at page 400.1 is admitted as Exhibit U14.2.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Together with the annexures, thank 
you Chair.  That affidavit just by way of information deals 
with issues that arose during Ms Klein’s testimony.  So she 
10 
has filed that supplementary affidavit in order to reduce 
those issues which were new to writing.  Then Ms Klein 
turn to page 400.43.  
MS KLEIN:   I am there Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is an affidavit that runs up to 
page 400.50. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you confirm at the bottom of - 
20 
above your name there to be, your Signature?  
MS KLEIN:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit is dated 3 February 2021. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you confirm this to be your 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 76 of 294 
 
affidavit? 
MS KLEIN:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I beg leave to the have it 
admitted as Exhibit U14.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Venete Klein starting 
at page 400.43 is admitted with its annexures as Exhibit 
U14.3.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I could or we could show 
the extent is necessary on Mr Tsotsi’s issues. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, try and cover everything that needs 
to be highlighted with Ms Klein so that we do not reach a 
point where she no longer wishes to appear before me.  So 
let us try and cover everything if we can, ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
Ms 
Klein…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not suggesting Ms Klein that you 
have had had enough of the Commission. 
MS KLEIN:   Thank you very much for your consideration, 
Chairperson I appreciate it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, Ms Klein just quickly 
on the aspect of suspensions we were dealing with the 
removal of Mr Tsotsi and there was the issue about Mr 
Tsotsi having failed to give a report which he had said was 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 77 of 294 
 
an investigation report available on the basis, and being a 
document on the basis of which the President wanted the 
inquiry to be conducted.  Do you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do sir, I do Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the - those of you Board members 
who came to testify, placed some emphasis on his failure 
to produce the document in order for you to make the 
decision that was ultimately made. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And according to the testimony that we 
10 
heard, that was one of the reasons why the Board took a 
decision that he should be charged. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the way in which the charges are 
formulated, one could not find the charge relating to his 
failure to provide the Board with such a report. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson at the time when the decision 
was taken that there was this vote of no confidence of Mr 
Tsotsi, what had happened was in the formulating of the 
actual charges, the company secretary at that time might 
20 
have set up a ...[indistinct – distortion] and met with the 
attorneys who had helped us in the actual drafting of the 
charges because there were various charges that were 
being brought.  And it was on the basis of the recordings of 
the discussion of the 19th that Mr Matshela Koko together 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 78 of 294 
 
with the attorneys of record at the time, I forget the name, 
and formulated the actual charges.   
Those were definitely one of the things that I can 
talk for myself that made me lose confidence in Mr Tsotsi, I 
cannot speak for anybody else.  But if you say it is not one 
of the charges, the charges were formulated based on the 
actual recording of what was discussed on that particular 
day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let me take that further because 
you see some of - at least most of the Board members who 
10 
have provided affidavits to the Commission, they have 
placed on or set out in their affidavits that when the 
Minister arrived on the 11 t h of March 2015, the Minister 
essentially repeated what Mr Tsotsi had said, at least 
insofar as the inquiry is concerned.  
But the Minister went further and identified four 
areas which he said were of concern to her, and said that 
the executives in those areas should step aside while the 
inquiry is ongoing.  My question is, did the Board ask the 
Minister about the report prior to the Board having to take 
20 
a decision?  The report allegedly, the Board wanted Mr 
Tsotsi to produce.  
MS KLEIN:   Chair that is a very difficult question for me to 
answer, you made a call.  I was not at the meeting on the 
9 t h where this not report but where the meeting or what had 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 79 of 294 
 
transpired to get this particular resolution from the Board 
was discussed.  
So when the Minister came in at that point in time 
there was to my knowledge, I did not have any idea about 
the report.  The way I remember that was the report was 
only discussed at the meeting that transpired after the 
Minister had left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if we accept your recollection that 
the report trans – the mention of the report was made only 
after the Minister had left.  Did you consider as the Board 
10 
whether it was necessary to go back to the Minister and 
say, wait Minister before we implement what you have put 
to us should we not follow due process?  Should we not 
first obtain this report, which Mr Tsotsi has told us about 
and then see whether and how we implement what you 
have put to us? 
MS KLEIN:   Well, Chairperson I can only talk for myself. 
But when I heard about the report like I said it may have 
been discussed in the meeting of the 9 t h and I am sure you 
will test that with other members of the Board.  But I first 
20 
heard about that in a discussion when Mr Tsotsi after the 
Minister had left so he told us how much work had already 
been done.  So I would not have thought it needed to go 
back to the Minister because Mr Tsotsi who had effectively 
now had - we have heard the Minister saying that there is 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341

work that needs to happen to get the company stabilised. 
If I could just maybe add on Chairperson whenever 
you sitting here in load shedding stage three, were in 
crisis. The Minister has told us when she first met us, I 
think at the end of December and she told us again, guys 
get a handle on the business. Now we sitting and we facing 
an investigation or an inquiry rather, which quite frankly I 
supported when I heard all about it because I thought it 
would be a way of ruling or getting a line in the sand and 
in understanding what one is dealing with.  
10 
But the report came up later when, if I remember 
that correctly, when Mr Tsotsi was telling us more about 
what he believes or why he believes, you know that we 
need to do this and we need to do this quickly.  So I did 
not think at the time personally I did not see the need to go 
back to the Minister and talk about the report because she 
did not mention the report Mr Tsotsi did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, finally on that, did the Board not 
itself render the report unnecessary?  If we recall Dr 
Ngubane when in response to Mr Norman Baloyi’s question 
20 
to Mr Tsotsi saying: 
“But Chair, you have said there is a report that 
exists, should we not first obtain that report before 
we make the decisions.” 
Dr Ben Ngubane’s response was that: 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 81 of 294 
 
“There might be a report out there but it is not 
Eskom’s report, we must make this decision, it is 
our decision.” 
And the Board ultimately went along with that, within the 
Board itself rendered the report unnecessary. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson on the question on what the 
evidence leader is asking me now is obviously the report 
was important, you know to us because it was certainly 
used as motivation to say guys you got to kick start the 
process.  But like I said is the charges that were 
10 
formulated against Mr Tsotsi was based on the recordings 
of the discussion of that day, which is possibly why he was 
not charged with it because it could be like to say, maybe 
that was part of the reason he was not charged with this 
because another Board member maybe felt that let us just 
move ahead and get this done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  In regard to Mr Norman 
Baloyi who it seems was a troubled child for the Board 
from the very beginning.  Can you recall why the Board 
moved for his removal? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson I do not think that I actually 
addressed it in my affidavit at all advocate, Chairperson if 
you can help me I do not think I addressed it in my affidavit 
so I am going to speak from memory if that is okay with 
you. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 82 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if you can. 
MS KLEIN:   At the time when…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can if you can remember but if 
we need to go and have a look at the document then we 
will have a look. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, okay, please direct me if there is a 
document.  But I do not think that I addressed it in my 
affidavit.  I do not think that I would have called Mr Baloyi 
a problem child.  What I think I myself that is talking here, 
is that the Board would make a decision and after the 
10 
Board decision was made - and understand how difficult it 
is, as a Board member sitting there not every decision is 
made in agreement with you.  
At the end of the day, whether you agree or not you 
kind of need to accept that the majority of the Board 
members have made this decision and if you go - you 
cannot constantly be objecting of that sorry I do not agree; 
I do not agree.  There are certain times in critical decisions 
gets made then you do that. But what I battled with 
personally and like I say I am talking from memory is that 
20 
we would agree as a Board on various things, we would 
then later on the same night get emails and email trails - 
and Chairperson I think you would be in a better place 
because you probably got Mr Baloyi’s affidavits where he 
will then disagree with what the agreement was earlier in 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 83 of 294 
 
the day.  I mean can I give you an example maybe just to 
demonstrate the point.   
On the removal of Mr Zola Tsotsi we had gone 
through an entire discussion, which obviously the attorneys 
allow them to use to then formulate the charges because 
we just formulated it.  Norman Baloyi then comes and adds 
on what he thinks must goes into it and I think that made 
you know, fulfilling the fiduciary responsibility very difficult 
to add stuff on after you know, after a Board meeting.   
And I think that was if you are asking my opinion I 
10 
am talking from, I am talking from my memory and total 
recollection right now but I think that to me was the 
charge.  Chair, I hope that answers the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, yes I recognise the 
disadvantage because you have not dealt with it in your 
affidavit. 
 
I 
am 
going 
to 
move 
on 
Ms 
Klein 
just 
by…[intervene] 
MS KLEIN:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, insofar as the Board members are 
20 
concerned, your fellow Board members, did you have any 
relations 
any 
interaction 
with 
them 
prior 
to 
your 
appointment on the Board, Eskom Board and the 11 t h of 
December 2014? 
MS KLEIN:   No, Chairperson I did not know one of them.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 84 of 294 
 
Other than obviously the only person that I could say that I 
know something about was Romeo Kumalo because I mean 
he was a public figure but beyond that, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you did not know him personally? 
MS KLEIN:   No, no I never met him personally. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Any of the Gupta brothers? 
MS KLEIN:   No, sir never met them.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you come to know them during 
your time serving on the Eskom Board at a personal level? 
MS KLEIN:   No, never met any of them, no never. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Salim Essa? 
MS KLEIN:   Like I said in my affidavit I was at one of the 
breakfast and I was introduced to him but beyond that no, I 
never got to know him personally. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what breakfast was this? 
MS KLEIN:   It was one of those breakfasts that I think 
Eskom was, you know, one of those EMA things I think so, 
it was at a particular breakfast I remember him coming up 
and introducing himself at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say in your affidavit it was 
20 
during about March, April 2015? 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you did not know him before then? 
MS KLEIN:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Minister Lynn Brown? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 85 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:   Minister Lynn Brown Chairperson I got to 
know in my job as head of retail, bank of ABSA.  We had a 
couple of functions and because of her profile she was 
invited to one or two of them and that is where - if I 
remember correctly, the first time I interacted with her 
personally was with the opening of Private Bank in the 
...[indistinct] of the Baxter, that is the first time I actually 
got to meet her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So did you come to know her on a 
personal level? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson obviously I got to know her better 
when I became a member of the Board of Eskom because 
there were always meetings that I was invited to where she 
was present. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and the former President Jacob 
Zuma prior to your appointment on the Board, did you know 
him personally? 
MS KLEIN:   No, I did not but in my time at Eskom I also 
went onto the Board of the Reserve Bank and I attended a 
meeting with the former President at his residence when 
20 
we had to go and discuss with him – I was the Chairperson 
of the Remuneration Committee of the Reserve Bank and 
as that I was called upon to go with the Governor and one 
or two other Board members to go and discuss the renewal 
of the contract of one of the Deputy Governors. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 86 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Now there is an issue I want to 
draw to your attention before we go into the transactions 
because it is relevant to what I have, what I am dealing 
with now.  And this is what Mr Koko says in his submission 
is an invitation you made to him to come to your home, to 
your house.  You know about that allegation? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If I could read to the Chairperson to put 
the Chairperson on the same page just before you respond 
to that allegation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay please do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is in Eskom Bundle 15 – Eskom Bundle 
15(b) on page 10 – 1039.  Ms Klein I know I have provided 
you with this affidavit or submission. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes – thanks Chairperson I am just trying to pull 
it up on the screen myself but the – okay (not audible). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair just read – I will read what he says 
there.  Page 10 – Eskom Bundle 15(B) page 1039 the black 
pagination 
Chairperson 
paragraph 
147 
is 
Mr 
Koko’s 
submission 
to 
the 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
Committee.  
20 
Paragraph 147 says: 
“Ms Klein has in – has in the proceedings 
before the Portfolio Committee attempted to 
put me in a bad light because she harbours 
resentment against me as a result of the fact 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 87 of 294 
 
that I had refused to assist her husband Mr 
Harold Klein procure a project management 
contract for his company in respect of the 
conversion of Eskom’s diesel driven OCGT 
Generation plants to gas driven plants.” 
Paragraph 148 on page 1040. 
“Ms Klein during the second week of January 
2017 after I had been appointed interim GCE 
phoned me and requested that I should meet 
with her at her home in Mooikloof Pretoria.  
10 
She stated that she had a private issue that 
she wanted to discuss with me.  I complied 
with the request and met with Ms Klein at her 
home on Saturday 14 January 2017.  Her 
husband participated in the meeting.  They 
informed me that they had a problem and Ms 
Klein said that she needed me to solve it.  
They explained the problem as being that Dr 
Klein’s company had tendered for project 
management contracts on the conversion of 
20 
the OCGT units to Guess Projects.  It was 
not getting the jobs.” 
Ms Klein what is OCGT? 
MS KLEIN:  Open Cycle Gas Turbine sorry I am not the 
technical person please do not just ja.  Open – open cycle 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 88 of 294 
 
gas turbine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. Then I carry on reading. 
“Ms Klein said that she had taken her ABSA 
pension money and had invested it in her 
husband’s business and he now could not get 
Eskom contracts due to her being a director 
of Eskom while his competition was getting 
these – his competition was getting these 
irregularly.  Ms Klein stated that she wanted 
me to do something about it.  I was surprised 
10 
by what she put across because it was 
contrary 
to 
every 
Eskom 
rule 
regarding 
conflicts of interest.  I informed her and 
husband that I had no knowledge of the 
intricacies of the conversation – conversion 
project at that time or any irregularities in 
relation to the awarding of tenders in respect 
thereof.  I told her that I would however look 
into the matter.  I then phoned Dr Klein on I 
believe Monday 16 January 2017 and I 
20 
arranged a meeting with him.  I for purposes 
of 
meeting 
– 
of 
the 
meeting 
called 
in 
Eskom’s 
Chief Audit Officer as well as 
members of the OCGT Guess Conversion 
Project team.  I introduced Ms Klein to them 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 89 of 294 
 
– Mr Klein to them when he arrived and 
asked him we hear him out regarding his 
complaints.  I then stepped out of meeting.  
Ms Klein’s attitude towards me tinged from 
that time.  She must have expected that I 
would course the contracts that had allegedly 
been irregularly awarded to be channelled to 
her husband.” 
Ms Klein can you comment on that? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson let me ask you do you have my 
10 
supplementary 
affidavit 
that 
was 
after 
that 
had 
been 
presented to Parliament I put through an affidavit to 
Parliament dealing with the exact matter.  Do you have that 
in front of you as well?  I mean I can talk you through it but I 
am just asking do you have that because it was 00:05:18. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson I received the affidavit from 
Ms Klein we have it but it is not – it has not been 
incorporated in the bundle yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you want to do that now so that it 
is in when any reference is made to it – we know it is in. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We could certainly do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you do not have enough copies? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think my – my – one of our investigators 
will run copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Let that be done. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 90 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be better … 
MS KLEIN:   I am happy to respond Chairperson in the 
meantime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just respond and then when the affidavit 
comes we can see whether you wish to add anything. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Alright, alright.  Thank you Chairperson.  If you 
could – I refute Mr Koko’s version completely.  Let me put it 
to you this way you know it is – I know that this is not a life 
10 
matter but you know in front of this really commission I was 
literally accused of bringing Mr Koko back you know or 
literally on my volition which obviously is not true. 
 
So why would I wait literally fifteen months to ask Mr 
Koko for business for my husband in the first place would be 
my response.  But now let me just deal with the matter that – 
that the evidence leader put to me. 
 
The reason Mr Koko was called and he was not called 
to my house – my husband was on a panel of project 
managers that had been appointed by Eskom in that time.  
20 
So it is not like – I would not ask him to work with none of 
them.  My husband has been appointed as a Project Manager 
because he – he holds a Doctorate in Civil Engineering.  So 
he was appointed as a specialist if you will.  
 
During that time in fact before Mr Koko became the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 91 of 294 
 
acting CEO my husband’s company and by the way you can 
go and check all the conflicts of interest.  I had a record of 
that time after time that you know he was on this particular 
panel.  He was then given a piece of work to provide Eskom 
with a number of civil engineers for particular work that 
needed to get done. 
 
When he provided the CV’s of the people those were 
just not good enough.  It was struck off.  Whilst all this toing 
and froing was happening my husband got a call from 
somebody by the name of a Gavin Sheer or if my memory 
10 
serves me correctly I am talking from memory here now.  
Gavin Sheer who said something like this to my husband; he 
said look I am working for Eskom your company has been 
given the opportunity now to find these specialists to work 
on OCGT’s but this is how it is going to go.  And please 
excuse me if I do not get the numbers right because I am 
talking purely from memory now.  
 
What he said was – or what he said to Harold was the 
total that you will get paid was something like R1500 an hour 
but the total that you will get as a company is R100.00 and I 
20 
will keep the R1400 because I am already here and you will 
just get the R100.00 per hour.   
 
Obviously because I was a board member my 
husband came to me and says to me what do you think of 
this?  I said well this is nothing short of fronting.  He said so 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 92 of 294 
 
what do we do with it?  I said to him I do not know what to 
do with it but let us try and escalate it within Eskom. 
 
I was not going to take it to the board because I did 
not consider it a board related matter.  It was an operational 
issue.  That all happened at the time when Mr Koko became 
the acting CEO.  Mr Koko was asked to speak to my husband 
in that particular week because everything came to a head 
just after Christmas I think that was January 2017 to speak 
to Mr Koko but because he could not make it he was busy 
obviously now acting as CEO and my husband could not 
10 
make it – it ended up that the meeting happened to be at my 
home. 
 
That was the reason that he came there to point out 
the fronting which he as the CEO had to go and investigate.  
Now by the Monday following that particular Saturday there 
was a meeting and a whole host of people were called to the 
meeting.  Obviously I was not part of it but there was an 
investigation done and Mr Koko did call forensics, audit and 
forensics and a whole range of other people and as part of 
my submission to Parliament with my version this is Mr 
20 
Koko’s version I attached a copy of that report which had 
been redacted which I am sure that the commission could 
call and just see if it was about – if the meeting was – my 
husband was about work for my husband’s company which by 
the way he had already been allocated but it was a whole 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 93 of 294 
 
fronting arrangement or whether it was to get more work 
from Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  We.. 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I hope that brings some clarity to 
the point that evidence leader has raised. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no it does we will have a look at the 
report as well.  I know you have given me the affidavit but I 
do not think it has the attachment – any attachment to it.  
10 
But we can arrange after the hearings. 
MS KLEIN:  It was    yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MS KLEIN:  We can – look apparently it was sent Advocate 
but we can certainly make sure that all the other things will 
be sent to you as well if you do not have it.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  Now let us go into the 
affidavit on transactions – the evidence that you set out 
there. 
 
And 
we 
start 
first 
and 
foremost 
with 
this 
cooperation… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you say the evidence she sets 
out where? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She sets out in the affidavit Exhibit 
U14.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 94 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is Eskom Bundle 1 page 400.43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 15 will not be necessary anymore 
or will it come back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It will not be necessary anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the extent to which I needed to 
refer to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay you may continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you.   So we are back in your 
affidavit Eskom Bundle 2 page 400.43.  Ms Klein we – I 
10 
would like you – let us deal with the Cooperation Agreement 
and the Fourth Addendum which was concluded between 
Eskom and OCM owned by Glencore at the time in 2014. 
 
That Cooperation Agreement is intended to make 
certain changes to the agreement that then existed between 
Eskom and OCM in order to increase first and foremost the 
price of coal OCM was selling – the price at which OCM was 
selling coal to Tegeta – to Eskom. 
 
The Cooperation Agreement came to the BTC for 
consideration on the 13t h of April 2015.  You were not a 
20 
member of the BTC, correct? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The BTC did not decide the matter it 
referred the matter to the board.  The board had a meeting in 
Cape Town on the 23rd of April 2015. You recall that? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 95 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:  I do Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This – at this meeting apparently this 
matter came to the board’s attention for decision making and 
we understand that the matter was not decided by the board 
as well but that the board referred the matter to Mr Brian 
Molefe.  You recall that? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct.  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now Mr Brian Molefe’s approval the 
secondment – approval for his secondment was only made in 
that meeting of the 23rd by the board.  And the approval 
10 
being made with effect from the 20t h of April 2015 to request.  
Can you tell the Chairperson what were the board’s reasons 
for – well before I ask that question let me ask you this one.  
 
Is it – who would have requested that the matter be 
referred to Mr Molefe instead of being decided by the board? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but who would have suggested on the 
board that the matter be referred to Mr Molefe instead of 
being decided by the board?  Can you recall? 
MS KLEIN:  No I do not.  As I said in my affidavit I do not 
20 
recall who made it but I can certainly tell you why I 
supported it if that is going to be your next question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes you can go into it. 
MS KLEIN:  Alright.  Chairperson what was being brought to 
the board was something that to my mind at the time 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 96 of 294 
 
management after having taken it to BTC where for some 
reason or other it was not concluded brought it to the board 
but in drilling down I mean I do not have all the details 
because I did not sit at BTC but if I try and remember this 
thing questions such as extending the tenure of a particular 
contract was one.  The price increase going from I think 
R150 to R400 odd where questions were being asked of 
management and he alerts me to this because like I said I 
was not part of the original discussion at BTC. Management 
did not seem to have the answers until when somebody 
10 
proposed that this gets given as an operational matter back 
to the Chair – oh sorry back to the acting CEO at the time. I 
did not see that as a major problem I thought it was probably 
the best thing because management clearly did not have all 
the answers. 
 
Also remember that the tenure of that current 
transaction was until 2018 and we were talking about 2015 
so it was not something that according to my mind needed to 
be drafted immediately.   
 
 
Just by way of record – reference if I can just get 
20 
back a minute or two if you will allow me?  Remember we 
were sitting with load shedding stage 3, we were sitting 
without money, basically we had so many boards in the air 
that for me something that did not need to be decided today 
00:17:38 is okay if management had not got the answers 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 97 of 294 
 
take it off the table and let us deal with the critical matters 
that it could work.  So that is why I would have supported 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  When you say mana – there were 
questions that management did not answer or could not 
answer did the board specifically raise questions with – with 
management?  But I do not want to say management. 
MS KLEIN:  My recollection is that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I narrow it down to the team that 
was negotiating the Cooperation Agreement and the Fourth 
10 
Addendum. Did management raise questions with this team? 
MS KLEIN:  Sorry management or board?  Are you referring 
to board raised questions with … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No sorry the board – did the board raise 
questions… 
MS KLEIN:  That is my recollection.  My recollection was 
there were questions and I personally I can talk just for 
myself.  I got the sense that they did not have all the 
answers and I almost – I remember sitting there albeit a long 
time ago and thinking well that is probably why it is with 
20 
board and not with BTC because maybe this – I thought that 
BTC got was not satisfactory which is why it was brought to 
the board.  I do not know.  But I got a 00:19:02 that the 
questions were not being satisfactorily answered which is 
why it was given back to management to take – to give back 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 98 of 294 
 
into 00:19:11. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well I am – I have put this version 
to Mr Andre Van Heerden who is preparing an affidavit for 
the commission and he - which will be provided to you in due 
course but let me say what he says and I hear your view.  He 
said the team that negotiated and presented to BTC was not 
called to present to do the same in respect of the board and 
did not receive any questions from the board on the matter.  
So that is why I am asking you whether do you personally 
know – whether do you personally know that questions had 
10 
in fact been raised with that team? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson so you – I just need to – you broke 
up just slightly there so you said somebody had – who had 
dealt with it?  You had asked this question of somebody else 
I did not get that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the - I said  Andre but it is actually 
Mr Johan Bester – ja it is actually Mr Johan Bester who was 
involved in the negotiation he testified previously before the 
commission.  He said although they did the presentation at 
BTC they were not invited to do the same for the board and 
20 
that they did not receive questions from the board in regard 
to the Cooperation Agreement and the proposal made by 
OCM.  Hence my question to you whether do you personally 
know 
that 
the 
board 
had 
raised 
questions 
with 
the 
negotiating team? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 99 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson obviously now I do not know what 
Mr Bester – I did not listen to his testimony but let me put it 
to you this way.  It would not be unusual that the negotiation 
team does not recall.  I mean that is why we have got X 
official members of the board.  I would imagine at the time 
whoever was presenting it and it would probably if memory 
serves me correctly has been the acting CEO at that time 
would have probably have been the one sending the 
questions.  I cannot – like I said I do not remember or I 
cannot say who was in the room exactly. But if he says he 
10 
was and very, very clearly the questions was not asked of 
him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As we understand from your affidavit and 
the affidavit of – affidavits of other board members the 
matter was referred to Mr Molefe for the purposes of him 
getting information and giving feedback to the board.  Is that 
also your understanding? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have as the legal team have seen 
from other board members affidavits that they have no 
20 
recollection of Mr Molefe reporting back on the matter to the 
board.  What is your recollection? 
MS KLEIN:  My recollection Chairperson is that I picked it up 
I think it was something under legal in the month of 
September. That is where I picked up the next – you know 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 100 of 294 
 
where I pick it up next.  I am not sure what is – I have not 
read – I have not had the benefit of reading through the 
affidavits of any of the other board members but I remember 
seeing it for the first time in September and it was under 
legal when it looked like this had already progressed quite 
far. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chairperson was in the – what Ms 
Klein is referring to is on page 400.55.  Ms Klein you might – 
you may want to turn there.  But now this is in September 
2015. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 Before 
we 
get to 
and 
will 
see 
Chairperson under 6.3 but before we go to that Ms Klein let 
me ask you this.  Did you know that Mr Molefe had 
terminated 
the 
Cooperation Agreement 
and 
negotiation 
process with OCM in July 2015? 
MS KLEIN:  No Chairperson I was not aware. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were not aware.  So then we come to 
September and you call it a report of the Chief Executive 
Officer.  Are you on that page 400.6… 
20 
MS KLEIN:  It was the legal report.  Yes that is correct 
Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that under paragraph 6.3? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct yes this is the legal update.  The 
CEO report but it is with the legal update. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 101 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay there is a heading there after the 
first 
paragraph 
there 
is 
heading 
Optimum 
Coal 
Mine 
Proprietary Limited and Optimum Coal Holdings Limited.   
MS KLEIN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that the paragraph there under is that 
what you want to refer the Chairperson to? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes that is the one I am referring to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  As where you… 
MS KLEIN:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As where you picked up that he was 
10 
reporting back to the board. 
MS KLEIN:  Effectively because that was his report back to 
the board.  So yes that is the one I am referring to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have read this paragraph and the 
reporting is not of the kind that I thought he was required to 
do.  In fact here it is a report that the negotiations have been 
terminated as opposed to I have obtained information and 
this is what – these are the facts let us decide how to go 
forward with the matter.   
MS KLEIN:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What is your comment on that? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson not being a technical person myself 
I was at that stage it did not look strange to me at all.  I 
mean this is him giving feedback.  Remember the contract 
that was brought to us in – in April spoke about something 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 102 of 294 
 
that was happening at one of the you know – with one of the 
suppliers of coal and they were asking for more money and 
they were asking for an extension of tenure.  So then I 
looked at this I think at that stage to think there was 
anything strange with that.  Obviously now at the benefit of 
hindsight I now realise I should have asked a lot more 
questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Yes but let me hear your answer 
to this.  I accept that that with the benefit of hindsight you 
realised that you should have asked more questions.  What I 
10 
was saying to you is if the board’s decision on the 23r d of 
April 2015 was for him to get information and come back to 
the board – report back to the board what is happening here 
in September is not that kind of reporting.  In fact what he is 
telling you is that he has terminated the negotiations with 
OCM. 
MS KLEIN:  My response to that will be very simple 
Chairperson maybe simple to me but maybe you see 
something else there is that remember we got a board sub-
committee you will remember on the – on the matters of the 
20 
suspensions because of me serving on PMG you already you 
know asked me for many answers.  I expected when I looked 
at this that this is probably had been dealt with would have 
been dealt with at one of the sub-committees.  So it did not – 
it did not come across as strange to me that this was clear 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 103 of 294 
 
or that he should have.  I did expect him to come back but I 
mean the fact that he did not and it was here – and none of 
the other board members raised it I did not find that as being 
strange at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but is that not problematic because 
BTC which is a sub-committee of the board had specifically 
referred the matter up to the board and the board not the 
BTC or any subsidiary for – committee of the board made the 
decision to refer it to Mr Molefe on the basis that he will 
obtain information and come back to the board.  But not to 
10 
make a decision that he made. 
MS KLEIN:  No I – I do hear you Chairperson and I am 
giving you – if you saying to me it is problematic I accept 
that it is.  I understood this at the time because remember 
we sitting with BTC members in the board that if this was the 
incorrect approach or this was wrong that is then would have 
been flagged as wrong.  I just – it was when you asked all 
the questions that I went back to go and reread it that I 
realised that this is the first time it actually came back to the 
board.  And I am not trying to make – I am not trying to 
20 
trivialise the matter but rather to say to you that you – as 
board members we were sitting with many hands in the fire 
dealing with many things at the time.  Now today when I look 
at it and obviously having heard everything I realise we 
should have asked – I should – I thought should have asked 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 104 of 294 
 
more questions here.  So you say problematic I accept that it 
is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes because – the impression Ms Klein 
created and you would know from the investigation by the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee or the oversight role they 
played the impression created is that Mr Molefe was brought 
to Eskom for a particular purpose and that purpose on the 
face of it appears to be to assist the Gupta brothers in order 
to obtain contracts with Eskom.  Do you have any comment 
on that? 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Other than what I have read in the media and 
obviously what has played out in terms of the commission I 
can 
understand 
how 
you 
could 
tell 
me 
that 
this 
is 
problematic.  Further than that I cannot comment because at 
the time when this happened I did not think that it was 
irregular because remember in my mind being a non-
technical person we are talking about something that was 
supposed to only have been decided in 2018 so I did not 
attach any – it has got to be decided now.  But with the 
benefit of having listened to you know different evidence 
20 
pieces and certainly the kind of questioning that you put to  
me I can understand how you can see this was problematic.  
I see it as problematic now.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But what is also more troubling is 
that the impression is created that the board also created an 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 105 of 294 
 
enabling 
environment 
for 
that 
ulterior 
purpose 
to 
be 
achieved.  I mean you as the Chairperson earlier said you – 
some board members may not have known, maybe acted to 
say the least negligently.  There might have been other 
board members who knew what was happening as an ulterior 
motive the real purpose for making certain decisions but I 
am just putting that to you so that you can comment to the 
Chairperson that the more troubling issue is that the board 
which is the gatekeeper or should have been the gatekeeper 
in the exercise of its fiduciary duties making decisions of this 
10 
nature 
that 
you 
nonetheless 
created 
an 
enabling 
environment for some of these decisions to take place.  Your 
comment? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson it is actually very difficult to even – 
sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes your comment, proceed. 
MS KLEIN:  Sorry.  Obviously when I look at things today it 
looks very different to what it looked like back then.  If you 
were to ask me directly whether I was involved or I knew my 
answer to that is no.  If you were to ask me did I see myself 
20 
as enabling this you know all I can say to you is you know as 
board members I can talk for myself.  We were dealing with 
so many different things coming at us.  Load shedding was 
still an issue.  We were dealing with lack of money.  We were 
– it was just coming from all angles so it is really difficult to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 106 of 294 
 
say you know who may have known what other than what I 
knew.  So yes I understand and I do hear you when you say 
this is what emerges but I cannot really comment on that 
because I was part of the board and should I have asked 
more questions on that – now I know that I should have.  But 
way back then you know it is – I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  We need to take the lunch break it is one 
o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the lunch break and 
we will resume at two o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
MS KLEIN:  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson.  We can proceed.  
20 
Ms Klein, you can still hear us? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I can hear you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  I was about to move to the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 107 of 294 
 
second or the – ja, the second point in the transactions 
which is what you deal with on page 400.47, Eskom Bundle 
2.   
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Klein, before I ask you a 
question on this.  It was brought to my attention during the 
lunch adjournment that that report we referred to of 
Mr Brian Molefe, although it was there in the pack to the 
board, it was in fact not presented to the board.  Can you – 
do you recall that? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   No, I do not Chairperson.  All I remember is 
that in going back, being asked questions by yourselves, I 
went and I found that report in amongst the documents in 
my packs.  So if it was not presented, then I cannot 
respond to that.  It certainly was in my amongst my board 
pack, thereabout. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I do not know whether you have 
also a copy of the minutes of the meeting of the 
10 t h of March 2015(sic) which would have ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   10 t h of June? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   10 September 2015.  I beg your 
pardon. 
MS KLEIN:   I can refer.  Do you have a reference point for 
me on it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, remember ...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 108 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:   Because I can go and...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, remember his report is dated 
9 March.  I mean, 9 September.  Sorry. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 9 September 2015 and it was 
meant to be presented to the board on the meeting of the 
10 t h of March(sic).  No, 10 September.   
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I know that you have a collation 
of the minutes of the board meeting.  So I was asking 
10 
whether 
you 
do 
not 
have 
that 
one 
as 
well 
of 
the 
10 t h  of March(sic)? 
MS KLEIN:   Oh, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the 10 t h of September. 
MS KLEIN:   Are you asking me if I have a copy of the 
board meeting with me for the 10 t h of September? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Just hold on.  Let me see if I can find it.  Yes, 
I have Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Under paragraph 8.2 where he 
20 
talks 
about 
the 
Chief 
Executive’s 
report. 
 
It 
reads 
...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was noted ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Seleka.  Are you talking about 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 109 of 294 
 
the CEO’s report or are you talking about the minutes of 
the meeting of ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the minutes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where would I find them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Chairperson will find them in 
Eskom, Bundle 14(C), page...  Bracket C.   
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I do not seem to have that but I 
am happy to listen to what you have got to say and see 
how I respond. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 841. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chairperson? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the Chairperson is getting the...  
And I will just read. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did we forget ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did we forget to allow Ms Klein’s 
lawyers to place themselves on record today? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We did, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall we correct that now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, you are correct there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 110 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and they did tell me they will join 
the meeting.  They will join the hearing but they will blank 
themselves and keep themselves on mute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, there is an understanding between 
the two of you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I will leave it at that. [laughs] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but they can place themselves on 
record Chair.  I think you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Advocate Don Mahon(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV DON MAHON:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Advocate 
Don Mahon instructed by ...[indistinct] attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, let us have 
Ms Klein back. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I have got the minutes that are or 
that...  I do not know what page they start but I have got 
841 in front of me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, they start on page 834. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 111 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The only relevant portion Chair is 841.  
And 
Ms 
Klein, 
you 
are 
back? 
 
Under 
paragraph 
...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just under paragraph 8.2.  It says: 
“The acting CE report as at 7 September 2015 
was tabled for information, details of which 
were included in the meeting pack.  
It was taken as read. 
It was noted that the pack had been distributed 
10 
late and members could direct any queries 
around the acting CE’s report to the acting CE 
and resolve that.  It is noted.” 
 
Well, I understand it was not presented but I see 
they say taken as read.  Can you – do you have – my 
question is whether you recall as to whether or not that 
report was presented? 
MS KLEIN:   No, actually I do not remember Chairperson 
and like I said, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, 
even if I did read it and if I knew then what I know now, I 
20 
probably would have had a lot more questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   But I do not recall that specific point being 
discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 112 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:   I mean, like I said I picked it up when I went 
through my documents when I got your questions.  That is 
when I really went and wrote down. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay thank you.  Now let us get to the 
submission, requesting the board to make the prepayment 
decision of R 1.6 billion.  That submission is drafted and 
submitted to the board on the 8 t h of December 2015.   
MS KLEIN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The board, in terms of that submission, 
is requested to make a decision, to make a prepayment.  
10 
Correct? 
MS KLEIN:   Correct.  Correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have referred to that submission 
which you will find in Eskom Bundle 18(A) on page 281.   
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 281, Eskom Bundle 18(A).  In our 
previous session or the session with the previous witness, 
we went into this submission Ms Klein.  So we are familiar 
with it.  I hope you are also familiar with it? 
MS KLEIN:   I am Chairperson. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are? 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so just to sketch the picture.  This 
document is drafted against the backdrop of negotiations 
between Optimum and Eskom regarding the existing Coal 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 113 of 294 
 
Supply Agreement at the time between the two parties. 
 
Optimum 
goes 
into 
business 
rescue 
when 
it 
appears that negotiations between it and Eskom are 
collapsing in regard to the increase of the coal price. 
 
In that process, OCM seeks to – it gets offer to 
sell its share.  You have at the same time Mr Koko who 
engages with the DMR, drafting a letter a response to 
which would form the basis of the submission as well. 
 
Do you see from his affidavit that the submission 
incorporate that letter to the board? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 8 t h, an email is sent to the 
board, asking the board to make a decision the next day at 
12:00 which is on the 9 t h of September. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To make that decision by way of a 
Round-robin.  Please explain to the Chairperson, what was 
your understanding of this submission in the sense that 
which 
party, 
that 
the 
submission 
proposed 
that 
the 
prepayment be made? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, my understanding was that there 
was this big need to do a prepayment to OCH because of 
the coal requirements. 
 
I must say to you upfront that because of my 
probably lack of technical knowledge I then wrote – I was 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 114 of 294 
 
the one – and I know that there had been other people who 
said that they call for an IFC. 
 
This request was sent to the entire board.  I then 
said, I will only sign this off if we can get an IFC going 
because I wanting Dr Pat Naidoo who is or for me was the 
most technically experienced person, to talk me through 
why something of this nature being R 1.68 billion would 
come to the board with less than 24-hours and see in which 
way the board will make a decision. 
 
I was not comfortable with that and I requested 
10 
that an IFC be hold which obviously was not held 
afterwards and Dr Pat answered the questions that I had. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Talking about the request for 
IFC.  What we see from the documentation provided to the 
commission by the witnesses, is that the member of the 
board who had requested, at least made a request for the 
matter to go to IFC, was Ms Viroshini Naidoo in an email 
reply to Ms Daniels. 
 
We do not see any other member requesting that 
the matter be referred to IFC.  Your comment on that? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson...  Yes, I would like to comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I responded by way of a Whatsapp signed 
document then subject to IFC and I sent that.  I think 
counsel sent that to you, yesterday or the day before.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 115 of 294 
 
Mine was underway over Whatsapp because of the urgency 
of this.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I have not personally received 
that but ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   You have not? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
...you 
could 
send 
it 
to 
the 
investigators. 
MS KLEIN:   It was sent – it was sent to the investigators 
Chairperson.  It was sent two days ago. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two days ago? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay I will ask ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   [Indistinct – distortion], yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So.  But then let us go further in order 
to answer the question now.  What did you understand was 
the 
prepayment 
made 
– 
for 
which 
entity 
was 
that 
prepayment meant for? 
MS KLEIN:   My understanding was always that it was 
meant for OCH who was in business rescue and was 
engaging with whoever but my understanding was that the 
20 
prepayment of R 1.68 billion was for OCH. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   And so in the documents says for the 
liquidating 
of 
their 
debt. 
 
So 
that 
was 
always 
my 
understanding, OCH. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 116 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so by OCH, you mean the 
company that was owned by ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Correct.  OCM.  I am sorry.  OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is fine.  That means the 
company owned by Glencore? 
MS KLEIN:   That was my understanding Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that means – I mean 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, was not there an OCH being the 
holding company at Glencore/OCM?  Was there not a 
10 
holding company called OCH? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you are not necessarily wrong 
Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So by that understanding, just 
confirm to the Chairperson.  That means the prepayment 
20 
was not meant for Tegeta? 
MS KLEIN:   Not according to what I read back and 
understood.  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And what made you understand 
that the prepayment was meant for OCM owned by 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 117 of 294 
 
Glencore and not Tegeta? 
MS KLEIN:   Because when I looked at the writer, it 
actually said pre-purchase of coal to OCM.  That is what 
made me understand that that is where the money was 
supposed to go to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was going to say Mr Seleka, 
please ask the question much directly because we know 
what the whole issues is about.  Ms Klein, I do not know 
whether you might have listened when or watched when 
Dr Naidoo was giving evidence?  Did you?  You did? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I did Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So you know the context. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Executive summary or submission 
that was placed before the board made it clear in 
paragraph 2.1.2 that the board was being asked to 
authorise three officials of Eskom. 
MS KLEIN:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Group CEO, Group Executive for 
Generation and Chief Financial Officer to negotiate and 
20 
conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the 
proposed owners of OCM, that is coal supplier.  You accept 
– do you know that the proposed owners of OCM were 
Tegeta? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, at that time I was not looking at 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 118 of 294 
 
who the proposed owners were.  I cannot argue the words 
away as you correctly say but bear in mind that this 
organisation or this operation was in business rescue.  So 
I did not know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   ...who negotiate ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just repeat the sentence 
with which you started, bear in mind... 
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  I can talk about my understanding at 
the time.  And that is, that this was an operation in 
10 
business recue.  I did not know who the Business Rescue 
Practitioners were talking to or who were the proposed 
owners or not.   
 
The way it was presented to me by management 
was that it was with the OCM or OCH.  That is what was my 
understanding right through the transaction Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you at that time read this Executive 
summary? 
MS KLEIN:   I obviously did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   But from a perspective...   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KLEIN:   From a perspective of, we are dealing with an 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 119 of 294 
 
operation in business rescue.  We are dealing with a group 
that needs money to liquidate their debt.  So I was not...  I 
must admit, I was not looking at proposed owners at all.  
My understanding was always, I am dealing with OCH.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you able to say, as did 
Dr Naidoo, you did see the paragraph, that is 2.1.2, and 
you did notice that it said the agreement was to be 
concluded 
with 
the 
proposed 
owners 
of 
OCM 
but 
10 
nevertheless you understood the issue differently. 
 
Or is the position that you did not take note of the 
fact that paragraph 2.1.2 sought your authorisation as the 
board that the three Eskom officials should conclude an 
agreement, not with the owners of OCM at the time but with 
the proposed owners.   
 
So I just want to establish whether you did see it 
like Dr Naidoo but thought in a certain way or whether you 
read it but you did not take note of what was being said 
here? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Ja.  Chairperson, let me start by saying the 
paragraph that you have referred to giving the Executive 
the right to do what they needed to execute.  That would 
be standard in every resolution because obviously board 
members are not operation.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 120 of 294 
 
 
But having said that, my understanding always has 
been this is a company in distress.  There is a Business 
Rescue Practitioner.  They are interacting with various 
people. 
 
So according to me, my understanding was always 
that I am singing off R 1.68 billion to OCM/OCH.  I never – 
I must say, you ask me now if I see it?  I probably did see 
it but I did not think anything of it because it is a company 
in business rescue where the practitioners would need to 
engage with a whole range of people. 
10 
 
So if I should have taken interested into it because 
that is what you are asking me, then maybe I should have 
but I always, in my head it has been clear, it has been 
OCH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, as I said to Dr Naidoo.  What 
troubles me is that as a member of the board you are being 
asked to authorise quite a large – a payment of a large 
amount of money from Eskom and the document being 
provided to you as the board by management makes it 
quite clear that what they are asking you to authorise is 
20 
the conclusion of pre-purchase of coal agreement with 
people who are not yet owners of OCM. 
 
But it looks like either the whole board saw that 
but did not appreciate or did not note its significance or 
maybe some did not read it but you said you probably read 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 121 of 294 
 
it but you probably did not understand.   
 
And you must tell me if I am putting words in your 
mouth.  Understand its significance.  Am I correct that that 
is the effect of what you are saying? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  Chairperson, all I can say to you is.  
You know, with the benefit of hindsight, I find that the 
wording was actually quite clumsy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   And I always think that management 
purposely putting words there because they were part of 
10 
the IFC when the questions were being asked and being 
deliberated and never... 
 
I mean, that docket packs said this morning.  We 
spoke about why did this happen, why was it necessary.  
Nowhere in that discussion did any of the management say 
to us:  Guys, do not forget that this is going to a different 
person than OCH.  I mean, you can see according to the 
minutes that that was not discussed. 
 
So if you are saying to me I should have paid more 
attention to it, the actual wording...  I do not want to sound 
20 
like a pop-up 
because as a 
board member, I take 
responsibility for the decisions that we make. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   But Chairperson, my understanding always 
was.  A company in distress, in need of money, the need of 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 122 of 294 
 
money urgently.  And that is why we signed it within less 
than 24-hours.  Nowhere in the deliberation was it about 
not going to ever to OCH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see, as I see it, it may well be 
that the whole idea from management that they should ask 
the board to authorise that pre-purchase of coal agreement 
be concluded with the proposed owners of OCM was a 
wrong idea, was a bad idea and maybe much more than 
that. 
 
But it does not seem to me that the board can 
10 
criticise management for having mislead them on that point 
because they put it here. 
 
They did not say owners of OCM.  They said 
proposed owners.  And this was a board, some of whose 
members are quite well-qualified with high qualifications. 
 
And it is just difficult to understand how it is 
possible that so many people on the board did not pick this 
up because...  I mean, you say Ms Klein that paragraph is 
a standard paragraph in your submission.   
 
That I understand because these things are based 
20 
on a certain template or format that you know that if they 
place a submission like this before you, paragraph 1 is 
about what the whole issues is about, paragraph 2 
resolution.  Then they specify. 
 
But I want to suggest to you that that part which 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 123 of 294 
 
says resolution required, and that is where paragraph 2.1.2 
falls under, that must be one of the most important parts in 
this document that board members must look at because 
they know they have been asked to authorise something. 
 
So the first thing they must understand is.  What 
are we being asked to authorise?  And if it is payment, 
there are certain pertinent questions they must look for 
when they look for answers for in this document. 
 
One, what is the payment for?  Two, who is it to be 
made to – who is to be made to?  Why?  What are the 
10 
reasons?  What is the justification?   
 
And the larger the amount that is talked about, the 
higher the obligation on the board or members of the board 
to scrutinise the document properly.  Would you not agree 
with me on all of these propositions? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I completely agree with you 
except for the one point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KLEIN:   That who is it made, who is it made to? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   The who is it made to part, is the part which 
is quite coming for me in terms of the wording. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KLEIN:   Remember we as a board now know about 
OCH being in business rescue. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 124 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   We also know now that they are engaging with 
a whole range of people we do not know who. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KLEIN:   So my understanding, which is why I was – I 
really wanted ...[indistinct - distorted].  Is this something 
that would typically happen?  Is this something that could 
happen?  And I am not satisfied there was.  The who it was 
made to, in my mind – I cannot talk for anybody else – 
business rescuers typically would go out and deal with a 
10 
whole range of people, so I didn’t see that as being 
strange at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   So you’re ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would agree, would you not, that 
if you are a member of a Board, of the Board of an entity 
such as Eskom and you are authorised to, you are asked to 
authorise such a serious, such a big amount to be paid, 
one of your duties is to make sure that you only authorise 
payment of this amount to the right person, because if you 
20 
authorise payment to a wrong party that would be very 
serious, is it not?   So ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   I totally agree with you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what I am suggesting to you which 
would apply to all the board members is there probably was 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 125 of 294 
 
a failure on the part of the board to do its job properly if it 
authorised payment to an entity that if they agreed to a 
request for authorisation to an entity – to one entity but 
they thought they were authorising payment to another 
entity and yet there was a document in front of them telling 
them exactly the entity that the executive management, the 
management, wanted to be paid the money.  Would you not 
concede that? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I completely concede with what 
you have said.  I just want to add that from my perspective 
10 
– and it is not a defence, this is where my mind is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   That is all I can talk – I cannot talk for the 
other board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I accept that. 
MS KLEIN:   We have got a company in distress in 
business rescue.  My understanding with that means that 
the business rescue practitioner is interacting with our 
organisation.  What they have got and who they are doing 
that with is not who I – I do not know because that is not 
20 
what has been put in front of me.  Which is – I go back to 
the wording, I concede with what you say, I do concede, 
the point I am making is, in my mind, I do not know who 
those people are and if I could have asked more questions 
at the time because what I know now, I would never have 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 126 of 294 
 
agreed(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, what I would suggest is 
that if you – you needed to make sure that you authorised 
the right entity to be paid and I suggest that reading this 
paragraph 2.1.2, once you saw that it was saying the 
payment must be to the proposed owners, I think the 
immediate question should have been why pay to proposed 
owners and not to current owners and that is when you 
should have asked management please clarify this, why are 
you saying we must authorise payment to proposed owners 
10 
and not to current owners?  And then if they gave you an 
explanation which you thought was valid, it is one thing, if 
they did not give you an explanation that was satisfactory, 
you may have refused and said well, I am only prepared to 
authorise payment to current owners, so this would have to 
be changed.  Do you understand that? 
MS KLEIN:   I hear you, Chairperson, and like I said, I 
concede with your position.  I, like I said, cannot answer 
for anybody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   I can just talk for myself and my position 
then.  If this was not a business rescue transaction then 
that would have been a very – then I would immediately 
have [indistinct].  I guess from my perspective, so what I 
understood it at the time was that because they are in 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 127 of 294 
 
business rescue they are talking to a whole lot of people 
and maybe this is okay.  So I cannot argue with what you 
are saying, Chairperson, other than that was my position 
for supporting it ultimately which obviously now I know was 
wrong.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I wish I knew then what I know now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, talking of 
a company in distress, what is also maybe of consideration 
10 
for you to comment on is the fact that eight months before 
in April 2015 this very company had indicated that it is in 
distress and it had declared a hardship or invoked the 
hardship clause seeking to get Eskom to increase the price 
of coal, not on a prepayment basis, but on a monthly basis.  
So increase the price of coal from R150 per ton per month 
to I think what I have seen from the affidavits to R442 per 
ton and this is prior to it going into business rescue.  
Could the same sentiment not have applied eight months 
before which you say applied now in December 2015 
20 
because the company is the same insofar as the board is 
concerned? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, like I said to you, I think – I 
heard your question and I reckon it probably would have, 
the same sentiments would have applied but remember at 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 128 of 294 
 
the time when that came to us, it was not seen as a matter 
of urgency we were told that this contract runs until 2018 
and my understanding was if this was really a case of, you 
know, they can go out of business tomorrow, out of – ja, 
tomorrow, that we would have – that I certainly would have 
paid more attention to it.  At the time there was not as 
much of a rush to sign anything off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the management – did the board or 
anybody on the board ever ask management what was so 
urgent about this, why was it not brought to the board 
10 
earlier? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, to respond to you, that was the 
reason – I cannot talk for Ms Naidoo but I can talk for me 
finding subject to IFC approval, I needed to understand, 
you know, is this a done thing?  This is a lot of money they 
are wanting us to commit to, why do we need to do it 
immediately and I say Dr [indistinct] gave me comfort in his 
explanation based on his many years of working for Eskom 
and knowing the organisation better than anyone else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what is the answer to my question, 
20 
is it that members of the board did ask this question of the 
executive and if so, what answer did the executive give as 
to why they did not bring this issue to the board earlier? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I cannot answer that for you, I 
cannot tell you for sure that that is the question that was 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 129 of 294 
 
asked of the executive.  I remember requesting an IFC and 
I hear another board member also did and that was - you 
know, was discussed as per the minutes.  I do not 
remember asking executives why this was such an urgent 
thing.  I wanted to hear that from a follow board member 
who had worked at Eskom and understood the running and 
mechanics of Eskom better than certainly than I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, indeed, that question is very 
significant, Ms Klein, because when you look at the 
timelines the company, OCM, went into business rescue in 
10 
August 2015 and this is before the report that was tabled 
by the Chief Executive – Acting Chief Executive Officer at 
the meeting of the 10 September 2015.  So if there was 
anything urgent, by virtue of going into business rescue, 
that urgency would have arose at that early stage. 
MS KLEIN:   I hear you, Chairperson, I really – I cannot 
really comment on that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because it seems to be given as a 
reason.  If you read paragraph 2.2.1 of the submission 
document on page 281, Eskom bundle (8) A, it says: 
20 
“Eskom faces a supply risk of coal to the Hendrina 
power station of 5.5 Mtpa by OCM as a result of 
business rescue proceedings.”  
But by this time business rescue had long started in August 
already. But …[intervenes] 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 130 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:   Like you pointed – sorry, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, go ahead. 
MS KLEIN:   I said like you correctly pointed out, at that 
time it was not top of mind for me.  I had been in a board 
meeting in April where it was brought in for discussion, it 
was referred back to the CEO.  As you have correctly 
pointed out it was not even presented, it was taken as 
read, so this was not top of mind for me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   That this was something that is in business 
10 
rescue until it arrived on the 1 s t – or sorry, the date in 
December.  So, you know, it is not something that I could 
have argued at the time because it was not top of mind.  
So you say to me now it should have been mind, the reality 
now, now I realise it should have been but it was not at 
that stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you proceed, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know whether the summary of 
20 
facts which is on page 282 was going to deal with this but I 
am looking at 2.2, the executive summary and conclusion.  
That point made in paragraph 2.2.1 does not tell the board 
the degree of urgency, it says: 
“Eskom faces a supply risk of coal to the Hendrina 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 131 of 294 
 
power station of 5.5 Mtpa by OCM as a result of 
business rescue proceedings.” 
It does not say if you do not approve today, in a week’s 
time there will be no coal.  It does not say whether this is 
something that is going to happen in three months time, in 
two months time.  You understand, Ms Klein? 
MS KLEIN:   I heard you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, Mr Seleka, you might know 
whether this issue of the level of urgency is dealt with as 
well in the executive summary. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, can I maybe respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I am sorry, advocate, can I maybe respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I understand that we are sitting in an 
organisation which was in dire straits just months before 
that with load shedding.  We are being guided by 
executives, when they say to you they need something 
signed tomorrow, I mean, it is not for me as a board 
member to come and say but hold on, guys, you know, we 
20 
are not going to sign this.  I mean, urgency was something 
that I took very, very seriously.  If management comes and 
says something is urgent, then it is urgent, which is why I 
called – phoned the IFC and as you correctly say, you 
know, Ms Naidoo also wrote about that, and I wanted an 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 132 of 294 
 
explanation before I signed, Dr Naidoo, you’re working for 
this organisation for more than 30 years, tell me what this 
is what we are signing.  Why is this urgent?   
So, Chairperson, I am not sure if that that answers 
your question about the fact that he did not say it was 
urgent, I was guided by the fact that I am asked to sign for 
something within less than 24 hours and that is what I was 
responding to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, my – what I have an issue 
with in terms of what have said, is to the extent that you 
10 
may be saying if management says it is urgent then I take 
it it is urgent.  I do not think that is correct, I think that as 
a board member you must satisfy yourself that it is indeed 
urgent.  So if management says this is urgent, you say why 
is it urgent?   They give you an explanation, if you are 
persuaded it is urgent that is fine especially if it is 
something in respect of which you would have liked to have 
more time to reflect like authorising payment of such a 
large amount of money, 1,6 billion.   
So if they cannot satisfy that it is so urgent that it 
20 
has got to be signed today, it can be signed in a week’s 
time, you might say well, you know, a few days will help me 
to make up my mind properly on the submission, so why 
are you saying we must meet today at whatever time.  You 
understand what I mean?  I do not think that just because 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 133 of 294 
 
management says it is urgent then board members must 
not question, they must take it it must be urgent.  You 
understand that? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I hear you completely, I just 
want to put it on record that I considered it to be urgent 
after hearing from somebody who works at Eskom for 30 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   That this was… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   But I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   I should have maybe asked more questions,  
but – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, of course he did not tell you 
the level of urgency, did he?  He did not say if it s not done 
within – if it is not done today this is what is going to 
happen tomorrow or in a week’s time or anything like that, 
20 
he did not tell you that. 
MS KLEIN:   No, no, he did not, Chairperson, but I – let me 
put to you, and maybe incorrectly so, the mere fact that the 
ISP was arranged so urgently gave me comfort that this 
thing is what it said it was and maybe, you know, a lot of 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 134 of 294 
 
what is coming today, one stands back and say, you know, 
I should have asked more and I should have done.  Just a 
pity I did not know more at that stage about what was 
really happening, clearly behind the scene. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The closest, Chair, 
one comes to in regard to urgencies on page 284, under 
paragraph 3.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The degree of urgency, if there is 
10 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It reads: 
“Risks and other considerations.” 
The paragraph there says: 
“The risk identified at this stage relate to security of 
supply being compromised, regulatory approvals not 
timeously obtained and that there would be no 
contract in place by end December 2016.” 
Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was on the 9 December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is on –well, the submission is 
dated the 8 t h. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 135 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Given to the board to make a decision 
on the 9 December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I mean, another day – if members 
of the board wanted another day to reflect properly would 
not have made a big difference.  Okay, alright. Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But, Chair – Ms Klein, I do not know 
whether you are aware of this, the facts on the other side 
on OCM’s part is that they were engaging with Mr Koko and 
by this time, when he writes this document to the board, he 
10 
had been advised on the 24 November and on the 1 
December 2015 that Glencore has taken a resolution to 
take OCM out of business rescue and it will provide 
funding to OCM and OCM will honour their agreement as it 
then existed to the end of that agreement, December 2018.  
Did you know about that? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, if I knew about that I would not 
have signed this.  I was not aware of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And in fact when you read the affidavit 
of the legal representatives of Eskom who advised Eskom 
20 
on these transactions between OCM and Eskom itself, that 
is CDH, they say in their affidavit that OCM continued to 
supply coal to Eskom from August 2015 and they put it to 
July 2016.  It may well be that it is shorter than that, April 
2016, because after April Tegeta takes over but the period 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 136 of 294 
 
in December, in January, February, March is covered by 
OCM supplying coal to Eskom.  Did you know that? 
MS KLEIN:   No, Chairperson, I would only have received 
the information as per the board packs, nobody ever 
discussed it with me.  Maybe – I do not know, maybe your 
BTC members would have been warned, you know, I cannot 
respond that, I [indistinct] of that including the legal 
opinion which obviously did not come to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Then the next day, the 10 
December, there is – a prepayment resolution is used to 
10 
obtain – I mean, to do a conversion to a guarantee, a 
guarantee of the same amount but not to OCM, guarantee 
to be issued in favour of Tegeta, the very next day on the 
10 December 2015.  Was the board aware of that? 
MS KLEIN:   Certainly not, Chairperson, it has all become 
part of, you know, the investigations and things but the 
board – well, I cannot talk for the board, I certainly was not 
aware. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you and/or the board make any 
follow-up in regard to the decision that was made on the 9 
20 
December 2015 and, by the way, this was decision made by 
way of a round robin, the board didn’t meet to discuss and 
ask questions.  Did you make a follow-up?  We have made 
a R1 billion decision, over a billion rand decision, what is 
going on?  Is OCM out of business rescue?  Are we getting 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 137 of 294 
 
supply, have we avoided load shedding?  Those questions 
to the executives.  Were they asked? 
MS KLEIN:   Certainly not and just so that – just to remind 
you that load shedding had stopped, if I remember 
correctly, either August or September of that year.  So we 
would not – I mean, once something like that – and we 
could say in terms of quantum, it is huge, which it is, but 
remember, we are talking about a company with R175 
billion turnover, we were brought a lot of big transactions 
to sign and once it was signed off it would have been 
10 
ratified – obviously, the resolution would be ratified at the 
next board meeting but we had been rapped over the 
knuckles how many times for becoming operational.  So to 
answer the question, I would not have gone back and 
asked.  I satisfied myself at the time, rightfully or 
wrongfully so, that that was what was required for the 
business but I would certainly not have gone and done a 
follow-up, there was just too much going on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What do you say about – because the 
people we see involved in the guarantee on the side of 
20 
Eskom is Mr Anoj Singh, Ms Caroline Henry, who prepared 
the submission, is Ms Suzanne Daniels who ultimately put 
together this guarantee, get it to the bank, the bank issues 
a guarantee in favour of Tegeta and then the underlying 
agreement is signed for the pre-purchase of coal by Mr 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 138 of 294 
 
Anoj Singh.  And just before I ask you this question – 
sorry, I am reminded of something, did Mr Anoj Singh take 
part in the IFC meeting, the teleconference?  He did? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chairperson, he was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he was privy to discussions at IFC.  
MS KLEIN:   He was there, he definitely was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, then he takes part in the 
guarantee.  Do you have anything to say about that, about 
his conduct? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, all I can say to you, you know, 
10 
with the benefit of hindsight, I am actually perplexed that 
what 
I 
believed 
I 
signed 
was 
something 
completely 
different.  I would be keen and I actually [indistinct] to see 
what the guarantee that was issued to the bank actually 
looked like and how that compares with what we were 
given as a board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay, I want to move on to the 
next point in your affidavit, the next and last point, on page 
400.49, Eskom bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that, is the position not 
20 
that – and I am asking you, Mr Seleka, not the witness 
because the witness might not know.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position not that around about 
exactly the time when the board was asked to authorise 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 139 of 294 
 
this pre-purchase agreement, to authorise prepayment to 
Tegeta, namely they met on the 9 December 2015, is that 
no – was that not the gate on which Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, 
who was then Minister of Mineral Resources, was having a 
meeting 
in 
Switzerland 
with 
the 
Chief 
Executive 
of 
Glencore 
where 
it 
would 
appear 
he 
facilitated 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
deal 
between 
Glencore 
and 
Tegeta/Oakbay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The meeting was on the 1 December, 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting was on the 1 December? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the first meeting is on the 1 
December, it is followed up on the 2 December.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a verbal agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To sell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 10 t h… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The significance of the 10 t h, the date 
of the 10 t h coincides with the conclusion of the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Between Tegeta and Glencore. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Between Tegeta and Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Tony Gupta was to attend that 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 140 of 294 
 
meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know about him attending the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, my recollection is that on the 
day on which Mr Mosebenzi Zwane met with the Chief 
Executive of Glencore in Switzerland… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that was on the 1 December 
2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In that meeting there were three of them, 
Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, Mr Salim Essa and the Chief 
Executive of Glencore. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Glasenberg. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
it 
is 
that 
meeting 
that 
Mr 
Glasenberg says in an affidavit Mr Salim Essa was 
introduced to him as an adviser to Minister Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Minister Zwane, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, if I recall correctly, an 
arrangement was made – I do not know whether in that 
meeting but an arrangement was made for Mr Tony Gupta 
to meet with Mr Glasenberg, I do not know who else, I do 
not know whether the following day or on the 10 t h or 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 141 of 294 
 
whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, that is the meeting of the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So but it is all happening, you 
know, in the first half of December 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, that is the meeting of the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I mean, the signing is on the 10 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the board had just authorised. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the day the guarantee is issued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then the signing happens. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is the signing happening, 
subject to suspensive conditions until the 31 March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The guarantee also has suspensive 
conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The date is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   31 March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the agreement concluded between 
20 
Tegeta and Glencore has a suspensive clause that says 
until 31 March 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, so – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the guarantee that is issued on the 
10 December back in South Africa also has a suspensive 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 142 of 294 
 
clause that shares the same date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The same date, 31 March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because the payment, the full payment 
is due I think on the 13 t h or 15 April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so by the time – so the date of the 
suspensive conditions is made in such a way that it is very 
close to the payment, the full payment date.  That is in 
April 2016.  And that is where you start seeing from the 8 t h, 
10 
before the 13 April, before the 15 t h, from the 8 to the 11 t h 
of April an unprecedented action is taken on the part of 
Eskom to do a prepayment again of 659. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Despite the Board meetings, PTC 
meeting scheduled for the 13 t h ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They push for them to meet on the 11 t h 
at night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes that is the other meeting which 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Dr Nteta was testifying about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They push to have that meeting on the 
night of the 11 t h of April at nine o’clock. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 143 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was that the Board or the BTC? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is BTC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And nobody in the BTC says why are you 
rushing us to a meeting on the 11 t h when we have a 
meeting scheduled for the 13 t h, in two days time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly Chair.  That is exactly what I 
was putting, the version of Mr Khoza I was putting, 
obviously Mr Khoza himself has to answer questions in 
regard to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the coincidence, at least for now 
the impression created is remarkable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Absolutely remarkable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, you follow the discussion 
Ms Klein? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes Chairperson, I must tell you when I 
followed this discussion it just made me feel like I should 
have run away from Eskom long before I actually did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing].   Yes, continue Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein I was referring to page 400, 
point 49 of Eskom Bundle 2. 
MS KLEIN:   400? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    400 point 49, it is the McKinsey 
matter.  I am simply going to read from your affidavit, in 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 144 of 294 
 
paragraph 11 you’re answering a question that has been 
asked to you.  Now you see we’re focusing on a particular 
aspect of McKinsey/Trillian as introduction to Eskom.  We 
have a witness who has testified that when she was at 
Regiments and they were servicing Transnet they had 
meetings with Mr Anoj Singh prior to him commencing his 
duties as a seconded CFO at Eskom, they had meetings 
with him at private hotels, talking about matters of Eskom.   
You may or may not know about it, do you know?    
MS KLEIN:   No Chairperson I don’t.   I have no knowledge 
10 
of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Regiments ultimately the directors or 
shareholders separate and Mr Eric Wood in particular 
incorporate a company called Trillian and he does so 
together with Mr Salim Essa.  They then start or it, Trillian, 
start rendering services to Eskom and you would recall that 
they in fact did not have an agreement with Eskom, 
Trillian. 
MS KLEIN:    Ja, from what I remember they never did.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And some payments were made to 
20 
them without any agreement in place? 
MS KLEIN:   I think that has come out recently Chairperson 
yes.   I am not talking – it is not in my affidavit but I am 
talking to what I can remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes,   In fact Ms Mthepu in her 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 145 of 294 
 
affidavit and her testimony before the Commission is that 
in March 2016 Glencore – not Glencore – McKinsey 
conducted a global review assessment in respect of Trillian 
to determine whether they can have Trillian as a business 
development partner at Eskom, which is a sub-contractor to 
McKinsey and the outcome of their assessment was 
negative and they decided and told Eskom we will not have 
Trillian as a support development partner, did you know 
that? 
MS KLEIN:   No Chairman. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You didn’t? 
MS KLEIN:   I’m hearing it now, I am not aware of this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, well to the extent you have dealt 
with the matter involving McKinsey in your affidavit just tell 
the Chairperson then what you would like to draw to his 
attention, it involves a submission to the Board to make a 
decision on the 10 t h of September 2015 about procuring 
the services of McKinsey. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson from what I remember a 
submission was made to the Board for us to sign off like 
20 
R100 000 for McKinsey.  At the beginning of the – when it 
was put on the table I actually asked to be recused 
because I am a management consultant, when I left ABSA 
in 2010 and started my own company, Klein Management 
Consultants, I was obviously being in touch with various 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 146 of 294 
 
consulting firms, so they obviously get the lion share of the 
work when it comes to Banks, so I spoke to Deloittes, 
KPMG, McKinsey, as well as ...[indistinct – distorted], so 
when I saw something on the table from McKinsey I 
immediately asked to be recused, I said guys I am in 
discussions where I may get a piece of work from McKinsey 
so I did not want to be part of the discussion. 
 
At that stage I was asked you know what is the 
detail of the work and I explained look I am a retired 
banker and they saw that I was obviously engaging to see 
10 
could I require an opportunity that worked in the different 
banks, but I think what complicated matters for me was 
that I went onto the Board of Reserve Bank in August so 
the work that they had planned for me to do could not 
happen in South Africa, it wouldn’t have – it would have 
been in the rest of Africa.  That is the reason I put up my 
hand and said look I don’t want to be part of any McKinsey 
discussion because I made – that is the wording is the 
possibility of a conflict. 
 
Does that answer the question Chairperson? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I was asking a different question 
but because of ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Sorry okay, ask again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No because of the preparation session 
you anticipated another question. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 147 of 294 
 
MS KLEIN:   I’m sorry Chair.   Okay, can I try and answer it 
for you Chairperson if it wasn’t that question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no I will ask that question 
...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   ...[Indistinct – distorted] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He will ask it again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I will ask again. 
MS KLEIN:   Please do, please do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The information as contained in your 
affidavit was that a submission was brought to the Board at 
10 
its meeting on the 10 t h of September 2015 for the sole 
sourcing of McKinsey and that what you have discovered is 
that even as the submission was brought to the Board on 
the 10 t h of September 2015 the agreement had already 
been signed on the 8 t h, is that ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is correct? 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct and I apologise, for ja, that is 
exactly what I said yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I think you do say it was Mr Koko 
20 
who had already signed the sole-sourcing agreement. 
MS KLEIN:   I believe so and if memory serves me well I 
think it was signed with the Chairperson at the time being 
Dr Ben, I think so, I am not ... ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what did they want the Board to do, 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 148 of 294 
 
if the sole-sourcing agreement is already signed a few 
days prior even coming to the Board. 
MS KLEIN:   Well remember at the time I was not aware 
that had already gone, the sole-sourcing agreement had 
already been signed.   My understanding was that we were 
signing off for McKinsey to help us with the Corporate plan 
and the reason I didn’t think there was anything wrong with 
that is because previously, the previous Board also had 
help in getting the Corporate plan effected to sign off all 
levels and it goes into the public domain. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh so you were not aware at the time. 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry, maybe I didn’t get the question right 
Chairperson, can you just then ask the question – was I 
aware of the sole-sourcing agreement in paragraph 8, is 
that the question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.   
MS KLEIN:   No I was not aware. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were not aware. 
MS KLEIN:   No I was not aware Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay then let’s go to the question you 
20 
anticipated and you answered. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  I apologise Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No that is alright, regarding your – 
what you refer to as a potential conflict of interest, and I 
pick that up from Mr Khoza’s affidavit as I indicated to you, 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 149 of 294 
 
that in the meeting there was talk about, or you raised that 
you might have a potential conflict of interest because 
according to him you were in negotiations with McKinsey to 
render services to McKinsey. 
MS KLEIN:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, however the minutes of the 
meeting record that you had in fact done work for 
McKinsey, now can you explain that ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   That is correct. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Would 
you 
please 
explain 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Yes I  - ja I think the first part of that 
sentence actually quotes me where I said I wanted to be 
recused because there could be a potential conflict of 
interest, like I explained I was looking to do a piece of 
work for them in the banking system in South Africa, but 
then I went onto the Board of the Reserve Bank in August 
of that year which is why I could not then carry on doing 
the work, so we were talking at that stage about me doing 
a piece of work in the financial services sector outside of 
20 
South Africa.  I had never done any work for McKinsey, we 
were still busy negotiating at that stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes I want us to refer the Chairperson 
to that minute, can you recall it? 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry, sorry Chairperson? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 150 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minute where the conflict, the 
potential conflict is reflected, I want us to refer the 
Chairperson to that. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes it was on the 10 t h of September, I think 
that was the date, ja the 10 t h of September. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, get to the page where he deals 
with McKinsey.  I want you to find and read it to the 
Chairperson Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:   Are you asking for me to – sorry.  Right let me 
read it to you, it says: 
10 
“Ms Klein declared a possible conflict of interest in 
her company, in that her company did some work for 
McKinsey.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, give us ...[intervenes]   
MS KLEIN:   But what I am saying to you is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Give us the page reference.  The page 
reference. 
MS KLEIN:    I don’t have the page, I don’t have that in 
front of me, I am reading it from the screen, remember you 
sent me everything in digital form ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Speak up a little bit Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, I see she is 
struggling to hear me. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson what I am saying is I received it 
in digital form, but I cannot give you a page reference. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 151 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, you heard that Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did.  Yes I am looking for that minute 
where it is recorded Chair, because it is important what is 
recorded there vis-a-vis what Ms Klein is explaining, but 
just read it to us because the minutes of the 10 t h of 
September don’t seem to have that, isn’t it a different 
...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Ja, it says – do you want me to read it 
Chairperson? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes please. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   It says: 
“Ms Klein declared a possible conflict of interest in 
that her company did some work for McKinsey.   
Members agreed that there was no conflict of 
interest and declined her request to recuse herself 
for the discussion.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so the minute explicitly says 
potential conflict in that you said the company did some 
work for McKinsey. 
MS KLEIN:   That is what the minute says Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, are you saying – but what are you 
saying about that?   Is that a correct reflection? 
MS KLEIN:   I am saying I [inaudible – no sound] no, the 
first part of it is the possible conflict of interest is correct, 
the ...[indistinct] is absolutely not correct because I did not 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 152 of 294 
 
do any work for McKinsey for which I was paid. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you – did you recuse yourself 
from the meeting or not? 
MS KLEIN:   I wanted to recuse myself but after explaining 
like I did to you earlier that is what they – possible work in 
the financial – not possible – work in the financial services 
sector which was originally going to be in South Africa but 
when I went onto the Board of the Reserve Bank in August 
of 2015 the discussion with McKinsey became doing work 
for them in the rest of Africa, when the Board heard that 
10 
they were comfortable that there was no conflict of interest 
and asked me not to recuse myself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you do work with McKinsey after 
that? 
MS KLEIN:   No, I have never done work with McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson that concludes the 
questions I have for Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I saw that in her second affidavit she 
deals with a matter that I am not sure she has dealt with in 
oral evidence, am I wrong about that?   It is about the 
20 
matter that and the suspension letters that she got from Mr 
Khoza which it looks like there has been a ...[indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She testified about it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, did she cover that last time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes she did, and ...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 153 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what you haven’t done I guess is 
to get the expert who did the analysis to come and testify. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, that is what we haven’t done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think you should work on that, 
because they have got the report already, it shouldn’t be – 
it shouldn’t take long for them to be available. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I think that is important that an 
expert gives evidence who conducted the analysis and is 
able to justify the conclusions that they reached with 
10 
regard to saying that the letters of suspension seem to 
have been dealt with or dealt with ...[indistinct] by Suzanne 
Daniels as well as Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s what they seemed to have had 
those letters – so that is important, I think that should be 
given some priority. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Ms Klein, we 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He doesn’t want me to release you.   Yes 
Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That supplementary submission Ms 
Klein referred to I thought we should just place it on record 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 154 of 294 
 
and admit it as well before she leaves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Didn’t we admit all of them, three or 
two? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is one which she refers to in 
response to Mr Koko’s version that she had invited Mr 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No it is not there yet. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it’s – oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is here, or we can incorporate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well we can – well if you want to add 
it to this bundle at the end that might be convenient. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair I will beg leave to have it 
admitted as – I now the Chairperson doesn’t ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the original or copy? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have the original here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got copies or you don’t have 
copies? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do have my copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And one which I can hand up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me have the original.  Do you want 
to briefly say what it deals with in terms of the gist or is it 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 155 of 294 
 
quite involved?    
ADV SELEKA SC:    It is a – well Ms Klein has given the 
Commission this submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said it is an affidavit, I see 
correspondence here.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, she calls it a submission Chair, it 
is a supplementary submission to be submitted to the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but this one while she may have 
intended it as a statement I think there is a letter 
10 
addressed 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
and 
then 
there 
is 
a 
statement, she has signed it, what you can you do is get 
her to confirm its contents are true and correct under oath 
then we – do we need the first page, the correspondence?   
Oh it starts one, two and then three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is – Ms Klein you can 
assisting us there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it looks like we must just take it as 
it is, this one, there are two, oh this is an annexure to the 
statement. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, those are annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but now why did you staple them 
separately or you had a small stapler that couldn’t ... 
[laughing] you see I think it should only come in here when 
it is properly ...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 156 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let me do, let me right it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you can do is get her to 
confirm it under oath. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Get her to confirm it under oath while 
she is here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well should I do that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think do that and then maybe 
tomorrow morning when it is properly stapled and you can 
then ask that I admit it as an exhibit and you add it at the 
10 
end of this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of this bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay just go ahead then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein what you have provided to 
the Commission it is a document dated 10 April 2018 which 
is on the face of it addressed to the Chairperson of the 
Portfolio Committee of Public Enterprises and you have 
relied on this document or drawn it to our attention as a 
20 
response by you to Mr Koko’s allegations.  Can you hear 
me? 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct Chairperson.

9, the very last page is signed by V J Klein, do you confirm 
that to be your signature? 
MS KLEIN:   I do Chairperson.

refer to this document together with the annexures thereto 
10 
as a response by you to Mr Koko’s version or allegation in

3.26, we have Ms Viroshni Naidoo as the next witness.  We 
could take a short adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can take a short adjournment while 
you reorganise and then – will ten minutes be enough? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ten minutes will be certainly enough 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  What was your estimate 
of how long you might be with her? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
I 
had 
estimated 
three 
hours 
Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am speaking with her, see whether 
we can’t do it shorter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think you took shorter with Ms 
Klein than you had estimated, I am going to assume that it 
is going to be the same with her, but obviously as I always 
say in the end the issues must be dealt with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Properly, but at the same time there is 
no need to take longer than one should. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will adjourn for ten minutes.  
We adjourn.

ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Chair 
the 
– 
ah 
yes 
the 
legal 
representatives and I have spoken about this particular 
affidavit which is a supplementary affidavit of Ms Naidoo.  I 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 163 of 294 
 
received it last night I think it would have been sent during 
the day I cannot recall but to the extent – to that extent 
Chairperson that it was being received that time we have 
agreed and I believe Ms Naidoo has been told as well that 
the issues traversed in that affidavit may have to be dealt 
with at a later stage after the parties who are implicated 
have been provided with a copy of 00:07:26. 
MS NAIDOO:  Advocate Seleka may I please draw the 
attention of the commission to two amendments in my 
affidavit? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes certainly. 
MS NAIDOO:  So on page what is that?  Page 2 paragraph 4 
my articles was not 93/94 that is 95 and 96. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you on the main affidavit? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay let us go. 
MS NAIDOO:  And then on page… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just hang on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Let us get there.  What is the 
page for the main affidavit?  I see where it ends. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 26 – 269.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  Page 2.  On page 2 paragraph 4 the year of 
my articles was 95/96. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I completed my articles at More 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 164 of 294 
 
Naidoo and RC 
MS NAIDOO:  RC  
ADV SELEKA SC:  RC from? 
MS NAIDOO:  95 to 1996. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh 1995. 
MS NAIDOO:  To 1996. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry 1995 should be? 
MS NAIDOO:  1993 should be 1995. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  And 1994 should read 1996. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  1994 should read? 
MS NAIDOO:  1996. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1990? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes it was two years that I did… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1996. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1996? 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 96. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does it affect the next – the 1995 in the 
20 
next line? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does it affect it? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes so that should read High Court in 1997 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 165 of 294 
 
when I was a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is that now the second – the next 
line? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1995 should be 1997? 
MS NAIDOO:  Should read 1997 yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MS NAIDOO:  And then the next one I would like to draw the 
commission’s attention to is on page 2 paragraph 19.3.4 it 
reads: 
10 
“17 February.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry let us get to the 
page first.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
MS NAIDOO:  Oh it is my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Use the… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Use the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Use the pagination on the top left of the 
page to tell us which page we should go to. 
MS NAIDOO:  So in your version… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Black pagination. 
MS NAIDOO:  So it would read:  Eskom 14-269.9 and then 
U29D and 27. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  269.9? 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 166 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay paragraph number? 
MS NAIDOO:  So it will read 19 – paragraph 19.34. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  19.34 17 February 2015? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes so that should actually be 16 February – 
ah no the 17 February it was not a board induction it was a 
meeting – it was a board meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is the correction that should be 
made there? 
MS NAIDOO:  You should delete induction and put in 
10 
meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have to do a supplementary 
affidavit that will … 
MS NAIDOO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Contain all these corrections.  We are just 
making notes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you need to – your Counsel will or your 
Counsel will assist you to do a supplementary affidavit which 
points out the corrections that you have pointed out. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  Okay Chair. Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But have you pointed out all of them now? 
MS NAIDOO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Ms Naidoo.  Chairperson 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 167 of 294 
 
Ms Naidoo is called mainly to deal with the issue of the 
transactions but as an introduction to that we could deal with 
– could lead evidence on your background Ms Naidoo and 
your appointment to the board of Eskom in December 2014 – 
15 – 14 or 15? 
MS NAIDOO:  14. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ja.  Please tell the Chairperson 
your occupation briefly including your – the work you do yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  Chair I am an admitted attorney. I did ten 
years of private practice thereafter I moved to Johannesburg 
10 
and I joined corporate.  I climbed the corporate ladder as 
they say.  I worked for Telkom, Bytes Technology, American 
Tower and Impact Limited.  Around 2014 I applied for the 
board position at Eskom and I was appointed I think it is the 
12t h of December 2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  11 well I do not know in your case but… 
MS NAIDOO:  Oh no I think it was 12 I got the date yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was it 12? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were you – were you appointed to the 
20 
board of Eskom? 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 12t h of December 2014? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I – I see from your affidavit that – ja page 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 168 of 294 
 
269.2 – ja paragraph 3 that you are an admitted attorney 
indeed if you turn the page to 269.3 in paragraph 7 you 
mentioned – well 6 in 2007 I relocated to Johannesburg and 
joined Telkom SOC Telkom as a legal advisor.  In 2008 I left 
Telkom and joined Bytes Technology American Tower SA and 
Impac Limited as senior legal counsel and in the latter two I 
was Group Leader or counsel.  You go on to say in 2000 I 
established the petroleum business which supplied fuel to 
Transnet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not – do you want to spend time on 
10 
that Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No that is all I want to read to you.  What 
I want to ask her is which petroleum company is that? 
MS NAIDOO:  I try – I traded for a very short period of time 
it was for a period of about two years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you could face the Chairperson. 
MS NAIDOO:  Oh sorry Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  It was for about two years so it may have 
ended in 2002 ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but what is the name? 
MS NAIDOO:  Africa 00:14:18 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Africa. Okay.  So I went to your CV which 
is on page 269.58 – 269.58 it starts there but I want to refer 
to page 269.60 because you list the companies that you 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 169 of 294 
 
have worked at but I see in your affidavit there is one 
company you did not mention which is Albertime Pty Ltd the 
period of employment there being from 2015 to 2017 position 
held legal. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is there a reason why it is not being 
mentioned? 
MS NAIDOO:  I think it was just an error. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay what – which company is that? 
MS NAIDOO:  Well perhaps your question in terms of… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Ms Naidoo I think 
you are quite fast.   
MS NAIDOO:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You speak quite fast and you speak quite 
soon after or just before he finishes.  Okay what is an error 
on page 269.60 I seem to have understood that there was 
something – something you were saying was an error. 
MS NAIDOO:  On page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 269.60. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So let me repeat the question Chair so 
20 
that the Chair – in her affidavit she mentions the companies 
that she has worked for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But there is one company which she did 
not mention in the affidavit but it is found in her CV. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 170 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the company’s name is Albertime Pty 
Ltd. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I was asking her how is it that it is 
not mentioned in her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  I am – I – it was probably an error but either it 
could have also been in terms of the question that … 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Phased it. 
MS NAIDOO:  So the questions that the commission had 
sent it was in terms of what we had done prior to being 
appointed.  So maybe that is why I specified all the jobs that 
I had.  This one I was appointed 2015 when I was already an 
Eskom board member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Naidoo I am sorry you will have 
to repeat that. 
MS NAIDOO:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether there is something 
20 
wrong with your microphone or with your voice or both but… 
MS NAIDOO:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it is how fast you are when you speak.  
Ja well – the question was how come 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 171 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not mention Albertime Pty Ltd in 
your affidavit.  Now what is the answer? 
MS NAIDOO:  Chair I think it was an error alternatively it 
could have been my answer in terms of the questions that 
were sent to me by the commission in terms of what roles I 
held prior to joining Eskom.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what is this company? 
MS NAIDOO:  So Albertime is an investment company and a 
consulting business and I joined… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well maybe the – maybe the first 
10 
point is not finalised.  What is it in that question that would 
have made you not to include Albertime? 
MS NAIDOO:  Nothing Chair I think it was just an error 
because I am the one who inserted my CV with you know all 
my details of my employment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no I thought you said there may 
have been something in – how the question from the 
commission was formulated and it is about your role so I was 
trying to understand. 
MS NAIDOO:  If I  - I cannot recall the exact question but I 
20 
know the questions was in terms of what positions we had, 
what 
degrees 
and 
qualifications. 
 
And 
maybe 
my 
understanding was before I joined Eskom.  So that is why I 
stipulated the employment prior to joining Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 172 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:  But – but as I said it was just an error 
because I attached my CV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ms Seleka – Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And – so the next question was 
what does the company do Albertime or did do at the time 
you were there? 
MS NAIDOO:  It is an investment and a consulting company.  
I was employed by Albertime but Albertime had business 
relations with a debt collection business in the intention of 
me joining was to work with the debt collection business.  
10 
But I did not work directly with Albertime I worked actually in 
the debt collection area of the business. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Whose company is Albertime? 
MS NAIDOO:  It is my husband’s company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have picked up from the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee transcript of your testimony that your 
husband is Mr Kuben Moodley. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that he was an advisor to Minister 
Zwane. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this would have been from the 1s t of 
October 2015 to 31 March 2016. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did that present any problem for you 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 173 of 294 
 
serving on the board of Eskom in 2015? 
MS NAIDOO:  Not in 2015; 2016 yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Problem of what sort? 
MS NAIDOO:  So in 2016 there were various articles in 
January concerning Mr Zwane and Tegeta and OCM and what 
you have addressed with Ms Klein the particular visit to 
Switzerland and therefore I was very concerned and – sorry 
Chair I should be speaking to you.  I then wrote to Eskom 
and I said that my husband is an advisor to Minister Zwane 
and I do not think I should be involved in any tenders where 
10 
we award contracts to any mining companies.  And so from 
that period I was excused.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so what transaction was being 
discussed? 
MS NAIDOO:  It was for OCM.   So are you asking what 
transactions happened while I was – during that period? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No this particular one where you said.. 
MS NAIDOO:  In January there was articles with Minister 
Zwane making his trip to Switzerland. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes and you tell the board in which 
20 
meeting about which transaction? 
MS NAIDOO:  I did not tell them in a meeting I wrote to the 
company secretary around January and I said I – you know I 
think – at first I did not think that there was a conflict 
because we are very different enterprises but after that 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 174 of 294 
 
article and there was so much involvement I felt I should not 
be involved in any transactions leading to mining companies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  So then the… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I understand now what you are saying. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes so the first tender meeting for February I 
excused myself when they awarded contracts for mining 
companies and I know one of those specific companies was 
OCM.  Then in March I brought it to their attention again but 
they were not appointing any tenders in the March meeting 
10 
they were only doing strategies.  The board deliberated and 
said I could attend that meeting or should I say continue in 
all the transactions which I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What was the board’s view when you say 
you did not want to be involved in any transactions involving 
mining companies? 
MS NAIDOO:  The board deliberated but they respected my 
exclusion or wanting to be you know excluded from those 
meetings so it was agreed that I will be allowed to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – so why is it a problem only in 2016 
20 
because he is appointed on the 1s t of October 2015 and here 
you have a transaction coming up on the – in December on 
the 9t h of December 2015 involving a mining company Tegeta 
or OCM? 
MS NAIDOO:  I did not really see a conflict as such because 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 175 of 294 
 
it is not like we were discussing what we were both doing.  
There was no sort of interaction or association in terms what 
the Department of Minerals and Energy was doing together 
with what Eskom was doing.  Even I will be honest with you 
when that matter for the pre-purchase came to me I did not 
for one second believe there could be a conflict.  But 
however in January when I saw there were the articles about 
Minister Zwane being involved with the company that you 
know was dealing with Eskom I was very uncomfortable and I 
felt you know I should actually excuse myself. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well and the article was obviously 
reporting on what had already happened. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Mr Zwane had gone to 
Switzerland on the 1s t of December.  He was there on the 2 n d 
December and had made it possible for the deal between 
Tegeta, Oakbay and OCM Glencore to be concluded – struck 
– the deal to be struck.  Insofar as you say the company 
Albertime was an investment and consulting company you 
rendered investment consulting services did the company 
20 
have anything to do with Tegeta related entities? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not Tegeta sorry the Gupta related 
entities. 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 176 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oakbay, Tegeta. 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Nothing at all.  How did you get 
appointed to the board would you tell the Chairperson – of 
Eskom? 
MS NAIDOO:  Chair around end of 2014 I started applying 
for board positions and I applied for the Eskom board 
position and then I was contacted by a Ms Rothnam who 
advised me that you know I had been nominated and do I 
accept the position.  After deliberation I did. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes were you – was this the first board 
you had to serve on? 
MS NAIDOO:  No I have served on other corporate boards – 
commercial boards. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But never in SOE? 
MS NAIDOO:  No, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  How did you come to know about it? 
MS NAIDOO:  There was an article in the newspaper. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh.  Was this the first time you came 
across an article that indicates – or what is the effect of the 
20 
article that they… 
MS NAIDOO:  It is applying for an Eskom board position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom’s… 
MS NAIDOO:  So there were quite a few I had applied for 
quite a few. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 177 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms… 
MS NAIDOO:  Accident fund board. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Naidoo.  What is the article that you 
are talking about now? 
MS NAIDOO:  It was an advertisement for the board position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Tell the Chairperson whether did 
you know any of your board members prior to their 
10 
appointment? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  I knew Mr Mark Pamensky and I knew of Mr 
Zethembe Khoza because I was at Telkom and he was also 
at Telkom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  How did you know Mr Mark Pamensky? 
MS 
NAIDOO: 
 
From 
a 
social 
perspective 
you 
know 
gatherings and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From where? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  Social perspective.  We attended very similar 
functions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  What should we consider him to have 
been a family friend? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 178 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Family friend.  So he – you and your 
husband would have known him. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you – oh – well you say Mr Khoza 
you knew him but did you know him personally? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  So you knew of him? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Telkom? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct he was an Executive at Telkom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Other than that you did not know any? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of the board members.  May – the Gupta 
brothers. 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know them. 
MS NAIDOO:  No I do not know them and I have never met 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Salim Essa? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes.  I know Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know him before coming – before 
your appointment? 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And how did you know him? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 179 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How well did you – did you know him? 
MS NAIDOO:  He is known to my husband.  I do not know 
him personally so I would not consider him my friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:  But my husband knows him so that is how I 
know him.  As I said in my affidavit and I took the guidance 
from your affidavit you know exactly times I had met him.  Ja 
and the last meeting was in 2015 I think it was at a wedding 
and we sat at the same table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you came to know him as a result of 
your husband knowing him. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He is friends with your husband? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did they do any business together? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not at all? 
MS NAIDOO:  Not when I was at Eskom no they have not 
done any business together.  I do not think they have done 
20 
any business together. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before or after? 
MS NAIDOO:  No, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So they know each other as what – 
friends? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 180 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:  Well more like associates yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  And in that process you came to 
know him? 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think you have mentioned occasions 
where you would have met with him? 
MS NAIDOO:  Mr Essa? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Mr Essa where you would have met 
with Mr Essa.  Can you tell the Chairperson those occasions 
again? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  They were mostly at gatherings.  I think there 
were more than 100 people at all three of the gatherings – 
there were three gatherings.  I have not met him on a 
personal basis to discuss any Eskom matters or my business 
relations.  I have never had coffee with him but I have never 
interacted with him on a social basis one and one.  So he is 
known to my husband he is not my friend. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did your husband play any role in your 
decision to apply to serve on the Eskom board? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He did not advise you to apply? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or discourage from applying? 
MS NAIDOO:  No I – I have not discussed my appointments 
or my job you know with my husband.  I am very 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 181 of 294 
 
independent.  It is quite offensive when somebody says to 
you got to your husband. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat the sentence 
before this last one? 
MS NAIDOO:  I have not discussed with my husband you 
know my employment or where I am planning to go if I am 
applying for a new position.  I have never done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not strange? 
MS NAIDOO:  No why? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Generally ask between couples? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  No I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you want to change from one job to – 
from working from one company for example to working for 
another company would you not talk to your partner, spouse 
and say this is what I am thinking? 
MS NAIDOO:  If I got ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you think? It might have an 
impact on certain matters in the family.  You might be 
coming back late because it is far in terms of the norms or 
that is the type of company that you are going to work for.  
20 
Obviously, in the end you decide. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But one, I would have thought that 
couples would talk about those things. 
MS NAIDOO:   Well, what I was trying to say to you that if I 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 182 of 294 
 
wanted to apply for a new job, I would not go to him and 
ask him or tell him or whatever.  If I did get a new 
appointment, yes, of course, I would tell him that I got a 
new appointment but I would have already accepted it. 
 
I never really addressed that with him.  To be 
honest, I think it was one of my head of legal positions 
where I did get accused by one my girlfriends who said:  
Did my husband get you this job? 
 
So, and I was very defensive.  No, Judge I really 
did not go and ask him:  You know what, I am looking at 
10 
taking a new job.  Maybe if I were unhappy somewhere I 
would have told him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS NAIDOO:   But in terms, I only have an agent and my 
agent would normally refer me to different jobs and then I 
go for the interview and things like that.  So if it means I 
got the letter of appointment, then I would call and tell him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you would tell him after you had 
been appointed? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, yes.  But I not like I would not ask him:  
20 
Do you think it is a good idea?  Or whatever.  We are in 
different professions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Oh, no, no.  I understand.  The 
suggestion is not that you ask for permission but it is just 
that discussion and consideration. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 183 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, of course.  Yes.  My job towards – you 
know as it is on photo 2, it was in and around my children.  
As my kids got older, I started – if you have noticed, I 
worked in a job from Pretoria.  Then I started moving 
closer to my home.  And that is why I reflected on taking 
board positions because I did – I thought it would allow me 
to have a bit more time as opposed to the 12-hour job.  Ja.  
So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, so you – you 
10 
say your husband did not play any role in your decision 
making.  You have said – I just saw something.  You said 
you knew Mr Pamensky socially.   
 
In his affidavit, Mr Pamensky says he knew or he 
knows Mr Salim Essa. I have known him for the past 11-
years.  At the time when he was deposing to an affidavit.  
Have you and Mr Pamensky ever been with Mr Salim Essa, 
all together? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I think so.  At a function, at a – what is 
it?  It was an ANN7 thing.  My husband got invited and I 
20 
think mister...  If I recall, Mr Pamensky was also there.  
But this was while I was an Eskom board member. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, this is ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   My husband was invited by Mr Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 184 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   But I could be mistaken.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The ANN7 ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, it was their award function. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   It was the news channel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the news channel that was owned 
by? 
MS NAIDOO:   Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   One of those companies, yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, one of the interrogated entities.  
Okay.  Now at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, you 
were also asked about Albertyn (Pty) Ltd having apparently 
or allegedly made a financial contribution in favour of 
Tegeta for the acquisition of OCM.  I cannot recall what 
was your response to that question. 
MS NAIDOO:   I was not asked the question.  I put that in 
my statement because that was what ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you did. 
MS NAIDOO:   ...in the Public Protector ’s report.  The 
20 
Public Protector ’s report came out in November.  Ms Thuli 
Madonsela’s last day, if I recall, was the Friday, the 
12 t h of October. 
 
The day before that I was contacted by Eskom at 
about eight o’clock at night to say:  Please look at your 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 185 of 294 
 
emails.  It is because they replied to the Public Protector ’s 
report and I did not know what they were talking about 
because I had left on the 30 t h of June 2016. 
 
Then when I looked – opened the document – I 
literally opened it on my phone and I realised that the 
Public Protector had sent them questions relating to the 
Eskom board members, specifically those of us that had 
left.  
 
And one of the questions – well, my question was 
not there about whether my husband’s company, Albertyn, 
10 
had contributed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Alright.  Okay let us do this.  Let 
us deal with the factual premise of the question, whether 
or not Albertyn did in fact make a contribution to Tegeta for 
the acquisition of OCM and whether you knew about it? 
MS NAIDOO:   My husband has told me no.  I have met 
with his accountant and auditor and they have proven to 
me no.  I have done this numerous times to numerous 
journalists.  I have written to the press about that.  I have 
tried to – I did write to the Public Protector but she had 
20 
already left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:   And the new one could not address the 
matter because she said the matter was closed.  She could 
not deal with it anymore.  So yes I have tried to deal with 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 186 of 294 
 
this aspect for a very long time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   And I have lived with four years now.  And 
Advocate Seleka, my husband’s company did not contribute 
to Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I mean, he has told he did not. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The company did not. 
MS NAIDOO:   And I have also verified by visiting his 
accountants and they have provided me proof.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Good.  I know the investigators are 
doing something about it but if we find anything we will 
share it with you. 
MS NAIDOO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Let 
us 
– 
I 
know 
that 
your 
supplementary affidavit deals extensively with issues of the 
suspensions ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   Correct.  I gave you ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Mr Tsotsi. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   So if I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Just remember, the arrangement 
because the suspension has been an issue we dealt with 
first 
and 
foremost 
before 
the 
transactions 
in 
a 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 187 of 294 
 
chronological sequence because it comes first. 
 
The 
people 
are 
moved 
out 
of 
Eskom, 
the 
executives and they are making a way for new people to 
come in and from there we see how the Corporation 
Agreement 
is 
dealt 
with 
between 
Eskom 
and 
OCM.  
Ultimately the prepayment in December 2015.  Decision.  
The guarantee thereafter.   
 
And then you have the April 2016 prepayment 
decision.  So what I am going to do is, is to put aside for a 
moment the suspension issues insofar as they are dealt 
10 
with in your supplementary affidavit because we have not – 
I have not even read it.  We have not even shared with the 
people who might be implicated.  We have to make that 
determination. 
 
So I will go into the transactions and starting with 
the Corporation Agreement.  That agreement reach – dates 
back to 2014.  It comes to the BTC in April 2016 on the 
15 t h.  The BTC does not decide the matter.   
 
I understand that from the evidence there is a 
question mark there because the matter fell within the 
20 
BTC’s delegated authority.  Is that correct? 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct, yes.  Seven-fifty to a billion or 
...[indistinct] BTC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay.  You are fast. 
MS NAIDOO:   My apologies.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 188 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just give us the threshold again. 
MS NAIDOO:   So the BTC threshold is R 750 million to a 
billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   R 750 million to a billion> 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That will be the BTC. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct.  And ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the BTC can make decisions on 
those? 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct.  And then from one billion to 1.5, 
10 
its board and thereafter it has got to the Department of 
Public Enterprises. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the Corporation Agreement 
despite falling within the BTC’s delegated authority, the 
BTC does not make a decision on.  It refers it to the board.  
The board sits in Cape Town on the 23 r d of April 2016. 
MS NAIDOO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you present in person? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, we were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not join by telecom? 
MS NAIDOO:   No.  So it is important to understand why 
we were in Cape Town.  We were presenting to the 
Parliament – it was our first meeting where the board was 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 189 of 294 
 
presenting to Parliament and then we also presented to the 
Ministers.  
 
So the day after we had this board meeting.  I 
think we were there for two days Chair.  So basically all of 
us were there.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, except for two. 
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry.  We were in Cape Town for two days. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I am saying, you are saying 
basically all of you were there but I think two joined by 
teleconference. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh, I will be corrected who they were.  I am 
sorry but I assumed we were all there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Anyway.  But they would have 
participated in the meeting.  In that meeting, it is unclear 
what – whether this item is properly on the board’s agenda.  
Can you recall?  The Corporation Agreement and the 
addendum form? 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No?  You do not have any independent 
recollection? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   So let me give an insight into what 
transpired. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   I know you have addressed this with 
Ms Klein. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 190 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   That we had basically on that day ratified 
Mr Molefe’s secondment.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, approved it. 
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was not ratified, approved it. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, correct.  But you must remember.  
Even though we did that, that was a formality.  It actually 
started a few days before.  What day – do you know what 
date – what kind of a day was it?  Was it a Tuesday or a 
10 
Wednesday?   
 
Because I remember we all met on a Sunday and 
we met with Mr Molefe because we were preparing for 
Parliament.  It was the first we were going.  He was very 
new and we all had to discuss the questions they were 
going to put to us.   
 
And there were lots of very stringent questions.  
And if the Commission wants, I can tell the questions 
together with the answers because one of the questions 
Ms Mzo put to us was the issues concerning the War Room 
20 
and the fact that incorrect information was going to the 
War Room and in that minutes that is being reflected. 
 
So that meeting then stopped.  We had this 
particular day where we were preparing on the Sunday.  
Then I think the next day or the day after, we flew to Cape 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 191 of 294 
 
Town.  We spent at Parliament.  And then the following day 
we had a board meeting.   
 
And it was a very introductory one where the 
Minister, you know, got to meet all of us properly and then 
we met Brian again for the second time.  And then 
obviously – it was sort of a very informal board meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, it was a very informal board 
meeting? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes.  It was not like we had a list of items 
we read through it and whatever. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   It was very informal.  It was very last 
minute. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Was it scheduled? 
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it a scheduled board meeting? 
MS NAIDOO:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, if it informal, maybe not. 
MS NAIDOO:   No, I do not think it was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in that meeting, the matter of the 
20 
Corporation 
Agreement 
between 
Eskom 
and 
OCM 
is 
referred to by Mr Molefe.  You recall that/ 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you deal with the basis on which it 
was referred to him.  You can tell the Chairperson quickly. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 192 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay.  So it was – so the matter came 
before us.  It was for the extension of the – no, it was for 
the amendment of the agreement.  They currently had an 
agreement but they were requesting from Eskom an 
increase in the price.   
 
There 
was 
also 
a 
clause 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
extension.  That was addressed with us. It was a fairly 
large extension.  It was, I think, for an additional 20 years. 
 
The contract was going to expire in 2018 but 
Eskom was looking at another 20 years for the life of the 
10 
mine but I remember the submission said that the life of 
the mine was under the 20-years but it could be extended 
to accommodate the OCM deal. 
 
The matter was – they were paying R 150,00 a ton 
and it was going to increase to R 442,00 until the end of 
2016 and from there to 2018, I think it was going to go to 
R 472,00.  I could be mistaken but after 2018 it was going 
to go to R 472.00. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but just tell the Chairperson the 
basis on which it was referred to Mr Molefe. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   So when we started – because it was such a 
huge amount in the sense that it was a big jump.  It was an 
extra 200% mark-up.  I mean, you were going from what?  
R 300 million a year to R 3.5 billion.  You are looking at an 
R 60 billion contract.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 193 of 294 
 
 
It kind of triggered – it was – we were in a 
financial strain.  We were not – we were a growing concern 
issue during this time and we were not in a situation to 
commit ourselves. 
 
I do also remember and I know tried to go back to 
the BTC minute.  I was not a BTC member at that stage.  
But I think one of the reasons they then pushed to the 
board was because it was above their threshold.  Oh, no, 
no.  Sorry.  It was out of their budget. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was out ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS NAIDOO:   Out of the budget.  So you must remember, 
you have every year a coal budget. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The budget of BTC? 
MS NAIDOO:   No, the budget within Eskom for coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The budget within Eskom? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes.  So that was the reasoning why I think 
it is mentioned of the minutes of the BTC that the matter 
must go to the board.  So there were various questions put 
to management.   
 
Remember, Advocate Seleka.  Every matter that is 
20 
presented to the board or the Board Tender Committee is 
presented by CV’s or the level of management. 
 
So for example, Eskom has got almost 42 tender 
committees 
below 
the 
board 
level, 
Board 
Tender 
Committee.  Directly below us we have ESCOs which is an 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 194 of 294 
 
executive committee consisting of the executives. 
 
Their threshold is R 300 million to R 750 million.  
They then will rectify, go through the submission and they 
submit 
it 
to 
the 
board 
tender 
and 
from 
there 
or 
alternatively either to the board. 
 
So it is very likely that we got this from either 
ESCOs or senior management and there were lots of 
questions put to the board.  I mean, put by the board.  And 
there were very few answers that could be answered. 
 
Mr Brian Molefe, on the Sunday I recall was very 
10 
impressive.  I mean, he was there two days but he was so 
well-glued up on the business.  Even if you go back and 
you look at the minutes for that parliamentary thing, he 
answered most of the questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   So we were very confident ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Ms Naidoo.  He what? 
MS NAIDOO:   He answered most of the questions that the 
parliamentarians put towards the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this Brian Molefe? 
MS NAIDOO:   Mr Brian Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   So on that day, on the 23 r d ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, hang on.  We are talking about the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 195 of 294 
 
meeting of the 23 r d of April 2015 and the questions, you 
say, the board had. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I am coming to that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   On that occasion.  Ja, but on that 
occasion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   He had been there for about three days 
or what? 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct.  He was there for three days. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But at the meeting that you talk about 
10 
when you he answered most of the questions. 
MS NAIDOO:   Maybe the day before when we went to 
Parliament.  Because you see, on the Sunday before we 
prepared, we all got together, together with him and we 
went obviously through the financials, the possibility of 
what questions would be put to us.   
 
And the thing is, you must be prepared irrespective 
of the fact that the man is there every job.  He knew he 
had to deliver.  And he – so we all prepared together, the 
board members and him and we were there with the senior 
20 
managers as well as the executives. 
 
Then the next – when we arrived in Cape Town, I 
think our first thing – we arrived the night before, the next 
day we all went to Parliament. 
 
The questions were put to us.  We answered it.  He 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 196 of 294 
 
answered the majority of the questions.  I am sure the 
minutes will reflect that.  And then the next day we had a 
board meeting.   
 
He came across very confident and he was very 
authoritative in the sense that he knew what he was doing.  
So when we started putting questions to management, he 
could not answer them, obviously, because he was also – 
he did not know much about the matter. 
 
And then we said:  Well, we have got now a CEO, 
a proper – a real life CEO. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   Let us give him to address the matter and 
come back to us. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  How did you put the questions 
to management? 
MS NAIDOO:   The questions I think were related in terms 
of what ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, how did you put them to 
management? 
MS NAIDOO:   In terms of how did I ask the question? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In which way, yes.  Did you send an 
email, did you send a letter? 
MS NAIDOO:   No, no.  We had a discussion ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or was management there, present 
and you had done putting question to them? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 197 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And which would be management in 
this case. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes.  So with due – Advocate Seleka, as I 
have said to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   There is a form of management that will 
submit to us, a tender.  So there would have been a line of 
managers or an executive.  Actually, an executive has to 
present or be present on a particular tender if it is in 
10 
relation to these aspects.  So I cannot verify exactly who 
the executive was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, there was no executive.  We heard 
Ms Klein said there was no executive.  You are meeting in 
Cape Town.  It is an informal meeting.  It seems not to 
have a prearranged meeting.  The minutes of the meeting 
are here.  All we see is all of the board members except for 
two who are joining in by teleconference.  Ms Khumalo and 
Mr Pamensky.  Then there is Phukubje the Company 
Secretary and the Committee Secretary, Mr Wayne Vellore.   
20 
 
Even Mr Molefe is not listed here but he was there 
in that meeting.   
MS NAIDOO:   No, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it not?   
MS NAIDOO:   I recall asking questions.  We would not 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 198 of 294 
 
have asked it to board members.  That does not seem 
right.  Our board members ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it was. 
MS NAIDOO:   ...be able to answer on a particular matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   We could have addressed issues maybe to 
board tender but management would have definitely had to 
be there to present a board matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That you heard when Ms Klein 
was testifying.  I also said to her, on this very question, 
10 
that...  Well, firstly she confirmed management was not 
there and that it was not expected of management to 
attend board meetings. 
 
But now it is even – what is it – I did not want to 
say – it is even more – ja, telling that it was an informal 
board meeting. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So management clearly was not there.  
But the second thing is.  I said to her.  Mr Johan Bester 
who was on the Negotiating Team on behalf of Eskom.  He 
20 
says he did not receive questions from management.  I 
mean, from the board.   
 
But you – I think you say what you know happened. 
If it did not happen ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 199 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If management was not given 
questions, from your recollection, it was not.  If it was, 
then say it was and then you will have to say how it was 
given those questions so that we move faster. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. If you can recall. 
MS NAIDOO:   I disagree the fact that there could have 
been no managers at this meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   Because they would have had to join us 
10 
when we went to Parliament and we had certain managers 
or executives.  So the executives were definitely all there.  
Are you talking about managers like Mr Johan Bester or 
are you excluding executive members? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  The minutes of that meeting...  
Chairperson, they are in Eskom Bundle 12.  Eskom Bundle 
12 ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   Am I supposed to... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, she will help you. 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh, okay.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minutes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you manage to go there or...? 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
No, 
I 
just 
want 
Ms 
Naidoo 
...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 200 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Eskom Bundle 12? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, okay. 
MS NAIDOO:   Ja.  What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 12, page 241.  That is 
the Reference Bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it you are just going there for the 
names of ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  The members who were 
present at the meeting.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   241? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   241.  Is that bundle...  Eskom Bundle 
12.   
MS NAIDOO:   Oh, yes I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you see...   
[Background noise interruption] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see who were present at that 
20 
meeting? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In person and by way of telecom, 
telephone. 
MS NAIDOO:   [No audible reply]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 201 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But to the extent that you want to say 
executives 
were 
there 
in 
this 
meeting, 
that 
will 
be 
inconsistent with what Ms Klein said.   
MS NAIDOO:   I find it very difficult to understand.  Then 
who were the questions addressed to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you are right. 
MS NAIDOO:   You understand? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   It is very likely that it could have been...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   So, I – honestly, we did have a discussion 
on the Sunday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   We could not have made a decision without 
asking questions, you know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:   But I want to reverse the question to 
members of the executive or the CEO that was present and 
that is very likely why we addressed the matter to him or 
referred it to him. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And...  Okay so, what were you 
expecting him to do? 
MS NAIDOO:   I think the intention was for him to provide 
more information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 202 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   That was very clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:   I remember one of the robust things was 
that during or prior to this particular meeting, we were 
constantly told about the so-called cost coal mines and 
how we were investing all this money. 
 
And at the beginning of every year, we would give 
them their budget and thereafter we would also pay for the 
coal which did not make sense because you did not own 
these mines, they were owned by other parties but you like 
10 
basically running them.  It was like sort of a neck lease.   
 
And we had an issue with that.  So when this 
matter came to us, it was like as if we were told now you 
need to increase this, pay more money, you do not have to 
budget.  So how you care going to deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   So go and get us more information.  And 
one of the things that we discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   Was if this company is having difficulty, can 
20 
Eskom then not take a shareholding in the company, not 
anybody else, Eskom so that Eskom can use the coal that 
it needs and thereafter sell or export the coal that it does 
not need because you are already doing that for the cost 
plus mine. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 203 of 294 
 
 
And if you look at the minutes that is reflected and 
it says then the matter was referred to Mr Molefe for 
further information.  That was it.  As simple as that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   There was no malice or there were 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   ...a Public Protector indicated... 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS NAIDOO:   ...like a strategy.  You know as Dr Ben said. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   That was the furthest thing from our minds. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, no ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   And in the submission itself was intense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Leave the Public Protector aside 
for a moment.  In their proposal by OCM was increasing 
the price of coal from R 150,00 per ton to R 442,00 per 
ton.  So that, you were saying, was too much for the board. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So you referred the matter to 
20 
Mr Molefe.  From Mr Molefe to come back with this 
information. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes.  The minutes is clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   For him to get us more information. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 204 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, more information. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And does he do that? 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He did not? 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay so what transpired is that.  I did not 
know – the matter never came back to the board.  We had 
various board meetings thereafter.  When the Commission 
is now sending me questions as to whether Mr Molefe 
reported this matter ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is in 2020? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, in November.  You guys sent me 
questions for the first time ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   In 2020. 
MS NAIDOO:   ...on the 9 t h of November. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MS NAIDOO:   So I then started going through all the 
minutes again and I picked up on the minutes of the 
10 t h of September, there is a submission for a CEO’s 
report.  And in the CEO’s report he talked about this 
20 
particular transaction and that he had, I think, cancelled or 
I do not know the exact details. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   But he advises that the negotiations had 
stopped or something like that.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 205 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we were looking at earlier on. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes.  So let me explain to you what 
happened over there.  The 10 t h ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  No, wait.  [laughs]  You want to 
explain what happened, what? 
MS NAIDOO:   On the 9 t h of  - or the 10 t h of September 
where I picked it up that there was mention ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, before you do that.  Before you do 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, this is what happens when you lead 
10 
the lawyer.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS NAIDOO:   Chair, I have waited for yours to sit on this 
chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To come and testify.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MS NAIDOO:   You understand? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Take it easy Ms Naidoo.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. Well, before you go into that.  It is 
because when I read your affidavit and I am looking for 
where you are dealing with this prepayment or rather this 
meeting.  Ja, it is on page – it starts on page 269.35.  No, 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 206 of 294 
 
that is your main affidavit.  Eskom Bundle 14(A), page 
269.35 going over to page 269.36.   
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry, what page did you say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   269. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 35.  269.36.  Ja, Eskom Bundle 
14.  So paragraph 87, it just goes right into the issue.   
MS NAIDOO:   Okay I am here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are here? 
MS NAIDOO:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, it is alright.  But the paragraph 87 
reads: 
“The board did not have enough information at 
the time to make a decision on the matter and 
there were too many unanswered questions. 
Eskom also had growing concern issues which 
played a role in me being cautious to commit. 
We simply request Mr Molefe to come back 
with more information. 
Since we had been appointed as the board and 
20 
we finally had a CEO who was more present, it 
seemed the logical thing to do.” 
 
So the matter is referred to him.  And if you turn 
the page to 269.37.  Paragraph 92 says: 
“It was expected for the CEO to table the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 207 of 294 
 
submission but I cannot recall that it actually 
was tabled to the board. 
I have reviewed subsequent minutes and could 
not find any discussion.” 
 
Paragraph 83: 
“The current agreement was in place until 
2018 and that is the agreement between 
Eskom and OCM at the current price. 
Eskom would continue receiving such a supply 
until an agreement was concluded. 
10 
I was not aware of the fact that Mr Molefe 
terminated discussions with OCM but only 
found out much later after my resignation.” 
 
And your resignation was 30 June 2016. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So on that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Naidoo, that second sentence in 
paragraph 93:   
20 
“Eskom 
would 
continue 
receiving 
such 
a 
supply until an agreement was concluded.” 
 
You mean a new agreement? 
MS NAIDOO:   No, the current.  So the agreement was in 
2018. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 208 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  It had not...  Ja, but there was a 
current agreement, is it not? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, correct there was a current agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
what 
did 
you 
mean 
until 
an 
agreement was concluded? 
MS NAIDOO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You say: 
“Eskom 
would 
continue 
receiving 
such 
a 
supply until an agreement was concluded.” 
MS NAIDOO:   It would have meant a new agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   Because remember, they come to you for an 
addendum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is what I am talking about. 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay.  So perhaps ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To say, did you mean a new agreement? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, the amendment on the increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no. 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh, okay.  Oh, sorry.  You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the meaning of what you say. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, you are right.  You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if you are – if there is a current 
agreement ...[intervenes]  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 209 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, you are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and you are receiving a coal supply in 
terms of that document Eskom would continue receiving 
coal 
supply 
until 
an 
agreement 
was 
concluded 
…[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does not make sense. 
MS NAIDOO:   No, you are right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   I would mean a new agreement, correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so your supplementary will also 
…[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   Include that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...need to deal with that.  Yes, Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  That 
sentence, Ms Naidoo, is important for a different reason or 
another important reason.  If you knew and are stating 
here that the current agreement and that is the agreement 
between Eskom and OCM would continue or was in place 
20 
into 2018 at the current price, Eskom would continue 
receiving such a supply until an agreement was concluded, 
which is a new agreement.  In other words, the status quo 
remains until 2018, until you conclude another agreement.  
And having said that, let us see what happens here 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 210 of 294 
 
because the board then will have to explain given that fact 
how does it deal with – or rather, explain how you – the 
manner in which you dealt with the submission for a 
prepayment of R1.6 billion in December 2015.  So Mr 
Molefe has terminated the cooperation agreement.  You 
say 
you 
did 
not 
know 
about 
that. 
 
He 
has 
given 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, do say no so that that goes 
into the record.  When you shake your head it will go into 
the record. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   No, no, so basically I do not recall the 
matter coming back to me to say that he terminated 
because I think that was the question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   Did he come back to say to us that he 
terminated and no that  …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not even terminated but he has to 
come back to you to give feedback. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because he is given the matter to go 
20 
get more information and give to the board because there 
are unanswered questions or questions that cannot be 
answered by the team. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so – now he has to come back to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 211 of 294 
 
you but he does not. 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In July he terminates the agreement, 
you come to learn about it only after your resignation from 
the board.   
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   After 30 June 2016. 
MS NAIDOO:   In the Public Protector ’s… 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
when 
reading 
the 
Public 
Protector ’s report. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is in November. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   20..? 
MS NAIDOO:   ’16. 
ADV SELEKA SC: 2016.  So that minute, what is it, that 
legal report which Ms Klein referred us to is not part of 
your evidence.   
MS NAIDOO:   Which legal? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not the legal report, the CE report 
20 
which has the legal part. 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh yes, it is in my submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it in your submission? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, it is, it is actually the very next page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, but you only came to know about 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 212 of 294 
 
that …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   …now when we gave you the request 
for information . 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, so on your questions, when you asked 
me... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   I had to go through all my minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   Because I did not want to miss something 
10 
and then Advocate Seleka cross-questions me.  So when I 
went through everything I noticed on the 10 September 
minutes there was a submission and the CEO’s report had 
this report about OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   So I went – that was in the submission 
papers, then I went to look at the minutes.  The minutes 
says the CEO’s report is noted, the board members got it 
late, they have not read it- I am not sure exactly not read 
it, but the impression is implied... 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   That we have not read it.  We can go back, 
read it and then revert to him.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   To be honest with you, Chair, that was a two 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 213 of 294 
 
day breakaway.  I did not go back and read his reports, you 
know?  And let me tell you how that meeting originated, the 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  No, no. 
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Barry said I should control you. 
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I should do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will ask Mr Roux to intervene. 
MS 
NAIDOO: 
 
 
To 
clarify, 
you 
know, 
I 
was 
not 
10 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he said if I do not he will intervene 
and stop you.  Ja, okay, so you came to know about the 
termination when you read the Public Protector ’s report.  
But the question is this, which is what we asked Ms Klein, 
we asked Dr or Prof Naidoo, how is that the board did not 
follow up with the executive after the matter is referred to 
him, which is a  serious matter, involves lots of money, and 
what is generally, we have told, regarded as a key power 
station, Hendrina power station, why does the board not 
20 
follow up? 
MS NAIDOO:   Adv Seleka, a very transactional matters 
actually came to the board and in hindsight – I hate using 
that word but it is truthful in the sense that the matters that 
did go to the board, even below our threshold, seems to be 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 214 of 294 
 
all the matters in contention that we are sitting and 
discussing now.  So what happened on the 23 April, it 
would have been an action item and it should have 
invariably been called up at the next meeting because it 
automatically gets.  I was not the Chair of the board so I 
can really not explain as to why this matter was not.  I was 
the Chair of bills and recovery, so I understood the process 
that it was my responsibility and duty to make sure that I 
go through these minutes, tabulate the action items and 
make sure that it goes to the next meeting.  I really cannot 
10 
explain this to you.  
 
Then I think sometime in about June/July I got 
appointed 
to 
BTC, 
so 
that 
was 
the 
very 
first 
time 
transactional matters starting coming to me but prior to 
that I do not recall very – or any matters coming to me, 
this may have been one isolated matter and from there, 
between that period to June/July we were dealing with 
Denton’s, we were dealing with the executives, we were 
dealing with the going-concern crisis, the last thing would 
have been a transactional issue and I would have had to 
20 
have some sort of interest in this matter for me to go back 
and say but I am waiting for you to come back with a reply, 
it is an operational matter, we gave it to the CEO and we 
left it with him. 
 
I do even recall the September meeting, or I could 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 215 of 294 
 
be mistaken, or August, where it came to the board that we 
were being too operational and that we need to step back 
and let the executives do their job.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   And that is minuted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:   And I correct that at parliament. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   So I can clearly understand why it was – but 
I cannot answer for Dr Dan, he was the Chair at that time. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the short answer is you do not 
know why he did not come back. 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or why the board did not follow up.  
You do not know why the board did not follow up.  
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the prepayment of R1.6 billion 
is also a transactional matter, is it not?  
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it came to the board. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And the board decided it overnight 
and by round robin.  
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Without a meeting.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 216 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA 
SC:   Without discussing it amongst 
yourselves.  Yes, the Chair was saying do not nod, speak 
to; the microphone.   
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you say yes? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let us deal with this because – 
so the impression, as I said to Ms Klein, is that Mr Molefe 
is coming there on a placement, if you like, so he is being 
10 
sent to Eskom.  Mr Salim Essa has spoken about him at a 
meeting in 2014 that you will see how powerful we are and 
we have decided who is going to be the CEO of Eskom, in 
2014, to one of the witnesses who came here, Mr Bester, 
and he says Mr Molefe is going to be.   
 
When in March 2015 Mr Matona is on suspension 
for reasons that the board members who have come here 
have not been able to explain and Mr Matona is fighting to 
come back and fighting, meaning he is taking legal action 
to come back …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, do not forgot what you 
wanted to say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think that some of the board 
members have said they believe that the suspensions were 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 217 of 294 
 
justified because there was to be an inquiry  I think some – 
I do not know if some might not have gone along with that, 
but where I do recall quite clearly is that many, if not all 
the board members who have testified here, have struggled 
to explain the exit of the three executives that have been 
suspended and I think the retention of one, Mr Koko.  So I 
just thought I do not want any member of the board who 
has testified to say you made a sweeping statement that 
they all could not explain the suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  So ja, they did 
10 
have reasons that were not related to what was stated in 
the letters of suspension and given to the members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What of course you can say – there is 
nothing wrong if you say they have given explanations that 
in your view are not sustainable if that is what you think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to be careful that we do not 
say they have not been able to explain suspensions when 
at least some of them have said well, we thought that in 
terms of the fact that there was going to be this inquiry, we 
20 
thought that it was an acceptable reason for the executives 
who 
headed 
those 
portfolios, 
that 
they 
should 
be 
suspended pending the finalisation of the inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course whether or not that is ... 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 218 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sustainable reason, is another matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  So that clarification 
accepted, Chair.  So while Mr Matona is on suspension and 
fighting to come back and having taken legal steps, that is 
what is meant by fighting to come back, on the 17 April 
2015 Minister Lynne Brown makes the announcement that 
she had decided – she has taken a decision to second Mr 
Molefe with immediate effect to Eskom.  So there is no 
waiting or awaiting of the outcome of Mr Matona’s issue 
10 
and seeking to resolve that issue before making that 
decision to have Mr Molefe come to Eskom.  And when he 
comes three days, or whatever days it is, certainly at the 
very most – if he started on the 17 April then at the very 
most on the 23 r d he has six days at Eskom, he is given this 
matter.  He is given this matter which has been handled by 
the inside team at Eskom since 2014 and I believe dating 
back to 2013.  But he is new, the matter does not go back 
to the team, it goes to him with the instruction, if you want, 
or the decision by the board that he should get information 
20 
and come back.  But he does not do that, he does not 
come back to the board. 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One.  Two, he terminates what was 
being negotiated and there, the board does not follow up 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 219 of 294 
 
with him, please report back, because we have given you 
this matter, it is about supply of coal to one of our key 
power stations.   
And I said this to Ms Klein, with that impression in 
mind, that he has been sent to Eskom, the incidental 
impression which arises on the part of the board is that the 
board may have acted in concert with his conduct in that it 
created an environment to enable him to do what he did in 
failing to call him up to account on what the board had 
decided he should do.  What would be your comment? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   I think that is such an unfair comment on 
the basis that when this matter came to us on the 23 April, 
you are asking me for a 200% increase, you are asking me 
to write up a R2.1 billion penalty, you are asking me to 
extend I think for another 25 years and I was the Chair of – 
I was not the Chair, I was member of bills and recovery 
and I remember that went to the life of mines would be, so 
I understood that you could never enter into a contract with 
a particular company over the life of mine and this 
particular submission it says that you would need this extra 
20 
25 years to mine, I think it was five years left, but it is very 
likely we can extend it but there is no answer telling me 
how you are going to extent if the mine is going to expire 
five years earlier.  So we made a logical [indistinct] from 
an economical perspective to say no, sorry, we need more 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 220 of 294 
 
information.  There was absolutely no malice or intention to 
push back on it and play into the hands of Mr Essa or Mr 
Molefe in terms of what you have implied. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja, well …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   Because, Adv Seleka, there has been so 
many issues on the penalty with Tegeta and the reduction 
and I know certain board members are being sued.  
Imagine if I had agreed to write up R2.1 billion the 23 
April, I would be sued.  So let us be fair to this board.  On 
what was presented to us was not fair, it was not the right 
10 
submission, it was not the right situation for Eskom and I 
still stand by that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the submission did not include an 
extension for 25 years, the submission proposed that you, 
as Eskom, should reserve a right …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, reserve a right, if you so wish, to 
extend it. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To that period.  That was the proposed, 
20 
that you reserve that. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, but I take that value of the reserving of 
a right very seriously.,  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   You know, there are legal implications. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 221 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Ms Naidoo, what is the point 
you want to make about the reservation of the right? 
MS 
NAIDOO: 
 
 
For 
me 
there 
were 
serious 
legal 
implications to that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was? 
MS NAIDOO:   There were legal implications to that if 
Eskom committed to it in advance because then it would 
have meant that Eskom would have had to negotiate or at 
least give them an opportunity to negotiate in terms of 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please look this side. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, face that side. 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh, sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  What was wrong with a 
proposal that Eskom should reserve to itself the right to 
extend? 
MS NAIDOO:   The right was referred to a price, it was 
linked to a price and the price was still R475 …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  4 …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   520.  So it was a right that went further. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of what 
…[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   That about 20 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on.  What was 
your understanding of what would go with the reservation 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 222 of 294 
 
of that right, you reserve the right and then what? 
MS NAIDOO:   So basically Eskom had agreement with 
them 
for 
2018, 
they 
were 
negotiating 
or 
looking 
at 
extending it for another 10 years.  Correct?  10 years.  But 
the intention was to actually get – reserve a right for 
another 25 years but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that the right to extend the 
contract? 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right, was there a condition attached to 
10 
that or anything? 
MS NAIDOO:    I do not remember any …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To that reservation of the right? 
MS NAIDOO:   I do not remember all of it but I know there 
was a price attached to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The thing is normally if you reserve a 
right, on the face of it that is in your favour …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you can decide to us it or you 
can decide not to use it in the future. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   But then you are …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So unless you say there was something 
else linked to the reservation of the right that would 
prejudice Eskom in some way and that is what I want to 
understand. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 223 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   So the reservation of the right had attached 
to it a price, a price that was far higher than the 150.  It 
was even higher than the 442.  So for me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did it say? 
MS NAIDOO:   I do not know the exact figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of what he 
said. 
MS NAIDOO:   So my understanding would be that if I 
commit now, at a later …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you reserve your right as Eskom. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right? 
MS NAIDOO:   A few years later down the line Eskom 
management would take that right on and continue to 
supply 
them 
at 
this 
increased 
price 
as 
opposed 
to 
benchmarking at that stage whether that was the right 
price.  So I was not in favour of the long term agreement or 
the commitment, as such, I would have preferred a shorter 
agreement of 10 years or shorter and then benchmark in 
terms of what was the current economic situation at that 
20 
stage. I just felt it was too much of a commitment on the 
likes of the mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not sure of how much 
importance this particular point might be, Mr Seleka, we 
might not need to spend much time on it. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 224 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, no, certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
I 
think 
the 
right 
to 
reserve 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can move on, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the right to reserve is – the benefit 
of the one who reserves it can exercise it or not extend it.  
Ms Naidoo, then – okay, we have gone through that, let us 
look at the submission - eight months later the board is 
approached with this submission for a prepayment of R1.6 
10 
billion.  The board is approached by email in the evening of 
8 December 2015, the email comes from Ms Suzanne 
Daniels in which she is asking the board to make a 
decision by 12 noon on the 9 December 2015.  
 
The two members of the board who testified before 
you have said that they understood that submission to 
require a prepayment to be made in respect of or to OCM 
owned by Glencore.  Now this is a decision that would be 
made by way of a round robin.  How did you understand 
that submission to require the board to decide? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   If I recall, the submission was based on the 
fact that OCM was now in business rescue, the business 
rescue …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Face… 
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry, Chair. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 225 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:   The company was now in business rescue, 
there 
were 
discussions 
with 
the 
business 
rescue 
practitioner and at the time when the submission had come 
to us, by that stage there was no final decision made by 
the business rescue practitioner in terms of a commitment.  
I think there was a clause that said that the business 
rescue practitioner had at the previous meeting said that 
they would continue with the agreement or they would 
remove the company out of the business rescue process 
10 
but there was no commitment.  Then there was indication 
that 
one 
of 
the 
particular 
mines, 
I 
think 
it 
is 
Koperfontein(?) that was being supplied by OCM, that 
agreement was coming to an end in January 2016 which 
would have been the following month.  So there was a 
sense of insecurity in terms of coal for the particular power 
station and therefore, this pre-purchase was coming to us 
to have a commitment and a security of coal.  So my 
understanding of Eskom’s business is that one of our basic 
assets is our coal stockpile.  Without that you can never – 
20 
you cannot practice, you cannot deliver on your strategy, 
so you needed to ensure that you had constantly sufficient 
coal.  You do not buy it on an ad hoc basis you buy it on a 
long term plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 226 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   So the understanding was at that stage 
there was a lack of commitment from this company because 
of their financial implications and that this particular pre-
purchase will give you a commitment where we could now 
have the coal, because it is already available, it is on 
stockpile, 
by 
pre-purchasing 
the 
coal 
basically 
be 
[indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   So that was my understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so which entity was going to 
10 
receive the prepayment? 
MS NAIDOO:   OCM.  I have put that in my affidavit.  And, 
Judge, to the question that you put to Ms Klein about 
whether we noticed the proposed owner.  To be – I am 
going to be very honest with you, I did not.  I have looked 
at it a hundred times since then as to who could I have 
missed that word and I can only explain the reasoning 
behind the heading that it said a pre-purchase to OCM.  
Throughout the submission they talk about the proposed 
purchaser, so obviously my understanding is the proposed 
20 
purchaser is somebody that will want to buy but in terms – 
they never referred to a proposed owner throughout the 
submission where they talk about it.  So I am going to be 
absolutely honest with you, I did not notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well you probably heard what I said 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 227 of 294 
 
to Ms Klein and maybe to Dr Naidoo in the morning as well 
that – well, what is troubling me about it …[intervenes] 
MS NAIDOO:   Is how it makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What troubles me more in regard to you, 
because you are a lawyer. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I totally accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think Ms Klein is a chartered 
accountant, there would be very – I think the two of you 
would be more of less the same in terms of – surprisingly.  
I mean, that part which – of the submission that requested 
10 
the board to authorise is a very important point. 
MS NAIDOO:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because before you come to the meeting 
or to discuss this by way of – or look at this by way of a 
round robin, you would know that the management is 
asking the board for an authorisation of something, number 
one. Number two, an authorisation for prepayment.  So 
obviously if you are being approached as a board to 
authorise something, you know there are very important 
pertinent questions, what must I authorise?  Why must I 
20 
authorise it.  How is authorising it in the interests of 
Eskom?  If it is a payment obviously you want to know to 
whom?  Are they entitled it?  Are there grounds that they 
should be – we should authorise payment to that particular 
entity.  Those questions are pertinent questions that should 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 228 of 294 
 
arise in your mind and when you read the submission you 
are looking for answers to those questions.  So I certainly 
would have expected that you would pick that up.  
 
Dr Naidoo said he did see but he did not – I think 
the effect of his evidence may well be that he did not think 
that – he did not appreciate its significance, I am not sure, 
I do not want misrepresent what he said, but he said he 
saw that the paragraph 2.1.2 of the submission refers to 
the agreement for prepayment being concluded with the 
proposed owners of OCM. 
10 
 
Ms Klein did not say she did not see it, I think she 
said she probably saw it.  I think she could not remember 
but she did not say I did not see it, she said I probably saw 
it and it may well be that – I think she said that the focus 
for her was on the fact that OCM was in a business rescue 
situation and then they wanted to secure the supply of 
coal.   
Dr Ngubane was here, I am not sure whether we 
asked him how he could have missed it but he said also as 
far as he was concerned he intended – he was authorising 
20 
a prepayment to go to OCM under Glencore, not Tegeta.  
So you have a professor, Prof Naidoo, you have a 
chartered accountant, you have a medical doctor, Dr 
Ngubane, you have an attorney, they all – some maybe se 
this, these two words, proposed owners, but do not attach 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 229 of 294 
 
to them the significance they should attach to them.  
Maybe others do not see them.  So it is – and yet you are 
dealing with a very large amount.  I think Ms Klein may 
have suggested indirectly that in the context of Eskom 
maybe R1,6 billion is not so large and amount, you know, 
but I think most people will agree that it is a large amount 
that you are dealing with.  The larger the amount you are 
being asked to authorise, the greater the duty on you to 
double-check that this money will go to the right entity, the 
right person.  You do not want to authorise money that 
10 
should go to A, you authorise it to go to B.  You 
understand? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is part of what is troubling me, 
how it is possible that in a board of – I think I was told 
about 12. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is apart from the investment 
and finance committee.  Of course their members would be 
members of the board as well. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it would mean that they got two 
chances of looking at the same thing, firstly at the level of 
the committee and secondly at the level of the board and 
nobody said hang on, hang on, hang on, we are being 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 230 of 294 
 
asked here to authorise a prepayment to proposed owners, 
not current owners, why is that?  What is going on? 
MS NAIDOO:   Chair, if I had noticed that, the first 
question would have been who are the proposed owner, so 
I can definitely tell you because of the heading said pre-
purchase to OCM, that stuck in my head, not that I am not 
trying to find an excuse for what I did in terms of not 
realising proposed order, but I did send questions to Ms 
Daniels on this matter, she did not mention my questions, 
she did mention that I’d you know signed off on the matter 
10 
and then I said refer it to IFC.  I did ask her the two 
questions was from the current agreement – can I refer you 
to the other? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Maybe for the Chairperson you can, or 
for the record.    
MS NAIDOO:  Yes, from the current documents, does not 
mean we buying coal at the price in terms of our current 
agreement and the person that has applied was either Mr 
Matshela Koko or Anoj Singh…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think come closer to the mic. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh, so the either two executives that 
replied was Mr Anoj Singh or Matshela Koko because she 
has got that on the email, she has got Anoj/ Matshela and 
they say confirmed.  The coal price is asked to the current 
coal supply agreement with OCM.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 231 of 294 
 
So I am being told this, then I said further advice if 
there is any other means of getting coal elsewhere and this 
is no other means of getting coal for him at a price of 
R150,00 per ton, the open inquiry for the smoke coal 
qualities for Arnot power station has not yielded positive 
results.  So I think when I got this, you know, the first 
impression was that this is coming from OCM.  So it has to 
be OCM.  The price is now R150,00 as opposed to the 442 
they were asking in April and that was what I thought was 
the right decision for Eskom and that is why I do not come 
10 
back on that but it still does not take away that I did 
not…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Except that it is remarkable to say the 
least. 
MS NAIDOO:   But with due respect Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on.  You accept that it is 
quite remarkable that from the entire Board does not look 
like anybody's says anything about there is something that 
needs clarification here, on the point of who is going to 
benefit, who are we authorising payment to pre-payment 
20 
to? 
MS NAIDOO:   But I think we were all thinking on the same 
line.  That is why I eventually, I think they were all thinking 
on the same lines.  That is why I see…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is it possible so many people, 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 232 of 294 
 
highly…[intervene] 
MS NAIDOO:   Because it is seen as a round robin the 
night before you are given a few hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on Ms Naidoo, highly 
qualified 
people 
and 
I 
think 
some 
of 
them 
quite 
experienced. 
MS NAIDOO:   It is the urgency of the matter and the fact 
that it was not at a meeting, so it was no discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But even that urgency they did not 
question did they? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   No because - well, I can tell you I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That issue could have waited even 
another week from what I can see.  So why did they not 
say hang on, we need more time, this thing can wait.  Why 
do you rush us to make a decision on this, they did not do 
that.  They do not – it is in black and white, it is in front of 
them. all of them do not say hang on what is going on 
here?  
MS NAIDOO:   I cannot answer for other members but for 
me personally because I was already in tenure for about 
20 
four months, everything at Eskom was very urgent and it 
had to be dealt with immediately.  I mean you would see 
from my affidavit, I gave you lots of examples where we 
had round robins for hundreds of millions of rands, and 
they had to be dealt with overnight or as a round robin. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 233 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were the Board, you were for all 
intents and purposes the ultimate authority at Eskom. 
Nobody should rush you to making decisions, where you 
are not satisfied that there is reason to make a decision 
now, now, now. 
MS NAIDOO:   The perception is that it is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you need more time, you can get more 
time. 
MS NAIDOO:   It was not played out that way.  You were 
told that if you do not do this, we go into load shedding. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But who tells the Board? 
MS NAIDOO:   Management, management is operational 
we are not operational. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But because 
you are 
not asking 
questions. You are not saying to them, what is going to 
happen if we only decide this in a week?  You do not ask 
those questions.  
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, we dealt with urgent matters urgently, 
we did not push back that is true.  But with due respect 
Judge this was never signed off to OCM, I mean to Tegeta. 
20 
This was signed off to OCM, IFC signed this to OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, this, this submission that you 
authorised says proposed owners of OCM, it does not say 
current owners of OCM. 
MS NAIDOO:   But eventually IFC held a meeting and it 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 234 of 294 
 
was agreed OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that does not justify this failure on 
the part of this Board to appreciate that they were being 
asked 
to 
authorise 
payment 
to 
proposed 
owners 
as 
opposed to current owners.  It was there in front of them, it 
was black and white.  You cannot blame management and 
say they did not tell you that they were asking you to 
authorise pre-payment to Tegeta. 
MS NAIDOO:   With due respect Judge I am not blaming 
them, I think was the drafter was very clever.  The drafter 
10 
was extremely clever to make the heading OCM. talk about 
OCM, talk about proposed purchaser and then in one 
clause talk about the proposed order, but yes I do accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in a clause that his entitled or she is 
entitled whoever it was, is entitled to expect you to look at 
because it is about what you are asked to do.  
MS NAIDOO:   Correct.  I do accept that was an oversight 
on my part.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Ja, Ms Naidoo 
20 
on the one hand those questions arise that why urgency 
and the convolution between the two entities which one 
actually was going to get payment but if the Board 
understood it to be OCM as under Glencore, that statement 
in that paragraph 93 of your affidavit, becomes even more 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 235 of 294 
 
significant.  It says: 
“The current agreement was in place until 2018.” 
And you are talking about this in the context of the 
cooperation agreement, the matter being referred to Mr 
Molefe and he was going to come back to the Board, he did 
not.  And then you go to the paragraph: 
“The current agreement was in place until 2018 at a 
current price, Eskom would continue receiving such 
a supply until an agreement was concluded.” 
If that was the case as we know from the evidence that it 
10 
was in fact the case.  It even makes a mockery of the 
allegation of urgency because the status quo remain until 
the new contract will be concluded.  Do you see that? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, but things changed in December they 
were in business rescue, they were not in business rescue 
on the 23 r d of April. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but business rescue started in 
August 2015. 
MS 
NAIDOO: 
 
 
Correct, 
before 
the 
submission 
in 
December. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Way before. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if there was any urgency, you say 
the urgency was that, there will be load shedding? 
MS NAIDOO:   So what my understanding was that there 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 236 of 294 
 
was a lack of commitment on the coal supply.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   And for me they needed a commitment from 
this particular company that they were going to supply so 
much of coal at a certain price.  And with due respect, 
Advocate Seleka business rescue is not the ideal situation 
for any company.  So when I am being told that this 
company is business rescue, they have agreed that they 
will continue with the agreement but as of the date of the 
submission, there is no final commitment.  But here is a 
10 
proposal 
being 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
business 
rescue 
practitioner on the pre-purchase for R150 a ton, as 
opposed to the 442million, I definitely saw it as a better 
deal for Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I get lost in your explanation. 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is fast and you know without breaks, 
but let me – let us say this to you, you make the decision 
for this pre-payment.  You believing it to be going to OCM 
for business rescue.  You are making a decision for a pre-
20 
payment of 1.6 billion whereas eight months earlier you 
refuse to increase R150,00 per ton.   
The price of a R150,00 to 442, four, four two which 
would have been a monthly payment, as opposed to a pre-
payment of a huge amount all at once.  How did you deal 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 237 of 294 
 
with this? 
MS NAIDOO:   There is the difference Chair because in 
April 23 r d when it came, there was an increase.  Yeah, it is 
a continuation of an existing agreement at the same price 
and you have been told that you will now save I think it 
was like R215million on the basis that you are getting it at 
the same price because you would address, I think it was 
the working capital.  
So my understanding was that if you budgeted 
R100,00 per month going forward, if you pre-paid that 
10 
same R100,00 or R20,00 out of that R100,00 in December 
the following month you will only be incurring R80,00.  So 
it is not like you are taking money out of your budget 
because you have already committed to this particular 
budget at this price but I thought it was a good deal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, in addition to that by this time in 
December 2015, Glencore had already made a decision 
that it is taking OCM out of business rescue, it will fund 
OCM and OCM will comply with the agreement to the very 
end.  
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, but then the submission says as of the 
date of the submission they had not got a commitment.  So 
it does give you these two clauses, giving you the 
impression that they have made these promises but they 
have not committed to it and we are now in the situation.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 238 of 294 
 
So my understanding at the time was that there is no final 
commitment and this is what now they are committing to 
and yes sign a deal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The commitment was made on the -  
conveyed in the meeting of the 24 t h of November 2015 and 
finally resolved by the end of that month and certainly 
given to Mr Koko on the 1 s t of December 2015.  Did you 
know of that fact?  
MS NAIDOO:   No, there is no date, the way it is drafted it 
gives you the impression that you had these initial 
10 
meetings and then nothing transpired.  And then you are at 
the situation now where you have not heard from them and 
everybody's quiet.  So I am hearing obviously the dates for 
the first time.  I can only tell you what was in the 
submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, so on the 1 s t of December 2015 
there is a meeting taking place in Switzerland convened by 
Minister Zwane with Mr Glasenberg and Minister Zwane is 
there with Mr Salim Essa.  You would not have known 
about that meeting? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
That 
meeting 
deals 
with 
the 
transaction of Tegeta acquiring OCM.  The meeting is 
concluded on the 2 n d of December when Mr Tony Gupta is 
present and they have called Mr Ephron the CEO of OCM 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 239 of 294 
 
South Africa to come and join them.  The deal is verbally 
concluded; did you know that?  
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For the price of R2.1billion purchase 
price by Tegeta of OCM.  And what we see here it is a 
parallel process, what is happening within Eskom and what 
is happening outside of Eskom.  And it seems to have been 
that Eskom is taking, the Board of Eskom is taking 
decisions that were intended to assist, financially assist 
Tegeta in their acquisition of OCM.  Your comment? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   The Board did not do that, if that was the 
intention of management or executive it was not the 
intention of the Board.  Chair, Advocate Seleka lead 
evidence with Ms Daniel, I think it was with Ms Daniel 
concerning correspondence between Mr Singh and I think it 
is Eric Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
MS NAIDOO:   Concerning…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Atul Gupta. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, it was concerning the submission 
20 
document.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes and they did not want the submission to 
go to IFC, they did not want it go to the DPE.  Advocate 
Seleka my letter to Ms Daniels on the 9 t h or the 8 t h of 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 240 of 294 
 
September was exactly in contradiction of what Mr Essa so 
called Mr Gupta, Mr Eric Wood was saying, I asked that it 
goes to IFC, I said that we need DPE approval and I said 
we need PFMA approval.  
So I find that actually, it is totally a contradiction of 
what I did.  I acted against what they were wanting to 
happen and there is no way I could have known that this 
agreement was signed.  And if this agreement was signed 
between these two companies, why would they bringing the 
submission to us and saying that the business rescue 
10 
practitioner wants to save OCM.  The submission in itself 
is incorrect or is unethical if there was an agreement as 
you said now for the sale of this particular company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka I think you have a question, 
so I will hold back.  I thought you might want to follow up 
on that answer.  Okay, no, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ask the question, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   How would you know if the Board was 
facilitating this deal if they did not say so in the meeting?  
You say the Board did not do that. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay, when I say the Board okay I cannot 
speak for everybody.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you speak for yourself, ja 
MS NAIDOO:   My apologies, let me speak for myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 241 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the only way we are going to find out 
about everybody is to ask everyone.  Nobody's asked me 
for four years, what I did.  I did not know about the so 
called correspondence that was happening between all 
these parties.  I found out about it three weeks before - a 
few weeks ago.  So it is - I find it very hard to accuse 
people of things when there is evidence out there and 
people are just ignoring it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see Ms Naidoo and you may 
have heard me say this in the past if you listened or 
10 
watched when some of the members of the Board or other 
former members of the Board of Eskom officials who had 
testified.  There is something that seems to suggest that at 
least some of the members of this Board, this Eskom Board 
may have been working in cahoots with people who were 
outside of Eskom, or may have known of some agenda on 
the part of people who were outside of Eskom and who 
were allowing themselves to advance that agenda, and it 
may be that some members of the Board didn’t know about 
those agendas but may have dealt with certain decisions of 
20 
them having – certain decisions which enabled an agenda, 
or some agenda that belonged to people who were outside 
of Eskom. 
 
So some might have known what was going on and 
others might have been going on with what they believed 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 242 of 294 
 
was their normal duty.    
MS NAIDOO:   Can I say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not now.   You have this situation Mr 
Seleka pointed out to you, in 2014 Mr Salim Essa, 
according to Mr Johan Bester – is it Johan Bester? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hank Bester who gave evidence here, in 
2014 already tells Mr Hank Bester that the next boss for 
Eskom will be Mr Brian Molefe.  At that time Mr Brian 
Molefe is Group CEO at Transnet and he has not applied 
10 
for any job at Eskom and somebody is appointed as Group 
CEO of Eskom, that is Mr Matona, I think at the end of – at 
the beginning of October. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1 October 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1 October 2014, before that he was DG 
of the Department of Mineral Resources if I recall correctly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was at the DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at DPE ja, but he was DG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   DG at DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, at DPE, so he is familiar with Eskom 
20 
also.  So within a few months while he was still trying to 
present his turnaround plan for Eskom he is suspended 
together with other executives under circumstances that 
raise questions and he goes to the Labour Court, tries to 
fight to come back and according to him he is told by one 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 243 of 294 
 
of the members of the Board that going back to Eskom is 
out of the question for him, they can talk about money but 
not going back. 
 
The executives concerned as suspended they get – 
it is said that they have done nothing wrong and a lot those 
executives you know said we were pushed out and they are 
given a lot of money and I asked Board members who have 
testified here why did you give them such a lot of money to 
leave if as far as you were concerned they could still come 
back, you had no problem with them.  They couldn’t give 
10 
me any satisfactory explanation.    
 
And then of course on the 17 t h of April 2015 
Minister 
Brown 
announces, 
as 
a 
media 
conference, 
announces that Mr Brian Molefe will be seconded to Eskom 
as Acting Group CEO.   I think Mr Molefe is hardly three 
months there, or two months/three months, then according 
I think one witness or some affidavit I may have read he 
then recommends to the Eskom Board that Mr Anoj Singh 
who was at Transnet as the CFO must also be brought to 
Eskom, and there is a huge question as to how Ms Molefe, 
20 
Tsholofelo Molefe, who was Financial Director in March 
2015 at Eskom, therefore CFO of Eskom, how she got to be 
included in the list of executives to be suspended because 
at the meeting of the 8 t h of March 2015 at Mr Zuma’s 
official residence in Durban where the issue of the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 244 of 294 
 
suspension of the Eskom executives was discussed and Mr 
Zuma is said to have been there as well in the discussion, 
Ms Tsholofelo or her portfolio was not included, and then 
Ms Daniels and Mr – what is the name Abraham, Masago, 
say that on the 10 t h of March, one day before the day on 
which the Board suspended these executives they both say 
separately they were called by Mr Koko to a meeting at 
Melrose Arch where they met with Mr Koko and Mr Salim 
Essa, separate meetings, and they were told the names of 
the executives who were going to be suspended and for the 
10 
first time Ms Molefe’s name was included and when the 
Minister – Minister Brown, arrived and came to speak to t 
he Board on the morning of the 11 t h, she also – when she 
spoke about the suspensions, she included Ms Molefe in 
terms of her portfolio, she had not been included in the 
original, and then she when there were discussions for her 
to 
leave 
between 
members 
of 
the 
Board 
who 
were 
mandated by the Board to talk to her, the Board had given 
a mandate through those Board members who were talking 
to these executives that in terms of money it should be I 
20 
think 12 months, 12 months remuneration, not more than 
that, she was not prepared to take that, she resisted 
leaving, but instead of them saying okay come back 
because after all they were not saying she had done 
anything wrong, they increased the offer to her I think to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 245 of 294 
 
1.8. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18 months Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To 18 months, ja, not 1.8, 18 months’ 
salary and you ask the question but why, why did you have 
to pay so much if you had no problem with these 
executives coming back, and it becomes difficult not to say 
well could it be that this whole thing was planned, that Mr 
Molefe should be brought to Eskom and maybe Mr Anoj 
Singh should be brought to Eskom as well, but of course 
they couldn’t be brought there if there were people in those 
10 
positions, those people needed to leave and then you go 
back to Mr Hank Bester ’s evidence that already in 2014 Mr 
Salim Essa told him that you will see how powerful we are, 
Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the next boss of Eskom. 
 
So – and then you think about emails, evidence that 
has been led here, emails that seems to come from people 
outside of Eskom and outside of government, sending 
messages, sending emails to Eskom including an email that 
went to Dr Ngubane who was Chairperson of the Eskom 
Board, which was in effect dictating to the Board what 
20 
decision they should take about certain newspapers which 
had published certain articles about Eskom and Transnet, I 
can’t remember who else, and Dr Ngubane has confirmed 
here that he took that email and went through to the Board 
and the Board made exactly those decisions. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 246 of 294 
 
 
So I am just saying when you say the Board did not 
intend to facilitate anything for – about the deal of Tegeta 
and Eskom, it may well be that some members of the Board 
knew of some agenda. 
MS NAIDOO:   Chair I can only ask that you look at the 
evidence and you treat all of us fairly.  It has been a hell of 
a four years for me, I am not going to get emotional on TV, 
but we did not want an inquiry, the inquiry was put to us by 
the President and the Minister.  We did not ask for the 
suspensions, that was put to us by the Minister and Mr 
10 
Tsotsi  On the issues of the suspensions I have addressed 
it in my supplement, you really need to listen to the 19 t h 
recording, the 19 t h of March recording sets the platform in 
terms of how Mr Tsotsi got the misdemeanours and I think 
that created a platform which scared the Board members 
that the Executives would have far bigger claims against 
Eskom, and I know that will be dealt with later, but it is in 
my supplementary affidavit. 
 
On the issue of the transactions you can see now 
for the very first time on the evidence that some of us 
20 
pushed back and we were working in favour of Eskom, so I 
can only plead with you to look at the evidence for the first 
time, take cognisance of that fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   You know there’s numerous people that it 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 247 of 294 
 
reports in terms of the GAP analysis that is presented to 
you, not a single one of those people  have contacted me, 
yet I tried to contact them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see part of the reason why I am 
telling you what I am telling you is exactly to be fair to you, 
to say this is what is going on in my mind, what can you 
tell me, you see that is part of being fair to members of the 
Board, to say I am not hiding from you what is going on in 
my mind, I want you to influence my thinking, this is what I 
am thinking. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   No, I do respect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not final. 
MS NAIDOO:   I do respect that, and that is why I tried to 
give the Commission as much tangible evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:    I am not here sitting on this chair accusing 
people of State Capture of doing anything, unless I have 
attached a tangible document, so I hope you will take 
cognisance of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no that is fine.  Mr Seleka we 
20 
are at quarter to six.   Let us talk about how long we – you 
still need to be and we might need to take a short 
adjournment.   I am not necessarily saying finish now, I 
just want that we all have an idea of how much longer you 
will still need. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 248 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can still sit longer, I just want to have 
an idea. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I don’t want to sit until seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes especially some of the matters 
which have been dealt with you know there might not be a 
need to go all over through them again but at the same 
time in terms of fairness it is important to give Ms Naidoo a 
chance to say something, but on some of the matters I 
guess I mean she could even finish a response on certain 
10 
points even by way of affidavits, but while we are here, if 
we can, let’s use the time as much as possible. 
 
So we have to do justice to the issues even with 
whatever time constraints. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so what is your assessment? 
MR SELEKA SC:   If we don’t stop now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I don’t think we should stop now.  
MR SELEKA SC:   Then we could possibly finish before 
half past six. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   I am fine, but my counsel will need 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us check with you first then we 
check with your counsel, are you fine? 
MS NAIDOO:   Oh absolutely. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 249 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Roux? 
ADV ROUX:   I am fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are fine with that, okay, no, no that 
is fine, let’s take a ten minutes adjournment now. 
ADVOCATE SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we come back and then we 
continue and try and see if we are able to finish by half 
past six. 
ADVOCATE SELEKA SC:   Ja, but Chair my estimation is if 
we don’t take a break. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no, no I think let’s take a 
break, the witness might wish a break. 
MS NAIDOO:   I am fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will take a ten minutes break, 
we will bear in mind what you said, yes. 
 
We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  Yes Ms 
Naidoo I was paying attention as you were using the word 
you pushed back. I do not know is it you as the board 
members or you in particular please remember to put on your 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 250 of 294 
 
microphone that you pushed back and I am trying to see 
whether did you in fact push back in regard to this pre-
payment we are dealing with because I recall seeing your 
email saying yes you approve but simply saying let the 
matter go to IFC and … 
MS NAIDOO:  PFMA approval. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  PFMA approval. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes and then whether this needs to go to the 
DPE because it was over the R1.5 billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yeah but where is the pushback?  
10 
Because I understand pushback to be that you would have 
been opposed to the decision being made. 
MS NAIDOO:  I did … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that right? 
MS NAIDOO:  No I was not pushed – I was not pushing back 
on the decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  I did support the money to go to OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  But I pushed back in terms of you led 
20 
evidence that the particular person that was communicating 
with Eskom in terms of the submission did what – wanted to 
avoid the matter going up for discussion.  Wanted to avoid 
the matter going to IFC and in that respect I had brought all 
those scenarios back into the – into the situation and that is 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 251 of 294 
 
how this matter ended up going to IFC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes just face… 
MS NAIDOO:  Sorry Chair but I did support the transaction.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  I did believe the money should go to OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Can I just interpose to complete 
an issue we discussed earlier on which should have been 
discussed I was mentioning because I do not want to forget.  
Please do not forget your next question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you present or do you recall the 
meeting that I was talking about earlier where Dr Ngubane 
as I understand his evidence asked the board to consider 
making – taking the resolutions that were set out in some 
letter or memo that had come from outside of Eskom? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes.  So... 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was in relation to the Mail and 
Guardian, City Press. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know which other paper yes. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall that? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes I do.  So we had a meeting a week before 
in September where we had a discussion on the – in fact the 
journalist were writing the wrong information and giving the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 252 of 294 
 
wrong information out and in those minutes it is clearly 
reflected for us to approach the journalist.  I think we even 
spoke about a gentleman called Mr Yelland because he was 
very proactive on Eskom and we wanted to liaise with him so 
that he would give out the right information and the whole 
intention was to get South Africa on board of understanding 
what was happening at Eskom with the load shedding and 
whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
MS NAIDOO:  That happened a week before … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not – do not into the contents of the 
articles. 
MS NAIDOO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I just want to – so you were present – 
you attended that meeting? 
MS NAIDOO:  That meeting… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where the resolution was taken? 
MS NAIDOO:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is what I am interested in. 
MS NAIDOO:  The resolution was done via a Round Robin. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay but you – you had… 
MS NAIDOO:  And why I remember it is because it was on 
my daughter’s birthday and we were in the US. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MS NAIDOO:  So I do not remember us signing off on it. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 253 of 294 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  So I do not understand how a resolution was 
taken because about five of us were in the US. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying that you did not take 
part in that Round Robin? 
MS NAIDOO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  No because we were away – we were 
overseas.  I think it was something that was you know going 
to happen or a resolution – but we did not sign off because 
10 
as I said we were overseas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
MS NAIDOO:  And I think Mr Koko has also said it was never 
implemented or something like that I heard in his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he said so ja. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  The – yes Ms Naidoo 
perhaps – well for what it is worth you know the email of 
20 
your reply to Ms Daniels it is on the 8t h of December 2015 at 
half past seven where it says: 
“Hi I confirm my support a Round Robin 
kindly 
ensure 
all 
governance 
issues 
is 
complied with in terms of PFMA and others 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 254 of 294 
 
that to the regulations.  Does the value 
require its consent from DPE. The IFC 
committee 
has 
approved 
the 
purchase.  
Session contracts are in place for the coal.  
Do you still need me to sign the document?  I 
do not have access to a printer just now.  
Regards Viroshni.” 
So there is no… 
MS NAIDOO:  There was no pushback on the transaction but 
in terms of what the implication was. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes there was a pushback. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  In terms of? 
MS NAIDOO:  You led evidence that this  particular inter-
portal person did not want… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  So it was pretty obvious from your evidence 
that whoever was liaising with Eskom did not want this 
matter discussed openly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  They wanted to avoid a discussion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   And that is why they insisted that the matter 
does not go to IFP. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes what Ms Naidoo is talking about are 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 255 of 294 
 
those emails exchanged with Mr Anoj Singh and Eric Wood 
and… 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think they go – did they go to 
infoportal? 
MS NAIDOO:   I do not remember but you put it with Ms 
Daniels.  The person that was… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but we talking the outside person. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who was … 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  Was emailing and advising that this matter 
must never – take out the IFC submission it must not go to 
the DPE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but if you talking pushback in that 
context are you trying to say to the Chairperson that you 
knew that this was going on and you were pushing back on 
that? 
MS NAIDOO:  No I only found out about it when you led 
evidence with Ms Daniels that this had transpired and then I 
… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But – ja but then pushback is a misnomer 
because you did not know what this (speaking over one 
another). 
MS NAIDOO:  No correct yes.  But you must also remember 
the implication is that this board was helping in a particular 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 256 of 294 
 
company like Tegeta and we were not and there is the 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but you are not asking for the matter 
to go to IFC you say that; that IFC committee has approved 
purchase. 
MS NAIDOO:  Correct which meant they would have had to 
have a meeting or would have had to approve it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja and Ms Klein is also saying… 
MS NAIDOO:  Sematic.  Semantic.  At the end of the day I 
wanted IFC to approve it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Ms Klein also says that is what 
she wanted. 
MS NAIDOO:  And that is what happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but the… 
MS NAIDOO:  It did go to IFC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but were you aware that she wanted 
it? 
MS NAIDOO:  So – no I do not know she gave her evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:  I know Ms Daniels confirmed my email. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No your email is here.  Your – so the 
board then with all the questions the Chairperson has asked 
you, I have asked you has made this pre-payment decision 
R1.6 billion you say in your understanding it was going to 
OCM.  The next day the 10t h of December 2015 something 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 257 of 294 
 
alarming takes place which is a conversion of that decision 
into a guarantee not in favour of OCM but in favour of 
Tegeta.  Was the board aware of that? 
MS NAIDOO:  Absolutely not.  We found out about it – there 
was a media briefing – it was a couple of months after I had 
even left.  There was a media briefing I think it was Dr 
Ngubane and Mr Singh were sitting and one of the journalists 
asked Dr Ngubane I think it was about the guarantee and he 
was taken aback and then I saw from the media briefing Mr 
Singh explaining to him and then he explained what it was.  
10 
No so none of us knew about it.  And if you see that video 
you can see he was like shocked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You say you had already left? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes I… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You left. 
MS NAIDOO:  I think I definitely left.  I left on the 30t h of 
June.  I think this was after.  I think it was even – it could 
have been after the Public Protectors Report. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MS NAIDOO:  Because she did not deal with it in her report. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I have a faint recollection of 
something said in Mr Pamensky’s affidavit but I do not have 
it here.  So I will not mention it because I might be confusing 
the two pre-payments.  Because he questioned – he said it 
came out in the newspaper – he read it somewhere and he 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 258 of 294 
 
questioned sending an email to the board members that we 
should not be rubber stamping – I just do not recall where 
was his email.  I hope we can check when the email was 
sent.  My impression was that email was sent before you 
resigned as a board member. 
MS NAIDOO:  So I attached in my affidavit an annexure from 
Mr Pamensky which was sent in I think it was around 
June/July 
205 
where 
he 
addresses 
Mr 
Anoj 
Singh 
appointment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay not that one. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No not that one. 
MS NAIDOO:  And he mentions I think rubber stamping there 
also because we were not made aware of Mr Singh – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh the board was not made aware of his 
appointment. 
MS NAIDOO:  No not at that stage.  We – that – yes.  So 
that email was dated 24t h of June 2015 we were made aware 
on the 25t h of June. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So Tegeta… 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  But by then it already happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Tegeta – Tegeta needed funds – 
needed funds to pay the R2.1 billion for the acquisition of 
OCM and you have this guarantee issued in its favour on the 
10t h of December which is the same date when they signing 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 259 of 294 
 
the agreement for the sale of shares of OCM – in fact of 
OCH on the same date.  According to the evidence of Mr 
Pearce Marsden Tegeta needed to show that it has the funds 
to do the purchase and it needed to show the bank of 
consortiums 
– 
the 
consortium 
of 
banks 
because 
the 
consortium of banks was loaning money to OCH – OCM.  So 
when you look at what was happening it would seem that 
either the pre-payment decision or the guarantee itself was 
meant to assist Tegeta in showing that it has the necessary 
funds to do the purchase.  Do you have any comment on 
10 
that? 
MS NAIDOO:  On the basis Chair of that submission 
proposed owner yes that is the thing here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But thank God IFC held a meeting the 
next day and their minutes were absolutely clear that the 
money goes to OCM.  So how they then facilitated a 
guarantee in the favour of another entity that is nowhere in 
this transaction is beyond me.  But that was not the intention 
of the board and that was not what we signed off. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Did the board make a follow up on 
the decision it had made? 
MS NAIDOO:  No so what happens with a Round Robin it 
gets ratified at a later stage.  After the 8t h of September 
when I sent that email I never heard back from Ms Daniels 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 260 of 294 
 
so I did not know that this matter eventually went to IFC and 
that this happened. As I said on that particular media 
briefing I found out about it.  I went back and I looked at the 
submission I found it and then when I went to Parliament I 
advised them that you know I had never been told or nobody 
came back to me and said even there was an IFC meeting 
and this is what happened.  When I was preparing for IFC – 
for Parliament Ms Klein told me yes there was an IFC 
meeting. She sent me the minutes and the one with Dr Pat 
and that is how I knew about it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but this goes back… 
MS NAIDOO:  So it is my understanding the matter ended on 
the 8t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes let us go back to December because 
the decision is made on the 9t h of – yours is actually given – 
your approval is given on the 8 t h of December.  So you did 
not wait for twelve on the 9t h to find out if you made this IFC 
requirement a prerequisite for your decision you did not wait 
for it to be fulfilled you gave your consent and then you say 
– you say semantics that IFC committee has approved the 
20 
purchase.  From December 2015 to June 2016 when you 
ultimately resigned is a period of seven months.  What did 
you do in that period to find out what happened with this 
massive amount of a decision that was made by the board by 
way of a Round Robin? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 261 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:  So in my email to be clear Advocate Seleka I 
said kindly ensure – ensure means you need to come back 
and validate with me that these things had happened.  I 
know Ms Daniels has argued in Parliament that the word 
ensure is not subject to.  But if you google it it comes to you 
have validate and come back to that person. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  So as a board member I am telling her to do 
this. The right thing would have been for her to come back to 
me and the fact that she failed or did not come back I 
10 
assumed that the matter had ended there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is right. 
MS NAIDOO:  And you must understand we get so many 
transactions it is not – I do not always go back and follow up 
and say what you know what happened here or whatever. 
Normally it will come back as an agenda item at my next 
meeting or it is reflected in the minutes and then you enquire 
what transpired on the matter.  I mean I showed you a 
screen shot of our meeting for two months there were over 
twenty meetings.  So it is – you know it is phenomenal how 
20 
many meetings we had which is – I did not follow up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – oh he is busy I am sorry.  Ja 
because I was going to ask you what is the answer to the 
question.  Neither did the board follow up.  But why? 
MS NAIDOO:  Because… 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 262 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But why because… 
MS NAIDOO:  Because we assumed that the matter – as I 
said to you – I said I thought the matter had ended there and 
then.  But the matter was never approved.  Remember it 
would have to then go to DPE approval and things like that.  
And it becomes an operational issue.  It falls back into an 
operational issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So are you saying it should not in the 
first place have come to the board? 
MS NAIDOO:  The 1.6 had to come to the board because of 
10 
… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and the board makes the decision 
because – on an urgent basis. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For reasons of the risk of supply and I 
think you did say there might be load shedding if you do not 
make the decision but I mean it is a – it is an explanation in 
the submission also talking about business rescue.  Ja 
somewhat confusing. 
MS NAIDOO:  So what would have transpired it would have 
20 
been in terms of a Round Robin it gets ratified.  Ms Daniels 
in her affidavit says that this was ratified on the 19 t h April.  I 
went and I looked at the minutes.  There is a submission on 
the 19t h April for a ratification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that 2016? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 263 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:  2016 but there is no record of it in the 
minutes.  So this was never – no sorry there is a record of it 
in the minutes.  But to be honest with you I do not ever 
remember that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what did you ratify because the… 
 
MS NAIDOO:  But the ratification – according to Ms Daniels 
… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no. why – no I am asking you. What 
did you ratify? 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  I do not remember it being ratified but when I 
go back now and I look at the minutes the minutes is saying 
a pre-purchase of coal from OCM is ratified on the 19t h of 
April 2016.  So even four months later knowing full well that 
the pre-purchase never happened and instead a guarantee 
happened company secretaries ratifying a pre-purchase and 
it is not ratified I think the word says noted if I am not 
mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you did not know about the 
guarantee? 
20 
MS NAIDOO:  No not at all. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know that the guarantee the 
terms of the guarantee came about – came from an email of 
infoportal to Mr Koko from Mr Koko to Ms Daniels and Ms 
Daniels instructing the attorneys CDH to draft the terms of 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 264 of 294 
 
the pre-purchase agreement. 
MS NAIDOO:  No I did not know that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You heard the evidence we led. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes I did yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  All the more to the Chairperson’s point 
about 
how outside people were influencing 
what 
was 
happening inside Eskom.  I mean in that trail of emails it 
leaves one with no doubt that that guarantee does not come 
from within Eskom.  It is a decision from somebody outside 
of Eskom because he provides the terms of what should be 
10 
in the guarantee. 
MS NAIDOO:  And further to that it is a total violation of 
what the board ruling was on the meeting of the 10 t h or the 
9t h the IFC minutes where the – Mr Singh I have read his 
affidavit he says he was on that call and I think Ms Klein 
also confirmed it that he was on the IFC call when they said 
that the – they approve a pre-purchase of coal to OCM.  So 
these are two different legal entities I do not understand how 
they took the – and they were guaranteed to a third party 
that has no relation to this particular transaction. And further 
20 
in terms of our delegation a guarantee for the board is R250 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you coming to the realisation that 
indeed maybe there is truth in the suggestion that this board 
of Eskom or at least maybe some members of it may have 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 265 of 294 
 
been party to some agenda by people who were outside of 
Eskom and influencing what decisions were being taken 
inside Eskom both by the board and by officials? 
MS NAIDOO:  Chair I am going to be very careful with my 
words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  I do not believe it is the board because on the 
basis of the evidence and what happened with OCM on the 
9t h of December there was no authorisation towards Tegeta.  
So with due respect I leave out peoples’ lives and I am not 
10 
going to make the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look – look – have you looked at the 
resolution in the minutes of the board? 
MS NAIDOO:  For?  For the IFC? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The resolution of – that was passed by the 
board at the meeting where – is it on the 9 t h of December? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 9t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 9t h of December 2015 with regard 
to the pre-payment.  Have you looked at those minutes? 
MS NAIDOO:  I have looked at the minutes of the IFC yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you looked the resolution is at the 
end of the minutes.  Have you looked at them? 
MS NAIDOO:  I am sure I have I just do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  They – that resolution is quite clear.  
It quotes verbatim clause or paragraph 2.1.2 that we talked 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 266 of 294 
 
about earlier which had proposed owners. 
MS NAIDOO:  Has it been signed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS NAIDOO:  Was that signed by the IFC Chair or the 
Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not – I cannot remember whether 
it is signed but that is what it says and it is not – it is not 
surprising because that is what has been – been the – the 
Executives had asked the board to authorise and what 
seems to have been done is to take that out from the 
10 
submission and put it in the resolution.  As – were the 
minutes signed that we are talking about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  These minutes are not signed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They indicate a Round Robin decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but there may be signed ones I do not 
know but there would have been I would imagine after a 
meeting there would circulate minutes the time to sign might 
be another time but at some stage they would be circulated, 
would they not?  And I would imagine if they did not circulate 
20 
them the secretary – company secretary, members of the 
board would want – would demand that they be circulated so 
that they see whether what they decided is correctly 
captured in the minutes and the resolution. 
MS NAIDOO:  Dr Naidoo’s minutes were signed. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 267 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the committee? 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am talking about the board. 
MS NAIDOO:  And the resolution would have been – have to 
be in drafted from those minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  But I do not know what transpired after that.  I 
have only got these minutes that he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the board you were part of the 
10 
meeting of the board and the resolution might not be – the 
minutes might not be signed but they reflect basically what 
was in paragraph 2.1.2 which you had seen.  
MS NAIDOO:  Yes but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they are quite – they are quite clear.  
That paragraph was clear – that one you – you … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have conceded. 
MS NAIDOO:  You might not have seen but it was quite 
clear.  So it seems to me that even if we might not be having 
this signed minutes and if they exist somewhere I suspect 
20 
they reflect exactly what was written in paragraph 2.1.2 
which is in the unsigned minutes and if they are quite clear 
the board authorised the conclusion of pre-purchase of coal 
agreement with the proposed owners.  So you cannot say the 
board authorised pre-payment to Glencore OCM because it 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 268 of 294 
 
is there.  
MS NAIDOO:  But Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what they were asked all you 
can say or some members of the board may say is I never 
intended to authorise pre-payment to the proposed owners of  
OCM and then we can talk about how probable that is but in 
terms of what you intended that is one line. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of what you objectively 
authorised that is what you authorised. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:  But Chair those – that resolution that is 
signed – that resolution in terms of what you make reference 
to is an unethical document because it is not what the board 
decided on.  So somebody at a later stage signed the 
resolution are not what I see agreed they were being 
unethical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but you do not dispute that the 
document that was placed before you the submission or the 
executive summary asked you to authorise pre-pay – a pre-
payment to Tegeta.  You – you say you did not see that other 
20 
members say or one member says he saw it but did not 
appreciate its significance because he knew that the existing 
contract was with OCM Glencore and so – so I am 
suggesting to you that if there are any – if there are existing 
minutes that are signed in all probability they will be along 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 269 of 294 
 
the lines of paragraph 2.1.2. 
MS NAIDOO:  And Chair that is then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not know if the record … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There can be minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There can be minutes for a Round Robin. 
MS NAIDOO: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh by the way it was a Round Robin. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay but the fact of the matter is – but 
in the Round Robin. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is the document that has – is it – 
where is the document that they were – the resolution that 
they were asked to sign – to approve? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  The submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is the submission then you autho – you 
authorised pre-payment. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pre-payment to OCM – to Tegeta then. 
MS NAIDOO:  But it was overwritten by the IFC minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NAIDOO:  It was overwritten by the IFC minutes.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 270 of 294 
 
Irrespective what happened on the 8t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No.  No Ms Naidoo you know that 
what you are saying is – cannot be right I mean you cannot 
have a lower body – the minutes of a lower body overriding 
the minutes of a higher body.  The higher body makes the 
final decision. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is clear from that submission. 
MS NAIDOO:  Chair with due respect the matter went to IFC 
the next day and – because the board requested that.  And 
10 
they made the final decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Dr Naidoo was here and he was 
chairing that meeting. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You heard – you heard what he said. 
MS NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He could not – he could not defend the 
proposition as – that was my assessment – this as  - the 
proposition that they authorised anything other than pre-
payment to Tegeta but what he did say was in his mind and 
20 
in the mind of the committee that is what he said they 
thought they were authorising pre-payment to Glencore OCM 
but the questions that I have asked you know and he kept on 
advancing as his reasons to justify his evidence that they 
intended to authorise pre-payment to Glencore OCM.  The 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 271 of 294 
 
reason he kept on advancing is a reason that actually goes 
against him. 
MS NAIDOO:  But Chair his minute which he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NAIDOO:  His minute of IFC which he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I recall correctly we looked at them in 
the morning to say the favourable interpretation of those 
minutes favourable to you would be that it could go either 
way. 
MS NAIDOO:  No it does not talk of any proposed owner. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no have you looked at those 
minutes?  When did you last look at them? 
MS NAIDOO:  I have got it in my submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And – ja… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just draw his attention – her attention to 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least what we looked at in the morning 
seemed to me to say the least that it was neutral. 
MS NAIDOO:  No it is not – it is clear OCM. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  A distinction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see OCM – OCM does not have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Saying OCM does not have because for 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 272 of 294 
 
the owners of OCM before Tegeta came into the picture was 
Glencore.  The owners as I understand it of OCM after 
Glencore got out of the picture were Tegeta.  So if you say 
pre-payment to OCM it does not necessarily mean you mean 
Glencore or you mean Tegeta.  But when you say pre-
payment to the proposed owners of OCM it is clear that you 
are not talking about Glencore you are talking about Tegeta. 
MS NAIDOO:  But the IFC meeting was absolutely black and 
white OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – ja but that is the point we are 
10 
talking about to say that does not help you either way that is 
why I am saying to say the least that could be neutral 
because OCM – is it OCM under Tegeta or OCM under 
Glencore?  The submission that was placed before the board 
talked about OCM the proposed owners of OCM. 
MS NAIDOO:  But Chair I did not know OCM on the 9 t h of 
December was owned by Tegeta? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Otherwise, the submission 
would not say proposed owners.   
MS NAIDOO:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the...the minutes.  I will refer you 
to the signed minutes.  They are in Eskom Bundle 18, page 
584.   
MS NAIDOO:   Sorry, which page? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 273 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 584, Eskom Bundle 18, one 
eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I might not need to see if you just 
read. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Because we looked at them in the 
morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bracket A. 
MS NAIDOO:   Is it 18(A) or 18(B)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18(A).. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18(A).  So ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 854, five eight four.  So there is 
only item on the agenda.  
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 5.   
“Noted that there was only one item on the 
agenda which as discussed around a Round-
robin resolution for the urgent request to 
20 
approve 
the 
pre-purchase 
of 
coal 
from 
Optimum Coal (Pty) Ltd.” 
 
Then 6.1: 
“The Round-robin resolution and supporting 
documents circulated to members. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 274 of 294 
 
The 
urgent 
request 
to 
approve 
the 
pre-
purchase of coal from OCM (Pty) Ltd, OCM 
was 
discussed, 
details 
of 
which 
were 
circulated to board members on 8 December 
2015.” 
 
On the next page, 585: 
“The resolution.  It is recommended that the 
board approve the transaction as set out in the 
submission to the board relating to the pre-
purchase of coal from Optimum (Pty) Ltd.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it still says in the submission? 
MS NAIDOO:   But it says from Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what is in the submission? 
MS NAIDOO:   Proposed owners. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Proposed owners. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   But then we are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you cannot say when the resolution 
makes 
the 
basis 
of 
your 
decision, 
the 
submission, 
incorporates it and the submission is quite clear.  It does 
20 
not look like to me you can ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   A lawyer ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...run away.  It does not seem that you 
can run away from saying ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   No, the lawyer and he is going to argue the 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 275 of 294 
 
intention of the parties was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] I think you might wish to leave 
that to Mr Roux.  [laughs] 
MS NAIDOO:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I see I have just gone past half-past five 
10 
– half-past six. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Half-past six, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Finalise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me finalise.  Indeed.  So 
Ms Naidoo, 
you 
see 
the 
sequence 
of 
events. 
 
In 
December 2015, the board does not ...[indistinct] say.  And 
four months later or less than four months later, in April 
2016 the deal has been concluded. 
 
The deal is subject to suspensive conditions, the 
purchase of shares in OCM.  That would expire on the 
20 
31 s t  of March 2016.  The full payment has to be made on 
13 or 15 April 2016. 
 
On the 11 t h of April 2016, the Business Rescue 
Practitioner, 
Mr 
Piers 
Marsden 
is 
approached 
by 
Mr Nazeem Howa.  And he says to him, Tegeta has a 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 276 of 294 
 
shortfall.  He is Tegeta’s CEO.   
 
Tegeta has a shortfall of R 600 million.  We 
cannot.  We are struggling to do – to service the balance.  
And could you approach the consortium of banks for a 
bridging loan of them to defer the amount. 
 
11 April 2016, a response is given to Mr Howa 
around 15:00 on that day that the banks have declined that 
request.  So Tegeta is having its back open.  And that is 
what is happening on the one side. 
 
Something 
else 
is 
happening 
within 
Eskom.  
10 
Tegeta which has been giving coal to Eskom pursuant to an 
interim agreements dating back to January 2016, now 
comes to Eskom in April. 
 
Roundabout the 8 t h of April, Ms Nteta said even 
before the 8 t h of April she is approached by Mr Nath with 
an unsolicited offer to supply coal but that offer is not plain 
and simple.  It incorporates a prepayment request all of a 
sudden. 
 
There has been the short-term agreements where 
prepayment was not given but now this one, when they 
20 
want to enter into the first interim contract, they are asking 
for a prepayment and a prepayment of six hundred-and... 
 
Well, firstly, it is unclear how much they want.  
Dr Nteta – you would have heard her if you watched.  She 
came up with an amount of R 500 million which ultimately 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 277 of 294 
 
gets up to R 659 million. 
 
Something that she was dealing with for the first 
time, she says, prepayment.  And the board again...  Oh, 
and this time it is the BTC.  I beg your pardon.  The BTC 
again, this time around, is told and asked to act on an 
urgent basis in order to approve the prepayment of 
R 659 million. 
 
They 
draft 
a 
submission 
document 
over 
the 
weekend without a written offer from Tegeta.  They get the 
written offer only on the 11 t h of April 2016 after half-past 
10 
four.  Mr Nazeem Howa by this time knows that he is not 
getting the assistance from the consortium of banks. 
 
The BTC is urged to meet after-hours, late at 
night, 
at 
nine 
o’clock 
to 
make 
a 
decision 
on 
the 
prepayment by way of a telephone conference.   
 
And they do so despite the meeting of the BTC 
being scheduled beforehand for the 13 t h of April 2016 and 
the decision is made to prepay Tegeta.  
 
The decision is finalised on the 13 t h of April.  So 
the BTC meeting does take place and they finalise the 
20 
payment, the decision on the payment and the payment is 
made despite issues that Tegeta had growing concern 
problems.   
 
The banks have closed Tegeta’s bank – well, 
frozen their bank accounts because of State Capture 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 278 of 294 
 
allegations.   
 
So you see a continuation of efforts on the part of 
Eskom to assist Tegeta in this acquisition of OCM at least 
on the facts that what it appears to be.  Did you know of 
these facts? 
MS NAIDOO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you have any comment? 
MS NAIDOO:   So we ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, sorry just before that because I 
know that you served on BTC. 
10 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At this stage.  Okay so you went, if I 
recall, 
this 
request 
for 
BTC 
to 
meet 
by 
way 
of 
a 
teleconference would have come to you as well. 
MS NAIDOO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why was it so urgent? 
MS NAIDOO:   Well, according to what I was told that this 
contract is about to expire.  I think the covering letter says 
in two days or three days which maybe could have been 
the day of the particular BTC meeting and they could not 
20 
wait for that day to negotiate or finalise this matter. 
 
And if they do not deal with this matter on that 
particular day, there would have been no coal for Arnot and 
as a result we would have to go into load shedding. 
 
So when I got the call from Ms Daniels – I think 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 279 of 294 
 
she either called us or SMS’d us and then I expressed to 
her my concern.  She said no it is very urgent but they will 
address it on the call.   
 
And that is when she sent me the submission or 
she could have sent me the submission first and then she 
sent me a message to say:  Go read your email.  And then 
I had this conversation with her.  I do not know whether it 
was via SMS or a call but we did discuss it. 
 
And then we went on the call.  We got – I think the 
call was set for nine o’clock and all of this happened 
10 
between quarter past eight and nine o’clock at night. 
 
She said it was very urgent and that we needed to 
do this.  So because of the urgency, I did not object to it 
and the fact that the submission was already put to me, I 
had to deal with it. 
 
But between that time, then I started emailing her 
questions and she said it will be dealt with on the call.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So...  Yes, I...  If you followed the 
testimony of Dr Nteta.  She said and repeating what is in 
her affidavit.  That she did not see a reason why the 
20 
meeting should be convened on the 11 t h because the 
decision 
could 
comfortable 
be 
made 
on 
the 
13 t h of April 2016.  What do you say to that? 
MS NAIDOO:   I have listened to her evidence and I was 
very surprised because why would I agree to have a 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 280 of 294 
 
meeting at nine o’clock at night on a Monday?  I have got 
small kids.  This was already annoying me enough.   
 
So they definitely expressed to the urgency or we 
would have never ever held that meeting.   Even if you look 
at my questions.  My questions relate to why this was 
being so late.   
 
I have even sent doctor – Mr Zethembe Khoza an 
email after the telecon to say:  You need to stop calling 
these meetings so late.  Who was the executive on the 
call?  I was very upset.   
10 
 
I was very angry about it.  And the irony is that, 
that call is not recorded as usual.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the teleconference is not 
recorded.  You say as usual.   
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, because the lifeline of this board right 
now are the recordings of the minutes that we have.  But it 
seems the 23 r d of April recording, it was never recorded.  
On the 11 t h of March, the recording starts at twenty past 
twelve instead of twelve o’clock. 
 
The 
recording 
for 
this 
particular 
one 
is 
not 
20 
recorded yet on the call I remember asking specifically if it 
is recorded.  I even sent an email to say send me the 
minutes.  So I only find out later that there is no recording 
being held. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  The other thing that I want to put 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 281 of 294 
 
to you from Dr Nteta.  I asked her whether could this 
supply plan of April 2018, which is relied upon in the 
submission, be used to justify the alleged urgency.  And 
her answer was no.  She said I know where you are going.  
My answer is no.  Because I know where you are going. 
MS NAIDOO:   In her evidence she said that there was no 
urgency. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   So why would was she party to a meeting at 
nine o’clock at night if she felt that there was no urgency?  
10 
Why was she then responding on questions that we asked?  
No board member in their right mind will hold an urgent 
meeting at that nature and be so upset about it when you 
have got the BTC two days later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did the BTC member not ask this 
question? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, we did.  We even asked why this was 
coming to us because it was below our threshold.  I think 
the figure was 659. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   Our threshold is 750.  The answer given, 
and it is in the minutes to say:  Well, the BTC had signed 
off 
on 
a 
previous 
agreement 
so 
therefore 
it 
is 
a 
continuation.  Now when I went back and I looked.  The 
BTC never signed off on the Tegeta short-term addendum.  
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 282 of 294 
 
It signed off on a strategy, I think in February or March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are right.  The mandate? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   So we were so caught up with all these 
things that they are telling us, that you have so much trust 
and faith in them.  Why would you for a second believe that 
somebody is being unethical? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I asked the question whether did they 
mislead the BTC.  Should I ask you that question whether 
10 
you feel that you had been misled? 
MS NAIDOO:   Of course, I was misled.  When I heard 
Ms Nteta...  You know, Judge.  When the Public Protector ’s 
report came out, I was so confident because I believed the 
people that I worked with like Brian and Matjila and all of 
them, which will come back and defend all of that.  And 
some of them did.   
 
So hearing evidence now, it gives me – it is 
absolutely shocking.  People are not taking responsibility 
for their actions.   
20 
 
I know that matter came before me.  I accepted to 
deal with the matter at nine o’clock at night because I am 
told it is urgent.   
 
You can see from the questions that I sent that I 
was not happy.  I was irritated and annoyed.  Then I said to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 283 of 294 
 
the chairperson why are you calling this meeting because I 
was not happy. 
 
So it was a reflection of what I was going through 
at that particular night but I believed them in terms of the 
urgency and the fact that when Brian came in August.  So 
at that stage there was no load shedding. 
 
I understood the implications of load shedding on 
South Africa and the economy and I was a proud board 
member that time to say but I stopped load shedding.  So 
of course the intention was to do whatever is necessary to 
10 
make this company run. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the other thing is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Wait.  We are at quarter to Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just alerting you to the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  The last thing is.  Did I 
say the last?  The other thing.  The other thing is.  At that 
time, Tegeta did not have a contract with OCM.  It had not 
concluded the contract with OCM to procure the coal which 
it was offering to Eskom.  It did not have the contract. 
20 
 
In fact, the written offer explicitly says to Eskom 
that they will be buying this coal from OCM and selling it to 
Eskom.  I am paraphrasing.  But they will purchase from 
OCM to sell to you. 
 
So there are two things.  The one is, they do not 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 284 of 294 
 
have.  The second thing is.  Why did you not deal directly 
with OCM?  Why this middleman, this intermediary? 
MS NAIDOO:   It is ironic you ask me that question 
because Advocate Banaras(?) called me to ask me the 
same question.  And he kept going on and on and on.   
 
And I could not understand what he was trying to 
say because one of the questions that I put – I sent about 
nine questions why the RFP was late, why are we dealing 
with these companies, can we justify to the DPE that we 
are doing the best deal for Eskom before this matter is in 
10 
the public domain. 
 
And one of the questions was.  Is this company the 
company that Tegeta bought?  Is OCM the company Tegeta 
bought?  Are they now being run by the Business Rescue 
Practitioner?   
 
And is one of the issues that if it is run by the 
Business Rescue Practitioner, we do this deal with them.  
Is there a possibility Eskom could lose its money?  The 
answer is:  Yes.  The answer I am told is yes.   
 
I am given the impression that OCM – that Tegeta 
20 
owns OCM.  But I recalled in February when I – when my 
husband was an advisor and I said I do not be part of any 
mining transactions but there was a submission put to us 
and I excused myself from it. 
 
The submission was the session of contracts from 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 285 of 294 
 
Eskom...  No, sorry.  From OCM to Tegeta.  But in my mind 
– and that is why I asked that question – is Tegeta taking 
over OCM and they own that particular company. 
 
So I did not understand why Vignale(?) they kept 
pushing that question.  I only found it later on in 
Parliament when the evidence was led that the transaction, 
it only finalised in August 2016. 
 
But 
to 
answer 
you 
even 
further. 
 
On 
the 
13 t h of April, when we had called Mr Anoj Singh to come 
and give us a verification on the guarantee, Mr Singh 
10 
started his conversation by saying:  Yes, I have looked at 
the submission.  Which means the submission went to 
himself. 
 
He was happy with it.  He apologised to us for 
overseeing the growing concern issue.  He said thank you 
to us for bringing it to his attention.  Because initially the 
guarantee he had was the cession of the revenue and the 
coal.   
 
But now the fact that this may be a growing 
concern, he did not foresee in six months what will be 
20 
happening.  Therefore, he has now gone back to Tegeta 
and now they will give us a pledge of the shares of the 
mine. 
 
We 
will 
now 
own 
the 
mine. 
 
It 
will 
be 
unencumbered.  Why then must I doubt that I am not 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 286 of 294 
 
sufficiently covered in terms of my 659?  He is telling me 
that I will own it, he said it will be unencumbered.   
 
And he says I will then also get a copy of their 
financials and I would see what is unencumbered and what 
is an encumbered asset. 
 
And then he goes further by saying:  No, I 
understand we are not in the business of owning mines.  
We will give them this temporary for 14-days and then we 
will get a better guarantee. 
 
So I am absolutely confident firstly and I am doing 
10 
it for the benefit of Eskom.  I am helping.  And so by this 
call, create the stockpile, get the discount and then further 
my money is... 
 
So I would have had...  Why if I know that this 
company had not taken over this particular mine, why 
would I ask for a company that has got nothing for a 
guarantee?  I am unencumbered ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you get that information? 
MS NAIDOO:   I have been told by my CFO.  Yes, this is 
what Tegeta will give us. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but did you get that information? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, we got it on the 13 t h of April.  The 
recording is absolutely clear.  It is in my submissions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Unencumbered assets? 
MS NAIDOO:   Unencumbered assets.  I have quoted it 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 287 of 294 
 
verbatim.  And we have, you know, quoted it - I may have 
missed out a line or two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS NAIDOO:   But you can do the part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you are saying to the Chairperson.  
You gave this company R 659 million repayment despite 
knowing that it had growing concern issues? 
MS NAIDOO:   The growing concern issues is not with – 
nothing about whether it had money or it was a revenue 
issue.  It was whether they would have a bank account.  
10 
And that is why I needed – and it was not a set thing.  It 
was a possibility that after five months that would be the 
scenario.  And that the expense was by the CFO on the 
13 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the banks had frozen their 
account. 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay I think the...  Well, the advice that I 
was given by the CFO that it was a four month or a six 
month.  It is actually in the recording, the situation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I am going to finish with this.  
20 
One is that.  Why did you not ask:  But we having been 
interim 
agreements 
with 
this 
company, 
short-term 
agreements?  Why did they know what a prepayment? 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, one of the questions were:  Why is this 
different to what our normal transactions were? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 288 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.  Not a normal transaction.  
Tegeta ...[intervenes]  
MS NAIDOO:   With this particular company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, with this company and the submission 
even says it.  You are getting better quality coal from a 
stockpile.  My interpretation of a stockpile is the coal is 
there.  It is ready to go and take it.  It is in your 
submission.  It is on the second page of the submission to 
say this is coming from the OCM stockpile.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay but now the reason given in that 
very 
submission 
is 
that 
Tegeta 
have 
requested 
a 
prepayment in order – and I paraphrase – to reopen the 
export component of the mine.   
MS NAIDOO:   I do not think they said reopen.  I think they 
said something about production or whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, in the submission itself, not the 
written offer made by Tegeta on the 11 t h.  Because 
Dr Nteta said that one was not placed before the board.   
MS NAIDOO:   I...  Sorry.  Are you talking about the 
20 
submission ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the submission itself. 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It talks about the export component of 
the mine.   
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 289 of 294 
 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, it talks about that.  The Tegeta/OCM is 
going to give you the coal from the export component of 
OCM Mine ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it does not say it is going to give 
you coal from there. 
MS NAIDOO:   Your very first paragraph on the top of the 
second page.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let me...  That submission, when it 
talks about the prepayments, it says: 
“Both suppliers have indicated the willingness 
10 
to extend current contracts.” 
 
And this is the only paragraph talking about that 
effect. 
“However, Tegeta has requested that Eskom 
consider some form of prepayment to enable it 
to meet the production requirements from the 
export component of the mine.” 
MS NAIDOO:   Okay now read the paragraph right at the 
top. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a long, long paragraph. 
20 
MS NAIDOO:   The first two lines above the six hundred 
thousand that it is coming from OCM export stockpile.  So 
even on the...   
 
Well, they told us that this is a good, better quality 
and the reasoning behind it is that this company could 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 290 of 294 
 
export is and therefore it now says if you want us to keep it 
for you, you will have to pay a prepayment.  
 
And the whole idea was to get this and to commit 
to it because Arnot would not have coal and as a result we 
were load shedding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but if you are saying to the 
Chairperson the coal that was going to be supplied was 
from the stockpile.  Why did you let them to make a 
prepayment? 
MS NAIDOO:   Because they would have exported it 
10 
because it was export quality and there was no reason for 
them to ...[indistinct] they could sell it to somebody else.  
That is what I have been told to say you need it.  You are 
in a situation.  You prepay me for it.  This is now yours.  
You committed to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but that is not Dr Nteta’s evidence. 
MS NAIDOO:   Yes, Dr Nteta’s evidence is now a totally 
different scenario as to what was told to us on that 
meeting.  She is even saying now that this was not an 
urgent matter.   
20 
 
Why would I sit down at nine o’clock at night for a 
meeting?  For my convenience?  Absolutely not.  And then 
insist on an unencumbered guarantee from a company that 
everyone is alleging did not have money.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, I will bring it to 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 291 of 294 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously, Ms Naidoo should come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we will... [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in regard to the supplementary 
affidavit, also to finalise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she is going to come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then to finalise some of these issues.  
But I see from her affidavit that there may be some issues 
in relations – there may be some issues on her version in 
relation to the meetings of the 11 t h of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the suspensions and so on.  I think 
certain things need to be raised with her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think let us stop here for now and 
we will just have to find another – probably in the evening 
20 
again.  If Mr Roux, if we are looking at a date within two 
weeks, we will ...[intervenes]  
ADV LE ROUX:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You...  Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.  
So let us leave it at that for now.  Thank you to everybody 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 292 of 294 
 
for being able to work until this time.  We will find another 
date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hopefully within the next two weeks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And make it an evening session.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, tomorrow? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tomorrow, who are your witnesses? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There are two witnesses scheduled for 
tomorrow Chairperson.  We will – the first one is Mr Mark 
10 
Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second who is oversees is 
Ms Suzanne Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I know that there might a slight 
change in regard to that... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. Okay.  No, that is fine.  Alright. We 
are going to adjourn.  Or we should start early if possible 
tomorrow, is it not? 
20 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
We 
should 
be 
able 
to 
finish 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We should be able to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...with Mr Mark Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You think he might be how long? 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341 
 
Page 293 of 294 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He might be – based on what we need 
to have him cover, about three hours Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About three hours? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so we might not be able to get to 
Ms Daniels tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It might.  It might not be possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought Mr Pamensky was going to 
be much shorter from what you have said before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he has given us a supplementary 
10 
affidavit which I am yet to read.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  It could implicate other people? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we may have to deal with it along 
the lines with Ms Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So maybe we should rather start, at 
least, at half-past nine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because remember I am not sitting for 
the whole day tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I am sitting only for half of the day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  We start at half-past nine 
tomorrow.  Okay we are going to adjourn for the day.  We 
adjourn. 
10 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 341
