PROCEEDINGS ON 22 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Ms Hofmeyr on a Saturday morning, 
good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may just request then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Tlatsana 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Good morning Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may request an opportunity just for 
the legal representative of Ms Viljoen to place herself on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV ESTELLE KILLIAN:  Morning Judge Estelle Killian Johannesburg 
Bar instructed by Mouyis Cohen on behalf of Ms Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just one or two logistically matters if we 
may before we commence with Ms – well recommence with Mr 
Tlatsana’s evidence?  Chair when we concluded fairly late yesterday 
20 
evening we were anticipating the prospect that we may be able to get to 
Ms Viljoen’s evidence today.  Having looked at what still remains of Mr 
Tlatsana’s evidence that needs to be covered today my suggestion is 
that in fairness to Ms Viljoen who may well not be reached in her 
evidence today she be released from attending today to return on 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 3 of 172 
 
Monday morning.  The idea would be then to ensure that we complete 
Ms Tlatsana’s evidence today so that Ms Viljoen’s evidence can be the 
first up on Monday morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and they are agreeable to that? 
ADV ESTELLE KILLIAN:  We are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you very much.  Ms Viljoen you are 
released and please return on Monday morning.  Monday we will start 
ten o’clock? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ten o’clock should be fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think let us start at ten o’clock so be back at ten 
10 
o’clock. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If we may then continue with 
Ms Tlatsana? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we may continue.  The oath you took Ms Tlatsana 
will apply throughout until you have finished your evidence. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair one thing just as Ms Viljoen is leaving I 
20 
do just want to mention that Ms Viljoen’s lawyer was contacted 
yesterday about the fact that there is an aspect of Ms Tlatsana’s 
evidence that may be relevant to Ms Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does it require her to be in attendance 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 4 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the hearing today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But she should just be aware of that fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we then move Ms Tlatsana when we 
concluded yesterday we were at page 17, 17 of your affidavit and we 
were at the point… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one that DD… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is – apologies – DD8[a]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As in DD8[a]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  DD8[a] at page 17 and we were at paragraph 
4.36 there where we were dealing with the R500 000,00 that was 
transferred out of Koreneke’s account with – for a payment with a 
reference L Skakkel, do you see that Ms Tlatsana? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  Thank you, you may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Tlatsana you also 
20 
testified about an amount of initially R450 000,00 and then a 
subsequent about of R50,000,00 that was paid into the bank account of 
your other business Kenk Supplies and Facilitators and what I would 
then like to take you to is the next amount that comes into the 
Koreneke bank account as I have it from your affidavit in DD8[a] and 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 5 of 172 
 
you will find that at paragraph 4.37 on that page.  What amount was 
that and when was it received? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The amount is 8.5 million Chair it 
enter the account on the 27 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.  We 
looked at page 17 and then you referred to page 37? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No apologies Chair it is paragraph 4.37 on that 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay thank you.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana you were telling us 8.5 million 
10 
was received into the account and what was the date? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The date was the 27 August 2015 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then your affidavit progresses to track the 
amounts that then flow out of the account after the 27 August.  If you 
go down to paragraph 4.38 when – when was the next amount that went 
out and what was its amount? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The next amount was 5 million that 
came out from Koreneke account on the 16 September 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What explanation were you given for that 
20 
payment out of the account? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr Van Wyk indicated to me that it is 
for other stakeholders, fire trucks and the security cameras in both 
airports. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How did he indicate that to you? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 6 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He called me to inform Chair. 
ADV 
KATE 
HOFMEYR: 
 And 
what 
did 
you understand 
other 
stakeholders, fire trucks and security cameras to relate to? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Other stakeholders to me by then it 
was yes the – like he said the fire trucks and the cameras in both 
airports that was my understanding Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well was your understanding of your agreement 
with South African Express Airways that you were going to be required 
to purchase fire trucks? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  By that time I did not have the 
10 
contract Chair to know what was entailed in the contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Tlatsana you did have an idea of the 
proposal and the type of work that you envisaged doing, did you not?  
As I understood your testimony yesterday you had a sense from him on 
the day that you were signing that you would be doing ground handling 
work.  You would be maybe doing some gardening and some cleaning.  
So tell me why then fire trucks are a basis for R5 million exiting 
Koreneke’s account? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I did not know Chair that was the 
information that I was given by Mr Van Wyk that they are going to 
20 
purchase the fire trucks and the cameras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – the question is you were told that – you 
have said you were told that this amount was for other stakeholders.  
You were asked what you understood by the - and you said you thought 
it was for or you – or you were told it was for fire trucks.  Now the 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 7 of 172 
 
question was, was it your understanding that the business that your 
closed corporation was going to be involved in would involve trucks at 
any stage was that your understanding before this happened – before 
this amount of R5 million was taken out of your account. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it ever your understanding that your business 
included having anything to do with fire trucks? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the second explanation you were 
10 
given security cameras for the airports.  Did you understand that to be 
part of the business that you would be doing for South African Express? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you subsequently I understand from your 
affidavit you reference a later request to pay some money in relation to 
security cameras, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Tell us about that please? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  At a later stage in a – 2016 and I 
received a call from the Mafikeng securities that there have been 
20 
cameras that they have put and I have to pay – Koreneke has to pay an 
amount of R495 or 65 if I am not mistaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I can just give you the reference to assist Ms 
Tlatsana it is at page 20, 20 of your affidavit which is in Exhibit DD8[a] 
and you will find it at paragraph 4.50 on that page. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 8 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was that amount that you were required 
pay? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was required to R495 000,00 Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just get clear on the chronology.  This 
is after the 20 – the 16 September when an amount of R5 million goes 
out of the Koreneke account and you are told by Mr Van Wyk it is being 
used amongst other things for security cameras at the airport, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then later in 2016 as I have your testimony 
10 
you were required to make a further payment of R495 000,00 for 
security cameras, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And insofar as the fire trucks are concerned 
were you ever aware of any fire truck having been delivered to either 
the Mafikeng or the Pilanesberg airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  There was never a fire truck delivered 
to any of the airports Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And insofar as security cameras are concerned 
other than your testimony about the interaction in 2016 were you at any 
20 
other point aware of security cameras being installed at either of the 
airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I have never seen any security 
cameras being installed in any of the airports Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we just get clear because yesterday you 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 9 of 172 
 
gave us testimony that you actually had not visited Pilanesberg airport 
until a date at the end of 2016.  Can you tell us what the position is in 
relation to Mafikeng airport?  When had you been there? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I started going to the – to both 
airports from the beginning of 2016 Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  That is a correction then on my 
part.  I had incorrectly record your evidence to say the end of 2016.  So 
in both cases you went to both airports for the first time in early 2016, 
is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when you give evidence about what was or 
was not at the airports the fact that there were not fire trucks and the 
fact that there not security cameras that you are aware of being 
installed I must take that and correct me if I am wrong to be evidence 
related to the period after early 2016, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Come again with your question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies it was quite a detailed questioned.  
You have just given evidence Ms Tlatsana that you are not aware of fire 
trucks ever being delivered to either airport, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You also as I understand your testimony said 
you also do not know of any security cameras having been installed at 
either of the airports until your interaction around the R495 000,00, 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 10 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am now trying to understand is to what 
period does that knowledge relate because you only visited the two 
airports as I understand your evidence from early 2016, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So it is from that date that you can 
say you are aware of no fire trucks and no security cameras, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If fire trucks had been delivered prior to that do 
you think they would have still been at the airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Well let me be clear about my question.  
You did not ever see fire trucks, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I only saw an old fire truck in 
Mafikeng airport which when I asked Mr Kalisilira he said it is coming 
from Mpumalanga it is being hired to come and assist. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the question still remains.  Remember you 
have been told in – on the 16 September 2015 that the R5 million as I 
understand your testimony was going to be used to purchase amongst 
other things fire trucks, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your evidence is that no fire trucks were 
delivered to either airport, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you only visited the airports in early 2026, 
correct? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 11 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what I am probing is, is it possible that fire 
trucks were delivered between September and early 2016 then never to 
be seen again from early 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the basis for your answer for saying no it is 
not possible? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  There were no… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you say no it is not possible that the fire 
trucks could have been delivered between September 2015 and early 
2016?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The new, the new truck they were 
talking about it was not there and if it was delivered I would – I would 
have known I would have seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you could only have seen it early in 2016 
because you – I understood you to say you did not go to the airports 
before early 2016. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That was not a new fire truck 
20 
according to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That was not a new fire truck Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no am I correct in understanding your 
evidence to be that you only went to the airports in early 2016 – early 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 12 of 172 
 
in 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between September 2015 and January 2016 did you 
go to the airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how would you know if trucks did arrive during that 
period and were – and disappeared? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I – I did not know Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I would not have known Chair because 
10 
I have never been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but I thought you – your answer was that they 
could not have been there. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I misunderstood you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not know? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I would not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I misunderstand something Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No Chair it is the clarification we are indebted 
to you for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana if that is so did you have 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 13 of 172 
 
somebody working for you that was on sight in Mafikeng airport and 
Pilanesberg airport in that period September 2015 to early 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair there were facilities 
manager as well as the staff – the ground handling staff, the cleaning 
and the gardeners. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who was the facilities manager? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was Ms Nothandu Dube. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you make any enquiries of her as to 
whether fire trucks were being delivered or cameras were being 
installed? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I did not enquire from her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But she would have been on the ground at the 
time at the airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we could enquire from her? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I did not enquire from her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry I was saying we could ask her for that 
clarity? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No she is saying they will ask. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will ask – they will ask her whether she knows 
anything about fire trucks that may have come during that time. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  She would have – she would have said 
if a fire truck would have arrivd. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 14 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me who else apart from Ms Dube could have 
reported to you if fire trucks had arrived during that time? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The ground handling staff or the 
gardeners.  I think they would – no, no not I think – they would have 
reported but anyway it is not their responsibility to report to me.  The 
person to report is the facilities manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did she make regular reports to you during that 
time as a matter of fact? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair there was no relationship 
between me and Ms Nothando Dube she was reporting to Mr Brian Van 
Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would it be correct to say you had no expectation 
that she would tell you if anything happened at the airport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair I would say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So there was – is the position that there was 
nobody at the airport who you believe could have taken the trouble to 
tell you if there were trucks – there were fire trucks that had arrived? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair if – ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the position only during that time namely 
September 2015 to early 2017 or was that the position throughout from 
May when you started working – your company started working 
throughout? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  From the beginning – from the 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 15 of 172 
 
inception of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the business. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Of the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of ground handling. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to the end. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you were – you were in charge – you were – 
you were the founder of the closed corporation.  You were the person 
who came with the idea and sold the idea to relevant people but there 
10 
was nobody that was working in the airports – in the two airports who 
was reporting back to you as to what is happening? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  If I have to respond to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The business was hijacked from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The business was hijacked from you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when – at what stage did you realise that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Um… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what stage did you come to that conclusion that my 
20 
business has been hijacked? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair the business was hijacked in the 
beginning because a lot of things were happening.  Mr Kalisilira would 
do the transactions I would not know.  I would just see from the phone 
that money has gone and after the money has gone if I ask I will be told 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 16 of 172 
 
another story that the money has gone according to the way it appeared 
on the statement and on the phone.  If I have to – to ask of the daily 
running’s of the business no, no it is not necessary we are doing the 
reports – the reports are in the files – we are doing the reports and 
then we are giving the reports to SA Express because on daily basis for 
whatever services that was done they have to send the reports to Ms 
Jacobs, Maureen Jacobs.  So they were communicating alone the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the question is at what stage did you come to 
the conclusion that your business had been hijacked? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I had no control of it Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I understand that part.  At what stage did 
you realise that my business has been hijacked?  Was it in May when 
you started … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Working on this ground handling business with SA 
Express?  Was it in March, was it in July, was it in August 2015, was it 
in 2016 or was it in 2018, 2019, when was it did you realise what has 
happened here is that my business has been hijacked? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair in the beginning when – during 
the flow – immediately when the first money enters into the account if I 
20 
ask I was irritating the tone of Mr Van Wyk started to change.  He will 
just shut me out and answer me quickly just to dismiss me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No Ms Tlatsana.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Which is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand what you are saying.  I want you to tell 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 17 of 172 
 
me exactly what happened. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am listening to your evidence very attentively 
but I am asking now for the third time at what stage did you realise that 
your business had been hijacked?  Was it in 2015, 2016.. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No it is difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2017, 2019, yesterday or today, when exactly? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  2015 I think June, July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016 or 2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  10, 15. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015 okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around June, July? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And when you realised this what did 
you decide to do about it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was a concern to me Chair and I 
communicated this concern with my spiritual father in church and he 
advised me that you know if things are going like this the only thing 
that you do is record everything – everything that is happening, every 
20 
communication record it so that you could have something to stand on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are maybe asking you things that maybe should 
be asked later in terms of the sequence but I want to find out now.  Let 
me go back to yesterday’s evidence.  When you agreed to Mr Van Wyk’s 
suggestion that you should take in more people in your closed 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 18 of 172 
 
corporation and he suggested two names and you agreed to have them 
as registered as members of your closed corporation did they pay you 
anything for the interest namely shares in terms of closed corporations 
it is called interest but effectively for the shares in your company? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask them to pay anything? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they bring anything of value to the – to the 
business as you understood at that time? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you all three become equal partners as it 
were in the business? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of dividends were you all going to get 
equal shares of dividends? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you going to get more? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  According to Mr Van Wyk he was 
saying that there would be – it is just for the – for the [indistinct] to 
indicate that at least people are there.  They will just get small portion 
20 
of dividends at the end of the year.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you say in terms of paperwork. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yex. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were registered as equal partners to you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair 33, 33. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 19 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then I was 34%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not seek any legal advice in regard to 
this before you agreed to this? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you say when you were – had spoken to 
your spiritual advisor you did not decide to take any steps – stop – any 
steps to put an end to the hijacking of your business? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair I thought of all those but 
now I – I have to have something on concrete to say this is what they 
10 
were doing.  I did not come that I should be on a haste to take any 
legal steps hence I reported to SA Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  My experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By July or around July 2015 is that when you said you 
got about R450 or R500 000,00 from this ground handling business that 
the accountant put into the account of your other company, was it 
around about that time to July 2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  If I have to – can I check my 
statement? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: You can check but you do not have to be exact, July, 
June, August I am happy as long as – I just want to remind – to be 
reminded about around when you got the R450 – the R500 000,00? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I do not remember the time but 
ja that was … 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 20 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was somewhere in the middle of 2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Up to that stage you had not been physically 
threatened that if you did not agree to do anything you would be 
harmed had you?  Had any of the people involved here physically 
threatened you with anything? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair Mr Brian Van Wyk’s character is 
– he is a very arrogant person and he is very bully.  And he was very 
bully by the end I was to do as he says.  And if I questioned he would 
threaten me that he will report me to the ANC people, his – he is 
10 
secured by the ANC people so what he is telling me to do I must just do 
as he says I should do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you scared of that threat? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair I was scared because I – I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What could the ANC do to you if he told them 
whatever he might tell them about you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  By then what came into my mind that 
was the time – that was – I do not know whether it was during or after 
the – that incident of Mr Bozwana when he was killed and the – for me 
to save my life is just to be quiet and abide with what Mr Van Wyk was 
20 
saying I should do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because he would boast to me that he 
is a high person in the ANC and I am – I am asking too much questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you – what did you think the ANC would do to 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 21 of 172 
 
you that you were fearing? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To be killed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you think that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair Mr Van Wyk… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you think the ANC would kill you?  Well what 
– what had you done which you thought would make the ANC want to – 
want you dead? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair here is the project that is going 
on and I am busy asking Mr van Wyk so many questions.  He is getting 
irritable.  I am calling – I am not finding him and what is it – the thing 
10 
was what is it that I want to know because I told you that we are here – 
I am here to assist you to see that the project is going smooth. 
Why do you not just relax as I told you that you should just 
relax?  That is what he was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your spiritual advisor advised you to what – to 
record everything (intervenes)? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Every communication, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For what purpose in the end? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  For the purpose … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you – as you understand what he was saying. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  For the purpose if maybe this would 
lead me into – maybe if killing, death or maybe this at a later stage just 
be observant, just be listening to him and be observant.  Create 
conversations so that he should end up saying what his intention is he 
– does he want to do with this company because the way he was going 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 22 of 172 
 
on it was not good.  It was very bad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your point of view as you were recording 
activities and discussions did you intend taking all of these things to 
some authorities to say look what so and so has been doing? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because it was too much on 
my head.  I did not – I could not even think straight by then because 
here is a business.  Here is my life and then I – I was seeking advice 
from the people.  One of the first person who I spoke to is – it was 
Ms Jacobs who is working for SA Express and then she advised me that 
why do you not contact the security in our company, Mr Ngwenya … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And – to inform him this – about – 
about this thing.  Anyway this – these things they came in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  About – go to – contact Mr Ngwenya 
and try and talk to him because immediately after – can I Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes because in January when I was 
refusing them access into the account Mr van Wyk and Ms Phiri they 
went – they opened a case against me that I illegally took Ms Phiri out 
20 
of the company and by then Ms Phiri resigned because there is a story 
before then in the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr we went on – on – I was following 
a certain issue but … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 23 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair I would just like to follow up 
just so we keep faithful to her chronology and I would just like to get 
clarification in relation to what you have just said in your testimony.  As 
I understand your answers to the Chair you started to become 
concerned about the hijacking of your company around June/July 2015.  
Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you move to your engagements with 
Mr Ngwenya.  Now those are in June 2016. 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  It is important that we just look at that 
time frame because between June 2015 and June 2016 you do – as I 
have it from your affidavit - also take other steps to deny Mr van Wyk 
access … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To the bank account. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will come to that but just so we have it in 
time.  As I understand your affidavit – that is around December 2015.  
Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So could we just go in sequence then because 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 24 of 172 
 
the issues that the DC – the Chair is probing relate to when you first 
realised that this company has been hijacked and we have your 
evidence to be June/July 2015 but Ms Tlatsana there are still further 
payments that come out of the account at that time.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you have not taken steps to stop that 
conduct in your business yet have you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So if we could then just continue with 
the payments.  So we contract them chronologically and then I would 
10 
like to get us to the point where as I understand your evidence you do 
deny access to the account. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let – if we – let us if we may go back to 
page 18 – 1-8 – of your affidavit.  That is in EXHIBIT DD8A because the 
next amount as I have it - unfortunately you do not attach this to a date 
– this particular amount but Chair there will be evidence that will clarify 
for us when this amount goes out and that is the amount referred to at 
paragraph 4.39.  Tell us what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that – that was the amount I also wanted to ask 
20 
about … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it seems to be hanging. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is hanging Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 25 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is actually related to the evidence of 
Ms Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She will go into detail … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About when those – that – that reference to 
Asset Management and Financial Services CC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is her CC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we will get that clarity.  It is not available 
here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But if we can have your evidence on it 
Ms Tlatsana.  What payment and in - what amount was made and to 
whom at paragraph 4.39? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The amount is nine million that has 
been made to Asset Management and Financial Services. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and Chair just because it may be 
useful for the record those payments occurred to Asset Management 
20 
and Financial Services.  This is evidence to come.  Just so that it is 
contained here.  On 1 May 2015, 7 May 2015 and 6 September - sorry – 
those are the incorrect ones.  Those are on the slips. 
Let me just get it right.  8 May 2015, 11 May 2015 and 
16 September 2015 … 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 26 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But those total - as I have it from your affidavit 
Ms Tlatsana - nine million.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then let us move to the next payment out.  I 
have that at the bottom of page 18 at paragraph 4.43.  What was that 
amount and when was it paid? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  On 21 September 2015 500 000 was 
paid to management consulting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did – did you understand management 
10 
consulting to be? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I did not Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we then move to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – but did you raise any issues about this 
money with either the accountant or Mr van Wyk? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair.  There was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had – had you reached a point where you had 
decided you were not going to be asking any questions? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because I was asking – I 
was talking too much.  I was asking lots of questions too much … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  According to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had reached a point where you had decided 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 27 of 172 
 
not to ask anything? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.  I just decided to stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And for the chronology’s purposes by this stage 
you had received that R500 000 payment.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we then go over to page 19 and 
if you could it up at paragraph 4.44.  That is the next payment out of 
10 
the account - as I have it from your affidavit.  When was that payment 
made, in what amount and to whom? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  R5 million was made to Neo Solutions 
on 11 November 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what inquiries did you make about that – if 
any? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I inquired and it was said that it is for 
the cameras. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So more cameras? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes.  Cameras were – were supposed 
20 
to be 14.9 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  14.9 million was the total amount that was 
going to be paid for cameras.  Is that what you were told? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that in regard to the five million at 4.44? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 28 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is about that?  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But – but the total – as I understand the 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is this payment of five million to Neo 
Solutions for which the explanation of security cameras is given. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have had a previous explanation of another 
five million to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there will be a subsequent one of 4.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that as I understand it is why Ms Tlatsana 
says the total being paid for security cameras was 14.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the five plus the five plus the 4.9. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understand it then Ms Tlatsana 14.9 in 
total over this period was going to go for security cameras? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who gave you that information? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 29 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr van Wyk Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am going to ask you at the conclusion of this 
money flow in and out about any documentary records related to these 
payments.  So just bear that in mind.  I would like to finish them and 
then we will go back to that question but at page 19 paragraph 4.46 you 
indicated what else happened on that day of 11 November in relation to 
payments.  What was that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA: 
 
On 
the 
same 
day 
of 
– 
of 
11 November 2015 Mr Kalisilira attempt – attempted to transfer R5 
million into Neo Solutions and the bank reversed that transaction. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did they do so? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because the bank needed to confirm 
the correctness of – of this transaction and they were trying to get hold 
of me.  They did not find me on line and they did not find Ms Phiri to 
confirm this transaction and then they reversed it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How – how did they try to find you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  By calling me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did they make contact with you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes.  They tried to get hold of me.  
They did not find me – get me on line. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry.  On line you mean on the call? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  On the call yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So did you go back to them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, I did not go back to them.  You 
cannot call – you cannot go through if you call the bank on the – on 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 30 of 172 
 
that dial line.  You cannot. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But how did you know they were trying to get 
hold of you then? 
MS BABADI SYBL TLATSANA:  After – they called me the following 
day.  They told me that we tried to contact you.  We did not find you on 
line and then we called Ms Phiri … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And she too – she was not on line.  
Though at a later stage they said they managed to get hold of her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did she say to them? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ms Phiri told the bank that she does 
not know anything about Koreneka.  She does not know anything about 
five million.  She does not even have that amount of money in his 
account.  She is just a mere teacher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what the bank reported to you as having been 
said by her to them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.  That is what the bank told 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I – can I just get this right.  On 
20 
11 November there is a first payment of five million that successfully 
goes out of the account to Neo Solutions.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you get an SMS notification of that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes I did Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 31 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you make inquiries about that payment on 
that day? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I did not make inquiries because 
Mr van Wyk has already mentioned that there is going to be money 
amounting to this for the purpose of security cameras. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ah.  So I did not understand that previously.  
He had told you that before this 11 November payment? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you did not have reason then to query.  It 
was in your mind part of the security camera payments? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no.  Not – not before - not before 
wait.  Not before.  After this transaction went … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then said Babadi this money is for 
the security cameras and there is going to be another amount that is 
going to go out from the company because we need to install the 
security cameras.  They are not there in the – in the airport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just clarify then does he phone you to 
tell you this or do you follow up with him after you get the SMS 
notification of the first five million? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I called him after – after this first five 
million has gone out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and that is what he said? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He said it is for security cameras and there is 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 32 of 172 
 
going to be a second payment as well? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Then tell us what happens with the bank 
on that day? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The bank reversed the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what reason were you given for that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because they did not find anyone of 
us from – on the phone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did they tell you that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The very same day. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because previously you said it was the next 
day that they contacted you.  I am trying to get this clear as to what 
was happening on the 11 t h and what was happening on the 12 t h. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Can I – can I go back to my – my 
statement … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And refresh my mind?  Yes, yes Chair.  
On four point – it says: 
“The following day a payment of 4.9 …” 
Yes.  If I remember well I think they told me the following day because 
20 
that day they did not find – find me.  I was – I was in Brits … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Huh-uh. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And the network there – I remember if 
I refresh my memory right - the network was not good that day and I 
was in Mafikeng the following day.  I arrived late that very day.  Yes 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 33 of 172 
 
Chair on 12 November that is when now the bank informed me that they 
tried to call me and that is when they made another transaction of 4.9 
million on the 12 t h. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What reason were you given by the bank for 
them trying to contact you on the 11 t h? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  They wanted confirmation of these 
transactions? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the second five million or both – well the 
first transaction and the attempted second transaction? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA: 
 
Of 
the 
first – 
of 
the 
second 
10 
transaction for the – for the same day because it – it was going to 
mean that on that day 10 million was going to go … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Out, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why is 10 million a worry and 4.9 million 
the next day was not a worry for – for the bank? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I gave the bank an explanation 
according to Mr van Wyk that Mr van Wyk says there has to be security 
cameras at the airport and now those monies are going to be paid into 
Neo Solutions.  That amount is going to be 14 – it was supposed to be 
20 
15 million and then they made 14.9 million for the cameras. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the banks concern – if I understand your 
testimony – is that on the 11 t h five million went out and then a further 
five million was attempted to be taken out of the account.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 34 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The following day – 12 November – the bank 
made contact with you.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Wait.  Can I go through this? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes the – the bank called me the 
following day and I confirmed that it is okay that the 4.9 can – can be 
paid out Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is because of your confirmation that they 
then did not take issue with the 4.9 going out on 12 November.  
Correct? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand your testimony you gave 
them the explanation that Mr van Wyk had given you that it related to 
more security cameras? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana I said I would come to 
the question about documentary proof for any of these transactions.  In 
this period – remember the first transaction goes out just after your 
receipt of the 8.5 million on 6 May.  You already start having money go 
out of your account on 7 May and we have now progressed to 
20 
12 November in your testimony. 
What inquiries did you make about invoices - proof of any of 
these dealings with your business at this time? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I was not allowed to ask and I 
needed to hold meetings with them so that I can see the report and the 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 35 of 172 
 
invoices and they were just not ready – they were just reluctant to give 
me that information of – of the invoices for every transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you realise that this was not a normal way of 
running a business? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what stage did you realise this? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  After I spoke to my – to my spiritual 
father and he said record these people because these people I think 
their intention is just to put you into trouble … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  With all these monies.  Record 
everything that they are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That is when now I began to record 
every trans - every conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you not decide look this is my company - this 
is my close corporation.  It has been hijacked by other people who were 
not there when I came up with this whole idea and they are doing all 
20 
kinds of things that I do not understand.  I do not know what is 
happening at the airport.  I just hear what I am told. 
When I ask questions I am told to relax not to ask questions.  
I must stop them continuing to be involved in my business.  Why did 
you not take that attitude? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 36 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair that was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words why did you not decide I am not going 
to have any further dealings with Mr van Wyk?  He is not good for my 
company.  I am not going to have any further dealings with 
Mr Kalisilira.  He is not good for my business.  They are now in charge 
of this business.  I am – I am nothing in this business anymore. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair that was – that was my concern 
and my torture that I do not know what is going on and nobody is 
saying anything for me and what is it that I – Chair I think I was - I was 
in a confused state. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Apart from seeking advice from your spiritual advisor 
did you not think of seeing a lawyer or seeing some other organisations 
that maybe support or help business people particularly women – you 
know – business people? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair it did not come into my mind not 
– not by then.  You know – I did not know who to talk to.  I was just – I 
was frustrated Chair and you can imagine now you are holding – I am 
holding this kind of business and then the next thing now I am jumping 
– you know – I was – I was not at - I do not know what to say to that 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have got to look at all angles of the story. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I will ask you the question.  What would you say if 
somebody said the reason why you might – you continue to have 
dealings with them – with Mr van Wyk and Mr Kalisilira – is that you 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 37 of 172 
 
continued to stand a chance of getting money as well and big money?  
You had already got about R500 000 therefore that is what made you to 
accept this bullying that you are talking about from Mr van Wyk and 
that it is what made you tolerate all these things that you did not like 
being done in your company. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I was relaxed with that by then 
because forward – because I wanted to – my – my stronghold by then 
was let Mr van Wyk be telling me because this thing I can see that it is 
not going okay.  Let him be saying something that will surely 
incriminate him that now he is – he is doing these monies because I 
10 
was just going alone with this trying to trap him because I did not want 
it to be hard on him to indicate that I am not happy. 
I was just going with him being underground just for me to 
end it up getting information that what is he trying to do with all these 
monies because if I ask of the invoices I am not been given invoices.  I 
am not been given any information and who would I talk to.  It never 
came into my mind that I should maybe contact the lawyer.  I was just 
foolish by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question is what would you say if 
somebody said you continued to tolerate what was happening because 
20 
you knew that you stood a chance of making some money in the 
process. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair it would not – it would not be 
– it would not be okay because that was not the idea.  The idea was 
this is the contract that I have gotten and let me just leave Mr van Wyk.  
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 38 of 172 
 
Let them do this.  Let them put these cameras and whatever and then 
after all these works are done and then I will – I will have access into 
my company because – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no finish what you want to say. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, because these are the things that 
he was saying that they have to be put into the airport.  Let them just 
do all those things and then after that I have got to go my way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The R500 000 that had been paid into your other 
company’s account did you understand that to be for all intents – 
intents and purposes yours or was your understanding that from that 
10 
amount you would still have to maybe pay staff?  Let me ask the 
question differently.  By June/July your – your staff who were working 
at the airport had been working from May.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was paying them?  Did you know what they were 
paid, how much they were paid, who was paying them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr Kalisilira was the one who was 
doing the salaries Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know how much each one was paid per month 
or per week or whatever the arrangement was? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because the – the staff 
signed the – the contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The contracts? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Kalisilira was the one who was paying them? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 39 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So the amount of R500 000 that was paid into 
your account was not going to be involved in any expenses of the 
company – of the close corporation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  According to Mr van Wyk he said it is 
– that is part portion of my – my share. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your dividends? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  My dividends, thank you sir.  Thank 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay; and then let me also ask you this.  Who 
10 
was the owner of the airport building in the two airports as far as you 
know – as far as you knew at the time your business started – when 
you started? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The airports belongs to – to the North 
West Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the North West Government? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And for – in terms of the arrangement as you 
understood it were you supposed to pay any rent for working there or 
not or what was the position? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no I was not working  
CHAIRPERSON:  For your company.  Where your staff working there 
and so on? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no the – the staff – the ground 
handling staff were paid by Koreneka but they were the SA Express 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 40 of 172 
 
staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were SA Express staff? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were not Koreneka staff? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No they were – they were put in 
uniform of SA Express.  They were SA Express staff but now their – 
their salaries were coming from Koreneka because according to – to 
this agreement all their monies they were going to be paid back into 
Koreneka.  SA Express was going to pay back for the money that they 
have – for the salaries of the ground handling staff only. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now let me try and understand that.  Koreneka had 
employed staff who were working at the airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of it’s ground handling agreement with SA 
Express. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those employees of Koroneka they wore SA Express 
uniforms, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they were not SA Express employees? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No they were not SA Express employees in 
terms of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes and they were paid – their salaries were paid 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 41 of 172 
 
by Koroneka? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why were they not wearing a Koroneka uniform? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    The explanation was, they are doing 
the SA Express work of ground handling. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Thank you Chair.  Just for clarification 
purposes in relation to this latest debate, it does appear that this 
aspect was governed by the Koroneka agreement, Chair, it’s an aspect 
that comes up – you’ll find it at page 96 and what  it seems to envisage 
10 
there, albeit – let’s be clear on Ms Tlatsana’s evidence at this stage 
she still hasn’t seen the agreement but at least this aspect of it, what 
she was told seems to be consistent.  If we go to page 96 of DD8 (A), 
Chair you’ll see there, there’s a heading clause 12, Personnel and what 
it seems to envisage there, the handling company, when it’s referred to 
here as a reference to Koroneka and when there’s a reference to the 
carrier, that’s a reference to South African Express.  12.1 seems to say 
that the handling company shall recruit suitable personnel responsible 
for the provision of services which shall consist of three customer 
service agents and three general workers, then 12.2 says, 
20 
 
“The abovementioned personnel shall, with the assistance of 
 
the carrier, so that’s SA Express, receive ground handing  
 
training to enable them to fully discharge their functions and 
 
then over the page they even deal with uniform which is 12.3, 
 
the carrier, that’s SA Express, shall provide the personnel 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 42 of 172 
 
 
with 
uniform 
which 
shall 
be 
issued 
once 
a 
year 
in 
 
accordance with the SA Express uniform policy”. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So that part seems at least to be consistent 
with the text of the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes it’s just strange that employees employed by 
one company should wear the uniform of another company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I mean if you go there and you have a problem with 
that employee you think…(intervention). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You would go to South African Express, 
indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then they tell you that person is not our 
employee.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed, well in due course we may be able to 
probe that with Mr van Wyk, indeed.    
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Ms Tlatsana if we could then go back to page 
20, of your affidavit in DD8 (A), you’ve actually covered already in your 
evidence, paragraph 4.49 and 4.50 o that page, where I would like to 
20 
pick it up is at paragraph 4.51.  Now what I want to make clear before 
asking the question, is as I understand this paragraph, this is not 
information you had at the time of the payments to Neo Solutions, is 
that right? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 43 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Please tell us what you subsequently were 
able to establish about the payments to Neo Solutions. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes I established that the money that 
was sent to Neo Solutions, Mr van Wyk got R300 000 cash payment on 
the 4 t h of January 2016 and then 4million was paid to Batsomi 
Investment Holdings on the 11 t h of December 2015 and then 3million 
was paid to Batsomi Investment on the 22 n d of December 2015, 
1.4million was paid to Batsomi Investment on the 10 t h of March 2016 
and 1.2million was a payment to Batsomi Investment Holding on the 
29 t h of March 2016. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did Koroneka have any dealings with Batsomi 
Investments?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And how do you know that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    That’s now when I have appointed 
the investigating teams to assist me to trace where did all this monies 
went to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And what did they establish about any links 
between Mr van Wyk and Batsomi investments, if you want a record for 
that it’s at paragraph 4.52 at page 21.   
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes, what we established is that 
Batsomi Investment is a company that is registered on the 11 t h of 
November 2014 and the director for the company it’s Sipho Via-Phiri 
who is Mrs Phiri’s son and who is Mr Brian van Wyk’s life partner. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can I just ask Ms Tlatsana, I accept that you 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 44 of 172 
 
only came to this information later right but what I understand you were 
told at the time of the Neo Solutions payments was that it was for 
security cameras. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know what the business is of Batsomi 
Investments? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No, no, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Don’t know but the total amount of 9.9million 
that went – well of the 14.9million that was for security cameras, as I 
understand your evidence 9.9million went to Neo Solutions, is that 
10 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If we total up and Chair I have done this in 
advance of today, because my mental arithmetic would not serve me 
well, if we calculate and add up all those amounts at paragraph 4.51 of 
your affidavit they total the full 9.9million don’t they? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      And as I understand your investigation you 
established that went out of Neo Solutions to another company called 
Batsomi Investments. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So if Neo Solutions was a legitimate company 
providing security cameras they would then have received no 
remuneration whatsoever for providing the security cameras, is that 
correct? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 45 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Come again with your question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Okay Neo Solutions, according to Mr van 
Wyk got 9.9million to put security cameras at the airports, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       But 9.9million was paid out from Neo 
Solutions’ account, according to your investigations, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So it seems – I’m putting it to  you for your 
comment in case your investigations went there at all, if 9.9million 
comes in and 9.9million goes out then Neo Solutions is left with no 
10 
money for the security cameras that they were allegedly putting up at 
the airports correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Did we – earlier on, I think in your statement you did 
mention who owned Neo Solutions, is that right?    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Yes indeed, she does do that…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Mr Vivien Natasan.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Correct Chair and he will be giving evidence in 
the course of next week to the Commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes was he the only director there, do we know, 
just for interest sake? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.      
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Let us then move, Ms Tlatsana to December 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 46 of 172 
 
2015 because in December 2015 you took steps in relation to your bank 
account, can you tell us what those were? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    I went to the bank and stopped the 
access – Mr Calasiera(?)to have access into the account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you do that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Because I could – wait, wait, where is 
it here.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Ms Tlatsana I’ve actually not found that 
detail in this affidavit, I ask you of it on the basis of what you’ve told 
the Commission in your previous interactions with them that you took 
10 
steps in December and that is also referenced in your recording in early 
January 2016 that you’ve provided to the Commission but please 
recount for us to the best of your recollection whether you – what you 
did in relation to 2015, if at all, in relation to your bank account? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    What I remember with the bank 
account I stopped the access of Mr Calasiera into the bank account 
because I went to the bank and changed the code and I put my phone 
for the OTP and…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    This was now in December 2015, okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You seem – I just want to be clear about your 
evidence are you clear that, that happened in December 2015 or are 
you not certain? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Certain. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Let me just assist to locate you in tie in 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 47 of 172 
 
terms of your testimony thus far, you have your discussion with your 
spiritual leader in June/July 2015, that’s when your suspicions about 
your company being hijacked first really arise, you then see a series of 
payments for the remainder of 2015 coming out of the account, the last 
of those that we looked at was on the 12 t h of November 2015 and then 
just to assist you in time, your recording that you provided to the 
Commission of you conversation in the Spur with Mr van Wyk I on the 
20 t h of January 2016.  So can I then have your best recollection of 
when you denied Mr Calasiera access to the bank account, was it 
before the Spur conversation? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes it was before the Spur 
conversation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So towards the end of 2015 then?    
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    I should think – or beginning of 
2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Fine somewhere there?   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Ja somewhere there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       But before the Spur conversation and after 
the last payment that you have recorded in your affidavit going out 
which is the 12 t h of November 2015, can we work with that timeframe? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Come again with your question Ms 
Kate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I’m trying to establish when you denied Mr 
Kalisilira access to the bank account and your affidavit has given us a 
date to work with, which is the 12 t h of November 2015 is when the last 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 48 of 172 
 
payment that you reference in your affidavit went out to Neo Solutions, 
correct?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct that’s the last payment that 
went out, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And you have a Spur conversation with Mr 
van Wyk which we’re going to listen to the recordings of shortly on the 
20 t h of January 2016. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And I’m asking whether you denied Mr 
Kalisilira access to your bank account between those two dates, 
10 
between 12 November 2015 and 20 January 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct yes, correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And you – why did you do that, why did you 
deny him access? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Because I came to realise that money 
is going out without any invoice, without my knowing, nobody is 
contacting me, so let me just stop this business with him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Could we then move to early 2016 in the 
lead-up 
to 
the 
recording 
that 
we’re 
going 
to 
listen 
to 
shortly…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Before that, I may have missed something, I just 
want to make sure I get it.  Before you decided to go to the bank and 
take the steps necessary to deny Mr Kalisilira access to your 
company’s account, had you spoken to Mr van Wyk about what was 
going on or did you speak to him after? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 49 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    About denying Mr Kalisilira access 
CHAIRPERSON:    My impression from your evidence is that at a 
certain stage, maybe it was in December 2015 at a certain stage you 
concluded that you had, had enough of payment that – being made from 
your Close Corporation’s account without knowing – without having 
invoices, without knowing what was going on, that’s why you decided to 
deny Mr Kalisilira access, is that right am I right to understand your 
evidence along those lines? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja my question is (indistinct) once you had come to 
10 
this conclusion that you were going to take steps to put a stop to this 
thing, did you speak to Mr van Wyk before denying Mr Kalisilira access 
to the account of the company? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You didn’t speak to him before? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you didn’t speak to Mr Kalisilira himself before 
doing it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you only speak to them after or did you just take 
20 
action and left it to them to contact you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    I took action and they realised when 
they tried to access that they had been denied access. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and then they then contacted you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 50 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s talk about Mr van Wyk, how soon after you had 
denied Mr Kalisilira access did he speak to you, a week, a month, a day 
or two, or you are not sure – soon thereafter?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   It was on the 31 s t of December.    
CHAIRPERSON:    When he spoke to you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    When I denied him access. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh when you denied the accountant access. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh the accountant was the only one who had 
access, Mr van Wyk did not have access did he? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No Chair it was the accountant. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay and you spoke to Mr van Wyk soon 
thereafter, a few days thereafter? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes I think it was on the 3 r d of January 
Mr van Wyk called me to tell me that Mr Kalisilira is telling him that 
he’s trying to access…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Access the account. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Access the account and it’s refusing. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja was he of the two, was Mr van Wyk the first one 
to contact you about this? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    I don’t remember but…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    But Kalisilira also…(intervention). 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Both of them – it was just series of 
incoming calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay, thank you. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 51 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair, and then we move to the 
20 t h of January 2016 when you had a conversation – a meeting, as I 
understand your affidavit with Mr van Wyk, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Please tell us how that meeting was 
arranged…(intervention).      
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe also let me also clarify this before, up to now, 
I haven’t heard from you any evidence relating to what your two co-
members of the Close Corporation may have been doing were they not 
involved in anything as far as you were – you knew at that stage? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes they were not involved Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They were not involved? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja they signed and after that you never had any 
interactions with them in any serious way in 2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Mr Thabeng resigned sometime in 
May or beginning of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:    2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh he wasn’t there for a long time. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   No he wasn’t there for a long time, 
immediately after the first payment that enters and then he resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:    He resigned. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And did he speak to you before resigning to say he 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 52 of 172 
 
was resigning because of A, B, C, D? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes he was asking about all this 
monies that are going…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    In and out. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    In and out and I explained to him 
that Mr van Wyk says that they are going to be for the repairation of the 
airport, refurbishment of the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   And then he just resigned says he’s 
no longer interested. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    He resigned. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Mrs Phiri stayed on? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Mrs Phiri stayed on – Mrs Phiri 
resigned on the 18 t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Of 2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   That time, that was the time when the 
Department of Finance wanted to make a payment to Koroneka and now 
20 
we were to complete the documents with the Department of Finance 
and now she – yes that was the time when she resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:    How much was that amount again, was it 20million 
rand? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 53 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay she resigned as the money was about to come 
in. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Chair because she didn’t meet the 
requirements of being a member yes because she didn’t disclose that 
she 
is 
working 
and in 
the 
Department of 
Finance tender – 
Treasury…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Working for government. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair and there was a circular 
that was in the Department of Finance that anybody that is working for 
government it’s either you work or…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    You don’t do business with government. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes because if you do that there are 
serious consequences that will be taken against those who did not 
disclose. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh so did she resign because that problem arose? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes because now from Treasury they 
were saying that – by the way you should know that if now she will be 
here in this company working, now it means that her pensions is going 
to be taken away from her and – yes Chair and I explained this to her 
she says, she cannot afford to lose her life pensions for this business. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    But the two never gave you any trouble, Mr Thabeng 
and Mrs Phiri during their time in the Close Corporation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    They were not doing anything Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They are not doing anything, their names are just 
there. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 54 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Ja they were just there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Thank you Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Tlatsana, Ms Phiri litigated against you in 
relation to her removal as a member did she not? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    She did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What did she say? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    She said I removed her illegally from 
the company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And what happened with that litigation?   
10 
MS 
BABADI 
SYBIL 
TLATSANA: 
 
 
 
With 
the 
outcomes 
of 
that…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, we went to Court and the 
outcomes were, I falsely removed her from the company and she should 
be – she should come back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did she come back? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No not yet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       When did you receive the outcome of that 
case? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Sometime in 2016, I don’t remember 
when but it’s sometime in 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      So Ms Phiri’s version of the facts that you’ve 
just relayed to the Chair indicate that she does not accept that she 
voluntarily resigned from the Close Corporation, correct? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 55 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    That’s what she said, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Subsequent to the resignation though was the 
department satisfied that they could pay the 20million to Koroneka?    
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes the money was paid in to 
Koroneka. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And was it the department who indicated to 
you they would not pay it as long as Ms Phiri was a member of the 
Close Corporation?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    That is the information that I got 
from the Treasury Department. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And did you relay that information to Ms 
Phiri?   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And at what stage then, did you learn that 
she was employed by the Department of Education as a teacher? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    That was the time now, that I 
realised that she’s been with the Department of Education. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Before that time you didn’t know what her normal 
job was? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   No Chair, it didn’t bother me to ask. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:       Yes, by the way when you were told by Mr Phiri – 
Sorry Mr van Wyk about – when Mr van Wyk told you her name as one 
of the people that you should include in your Close Corporation, did 
you say that you knew her, you knew Mrs Phiri before this? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    I’ve never – by then I’d never 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 56 of 172 
 
seen…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:       Oh you didn’t know her before that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    I’ve never known her before. 
CHAIRPERSON:       And what about Mr Thabeng? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Mr Thabeng I just knew him as SABC 
employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Thank you Chair, with your leave I’d then like 
to move to the recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes that’s fine. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Chair what…(intervention).    
CHAIRPERSON:   I have in mind that we could take the tea break at 11.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       That should be fine, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     What we’re going to do for this purpose 
Chair, it’s my proposal that we adopt the following approach.  The 
recording is quite a long recording in total about an hour and a half, 
what the Commission has done is extracted excerpts of it which are the 
ones which are pertinent for today’s evidence.  The quality is not ideal 
but we’re hoping that when we play it, we will be able, with Ms 
20 
Tlatsana’s assistance to determine what is being said.  It’s her 
recording, she was in the conversation so we will ask for her assistance 
on that.  The idea is to play portions and then have her translate in a 
sense or tell us what is being said.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay that’s fine. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 57 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Chair there’s a point in that interaction 
where it’s Ms Tlatsana’s evidence that Mr van Wyk was writing down on 
a piece of paper certain handwritten notes, we’ve already seen those 
notes, it was the first annexure to Mr Ngwenya’s affidavit but what 
we’ve done for today’s purpose is we have created a version of that, 
that can be projected on the screens so that we can follow what is 
going on as Ms Tlatsana will endeavour in her evidence to explain to us 
what various things on that page mean but for those of us who have the 
benefit of the bundles in front of us, we’ve also reproduced them.  So 
Chair if we all go to DD8 (B) and we turn right at the back there to page 
10 
586. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Ms Tlatsana do you have that yet, it’s 586 it 
should be right towards the back. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Do you recognise that page? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Yes Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What is it…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry maybe before we get there, Ms Tlatsana, 
you did say that you were advised by your spiritual advisor to record 
20 
you said, these people. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you understand that to mean you must record 
conversations that you had with them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.   
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 58 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:       Yes and did you go along with this suggestion? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:       And did you then decided that you were going to 
do that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to that end what did you decide to do to prepared 
yourself to start doing that, did you buy anything to use to record 
them?      
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes the other recordings were on the 
phone because when they were calling me, giving me instructions and 
10 
then the other one, the one (indistinct) it’s a device – it’s a recording 
device. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is it something you had anyway, was it something on 
the phone?   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No, no it’s a recording device -  it’s 
a recording device on it’s own…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Did you buy is specially? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Oh for this purpose? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:       Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      And- I’ll ask you about that in a moment, 
let’s look at page 586 if we may, that’s in Exhibit DD8 (B), you 
indicated that you recognised this page, what is it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Chair this is the page where Mr van 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 59 of 172 
 
Wyk was writing – was taking notes of what is to happen, what is 
supposed to happen. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And if you go over the page to page 587, I 
just want to explain, Chair, what we’ve done, in order to try and make it 
a bit clearer on the screen, we’ve broken that page into two parts Ms 
Tlatsana you’ll see at 587 there’s a section of that page which has 
been cut out and then if you go to 588 there’s the sort of last third of 
the page if you hold it in the landscape position, do you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Yes Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So what I’m going to suggest is that we 
10 
move between those two in the course of your evidence and you can 
indicate to us where we should be looking on the page, for the 
purposes of the evidence. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Okay Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     With your leave Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you – or maybe she should just tell us if she’s 
able to because understand at – that this was in a meeting, when that 
meeting was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes when did you meet with Mr van Wyk, 
when he wrote this down? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   It was on the 20 t h of January 2016.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And where did you meet? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  We met at Spur restaurant.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      And you’ve mentioned a recording device 
that you purchased, did you purchase it before this meeting or prior to 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 60 of 172 
 
that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Yes I purchased it specially for this 
meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what did you do with it, when you were 
meeting with Mr van Wyk? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   It was inside my handbag.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Had you tested it before? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Were you satisfied that if it was in the 
handbag it could still record? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And why for this meeting in particular did 
you purchase the device? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Mr van Wyk was desperate for the 
money, he wanted access into the money, now since now he was saying 
that he’s coming to meet me in Mafikeng and tell me the reasons why 
he is so desperate, then let me record this conversation so that 
tomorrow he doesn’t say that I’ve said something else. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And what money was he desperate about? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The last 20million that entered.    
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So by the 20 t h of January had that 20million 
been received by Koroneka? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And as I have your testimony earlier that’s a 
payment directly from the North West Government, is that correct? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 61 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       And was it received by Koroneka in December 
2015? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If we could then start with the first recording 
we will play it, Ms Tlatsana if you’ll assist us with what is being said 
and if at any point in that recording it’s necessary to go to the page 
which is handwritten you’ll let us know, thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at the meeting was it just the two of you, 
yourself and Mr van Wyk or was there somebody else as well. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    No it was the two of us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay alright. I’m sorry what is the device called 
that you purchased for purposes of recording? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    It’s a recording machine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh there’s no particular – or you don’t remember? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I don’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Okay, alright, that’s fine.  Is she able to hear 
anything? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Chair I think we’re going to have to turn it 
actually softer because I think the amplification is what’s distorting it, 
Chair it may make sense to adjourn so that we can try and get this right 
if we may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay let’s adjourn for the tea break now and we’ll 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 62 of 172 
 
resume at five to eleven. We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNED 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Extended break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have encountered some difficulties when 
we seek to play the recording on all of the speakers in the room.  There 
is a level of distortion that is making it difficult for Ms Tlatsana clearly 
to hear the recording.  It is therefore our proposal that for the purposes 
of her evidence today what we do is we enable Ms Tslatsana to listen to 
10 
the recordings through earphones played from a laptop and she will 
indicate to our commission investigator who is with her when she would 
like to pause and stop the recording and then she will tell us through 
her testimony what she hears on the recording. Chair these recordings 
are in the possession of the commission and they can be made 
available to any person who wishes to listen to them after this evidence 
is given and they will then be in a position to the extent that they want 
to dispute any aspect of them to do so.  So it is our proposal just to 
make today’s evidence proceed that we do it on that basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And anyone other than Ms Tlatsana is able to hear 
20 
when they listen to the recording, the conversation? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are certainly able to hear parts of the 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It takes place in a restaurant. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 63 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so there is some background disturbance 
at points. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There are however parts of the conversation 
that are very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In English. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Parts of the conversation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That are in other languages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And parts that are less clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But anyone listening to it will be able certainly 
clearly to make out parts of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay no that is fine.  Thank you we can do – we 
can proceed on that basis. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  My proposal Ms Tlatsana is 
20 
that we begin with the first excerpt of the recording which relates to as 
we have listened to it a reference to a R400 000,00 payment. So what I 
will ask Mr Madlala to do is to allow you to listen to it, when you want 
him to stop so that you can relay to us what is being said you can do so 
and then you can tell us what is being said in the conversation.  Is that 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 64 of 172 
 
fine? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just also – I just emphasize that when you tell me 
what you hear I want [indistinct] to hear what you are hearing in terms 
of both conversation – both of you who are talking at the meeting.  This 
is what he said, this is what I said. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next portion and so on and so on okay? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
[MS

MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It takes long because in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay first of all let me ask because you have got 
enough paper there to make notes. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell us what you have heard so far? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes it takes long because he is eating 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 65 of 172 
 
but what he was saying – what he started saying was –  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlastsana may I just interject there.  When 
you say he is that Mr Van Wyk? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you just for the record. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes.  He started by telling me that he 
was saying that David Kalisilira has to be payed R150 000,00 and for 
the reflector jackets that they have bought – reflector jackets for ANC 
104. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry for the? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Reflector – reflector jackets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or reflector jackets. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes reflector jackets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That they bought for ANC 104 and he 
was saying that he has got an invoice, that invoice is in his phone and 
he is going to forward it through to me and he was saying that he has 
forwarded it even though I have never seen it up to today.  And he also 
– Mr Van Wyk – because I was saying to him that I am not happy about 
the way you people are doing things because now how are we going to 
20 
account for all these monies hence now he said no, no I am going to 
send you the invoice to show you that definitely we have spent these 
monies and then he said the total amount of money that they have 
spent it is R400 000,00 that they have paid for the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  R400 000,00.  
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 66 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes R400 000,00 that they have paid 
for ANC 104 celebration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh what did you understand that to refer to ANC 104 
celebration? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes it was after – 2015 was after ANC 
was celebrating 104. 
CHAIRPERSON:  104 years/ 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so he said they had paid R400 000,00? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes the total amount they have spent 
10 
for the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They had spent? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On – they had spent in connection with the ANC 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  104 celebrations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  104 celebrations. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was he talking about money that had been taken 
out of the account of your closed corporation for that purpose? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He was – he was telling me to pay 
20 
back this money – to pay it back to him because this is the money that 
they have spent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who – who is they that he was referring to?  Who 
Iwas he talking about when he said they had spent? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He – they he means him and David 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 67 of 172 
 
Kalisilira. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was your understanding of why you should 
pay that to them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He was saying that I must refund … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Koreneke must refund them this 
R400 000,00 because this is the money that they have spent for doing 
the reflector jackets as well – ja because he said the money that he 
10 
spent is R400 000,00 this is what he says here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and what did you say to him in response to any of 
the things that you have just told me he said to you at that meeting? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He was giving me information.  Me I 
told him that I am concerned about all these transactions that every 
time you will be talking of transactions and there are no invoices and 
how are we going to account for all these monies, that is what I said to 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is when he said he would give you – he 
would forward you the invoice? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand that the invoice was going to be 
in respect of the R400 000,00? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 68 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  According to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask him any further questions about this 
R400 000,00 and why your closed corporation should pay for it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I did not ask about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not ask okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I wanted him to tell me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As much as possible. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  As much as possible because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without you asking too much? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I want – yes because it is the 
10 
confirmation of what him and David has been doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  May I just understand.  Is there more of that 
first recording that we need to listen to?  Is it going on? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so we can continue to play it.  Thank you. 
[MS 
TLATSANA 
IS 
LISTENING 
TO 
RECORDING 
THROUGH 
EARPHONES] 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are ready?  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair and he – he as well asked 
me if I am having a problem with the explanation that he is giving me 
regarding all these transactions of finances and I confirmed to him that 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 69 of 172 
 
yes I am having a problem.  And then I said but it is okay we will see 
this thing they will unfold because we are going for the elections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understand it that is the end of the first 
recording.  We will now move to the second – well let me be specific 
excerpt of the recording, the whole recording as I mentioned earlier is 
over the period of the whole meeting but we have selected excerpts 
that are relevant to today’s proceedings so we will move to the second 
one if we may?  And as I understand it this is one where you may want 
to refer to the handwritten notes that he was making in the course of 
10 
the meeting according to your evidence.  So if we could beam those up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh maybe before we do so and the note might refresh 
your memory but from what you hear what are the points that have 
emerged so far in your conversation at this meeting that are covered by 
the part that you have listened to? 
1.  He – did you say he complained about you denying the 
accountant access or that is not part of what is in the 
conversation so far? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No that is not part of this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. But you said he – he asked that your closed 
20 
corporation should refund him and the accountant the R400 000,00 that 
he said they had paid on the ANC 104 celebrations? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you say your response to that was what?  
Did you agree to refund them, did you not agree, did you comment, 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 70 of 172 
 
what did you say? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  My response was why are we busy 
paying all this?  Why all these transactions and how are we going to 
account for all these transactions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what did he say in that conversation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Is this we know – this is where we are 
going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is where we are going? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  But is it – is it therefore fair to say 
10 
this part of the conversation that you have just listened to really deals 
with the issue of the R400 000,00?  This part that you have listened to 
so far…

side of that word and below upgrade or upgade and the word that I 
cannot read there is 300 and then there is something written after that

20 
has got M that is written H and below that CF, yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair and then he said HOD and 
CFO they will be given money until the end of the contract.  They will 
receive some money until the end of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words for year one up to year five? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 89 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The YR1, YR2, YR3, YR4, YR5 which appear on the 
second column to the left that refers to year one, year two, year three, 
year four, year five? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that what is written on the – on the 
column on the extreme right on the diagram where it says H and then 
CF and then CHCF throughout and I think what is written in regard to 
year four and year five is just some punctuation mark to indicate same 
thing.  Is that right? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it represents that the head of the department and 
the CFO would be paid right throughout? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The five year period? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you look at the column under D – DOT it 
only – it is only written in respect of year one. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It means they would only get something for during 
20 
that – the first year only in that regard. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  In the first year Chair - he was 
referring that in the first year be once off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the - the DOT was a once off and number one in 
the province was also once off. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 90 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Once off, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Minister was also once off? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they would be paid something but on a once off 
basis? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not every year? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Continue. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana can I just get one point of 
clarification?  Previously you indicated that there were two Ministers 
who were being referred to.  That is when we were at the top of this 
section of the page but when you are describing now what was said in 
relation to year one I – I understood you to refer only to one Minister.  
Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I am referring in the year one … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  DOT is Minister of Transport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  M - M is Minister is Lynne Brown 
according to the voice here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, I understand sorry.  So DOT in that column 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 91 of 172 
 
next to YR1 … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is actually a reference to the Minister … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Of Transport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of Transport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Then the one signifies the number one 
in the province the Premier … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the M signifies Minister Lynne Brown who 
10 
was the Minister in the Department of Public Enterprises? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Minister of Transport that he is talking about 
there in the diagram is it – was it still Minister Dipuo Peters? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And he further said – he further said 
do you understand what I am – what I am saying?  Are you going along 
20 
with me and then I said I do not understand - I said I do not understand 
you.  You are talking about politicians.  You are talking about 
administrators as well who has to get money.  Is HOD and CFO not – 
are they not earning every month as well because this – the other three 
they are earning. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 92 of 172 
 
So you are adding them as well now for – for a period of a 
contract.  He said yes you should understand because otherwise if you 
not taking care of them you will never get your payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what he says in the conversation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And he further said that I should bear 
in mind that the CFO is – is the HODs person that is why it is important 
10 
for her as well to receive money every time when – when the payment 
is being made and then he jumped – he went to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before – before he jumped who was the CFO at the 
time that he was referring to? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He was referring to Ms Phatudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The CFO of the … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Department of Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  North West Department of Transport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And he jumped to the grant to tell me 
that these people are so critical - HOD and CFO – because they are 
critical in a sense that they can decide to add some money into that 
grant.  That is why now he was going to – can you go to the other 
slide? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 93 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Could we move to the other side?  This 
one Ms Tlatsana? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no, no, no.  The other one above 
this diagram.  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5-8-7? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no.  No, no.  I want – I want – I 
want this one here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what – on what page is it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we go back to 5-8-8 – this one and we go to 
10 
the top of it. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja 5-8 – ja 5-8-8 ja.  5-8-8. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Keep going.  That one - you want the top of it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  There by 31.  This one now … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja and then now he went to – to that 
diagram to say I should know that 31 million is paid and then 20 million 
is being paid which it makes 51 million and then he was saying that the 
20 
HOD and the CFO they are the very critical people to be taken care of 
because they can decide to increase the – the grant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The subsidy or grant? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 94 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then they can decide to increase 
the subsidy with 18 million to make … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that a 1-8 that we see below the 5-1? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there is a line to total.  Is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To make it 69. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now let us look at that.  In that diagram there 
10 
is 31 – there is the number 31.  You say what did he say about that 31 
and then there is 20 below that and then there is 51.  Can you just 
repeat what he said about those number? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.  31 million – 31 million is – 
is the one that was paid before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paid by the Department of Transport to your close 
corporation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana may I just interject there?  The 31 
20 
million who paid it to Koreneka? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  31 million was paid by SA Express. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Into – into Koreneka? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To Koreneka.  Correct Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 95 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and R20 000 – R20 million? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then – and 20 million was paid by 
the Department of Transport into Koreneka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that made a total of R51 million? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – and then there is something written below 
51.  Do you say that is 18? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes it is 18 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what did he say about that 18 million?

Mr Mahlakoleng and the CFO they are very critical people who they can 
even – they are going to increase the – the grant with this 18 million to 
make it 69 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was saying there was going to be an increase 
or was he saying they could make an increase? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He said there was going to be an 
increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says there was going to be an increase? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the subsidy and it would – they would add R18 
20 
million?

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and so that the total amount would – would not 
become 69? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 96 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be now for the whole of the year – 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  2015/2016 yes correct Chair.

response to this part of the conversation? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So now we are going to move to the 
third recording which I have it deals with further payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before we go to other – to another 
diagram.  The diagram that we have been dealing with now – up to now 
at page 5-8-8 yes that diagram.  The figures of 5-3 on the extreme left

Page 97 of 172 
 
the list that we are now compiling you will see in the top right there is – 
where province is written there are lines going out from the province.  
Then you have got something written there and then I can make out 
above it a five and a 10.  Will you also address that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Stop there.  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And he further said these critical 
10 
people they have added something on top and then he further said 
Lynne Brown has to get 10 million, Dipuo Peters has to get 10 million 
and then he said number one of the province needed 10 million but he 
has been paid five million and then he said E – in the diagram – in the 
diagram of – of the province … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes at page 5-8-8. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja.

CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the five … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes there is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is the five on top? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Above the one.  Is that right? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, above one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the right hand side.  So we have got the 
word province as I am following you Ms Tlatsana and then we have got 
lines coming out of the words province towards the top of the page and 
then we have a one on the first line.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does that signify? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  One signifies number one – he says 
number one of the province. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And above that is that where we find the 
number five? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am trying to locate where the two of you are. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair.  If we – if we go to the top … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is province. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Province. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you take the word province there are four 
lines coming out from the word province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  If you go to that top line there’s a one as I 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 99 of 172 
 
have the evidence, that is a reference according to Ms Tlatsana to 
number one in the Province, the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  And then above that is a five, is that correct 
Ms Tlatsana? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  And what does the five signify? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Five signifies that he has already 
received R5million. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then next to five there is ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ten he is still – he needed R10million 
but he’s been paid R5million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair and then next to one is E. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Bid E he was taken off the MEC. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And EC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  E represented who? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  MEC, he just wrote E of the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  E, oh okay it was not a reference to somebody’s 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 100 of 172 
 
name? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no Chair, it says MEC he’s been 
paid but he’s short of R700 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a reference in the diagram to R700 000? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No not in the diagram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that’s what he says in the conversation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you remember that when he was saying that he 
was pointing to this E. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So just repeat what he said about E, about the 
MEC. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  E is MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Who has been paid, he said MEC has 
been paid he is only running short of being R700 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said there was only R700 000 remaining to be 
paid to him. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, the next line is for HOD, he didn’t 
write but this is what he was saying because he was writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, so he said HOD. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 101 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, the third arrow says it’s HOD is 
being paid but he’s remaining to be paid another R500 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then he further mentioned that his 
priority for now is for the two ministers and then he said 18million is 
being added into this budget and the budget for now it’s 69million for 
the financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay but that still was going to, that still 
related to the 2015 allocation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana may I just clarify, as I have 
your evidence on the recording at this point he hasn’t said that either 
of the Ministers have received a payment yet has he? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  So the R18million that was to be added as I 
understand your testimony was to be used to pay the Ministers, 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  No apologies clarify for me. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair, his priority for now is for 
these two Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  So that now I should give David 
Kalisilira the access into the account with the money that was paid in 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 102 of 172 
 
December, so that he can go and pay them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the money that had been paid in December was 
R20million. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he so far has he indicated how much the two 
Ministers should get? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much was that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He mentioned earlier on that Minister 
Lynne Brown has to get R10million and Minister Dipuo Peters has to 
10 
get R10million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So that means that the whole amount 
that your close corporation got in December, the whole amount of 
R20million that you Close Corporation got in December was to be paid 
to the two ministers on the basis of R10million each? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and did you say at this part of the conversation 
did you say anything about this R20million being paid to the two 
Ministers? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  (Indistinct) Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Tlatsana. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair and the – he said I should 
know that the actual budget was increased to – the actual budget was 
increased to R60million. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 103 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the budget for the subsidy? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, he said but we should remember 
it has been increased to R60million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Now R9million is added for the 
purpose of the boys of the Number One of the Province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the voice? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Boys, boys, boys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Boys, for the boys? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes because he is not working, he 
10 
says he is not working alone, he has got people that he’s working with 
and that R9million has to go to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they must get something as well. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that is the number one of the province, the boys 
of number one of the province? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we will move to the next recording. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And he further said we should 
remember again that these people that have to be given there are other 
people, because the negotiations were made by my boss and the 
Chairman of the Board. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 104 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and did he say who his boss and the 
Chairperson of the Board were that he was talking about, was that still 
to come? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes to come Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Those are the extracts that we compiled for 
today Ms Tlatsana, but what I would like to ask you is whether you 
recall any other important aspects of that conversation that you regard 
as relevant and what might assist you there is to look at that diagram 
because the Chair as I have it still has a few questions in relation to it, 
10 
the one that the Chair raised is in that section that is reflected now, the 
end column on the right that we’ve extracted, you will see down the left 
hand side that is in EXHIBIT DD8B page 588, there are 53, 53, 53 
written with what appears to be little two’s beneath them, what was that 
section of the page signifying? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair, if I remember correctly, if I 
remember, this five and three first year, second year, third year, fourth 
year, fifth year, these are the amounts that Mr van Wyk was saying that 
the HOD and the CFO will get every year, it’s going to be part of their 
portions and he was saying that between five million and three million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it was not 53? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say he was saying that they would get for each of 
the years, year one up to year five, something between five million and 
three million. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 105 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair.  It’s him, if I remember 
well he was saying it’s him the CFO and the HOD, they will be sharing 
between five and three million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so there would be one amount and then they 
would have see who gets how much based on however between five 
million and three million, it’s not like each one would get either five or 
three and another one another three, it will be shared between the two 
of them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair, among the three of 
them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Who is the third?   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The third was Brian himself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That’s Mr van Wyk. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does the two beneath that signify? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The two he was saying that me every 
year I will be getting the two million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is yourself? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And but is that also in the recording or is that your – 
just your recollection of the conversation that he is not necessarily in 
the recording? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No he is in the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s in the recording? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 106 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because this whole thing is recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I think remaining on that page is just 
the bottom where it seems to say upgade or upgrade and then the 300 
split and what appears to be two two’s, can you explain to us what that 
is? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I don’t remember because here is 
airport, you see that he scratched the airport. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the word next to upgrade that seems to 
have been crossed out? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, it’s airport but I don’t remember 
what was he said. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay any greater memory about that bottom 
section? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  This 300 000 I should think he was 
referring it to this – to here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay if we could go to the other part of the 
page then. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you think the 300 referred to him? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  (Indistinct) Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the 300 on that diagram at the bottom of 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 107 of 172 
 
that diagram at page 588, what does it refer to? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  You know Chair I don’t remember, let 
me forget about this 300, but otherwise I know that it’s in 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t remember? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I don’t remember I didn’t quite, I 
am not ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the word upgade or upgrade do you remember 
what it was all about, what it meant? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair, he doesn’t stop talking 
10 
about the upgrade of the airport, he is just continuing upgrade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you say this word was meant to be upgrade? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was talking about the upgrading of the airport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes because this whole conversation 
it’s all about the airports, the business of the airports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay, thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then Ms Tlatsana we were going to the 
other section of the page which we have represented in EXHIBIT DD8B 
20 
at page 587, if we can look at that with you and you can talk us through 
what was being recorded there. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair, at the beginning there is a 
one – the next one is agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 108 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He started by saying that Koreneka 
has to enter into an agreement with himself for a period of five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there would be – there should be an agreement 
between Koreneka and Mr van Wyk? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then next to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say what that agreement was going to be for? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He said that we should enter into an 
agreement because of the money ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh of your working relationship, to formalise the role 
that he was playing, that is your understanding of what he was talking 
about. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  My understanding by then was Chair 
he has been in control of ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your close corporation. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Of my close corporation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Now him being in control now his 
normal in control so to make things easy so me and – Koreneka and 
20 
himself must now enter into an agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, but you – so your understanding was that 
he wanted an agreement with Koreneka so that he could continue to 
play a role in Koreneka’s business? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 109 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And two is way forward, in this way 
forward he was saying that there’s a box below way forward, he was 
saying one ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you talk about way forward on the 
extreme right or if you go horizontally on one that is five years what did 
that five years represent, what did he say about five years? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Koreneka should enter into an 
agreement with himself for a period of five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, alright. 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had moved to two on the way forward. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, on the way forward now we 
should start now doing things peacefully and be having every month we 
need to have monthly  meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I see there’s a box there and there’s an asterisk 
on the left hand side of the box and in between inside the box is written 
one month meeting, is that what he was talking about? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And then he was asking me what is 
happening about operations, about finances and financial taxes.  He 
was asking me now since now the access is being taken away from the 
auditor, Mr Kalisilira, now what is happening with that and what is 
happening with the finances and what is happening with the financial 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 110 of 172 
 
and taxes.  And then when we go down he said because Babadi David’s 
role, David Kalisilira’s role by the way ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr I don’t know whether you don’t want her 
to finish that line or is it more convenient to finish each line before 
...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that is preferable Chair, if before we get 
to David’s role Ms Tlatsana you’ve taken us in that line where there’s a 
box one month meeting, you’ve taken us across it, reading from left to 
right, you’ve told us he was worried about – well he wanted to discuss 
what was happening, finances, financial and tax, then there’s a 
10 
reference to the word audit there, I understood your testimony to be 
that’s a reference to the auditor, Mr Kalisilira, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then below that there seems to be MAAR in 
brackets and a 1 April, what did that signify? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I don’t know but I know that it’s – 
okay, I should, no let me not just presume, but financial taxes – okay 
financial taxes for the year end, financial years they begin 1 s t April and 
March at the time, so these were the roles of Kalisilira the taxes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Understood and then you moved down to the 
next asterisk which reads David role as I have it and you were going to 
describe that to us. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, he wanted to find out now 
because now David doesn’t have an access now what is going to be his 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 111 of 172 
 
role because ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh was David Mr Kalisilira? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He was saying what about his role 
because now Mr Kalisilira’s role has been to do payments, he’s an 
accountant to do financials, to do taxes, PAYE, returns, queries, 
Department/A and then he said 60 plus VAT these are the concerns 
about that, now what is going to happen because now this is what Mr 
Kalisilira has been doing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So these are the queries he was raising with you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA: Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go below that there seems to be 
– well just to right of that before we leave that line there seems to be 
something scratched out, do you recall what that was?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I don’t, I don’t. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That’s fine, if we then go down to three there 
seems to be the words bank statement what do you recall about that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, three he was demanding from the 
20 
bank statements that I should show him the bank statements. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did he give an explanation for why? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He needs to know the movement of 
the finances. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well didn’t he have access to that previously 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 112 of 172 
 
through Mr Kalisilira? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, through Mr Kalisilira. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in December as I have your testimony you 
cancelled Mr Kalisilira’s access to the bank account, so is Mr van Wyk 
talking about the period thereafter then, he wants access to? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, he needed the bank statement 
from the 1 s t of  January until the 20 t h. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why did he need that, did he tell you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I was just listening to that man, 
I was just listening to him because he was just everywhere but the 
10 
bottom line is demanding access, he was trying to come up with 
reasons and I was just listening to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: And below three seems to be a four, what – is 
that correct?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, it’s four, and then he was saying 
that after that by the way there has to be payments, he is saying 
payments for all these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Payments for? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  For number 5, you see across this 
20 
adjacent is number five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are the letters that appear next to what may be four, 
but is not so clear, but under three are those letters PMT? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair, PMT stands for payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay and then there is five and then there’s 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 113 of 172 
 
fifteen and then there’s 725 and there’s 75 and there is to company. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did that mean?  Do you recall? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I don’t recall, I don’t recall what that 
mean. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then you had moved us to five which I 
understood you to say are the things which need to be paid, is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I read those it seems to be facilities, 
10 
tractor, flowers, grass, gardening equipment, ablution upgrade and 
diesel.  Is that as you read them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes that’s what he was saying that 
these are the things that have to be – that has to be attended to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For what? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  For both airports. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This is the business of Koreneka we’re now 
talking about, is that right?    
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Laughing) 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We haven’t really been focusing on that yet in 
this conversation, but are we now back to what Koreneka is actually 
doing in terms of its agreement. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  In terms of the agreement now he is 
detailing to me now what is the agreement. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 114 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, I mean ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Koreneka involved in some farming of some sort, 
why did you need a tractor? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that for doing something on the grass in the 
airport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of watering and maybe cutting grass and so on. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The tractor is to cut grass in the 
runway. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And in other reasonable areas 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So it’s not out of the norm, okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you understand those to be things that 
Koreneka was involved in at the time?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He was saying that these are the 
things that have to be attended to, we have to buy flowers for the 
20 
airports, we need to buy grass for all the airports, (indistinct) 
implementation, ablution upgrade of the airports, diesel for the tractor, 
these are the things that he was talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These things Ms Tlatsana many of them went so 
outside, so much outside of what you understood you know ground 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 115 of 172 
 
handling to be about.  Did you understand all of these things to be very  
much part of ground handling which is what your business, Koreneka, 
was about in regard to the airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair these are the duties that the 
staff of Koreneka was doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but my question is different, my question is 
whether when you entered into or the agreement with S A Express the 
business that Koreneka was going to be involved in was described as 
ground handling is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So and when you explained to me yesterday if I recall 
correctly, and maybe it was another witness, ground handling, it was 
very much about processing passengers from when they come to use 
aircrafts, when they want to fly, they want to travel, they come into the 
building, they need to check in, their luggage needs to be checked in 
and they need to be taken to aeroplane or that kind of thing, that’s how 
you described it, is that correct, or did I misunderstand your evidence? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That is what the contract was saying 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But now this thing of – these things of fire 
20 
trucks, cutting grass and upgrading the building and so on, didn’t they 
seem to be very much outside of the business of ground handling as 
you understood it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair the cleaners and the gardeners 
Mr van Wyk said the agreement that was entered into with government, 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 116 of 172 
 
they adding some responsibilities of gardening into Koreneka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the agreement had been concluded? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he said this is what government decided to add? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes he said the Department of 
Transport has added some extra responsibilities into Koreneka, not into 
the contract, into Koreneka for Koreneka to be doing, since Koreneka 
has got the cleaners and the gardeners of the airport and to confirm 
that I even went to Mr (indistinct), Mr [indistinct] told me the same 
thing hence now he even gave me that circular that this is – these are 
10 
the budgets that have been located for the rest for – for SA Express 
and then these other ones are for management company to be doing 
that – this kind of work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so at least the cleaning part, maintenance and 
maintenance part that you knew about – you knew about that from some 
– from a certain stage? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair this is what I was told about 
Mr Van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And since – because I have not been 
20 
to the airport remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And now those people they were – this 
the work that they were doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 117 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and… 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And being paid by Koreneke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And being paid by Koreneke? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so therefore the tractor for cutting grass that is 
the part that would require the tractor?  The maintenance and the 
maintenance and cleaning part? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  And you had accepted that that was part 
10 
of what was going to be Koreneke’s responsibilities after Mr Van Wyk 
told you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I found the – in 2016 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  When now I took over I found those 
responsibilities being done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  People were doing that kind of – of 
job. And even the salaries they were paid from Koreneke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And – and even if I asked the airport 
manager, the airport manager explained to me that yes this according 
to what he knows yes this is what has been agreed upon.  Even though 
the contract does not say that but now he say that that is why the 
contract has to be looked into and then that was the response that I got 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 118 of 172 
 
from them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there was an addition on the subsidy in order to 
take care of the salaries for the maintenance and cleaning staff? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No there was never an addition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no addition? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No the subsidy payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Was according to the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the agreement. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To the schedule that was attached on 
10 
the service level agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and how many – more or less how many 
employees were involved in cleaning and maintenance?  Or you cannot 
remember? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair – I would say 30 Pilanesberg, 
30 Mafikeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is quite a lot of people.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say they were added without any increase on the 
– on the subsidy to help Koreneke to pay their salaries? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair.  Remember the subsidy – 
the subsidy according to the way I saw it – the subsidy it is a – for the 
first year it is 51 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When I say subsidy I am just referring to the money 
that came from Department of Transport. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 119 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes, no there was no money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And went to SA Express and then came to you or 
came straight to you.  I am just using one word for all of those monies. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes I – no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no addition? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to complete this line of questions if I may 
Ms Tlatsana about what work Koreneke did or did not do.  Did Koreneke 
ever engage in route marketing for the routes that were flying into the 
10 
airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that you will recall Ms Tlatsana because 
you have looked at the subsidy structure page of the main agreement.  
If we go in DD8[a] to page 156.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 156? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes 156 of DD8[a]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana if you have a look at that page 156 
this is not a particularly good copy we have seen better copies I can 
20 
take you to one but I assume you have seen this page before. The 
second half of the page deals with what the management company 
subsidy is going to be and do you see the lines following that say: 
route marketing subsidy Pilanesberg and in year 1 it is about 14.8 
million and then below that route marketing subsidy Mafikeng and about 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 120 of 172 
 
8.8 million again.  Do you see that?  Oh sorry 14.8 million again, do 
you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is in excess of 29 million that total and as 
I have your evidence your company never engaged in route marketing? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you did receive that payment of 29 million 
nonetheless? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes it was paid into the account.  Yes 
Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana if we can then go – I 
am conscious of the time and what we still need to cover.  The 
remainder of your affidavit starts to talk about the success of 
companies who are then appointed to replace Koreneke for – in relation 
to ground handling at the airports.  We have had quite a bit of evidence 
in relation to those aspects from previous witnesses so Chair with your 
leave my – I propose to ask specific questions that are peculiar to Ms 
Tlatsana’s personal knowledge in relation to those aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because we have had the benefit of the setting 
20 
out of the time and the circumstances of their appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Through other witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine but I also wanted to mention to you 
that from my own side I will not be rigid by one o’clock if we – that we 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 121 of 172 
 
stop at one o’clock if we need a little bit more time just to finish her 
evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we could continue if we – by that time we are 
about to finish. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we go next Ms Tlatsana in your affidavit that 
10 
is in Exhibit DD8[a] to page 23.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  23? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  23, 23.  Ms Tlatsana that page of your affidavit 
there is a heading towards the bottom of the page Valotech agreement.  
We have heard about that agreement in previous testimony.  I have a 
few questions in relation to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just before that.  Did we finish with that 
meeting where she was recording?  Okay let me just check.  On what 
basis was that meeting ended?  So Mr Van Wyk said a lot of things and 
you said most of the time you kept quiet you said he must continue.  
20 
Just tell us some of the points that you made during that meeting? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If any? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay Chair.  And he said I should 
consider – he was insisting on me to consider the fact that he has got 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 122 of 172 
 
two critical people that has to receive their monies.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That he – that should be paid? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes that should be paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And if I could be of assistance and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you could assist with regard to that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes if I could release and give back 
the pin codes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the pin code or password. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja the password to Mr Kalisilira to 
10 
continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the accountant to get into – access the account. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did you say? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I did not say anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he was asking you to think about that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes and I just kept quiet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what did you – did you say anything in 
response to his proposal that your closed corporation should enter into 
a contract with him for five years? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To my knowledge I – if I remember 
well I never said a word regarding to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there any particular point of importance that 
you made at that meeting that you want to tell me about? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  In the… 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 123 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To him that you made to him? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  In that meeting Chair the purpose of 
the meeting was Brian to extract more money from the company and my 
main story was I do not understand why you need money.  I do not 
understand why you talking about people that are getting their salaries 
every month to get money from this company and I do not understand – 
you are busy making arrangements and all this things you are just 
informing me you are not telling me – you come here to tell me what to 
do and I am not happy about that.  I remember this somewhere where I 
was now even scolding him that I am not going to take his story.  And 
10 
he just wanted to – his presentation was Babadi I am in trouble please 
these people they want their monies that we promised to give them.  
Make access available so that we can pay them because there is 
another 18 million coming in February.  So that is the one that we will 
play around with.  
CHAIRPERSON:  How long did that meeting take if you remember more 
or less?  You cannot remember? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I think it is – it did not take long 
less than 30 minutes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So by the end of the meeting you had not 
20 
promised him anything.  You had not agreed to anything? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I – no, no, I – as I remember I 
did not promise him anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because when he was busy talking I 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 124 of 172 
 
was saying okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But okay can mean I agree. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No okay.  My okay was to dismiss him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  So that he can get out of my back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because at least – because I got what 
he wanted to say 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So the meeting ended without any 
particular conclusion? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair if I remember no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes alright thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And there is one fact here that you 
think we should say.  In the beginning of this meeting what he 
mentioned that I made Ms Kate and the gentleman aware.  He said 
Babadi to be honest now let me be fair to you – I have not been fair to 
you all this time.  Let me now be open to you and tell you exactly what 
is supposed to happen.  Remember that is what he said.  Now that is 
what he said.  That I have not been fair to you please now I am here let 
me just be open and fair to you and tell you actually what is going on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is in the recorded conversation? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could I ask a follow up in relation to that Ms 
Tlatsana.  Did you understand what Mr Van Wyk then said to you in the 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 125 of 172 
 
course of that conversation to be an explanation of where the monies 
that you had seen go out of the Koreneke account actually ended up? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Your question again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me break it down.  You had previously seen 
amounts go out of the Koreneke account, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you had made enquiries of Mr Van Wyk 
about what those monies were being used for, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now you sit down with a meeting on the 20 
10 
January 2016 and as I have your evidence he said to you he is now 
going to be frank with you, he is going to tell you what is really going 
on, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then he proceeds to tell you about millions 
of rands that need to be paid or have been paid to people, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you understand him to be giving you an 
explanation for where the monies that had been taken out of the 
account previously actually ended up as opposed to the reason he gave 
20 
you previously? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair Mr Van Wyk’s story was not 
adding up.  It was not adding up.  He was just everywhere.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But he did not ever say to you remember when 
I told you that there was a payment for fire trucks that was actually a 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 126 of 172 
 
payment for this person or that person, he did not say anything like 
that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no he did not say – no he did not 
say that one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  According to my memory he did not 
say that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go – I was going to direct you to page 
23 of the affidavit in DD8[a]. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Hm. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have a heading there the Valotech 
Agreement.  Ms Tlatsana we have heard evidence about that I would 
like to ask you just a few questions.  Who was Ms Nothando Dube? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Nothando Dube was the facilities 
manager in Koreneke during the year 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did her role cease at Koreneke? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes her role ceased in May 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happened? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  She did not – she did not extend – she 
did not extend her contract because everybody was – has extended 
20 
their contract.  She did not extend her contract and she was just there 
coming every day to office.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I think we had evidence previously that you 
dismissed her, is that not correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It is correct I dismissed her. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 127 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did you do that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I do not remember the date but – 
maybe the 22 May somewhere there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In May 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what role did she then play in Valotech to 
your knowledge? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No after she left some two days after 
she left now in the corridors I heard that she got a company and her 
company is being paid – is going to be paid in the 1 June for her to 
10 
take over the responsibilities of Koreneke in Mafikeng airport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And to your knowledge did that payment take 
place? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  After my investigation yes that 
payment did take place. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you able in that investigation to 
establish any links between Ms Dube and Mr Van Wyk? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What were they? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  After my attorney Mr Julian Knight 
20 
enter into the shelved warehouse to check the whereabouts – to make a 
follow up on this Valotech company when is it registered is then when 
now we realised that the owner of this company initially it was the name 
of the company was Estala – Lavel Estavel and it was Mr Van Wyk’s 
company with the registration number K2013149778 and then this 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 128 of 172 
 
company the person who put it on the shelf his name is Mr Sipho Phiri 
and Mr Sipho Phiri is Mr Brian Van Wyk’s partner.  And because we 
could confirm again with his ID number – with Mr Van Wyk’s ID number 
that yes the Lavel Estavel was his company his ID number is 8208… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We do not need that detail. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:    Okay alright 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Alright thank you.  Should I continue? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I would just like to get a few more details 
in relation to Valotech.  To your knowledge did they render any services 
10 
at Mafikeng airport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  They have never rendered any service 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How do you know that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Because I was – Koreneke was there 
rendering services. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Until what date? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Until 2017 if I am not mistaken.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would also like to just draw your 
attention to a document that we actually received in the course of 
20 
yesterday Chair but it has been added to the bundle just for Ms 
Tlatsana’s comment.  You will find it in Exhibit DD8[b] and you will find 
it right at the back at page 584.  Chair this is an email that we 
received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 129 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From Ms Petudi actually yesterday but it was 
not dealt with in the course of her evidence insofar as the document 
was concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But her evidence was that Valotech invoiced 
the North West Department in terms of its agreement with SA Express 
the invoice came through on an email from Mr Kalisilira and it is for 
that reason that I want to ask Ms Tlatsana whether she recognises the 
person who is sending this email at page 584. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair I do recognise this here. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who is that person? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr David Kalisilira. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is that email address indicated for him one 
that you were familiar with? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair – I think I can say 
correct, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was – you did know his email david@jdk.tax? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you know this one I am not sure of. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I am not sure of this one. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware of his – the name of his 
company or the one he worked at? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Come again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware of the company that Mr 
Kalisilira worked at? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 130 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes I was aware of. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was its name? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The other company was Mint Books. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mint Books yes that you refer to in your 
affidavit.  So does this company JDK and Partners mean anything to 
you that appears under his name in the email? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair during the investigation we 
realised that this one too is his company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So – were you aware previously 
that Mr Kalisilira was involved at least on the face of this document 
10 
with Valotech? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was not aware the first time I 
realised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr I just want to make sure that we are on 
the same page on how much is left. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you finish. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But part of the reason I want to know that – to know 
your estimate it is because I do not want you to necessarily rush too 
20 
much when I might still have time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is your present estimate of how much more 
time you need without doing any injustice to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Probably 45 minutes Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 131 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I can sit another 45 minutes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Should we carry on and then break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us just carry on.  If it is – is that fine with 
you Ms Tlatsana and with everybody involved? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It seems to be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright let us – let us continue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just want to mention I am the only one who 
has been standing for the whole day but I will keep it together for the 
next 45 minutes without any problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you so much.  We – Ms Tlatsana you 
have confirmed that despite Valotech receiving a payment from the 
North West to your knowledge they delivered no services at Mafikeng 
airport, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana I then understand that there was a 
point at which you were arrested towards the end of 2016 can you tell 
us about that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was arrested on the 15 December 
2016 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2016. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  2016 yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what were you arrested for? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was arrested for racketeering it is 4 
charges I do not remember them but I know that racketeering was one 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 132 of 172 
 
of them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go to page 22 of your affidavit in 
Exhibit DD8[a] page 22.  You indicate at paragraph 4.58 that you were 
subsequently charged, what was your charge? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay I was charged with fraud in 
relation to the business of the first respondent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is Koreneke, correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you granted bail? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In what amount? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Half a million Chair, R500 000,00. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what has happened subsequently with that 
case? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was provisionally withdrawn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was the bail money returned to you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just for your reference I have that at page 28 
paragraph 4.85.  There you say the criminal matter has subsequently 
been withdrawn against me and the other role players are now the 
20 
subject of criminal investigation in respect to the money laundering 
referred to in this affidavit.  Chair we will look into that in due course.  
I do not propose to do it with Ms Tlatsana you will recall at the opening 
of the aviation evidence I indicated that we had taken steps to make 
contact with the priority crime investigation unit. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 133 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we will update you in due course on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Tlatsana I understand your testimony to 
be that the charges are provisionally withdrawn, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did their withdrawal come about after you had given 
your version of what had happened or not really? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair it is after I submitted my 
10 
version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you as I understand it the second affidavit 
that we have referenced in these proceedings is an affidavit that you 
have provided to the Hawks, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in relation to your bail who – how did you 
manage to come up with half a million rand for that bail? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I took it from the bank account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Your personal bank account? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No the company’s 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The company - Koreneke’s. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you.  That is at the end of 2016 
I am trying to follow it in the chronology.  The next event that appears 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 134 of 172 
 
from your affidavit is a purported termination of your agreements with 
SA – your agreement with SA Express which occurred in March 2017.  
Can you tell us about that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Where are we? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I can take you to page 30, 30 of your affidavit.   
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well if you go back one page sorry just so that 
you can get the heading.  At page 29 you will see a heading ‘The 
termination of the ground handling agreement’ and at paragraph 4.91 
there is a reference to an email that you received.  We can go there.  
10 
The email is at page 245 in the same bundle.  No apologies that is the 
order.  The letter is at 242.  That is the one in relation to the 
proceedings.  I do apologies.  Please go back to 239.  That is the letter 
of the 13 March please tell us what that says? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The letter is from SA Express to the 
director Koreneke Trading and Projects. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who in particular at SA Express wrote the 
letter? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  CEO Mr Inathi Ntshanga. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what does it record?  What 
20 
does the letter say? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay.   
“Termination of standard ground handling agreement 
between Koreneke and Project and SA Express.  This 
letter serves as confirmation of termination for 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 135 of 172 
 
standard ground handling services at Pilanesberg 
International Airport.  The agreement shall terminate 
on the 31 March 2017.  Please liaise with the newly 
appointed airport management company.  Yours 
faithfully.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I have it from your affidavit you took 
legal steps in response to this letter, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happened in those legal proceedings? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  On that legal proceedings we went to 
10 
court and then we were – been granted – the draft order says – which 
one should I read?   
“The cancellation by the respondent on the 1 March 
of the ground handling entered into between the 
applicant and the respondent on 15 March 2015” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  15 April. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I mean 
“15 April 2015 be declared unlawful is hereby set 
aside.  It is hereby declared that the ground handling 
agreement entered into…” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second - I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Ms Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, proceed. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the second declaratory – as I have it you 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 136 of 172 
 
obtained - was that the ground handling agreement entered into 
between yourself and South African Express remained binding.  Is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then Ms Tlatsana if we go to page 33 of 
your affidavit in DD8A you then detail the agreements that were 
concluded with companies that we have been colloquially referring to 
as PAMCO and MAMCO.  We have been through those details 
previously in evidence. 
What I am interested in – in terms of your knowledge is 
10 
whether PAMCO rendered any services in relation to either the 
Pilanesberg or the Mafikeng Airports? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I – I do not know but what I know 
about PAMCO is after my – after Koreneka’s suspension on 25 May 
2017 and then it was PAMCO that entered.  Before then yes they came 
to tell us that they are the ones that have been granted – given the 
contract to do the work. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when you – when exactly did you move off 
site at the airport? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The letter from the CEO said with 
20 
immediate effect. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when was that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  There is a letter for the CEO.  There 
is a letter for the CEO.  I think it was on 25 May somewhere there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In 2017? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 137 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But until that point you had been rendered the 
services at Pilanesberg and Mafikeng.  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say on page 34 paragraph 4.108 that: 
“On 28 June 2017 PAMCO was paid 15.55 million by 
the second respondent.” 
That is a reference to the North West Department of 
Transport and you add: 
“Despite the fact that it has to date rendered no 
10 
services in respect of the Pilanesberg Airport and 
knew that the money was due and payable to 
Koreneka.” 
But I am just trying to get clear on the extent to which you 
can make that statement in relation to your knowledge of what was 
happening on the ground at Pilanesberg Airport.  Your knowledge ends 
at the end of May 2017.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So you can say until May 2017 they 
were not rendering the services.  Correct? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you do not have knowledge after that point.  
Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana I would like to ask you 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 138 of 172 
 
now just in summary to go to a diagram that has been prepared by the 
Commission.  You have been show this diagram previously and you will 
find it in EXHIBIT DD8B right at the back.  It is at page 5-8-5.  
Ms Tlatsana you have a copy in front of you. 
There is also a graphical representation that is been 
displayed in the room.  You will see on the top left there is a little what 
looks like a house representing the North West Government and then 
you will see a series of lines in red on that diagram which when this 
was put together was intended to denote payments out of the North 
West Government and you will see a whole number of lines at the top – 
10 
covering the top of the page - going from the North West Government to 
South African Express.  Do you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There are also payments going from the North 
West Government into Koreneka.  Do you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then payments down out of the North West 
Government to Valoteck, MAMCO and PAMCO.  Do you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then below Koreneka there are a series of 
20 
payments out.  Ms Tlatsana this has been produced based principally 
on your affidavit evidence as well as certain of the evidence Chair of 
other witnesses.  So it is only fair Ms Tlatsana can only speak to that of 
which she has personal knowledge but we thought it useful just for 
summary purposes for us to get a picture of how much money and to 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 139 of 172 
 
whom it went. 
So if we talk about your aspects Ms Tlatsana you can confirm 
– can you – that 20 606 435 million - that is the line between the North 
West Government and Koreneka - that money came into Koreneka.  
Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the line from South African Express which 
is in the top right hand corner down to Koreneka of 31 million.  Can you 
confirm Koreneka having received that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then out of Koreneka this is tracked from 
your affidavit there as the 500 000 that went to (indistinct).  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Another 500 000 that was given a reference 
management consulting.  Do you recall that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Two million that went to a Mr Peters.  Do you 
recollect that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Nine million that went to an entity called 
20 
AMFS?  As I recall it the only indication you were given of that on a 
statement was an entry movement and finance.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  9.9 million that went to Neo Solutions? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 140 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the balance of that is 29.1 million.  
Do you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicated there Ms Tlatsana as 
retaining that 29.1 million.  Do you see that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will recall yesterday we have asked for an 
account of what happened to that 29.1 million and I understand you will 
still be providing that to us in due course. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did give us some information about it in the 
course of your evidence yesterday.  You said at least 500 000 was paid 
to your associated company around June/July 2015.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana I also understand that you made 
another payment out of that account to the ANC.  Can you – in early 
2016.  Can you please explain to us the circumstances around that 
payment? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair during 2016 when Mr van Wyk 
was making the up and downs and with a series of calls he – he needed 
20 
money because before then he was saying that the ANC had to be paid 
money and that is where now I was – I used to query him but I do not 
understand why but now this time when I – I made this transaction 
because he wanted to – to have access into the account and I – I 
decided that – you know – let me pay all the outstanding that Brian was 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 141 of 172 
 
talking about. 
So that we can be – I can be relieved from him because the 
pressure was just too much – was unbearable with regard to the 
demand of the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With reference to the meeting that you held with 
Mr van Wyk at Spur Restaurant where you recorded your conversation 
where – when was it when you then decided to make payments – 
remaining payments and when you had to deal with the question of 
making a payment to the ANC. 
Where are we talking about?  What timeframe are we talking 
10 
about?  What – what time, when, which month, in 2016?  The meeting 
was – was on 23 January. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  20 June. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry- 20 January it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20 January 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when you made this decision to make some 
payments to some people so that you can have nothing to do with him 
because you were – he was giving you too much pressure.  When was 
20 
that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I do not – I do not remember 
very well because I – we tried to check in the statements.  I do not 
know whether it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you cannot remember? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 142 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Before the 20 t h or after the 20 t h.  I do 
not remember well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you think it could – it could be before – it could 
have been before the 20 t h before you had the meeting? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I cannot remember Chair.  I cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Late in the year, early in the year, mid-year you 
cannot remember? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no, no.  It is – it is early in the 
10 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is early in the year? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could I probe that a little bit further?  How did 
you obtain details for the payment to be made to the ANC? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I – I got the details from the ANC 
Regional Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the North West. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Let us go back.  I do not – I did not get 
the story correctly.  How did the idea of your close corporation paying 
the ANC or you paying the ANC something arise and from whom did it 
arise and what was the occasion? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA: 
 
Chair 
Mr van Wyk 
was 
putting 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 143 of 172 
 
pressure that we should pay – we should put money into ANC and he 
was putting pressure – everything that he was talking about it was ANC 
this, ANC that, ANC this, Luthuli this, ANC this.  He was just making 
noise about ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Earlier on when you talked about your meeting with 
him on 20 January 2016. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said he talked to you about your refunding him 
and Mr Kalisilira – I hope I am pronouncing the surname correctly – 
refunding them because they had paid a certain – a few millions I think. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  400 000 Chair. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  400 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  400 000 – as I have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, 400 000 not millions. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R400 000 for the ANC 104 celebrations.  Now when 
the question of paying the ANC that we are now talking about arose 
was it in relation to that money or was it something else? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair Mr van Wyk – okay the 400 000 
20 
was the refund … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To him and Mr Kalisilira? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  For – for (intervenes). 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 144 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this time he was not talking about that R400 000? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no.  This time it is not about 
400 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  This time it is a – a donation to ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, he asked you to make a donation to the ANC? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and what did you say to this 
suggestion?  What did you say to his proposal or suggestion? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair because these were the things 
10 
that he was saying - he said before that they should be done and then I 
said – you know – let me just pay this amount of money so that I can be 
out of Mr van Wyk’s back.  He can be out – out of my back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you agreed?  So you agreed to pay a 
donation to the ANC? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.  I – I paid that money to 
ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he indicate to you how much he was suggesting 
you should pay or did he leave that to you?  The amount that you 
should pay as a donation did he make a suggestion to you or did he 
20 
leave that to you how much you would – how much donation you would 
make? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I – I do not remember.  I do not 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember him making …. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 145 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I do not remember (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talking about an amount? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I do not know remember that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  How much did you pay as a donation to the 
ANC? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  One million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R1 million? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would this have been around early – early in 2016, 
around mid-year or you are not sure? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was early 2016 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Early in 2016? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand your evidence you got the 
account details from the Regional Office of the ANC.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when you provide us with your affidavit in 
due course accounting for the 29.1 million that is not accounted for on 
your affidavit I take you will get the details for when that payment was 
20 
made? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Amongst others and can I ask you today to your 
recollection were there any other payments that you made to political 
parties or politically connected persons? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 146 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Not to my memory Chair, no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you will go back over the bank statements 
and give us a full account? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana there are one or two sort of tie up 
questions that I want to put to you but before we go there.  Your 
affidavit to the Hawks talks about threats about that you received over 
the period of your engagements with Koreneka and South African 
Express.  Can you tell us about those?  What – what did they involve? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair in the beginning of – in 
10 
December 2015 no 2016 before … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is – can we just locate in time.  
December 2016 is where you – when you arrested. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is where we are in time? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes but I am going – I am going back 
not to the beginning of … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A little bit behind that? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before that, thank you. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, before that.  Beginning of 2016 – 
January there – some two gentlemen came to the office.  I remember 
the other one his name – he was saying that he is Sipho.  I forgot the 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 147 of 172 
 
other one.  They were just so - looking strange.  They were driving a 
big Mercedes Benz. 
They parked there and then they – they parked there in front 
of the office opposite and then they came straight into the office and 
they said – they – they asked the lady who I am working with that they 
are here.  They want to see me and their car it is a GP registration and 
I wanted to resist but I said God be with me. 
Let me just go and hear what these people want and these 
gentlemen they said to me that they came here to come and intervene 
into my misunderstanding with Brian van Wyk – misunderstanding.  Yes 
10 
there is a misunderstanding because now Brian van Wyk is a – is 
expecting money from Koreneka and I am not giving him the money and 
he is under threat because he promised to pay people money and this – 
these very same men they said that there is a – their portion as well is 
in that package. 
I told them that you know what I do not know you.  I do not 
understand what you are talking about.  Yes Brian van Wyk I know him.  
He is a GM of Commercial in SA Express.  I have got no dealings with 
Mr van Wyk.  So I do not understand what you gentlemen are talking 
about.  I think if you can just go back to Mr van Wyk and find out what 
20 
is he talking about. 
I do not know.  I have never entered into any business with 
Mr van Wyk and they – they changed their face.  They started fixing 
themselves to sit properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr do you want to describe that for the 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 148 of 172 
 
record or not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am not sure I will do it justice Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fixing their face and doing whatever they were doing.  
Was it threatening or not really threatening? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was threatening Chair because the 
other one was putting on a jacket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And I am in the office and they come 
from the car.  They are only holding their – their phones and then that 
other one is fixing a jacket.  Maybe there is a gun there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you were thinking? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That is what I was thinking and he 
was busy fixing this thing.  This is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What a watch?  Hm? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  This thing that looks like a – that 
thing.  He was busy fixing it.  I do not know whether they were 
threatening me that – you know – we are traditional (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  We will deal with you or I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the witness is holding her wrist – right hand 
20 
wrist and moving her arm in a – as if she is fixing or rearranging her 
watch but she says it was not a watch.  Is that right? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not a watch.  It was a skin that is – that 
somebody was wearing around her wrist – his wrist.  Is that right? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 149 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It is a traditional skin that is worn by African 
people under circumstances. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is an animal skin. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A goat skin or you do not know – sheep skin? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I do not know the animal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  But it looks like (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you – he was making movements with his 
hands suggesting that – he was touching this animal skin and you say 
you do not know whether was threatening you in terms of any 
traditional muti? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because you know now that 
our African cultures are so many different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  You do not know whether he is a – he 
is a traditional healer or this is just a dressing or what or maybe that 
was a code … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  To come and threaten me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 150 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana did you feel fearful in this 
interaction? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I could not 
even go home and – because they were saying that no – no we are 
going to come next time and then maybe we will visit you at your 
house. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana you – I think you mentioned 
somebody amongst the people who approached you identifying 
themselves with the name Sipho.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Where my dear?  Yes that is where I 
10 
mentioned Sipho. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Just please tell us about that because it 
is quite important what the name of the person was. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair on the next occasion right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The people who were talking to you … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you say were making you fearful.  Did you say 
one of them said his name was Sipho? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because he – he even took 
20 
out his ID so that I should confirm his ID.  I - please I do not want to 
see those things because I just want to dismiss them so I can 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you catch a surname when you looked at 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 151 of 172 
 
the ID? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you look at the ID or you did not even want to 
look at the ID? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I did not even look at any of 
their things because I just wanted these gentlemen to – to go away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you saw them … 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was not comfortable. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you saw them again would you recognise 
them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And with what level of certainty do you recall 
the person’s first name being Sipho? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes that one because the –the lady 
who I am working with in the office he remembered that one that – the 
other one was Sipho. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you had that confirmation.  Did you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the person in the office? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair some significance we submit and we will 
certainly investigate it further but you will recall that Mr Ngwenya’s 
interaction … 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 152 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Later in the year is with an individual who he 
recalls identifying himself as Sipho. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this will be an aspect we will investigate 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and among the things that Mr Ngwenya said this 
person told him was that – was that the money that Mr van Wyk had – I 
cannot remember if he used the word “taken” … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes moved from … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Moved … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or moved out, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, moved out; was moved out to the ANC or for the 
benefit of the ANC … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or something along those lines according to 
Mr Ngwenya. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Are you able to give some description 
of this person who called himself Sipho or has the – has his face kind 
20 
of faded from you – you cannot remember or – or in terms also of the 
height and everything? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, the other one is short Chair and 
then the other is taller. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us talk about Sipho.  Is he tall?  Is he short? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 153 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I do not remember who was 
Sipho in between the two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember who was Sipho between the two 
of them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No because the – the lady who I am 
working with in the office.  She was saying that the other one is Sipho.  
He said he is Sipho.  So I did not remember.  Chair when you are 
frightened you cannot even think properly.  I did not even look at those 
people. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but now they will – if you recognise – if you say it 
is so and so and you say you can recognise them they will say on your 
own evidence you said when you are fighting you cannot remember 
people.  How do you remember them then? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I mean the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but if they – I asked you to describe them. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay, yes.  The other one is short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of them was short? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes.  Light in complexion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And a bit stout. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything on his face or anything that stood 
out for you that would still be there in his – on his face if you saw – 
saw them on anyone of them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 154 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing stood out? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA: 
 
No 
Chair 
not 
according 
to 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that was – that was what two years ago – three 
years ago? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It was 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you saw them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It is 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you had a meeting with them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  2016 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you subsequently see them again? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would you be confident that you can recognise 
them quite well three years later when you saw them once and the 
atmosphere was – I think as I understand what you say like you were 
fighting?  Why – why do think you would be able to recognise if you 
were shown some people and you were asked whether they are among 
them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair I slightly will – slightly I will 
recognise but it – do not be confirmation or maybe I should just go with 
20 
it but I – I think slightly I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You think you have some chance that you could 
recognise them? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 155 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair and Ms Tlatsana that was – I 
asked you what threats you had received.  That was the first example 
that you gave.  Were there any others? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.  The other one – the other 
one I attended a funeral in Mafikeng and one gentleman who – he is a 
husband to my previous bookkeeper – he – he came to me and said 
what are you doing here in the funeral.  I said what do you mean.  I am 
attending a funeral.  He says do you not know that – do you not know 
that Supra needs your head. 
He wants to kill you.  Why – why does he kill me?  No they 
10 
say you ran away with the airport money and then the other one … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana before you go to the last one I just 
want to locate us in time.  You do not have to go there but as I have it 
in your affidavit to the Hawks you said that that funeral was in about 
June 2017 is that – does that accord with your memory? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then your third example. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The third example was – the third one 
was in – on my phone.  I would receive a series of calls telling me that 
ja we are seeing you.  You are driving this car.  We come following you.  
20 
You are dressed like this and you are about to enter your – your house.  
Then tomorrow – we are here at your daughter’s school and she is 
dressed like this. 
She is entering and you are going to wait for her when she 
comes out of school and then this – and that gentleman he was 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 156 of 172 
 
addressing himself as Sipho as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one who was sending you messages? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The phone calls.  He was phoning me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Phone calls? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair.  He was calling me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Any SMS’ – no SMS’? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes and SMS’. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And SMS’? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was saying – you said he was Sipho? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes he was saying that he is Sipho. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what he said was there anything that he 
said or wrote to – in the SMS’ that suggested that he was one of the 
two people that had met you? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He – that one of the telephone he was 
telling me that he has been sent by the person that I ran away with – 
with his money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And you know that that person lives in 
Johannesburg area. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And these people they need their 
money so now they said I should come and kill you.  Now for me not to 
kill you what are you going to give me in return.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 157 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I said why should I have to give you 
money, he said no you need to put up a price and then I said okay fine 
price, then give me the price, how much do you want and then he was 
saying that he wants between one million and one point five million, 
and then I said to him okay you can go ahead with your killing, I am not 
part of that, that’s your game.  And he was calling me, he was telling 
me that he is going to go to my daughter’s school, I said go ahead, be 
killing is there anybody that if he wants to kill you are telling them that 
I want to kill you, kill if you kill, that’s what I told him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this said also in sms messages, these threats of 
10 
killing and so on? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair, the recordings I gave them 
to, I reported the matter to the Mafeking Police Station Chair and to 
Brigadier Kleinhans, he referred the matter to, he was there, he called 
his subordinates to come and take this matter, up to today Chair I have 
not hear anything.  I called the Chief Hawks in Potchefstroom and in 
Mafeking, nobody came. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing has happened? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Nothing has happened Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they take a statement from you at the police 
20 
station? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair they did and as well as the 
recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as well as the recording? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 158 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you recorded these conversations, or these 
recordings that we were using earlier, which recordings are you talking 
about? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Excuse me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which recording are you saying they also took? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The recordings of Sipho of these 
death threats I recorded it as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so you handed those over to the police at 
Mafeking? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When was that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  In 20 ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  17? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  2017 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As the threats were happening? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes it was beginning of 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say up to now nobody from the police has 
ever come back to you to say how far the investigation was? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Nobody Chair and I tried to call, I 
even called the Commissioner from Potchefstroom, he said to me I 
20 
should go back to Mafeking Police Station, who am I going to ask in 
Mafeking Police Station so I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember who the investigation officer was 
who was assigned to the case or were you never told? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was never told Chair and even to 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 159 of 172 
 
come back to me to give me the case number I never got the case 
number but I understand my investigating team managed to end up 
getting the case number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the police officer who took the statement from 
you what was his name, or her name? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He is Kolonel – oh my goodness, I 
don’t remember his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you can recognise him if you go into that police 
station? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because Brigadier 
10 
Kleinhans called him to enter the office and to take a statement from 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr do you know whether there is 
anything that the Commission may have started doing to try and find 
out how come about close to two years nobody has ever come back to 
her to say what’s happening about the investigation? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we haven’t, as matters stand, as I have 
it, this is actually the first time that certainly we’re hearing about it, 
what we have followed up on are the criminal cases that have been 
opened in relation to this whole money laundering scheme, that is the 
20 
respect in which we have received the report that I make reference to 
but there’s no reason why we shouldn’t ask for an account on this as 
well, so we will put that in process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think we should I mean threats of this nature are 
very serious threats. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 160 of 172 
 
ADV KATE  HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if somebody goes to the police station and opens 
a case and a year goes by without anybody from the police station 
saying anything to him or her is just totally unacceptable, now it’s 
about two years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean this is why people lose confidence in the 
police. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It’s unacceptable.  I mean they may have done 
something but they haven’t told her and the fact that they haven’t told 
10 
her what’s going on is unacceptable. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair, we will certainly follow it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, please follow up and let me know what’s 
happening.  Ja, thank you.  Well you have heard what I said Ms 
Tlatsana, the Commission will try and find out exactly what’s happening 
because it’s unacceptable that you are kept in the dark for so long, 
actually that it takes so long is also quite a matter for concern that 
investigation takes so long, nobody has been arrested and they have 
not told you that you have no case therefore nobody will be arrested, 
and you are simply not informed at all of what’s happening when you 
20 
have laid a complaint about such a serious matter. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair and even in the very same 
police station in Mafeking Police Station when I was arrested one of the 
conditions was to report every week at the police station and I reported 
until August and now every week I have to register, that register, those 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 161 of 172 
 
pages where I was doing my register Chair they disappeared from the 
file and the purpose was I should be arrested because if now you are 
registering and now the papers disappeared, fortunately I had a back 
up because every time when I go to register I would go with a diary 
book, when they sign this paper they sign even my diary book, this 
book was my way out, and even in town Chair I am being followed.  
Chair I am not safe, even while I’m sitting here I am not safe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you decided that you would come forward 
and give evidence despite not feeling safe and despite all the threats.  
What I mean is you are prepared to make sure that the Commission 
10 
gets your evidence. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair in my custom when a father, 
when a man speaks we women will listen, you called me and I had to 
obey you and come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm, thank you very much for coming. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  And that is the mistake that I made 
with Mr van Wyk because now I was listening to him, obeying to his 
instructions only to find that now he took advantage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair just one or two concluding 
20 
questions, they are small aspects but they are actually going to be 
relevant to the evidence of Ms Viljoen and so Ms Tlatsana is going to 
be asked one or two questions in relation to them.  Ms Tlatsana you 
have a file near you which includes Ms Viljoen’s evidence.  Chair you 
should also have yours, it’s a soft file. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 162 of 172 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In front of me I don’t have any other file. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think your registrar indicated it would be put 
there yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair it hasn’t been entered into the evidence 
yet, we had hoped to have Ms Viljoen today (break in audio) three 
pages that I would like to ask for Ms Tlatsana’s comment on because 
she knows what Mr van Wyk’s signature looks like, given that she has 
signed agreements with him.  I propose that it be entered into the 
record as EXHIBIT DD9. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the file containing Ms Kalandra Viljoen’s statement 
will be marked EXHIBIT DD9. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana if you will go into that bundle, 
DD9, to page 64. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Which one is 64? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  64, you will see it in the top right hand corner 
of each of the pages, they’re KV and then they have a number after 
them, it will be under the tab 7, have you got that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If you turn that page to landscape 
20 
you will see a signature in the bottom left hand corner, do you 
recognise that signature. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whose signature is it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr Brian van Wyk Chair. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 163 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How certain are you of your ability to recognise  
his signature? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It’s in the contract, the contract for 
Koreneka that we both signed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you seen him sign anything else? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes in my – yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What else? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No, no, I don’t remember, how can I 
say it.  What did he say, yes there were letters that he wrote for me in 
the office and this was his signature. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you turn over the page to 65 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you turn over you don’t intend to get her 
to read what the document reads there or is that – you want to do that 
with Ms Viljoen? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was my intention Chair, as I have it Ms 
Tlatsana has no personal knowledge of this page, Ms Viljoen will 
explain to us in her evidence what it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe we must just read it so that whoever reads 
the transcript can associate the document which has got that signature 
with the writing. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course, right.  So just for record purposes in 
bundle DD9 at page 64 there is a page bearing a date of 01.05.2015 
and on that page is written R2million received by B T van Wyk and then 
there seems to be a number, M for mobile of – I won’t read that out for 
privacy purposes but we can see it on the page, and then below that on 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 164 of 172 
 
the left is the signature Ms Tlatsana that I’ve asked you to identify 
correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you’ve identified it as belonging to? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr Tebogo van Wyk, Brian. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If you turn over the page to 65  you 
will see another page similar to the previous one, this one again has a 
date, 7.05.2015 R2million received by B T van Wyk and then the same 
number recorded there and do you recognise a signature on that page? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whose signature is it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr Brian Tebogo van Wyk. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go over lastly to the third page in 
that sequence, page 66 of Bundle DD9 again a page with a date at the 
top 06.09.2015 R5million received by B T van Wyk, the same mobile 
number and below in the middle of the page do you identify that 
signature? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And whose signature is it? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Tebogo Brian van Wyk Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Tlatsana also relevant to Ms 
Viljoen’s evidence that will commence on Monday, can you tell us about 
the investigator who was assisting you in your case, what was his 
name? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Which case my dear I have got three 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 165 of 172 
 
investigators. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh you have a series of cases, I do apologise, 
the one involving your criminal complaint against Mr van Wyk who was 
that investigator? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Okay it’s Magosi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, that’s in the Hawks and was there a 
forensic investigator who as assisting Captain Magosi. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It’s Mr Jan Judeel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Judeel, how do you spell that Judeel? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  J-u-d-e-e-l. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now to your knowledge does he 
have an official position in the Hawks? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I don’t know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You don’t know, you don’t know whether he’s 
employed in the police force or priority crime investigation unit? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I know that he used to be. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Used to be? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know where he currently is? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Not of my knowledge. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And has he ever relayed to you an interaction 
that he had with Ms Viljoen? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  That’s what he said him and Ms 
Magosi went to meet Ms Viljoen. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let’s just pause there, who is Ms Magosi? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 166 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  The investigating officer for the 
current case that is at Mafeking. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did he say about him and Ms Magosi? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr ...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Judeel yes. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He said they went to take a statement 
from Ms Viljoen and then he said she is busy giving them different 
statements. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that all you recall? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Ja, that is all that I recall. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you remember when that was that he 
gave you that information? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No I don’t remember, I don’t 
remember.  I actually don’t know because he was giving me information 
every time after monthly  he will be giving me a report of what they 
have done.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then I just need to ask you for completion 
sake, Mr Thabeng, who was one of the members who you added to the 
close corporation, did he dispute his resignation from the corporation at 
all? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  He wrote a letter and – to resign. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he wasn’t in the same category as Ms Perry 
who suggested that she had been unlawfully or fraudulently removed 
from the register? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  No he did it on his own. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 167 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He did it on his own, and was there any 
litigation against you that he embarked upon? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes – there was a litigation that he 
said he is still a member of Koreneka, something like that if I remember 
well, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then, can I just get clear because I – my 
question was did he dispute his resignation and as I have it your 
answer was no, but then I asked well has he litigated against you about 
it and I understand your answer to be yes, and it related to the fact that 
he was still a member, can you clarify that for us? 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Mr Thabeng resigned from the 
company, he wrote a letter and the letter was admitted to the office, 
and later after a year now when we are in court I understand that now 
he says now he wants to be part of this proceedings of – proceedings in 
the court because now he was part of – he wants to be part of this 
whole thing so that he can get his portion of share. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which proceedings were those? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  We were in court I don’t remember 
whether it’s the first matter, how many cases have we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who and who were in court, who against who in the 
20 
proceedings, ja the proceedings about which you were in court, who 
had brought them against whom?  
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  It’s Ms Phiri against me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay when that litigation was going on you say that 
Mr Thabeng also indicated that he wanted to be part of the case? 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 168 of 172 
 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair because he was, his 
attorney was sending ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Letters. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Was communicating with my attorneys 
with regard to that but if my memory serves me well he was saying that 
he is still part of the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but there was correspondence you can’t 
remember everything that was said in the correspondence. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But part of it was that  he was contending that he was 
10 
still part of your – of Koreneka? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But did he bring proceedings himself or he just 
– his lawyer just sent letters, did he institute court proceedings, Mr 
Thabeng? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Not up to my knowledge no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair, Ms Tlatsana in conclusion 
from my side certainly we understand it to be the position that you are 
still seeking payment from the Northwest Government in relation to this 
20 
agreement, is that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You indicated in the course of your evidence 
that you were told by Mr van Wyk that as a parastatal South African 
Express doesn’t need to go through a tender process, do you recall 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 169 of 172 
 
that? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you were now to be told that South African 
Express must go out on tender before it grants the contract of the type 
that you got, a ground handling contract, and you know as a fact that 
process wasn’t followed before your contract was concluded what would 
be your comment on the proposition that your contract is unlawful? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I can’t comment on that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You can’t. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I really can’t comment on that, I don’t 
10 
want to bind myself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You can’t.  If you were persuaded that it was 
unlawful to have concluded that agreement with your company without 
any tender process having been followed I assume, but I would like 
your comment on it, you wouldn’t have a basis for continuing to pursue 
payment out of the Northwest Government or South African Express, is 
that correct? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  I was asking for the payment in 
relation to the contract that is at present with us with the S A Express 
and that’s all that I was doing, because the contract was saying that 
20 
the contract is going to end in 2020. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But if that contract was unlawful from the start 
then you would have no claim for that money would you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m not sure Ms Hofmeyr whether it’s a fair question 
to her. 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 170 of 172 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It may not be.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it may not be, it may not be yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, I am indebted to you Chair, the force of the 
point is simply that one of the questions that remain outstanding for the 
Commission, and it’s fair that I put this to Ms Tlatsana is that we do not 
know what happened to the 29.1million that came into Koreneka as 
matters stand here and how it was accounted for in the business.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is of concern because the scheme of 
these arrangements suggests an underlying invalidity in relation to 
10 
those contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is flowing from that that I am interested 
to have Ms Tlatsana’s submission in relation to her continued pursuit of 
funds notwithstanding everything that she has uncovered about – to 
quote your affidavit, the sham that these agreements were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well part of the reason why I am saying I am not 
sure if it’s a fair question because it might involve law. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but there may be a way maybe of asking it in a 
20 
way that is not very legal or legalistic ...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, technical, indeed, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me try this.  Let’s assume that when one 
looks at this agreement that Koreneka concluded with S A Express and 
how everything was carried out if one were to conclude that if you look 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 171 of 172 
 
at everything this agreement that Koreneka had and some of the 
payments that came in and came out were tainted by corruption, let’s 
assume, we are not saying it is so, let’s assume that that were to be 
the position, would you think that you would still say you must be paid 
money in terms of that agreement, despite the agreement and the 
payments being tainted by corruption or would you say well if it’s 
tainted by corruption then you don’t think you should be paid? 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Chair would it be fair if I say I cannot 
comment on that because ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that’s fine. 
10 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Let me do ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be something where you need legal advice, 
there may be litigation going on, you might want to reserve your 
position.  I don’t think we should take that further, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair.  Chair those are the questions 
from our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no thank you.  Thank you very much Ms Tlatsana 
for coming forward to give evidence, we appreciate it and the fact that 
you were able to come on a Saturday.  It may be that you would be 
asked to come back at some later stage, I am sure if you are asked 
20 
again you will come back.  Thank you very much. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused. 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSANA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will adjourn for the day and we will 
22 JUNE 2019 – DAY 118 
 
Page 172 of 172 
 
start at ten o’clock on Monday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And thank you to everybody for having taken the 
trouble to come on a Saturday, we have to try and work hard, there is 
not a lot of time left before the Commission finishes its work.  We 
adjourn.
