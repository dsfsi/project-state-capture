PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 20 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mbikiwa, good morning everybody. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are indeed Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Y are you ready? 
MR Y:  I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  The oath you took continues to 
apply.  You understand? 
MR Y:   Yes Chair understood. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you let us proceed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Y we concluded yesterday with you 
dealing with the high level review panel report which made various 
findings regarding the diversion of the Special Operations Unit and its 
mandate and I think we left off on your evidence to the effect that Ms 
Myeni did not qualify for the security protection that this Unit was 
providing to her. 
MR Y:  Correct.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I would like to begin this morning and to 
conclude your evidence by focussing on the services that were in fact 
20 
provided to Ms Myeni.  And for that purpose I would like to take you to 
the affidavit of Ms Moonsamy.  If you can turn to page 15 of the bundle 
in front of you, that is DD23? 
MR Y:  Okay Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair as always this affidavit is included in 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 3 of 146 
 
the bundle on a provisional basis on the basis that it does not as far as 
we are aware raise a contentious matter.  But it is provisional and 
subject to your direction in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it an annexure to Mr Y’s affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No Chair it is an additional document to Mr 
Y’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if it is not an annexure to Mr Y’s affidavit 
then it should have been given a different – separate exhibit number. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We can certainly arrange for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see because what Exhibit DD23 was said to be 
10 
was Mr Y’s affidavit and annexures to it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it is not an annexure it means it has not been 
admitted and it has not been given an exhibit number. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair.  Chair can I then request that 
Mr Moonsamy’s affidavit and its annexures be included as DD23B? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can do that.  You then have to remember to – it 
means the – or otherwise we can put it on a separate small file as 
DD24? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  DD23B Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if we – ja we could do it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  There is already a DD24 I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if we keep it inside this lever arch file we can 
have Mr Y’s affidavit and its annexures as 23A and then this affidavit 
and its annexures as 23B. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 4 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the lever arch file must make it clear it 
contains those two exhibits.  That is one way of doing it.  Another way 
of doing it is to take Mr Moonsamy’s affidavit and its annexures out of 
this and have it in a separate small file.  Then it can have its own 
exhibit or it might still have – it might still be DD23B but then this one 
will have to be A but kept separate. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I think given that we will be referring 
to Mr Moonsamy’ affidavit during the course of Mr Y’s evidence I think 
your first proposal would make sense that we keep them in the same 
10 
file but divide them into 23A and 23B and label the file accordingly to 
reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What is the last page of the annexures that 
belong to Mr Moonsamy’s one? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is page 273 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the end of the file? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I apologise Chair it is 167 is the end of 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The annexures to Mr Moonsamy’s one? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The annexures to Mr Moonsamy’s affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  167? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then what comes after 167 is the High Level 
Panel Report? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 5 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to the end? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Up to the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it an annexure to Mr Y’s affidavit or is it separate? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is a separate document Chair it was added 
afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see then ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  He refers to it in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair but it was not attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes then what should be done then it is that the High 
10 
Level Report should be a separate Exhibit it will need to be C – 23C.  
Well in that event what we might not need to change anything.  It 
seems to me that there is no annexure to Mr Y’s affidavit. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you people allowed me to say Mr Y’s affidavit and 
its annexures but there are no annexures. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I cannot allow us people to take the 
blame it was mine entirely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need to correct that now.  We will need to correct 
what I said yesterday when Mr Y’s affidavit was admitted and was 
20 
allocated a number.  I said at the time that it would be Exhibit DD23 
together with its annexures.  It has now transpired that it does not have 
any annexures therefore the position is that Mr Y’s affidavit is to be 
marked Exhibit DD23A.  And then in the same there is an affidavit by 
Mr Lingaraj Gary Moonsamy that affidavit is admitted and will be 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 6 of 146 
 
marked as Exhibit DD23B.  That is that affidavit together with its 
annexures.  Then there is another document in the same file that is the 
High Level Review Panel Report it is admitted and will be marked as 
Exhibit DD23C. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then during the break you can put in the 
dividers. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We will arrange for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  What page did you say we must go to? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are at ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go to Mr Moonsamy’s affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are at Mr Moonsamy’s affidavit and that 
is at page 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so that is Exhibit DD23B? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Y are you there? 
MR Y:  I am Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At page 15? 
MR Y:  Yes I am. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You will see there that at paragraph 1 Mr 
Lingaraj Gary Moonsamy describes himself as the Head of Department 
Group Security Services at South African Airways Kempton Park, 
Johannesburg.  Can I ask you to turn over to page 16. 
MR Y:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 7 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And we pick it up from paragraph 7.  I will 
not read the entirety of this into the record but I will – I will paraphrase 
it for your purposes.  Mr Moonsamy says that he – that among his 
duties was to provide Ms Myeni with the services of a close protection 
officer which he did together with three other Members of South African 
Airways Security Services for about four months.  He then in paragraph 
9 says that he – after this four month period Ms Myeni obtained a new 
security detail but that he did not know who appointed them or where 
they came from.  And that is despite him being the Head of Group 
Security Services.  At paragraph 10 he says that Ms Myeni breached 
10 
SAA policy by not making prior arrangements before arriving at SAA 
with her own security detail.  And then at paragraph 11 which is on 
page 18.  He says that the people with her would refuse to sign in 
which he says was also in violation of South African Airways policy.  Do 
you have any knowledge of any of this? 
MR Y:  I do not Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you have any reason to doubt this 
version? 
MR Y:  I do not Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if these agents or Members who were 
20 
protecting Ms Myeni had had been legitimately deployed to South 
African Airways do you know of any reason that they might not want to 
sign in? 
MR Y:  There should be no legitimate reason Chairperson.  They would 
have to follow the existing policies and procedures. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 8 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Then at paragraph Mr 
Moonsamy says that he did not confront Ms Myeni about this but he 
took note of incidents and recorded them.  And he refers to CCTV 
footage of the individuals who used to accompany Ms Myeni at SAA as 
her security detail.  He attaches a photograph from that footage which I 
would like to take you to.  It is at – that is at page 160. Can I ask you 
to turn there?   
MR Y:  Okay I am there Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Have you been shown this photograph 
before? 
10 
MR Y:  Yes I have by the investigators from the Commission. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And are you able to identify any of the 
people in the photograph? 
MR Y:  Chairperson the bottom left hand corner the individual we 
identified as a Member of the State Security Agency. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And are you able to indicate who he is? 
MR Y:  Yes Zama Ntolo.  He is the – was a Member of the Special 
Operations Unit. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you know anything about why he 
would have been deployed to South African Airways? 
20 
MR Y:  No Chairperson.  As I indicated yesterday we have found no 
paperwork, files, requests, deployment plans, project plans that would 
indicate that this was an official undertaking. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  The other aspect of Mr 
Moonsamy’s affidavit I would like you to – like to refer you to is an 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 9 of 146 
 
Incident Report that he talks about in his affidavit.  If I can ask you to 
turn back to his affidavit at page 19.   
MR Y:  Okay I am there Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At paragraph 15 he refers to a report about 
an incident with Mr Wolf Meyer who was the Chief Financial Officer of 
SAA until the end of 2015.  He attaches a copy of the report which I will 
take you to in a moment.  And he says that the report indicates that – it 
says Myeni and I assume that should Ms Myeni instructed the security 
personnel accompanying her at a meeting with Mr Meyer to confiscate a 
recording pen from him.  Can I ask is it within the mandate of SAA 
10 
Members to confiscate electronic equipment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean SSA?  You said SAA. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Apologies Chair.  SSA Members? 
MR Y:  Thank you for that Chair.  No it would not be within the 
mandate.  We do not have executive powers and it would be the 
responsibility of the SAA Security personnel to implement and police 
whatever their rules and regulations are. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed and you will see that at paragraph 16 
Mr Moonsamy says that it is not the mandate or policy for Group 
Security Services.  That is Group Security Services at SAA to 
20 
confiscate any belongings of Exco or Board Members in execution of 
their duties. 
MR Y:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I skipped over a part at paragraph 15.  If I 
can just refer you to that as well.  He says he was informed by his 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 10 of 146 
 
predecessor Mr Johan De Waal and was told by Mr Nico Bezuidenhout 
and Mr Wolf Meyer that the security personnel who used to accompany 
Ms Myeni at SAA would confiscate laptops and phones from people 
before they went into meetings with Ms Myeni on her instruction.  Can I 
take you to the report which refers to an incident of that kind?  You will 
find that on page 161. 
MR Y:  Okay Chairperson I am there. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And before I read the report into the record 
if I could ask you to turn to page 162 and just read who it says it is 
compiled by? 
10 
MR Y:  It says it is compiled by Zaza Ngema. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Do you know who Zaza Ngema is? 
MR Y:  I do not Chairperson.  As mentioned to the investigators in 
compiling the list of agents one might have indications of someone with 
the nickname of Zaza but we are unable to say that it would be Zaza 
Ngema therefore we could not confirm categorically to the Commission 
that it is the same person. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay but in the list that you have compiled 
you say there is a Zaza? 
MR Y:  Correct Chairperson. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we turn back to page 161 which is the 
report. 
MR Y:  I am there. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And we go to the background section.  It 
says: 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 11 of 146 
 
“On the 3 r d of July 2015 at 07:45 I, that is the compiler, 
Zaza Ngema received an urgent call from Mpendulo 
requesting me to assist him in transporting Ms Myeni 
from OR Tambo International Airport to the SAA Business 
Park for a Board Meeting.” 
Do you know who Mpendulo is? 
MR Y:  I do not Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The objective is described as to ensure that 
Ms Myeni is safely transported to her Board Meeting at SAA Business 
Park and that her safety guaranteed.  I then want to go to operational 
10 
support.  It says there: 
“Zama was called in to back me up for any eventuality 
and utilise his car to transport Ms Myeni.  He arrived at 
the hotel around 11:40.” 
Do you know who Zama is? 
MR Y:  Chairperson I assume it is the individual identified in the CCTV 
footage which would be Zama Ntolo. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  “He arrived at the hotel around 11:40 
Ms Myeni and I briefed him of the anticipated situation at 
the SAA Business Park Board Meeting.  Zama and I 
20 
came up with an operational plan.  The operational says 
we agreed that we will drive in Zama’s car to the SAA 
Business Park. All Board Members are to surrender any 
electronic devices that they may have.  Access to the 
Board room to be monitored by Zaza and alternate with 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 12 of 146 
 
Zama.” 
Mr Y can I then ask you to read the report into the record? 
MR Y:  Okay Chairperson.  It starts at 12:15: 
“We left the hotel with Ms Myeni and proceeded to her 
Board Meeting at the SSA Business Park.  Upon arrival 
at the entrance at 12:30 the security guard denied us 
access since Ms Myeni did not have her access card.  
Ms Myeni had to call the owner of the security company 
for us to be granted access to the premises.  We were 
granted ...(intervenes).” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Mbikiwa.  Why do you need him to read 
the report?  He was not there I assume? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  He was not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  He was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The report relates to an incident that has 
been referred to I understand previously in the evidence of Ms Stimpel. 
MR Y:  H’mm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  An incident involving the confiscation of a 
20 
recording pen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I – the purpose was simply to read the 
report into the record.  It is an attachment to Mr Moonsamy’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I think if you want him to confirm anything 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 13 of 146 
 
whether it is the kind of thing that people in the State Security Agency 
do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can just tell him what the report says in regard to 
that issue and then he can say whether that is the kind of thing that 
they do.  But otherwise there is no need for him to read reports. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he knows nothing about. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Y at this – what this report indicates is 
that Ms Myeni had a Board Meeting at which no one was allowed to 
have cell phones and thereafter had a meeting with the CFO at which 
she left the meeting, took the recording pen and handed it to the SSA 
agents and instructed them to confiscate it.  In your experience is that 
what Members of the SSA are empowered to do? 
MR Y:  No Chairperson.  I might add that within the SSA we have our 
own security protocols in which one would lock up your cell phone in a 
cell phone box and you know that you are not allowed recording 
equipment.  But at external meetings we may have advised the SSA 
20 
Security Head that this is the best practise.  But we do not have the 
executive power to actually go and confiscate any equipment off any of 
the Board Members. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Chair that concludes Mr Y’s 
evidence insofar as my questioning is concerned. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 14 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you very much Mr Y 
for coming to give the evidence.  We appreciate it very much.  Should 
we need you to come back we will ask you to come back but thank you 
very much and you are excused.   
MR Y:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chairperson could we stand down for a few 
minutes simply to rearrange logistics for the following witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay how much time do you need? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Five minutes I think Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five minutes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Morning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, Mr Mbikiwa will be presenting the 
20 
evidence of our next witness, but I request an opportunity simply to do 
a short opening before this next session of evidence because 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I indicated at the start of the aviation session 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 15 of 146 
 
that in respect of each new investigation area I propose to do a short 
summary of what would follow.  Chair, this is the last instalment of this 
phase of evidence that we will be presenting and we again shift our 
focus.  Today and tomorrow we propose to deal with the role of Auditors 
at State Owned Enterprises. 
Chair, Auditors have been described by our courts as the 
watchdogs of institutions that they audit.  That actually comes from a 
case involving PricewaterhouseCoopers previously and we are going to 
have a witness from PwC testify tomorrow.  That was “Thoroughbred 
Breeders’ Association of South Africa vs Price Waterhouse 1999 (4) SA 
10 
968 (W)” as it was then. 
Chair, it is an important incident of the responsibility that 
Auditors bear when they audit companies to both be independent as a 
matter of fact, but also to be seen to be independent.  In colloquial 
audit speak that is referred to as having independence of mind and 
independence of appearance and both are essential to the proper 
discharge of their functions. 
Chair, there have been calls for this Commission within its 
investigations to look at the role that Auditors have played within the 
public sector in particular and the calls originate from an appreciation 
20 
that they play a role of watchdog and if there are acts of State Capture, 
Corruption and Fraud taking place in those institutions. 
The legitimate question that maybe asked is well what role 
did Auditors play and what responsibilities may they have had to 
identify what was going on and it is for that reason Chair that we 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 16 of 146 
 
propose over the next two days to investigate this role insofar as it 
related to the SSA Group of Companies. 
Chair, the evidence that we will present in the next two days 
will explain that State Owned Entities are by default in terms of the law 
to be audited by the Auditor-General.  However where there are 
occasions where an external audit firm can be appointed to audit a 
State Owned Enterprise. 
Where that happens it requires the concurrence of the 
Auditor-General and I think it would be fair to say, but Mr Sokombela, 
who is our witness soon will be the expert on this.  It may be fair to say 
10 
that when external audit firms play this role they stand in the shoes or 
the place of the Auditor-General who would otherwise by law be doing 
the audit as a matter of default. 
Chair, as a consequence of their role in State Owned 
Enterprises Auditors have additional responsibilities to those which 
they bear when they audit private companies and those additional 
responsibilities include amongst other things an obligation to assess 
whether State Owned Enterprises have complied with their PFMA 
obligations insofar as that may have an impact on the audit that they 
conduct and so we propose to explore in the next two days the role that 
20 
PwC and Nkonki Incorporated played when they were doing the joint 
audit of SAA for the financial years between 2012 and 2016 and the 
question that will be posed is whether in the course of that audit work 
they properly discharged their obligations. 
We will ask that question because after they had completed 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 17 of 146 
 
their five years of audit work and had given SAA clean audits each year 
from 2012 to 2016.  The Auditor-General stepped in and took over the 
audit in 2017 and found the finances of SAA and its group in a state 
that can only be described as shambolic. 
Chair, we will present the evidence of two witnesses.  The 
first will be Mr Polani Sokombela who is a Business Executive in the 
office of the Auditor-General and after that we will be presenting the 
evidence of Mr Pole Motibe who was the audit partner from PwC who 
was assigned to the SAA audit for the years 2014 to 2016.  Chair, we 
propose to explore the following in their evidence:  Mr Sokombela will 
10 
provide a background for how audits of SOE’s are supposed to be 
conducted with reference to the relevant legislation and the applicable 
auditing standards. 
He will also enlighten the Commission on what the Auditor-
General found when it moved into SAA to conduct the audit for the 2017 
financial year and after Mr Sokombela we will present the evidence of 
Mr Motibe of PwC and we will explore the following questions with 
Mr Motibe:  first, we will traverse with him the fact that except for the 
first year of PwC and Nkonki’s appointment as Auditors of SAA. 
In all four subsequent years they were appointed without any 
20 
procurement process having been followed.  This occurred at a time 
against the advice of the Bid Adjudication Committee of SAA and at a 
time when a legal opinion had been obtained indicating that a failure to 
follow a procurement process before appointing Auditors would be 
unlawful. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 18 of 146 
 
Their own appointment on the basis of those facts therefore 
constituted irregular expenditure for four solid years, but it was never 
disclosed as such in the financial statements of the SAA Group.  We 
will then explore why it was that PwC and Nkonki both had joint 
business relationships and made payments to another auditing firm 
known as Kwinana & Associates during their audit work for SAA. 
Now Chair, Kwinana & Associates was the auditing firm of 
Ms Yakhe Kwinana who was one of the Non-Executive Board Members 
at SAA during the period that PwC and Nkonki were appointed as 
Auditors and she was also the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee of 
10 
SAA and in that role she would approve the audit fees to be paid to the 
Auditors in each successive year. 
We will explore why not one of the significant transactions 
that have been dealt with previously in the evidence before this 
Commission and which there are indications may have involved Fraud, 
corruption and elements of State Capture were not identified by the 
Auditors in that period as a possible reportable irregularity and finally 
we will probe how it could be that PwC and Nkonki gave clean audits to 
SAA for those five years when they audited the group. 
Only then to reach a situation where the Auditor-General 
20 
moved in and in 2017 found a situation that was so dire that a qualified 
audit had to be given and a restatement of the previous years of 
account.  Chair that is just an introduction to what we propose to deal 
with in the next two days.  With your leave ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 19 of 146 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to hand over to Mr Mbikiwa. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much 
for 
that 
introduction 
Ms Hofmeyr.  Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, I intend to proceed 
straight into the evidence of Mr Sokombela.  So I would ask if he could 
please be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Polani Sokombela. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth?  If so please raise 
your right hand and say so help me God. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, to start with can I 
20 
ask that Mr Sokombela’s affidavit and its annexures be admitted as 
DD20A to DD20D? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Polani Sokombela’s affidavit will be marked 
annexure or Exhibit DD20A.  Now you have got B, C ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And D, Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 20 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to D, but those are annexures to the affidavit.  
They are not separate ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Affidavits? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be confusing to do them like that.  Maybe 
because they are in different lever arch files, maybe 20 – how have we 
done this before? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, my understanding is that we have 
done it in this way.  Where the affidavit and annexures have gone over 
10 
a file.  The next file has become the same number, but A, B, C, D 
etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure we have done it like that, but for some 
reason this morning something seems wrong about doing it that way. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA: 
 
Chair, 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
that 
another 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see when you say DD20A that least this morning.  
I do not know about other days in the past – this morning.  That seems 
like an exhibit on its own.  When you say Exhibit DD20B that sounds 
like an exhibit – a separate exhibit on its own. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  C, D and so on.  Whereas the idea is that it is one 
exhibit with annexures.  I do not know how I am thinking this morning. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  Chair, I am not sure what to suggest 
...(intervenes). 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 21 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Because it will of course be necessary to 
refer to the different files in the course of ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us hear Ms Hofmeyr who has led quite a lot 
of – might be able to tell me that there is something wrong with me this 
morning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not at all Chair.  Chair, can I say we have 
previously where we have had annexures that extend beyond one file.  
In order for us to be able to navigate which file you need to have in 
front of you or the witness needs to.  We have allocated a B, C and D. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that we have certainly done previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes and it has worked well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It has, because only to assist us in identifying 
which file to place in front of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It has occurred to me though that one way we 
may do it is for the purposes of entering it into the record we could 
enter it as Exhibit 20 which will run with an affidavit and annexures 
commencing page 1 ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we give the indication of the last 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that would be how it is entered into the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 22 of 146 
 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For convenience here ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We could pull out B, C and D just so that we 
know which file should be in front of us ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I actually do not know if that will 
complicate things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well one would not like to depart from how we have 
10 
done it in the past. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have entered it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Really there is a problem. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your feeling is that maybe we could stick to how we 
have done it in the past. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just provided when we enter it into the record 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We indicate that the A file contains the affidavit 
...(intervenes). 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 23 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And annexures ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then B, C and D ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Continue to contain the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexures, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that would probably be best. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You want me to explain it like that.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Thank 
you 
Ms Hofmeyr. 
 
The 
affidavit 
of 
Mr Polani Sokombela and its annexures will be admitted and marked as 
follows:  the affidavit itself and annexures which are in the same file as 
that affidavit will be marked Exhibit 20A.  The exhibits in – how many 
other lever arch files? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  There are three others, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three others.  There are three other lever arch files 
all of which contain annexures to Mr Polani Sokombela’s affidavit.  
20 
Those files will be admitted and marked Exhibit DD20B, 20C and 20D.  
They are annexures to Exhibit 20A.  I hope that takes care of it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela, you have provided the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 24 of 146 
 
Commission with a detailed affidavit and extensive annexures.  
However with the Chair’s leave and subject to his direction.  I intend to 
focus in your oral evidence today with those issues that are relevant 
from an auditing perspective to identifying and preventing Fraud, 
Corruption and State Capture and also on those issues where your 
experience and expertise can assist in shedding light.  Can you begin 
by telling us what your qualifications are? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  My qualifications are I am a 
qualified Chartered Accountant. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And your tertiary education? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  My tertiary education I have got a BCom Degree 
and then I have got Honours in Accountancy or they call it a Certificate 
in the theory of Accounting and then I wrote then my Board Exams with 
SAICA and then I wrote then my Public Practice Examinations with the 
Independent Regulatory Board for IRBA for Auditors.  I am sorry Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you and what is your position? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, my current position – I am the Business 
Executive in the Auditor-General of South Africa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what positions have you held previously 
in the Auditor-General? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, the positions that I have had previously in 
the 
Auditor-General 
– 
I 
actually 
started 
my 
career 
at 
the 
Auditor-General as a trainee accountant and after finishing my articles 
and also finalising my qualification exams.  Then I was promoted to be 
an Assistant Manager and as I was gaining experience then Chair.  
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 25 of 146 
 
Then I became a Manager and Senior Manager and then now then that I 
am a Business Executive. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  How many years have you been at the 
Auditor-General? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, I have been with the Auditor-General – this is 
the 14 t h year. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you and can you tell us what your 
involvement was in the South African Airways audit? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, my involvement in the audit of South African 
Airways initially it started when the South African Airways was moved 
10 
from the Department of Public Enterprises to National Treasury.  I think 
it was somewhere around 2015, if I am not mistaken.  I think there were 
challenges as far as SAA is concerned and at the time then SAA was 
moved. 
The Business Unit within the Auditor-General that I am – that 
I am currently a Business Executive for is responsible for among others 
the audit of National Treasury and at the time I was a Senior Manager 
also overseeing the portfolio at the time and then I became involved 
then as – when SAA was not audited by us, but was still audited by the 
private sector firms i.e. PwC as well as Nkonki and Chair after then the 
20 
Auditor-General then was appointed for the 2016/2017 financial year. 
Then I became involved as the Senior Manager responsible or 
the Engagement Manager, what do you call, for the audit of South 
African Airways.  As the person then that is responsible and also 
accountable in terms of delivering the audit report of SAA.  So that was 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 26 of 146 
 
my involvement, Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  If we pick it up at your affidavit 
on page 4.  You deal there with the mandate of the Auditor-General.  
Can you tell us what that mandate is? 
MR SOKOMBELA: 
 
Chair, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
get 
...(intervenes). 
...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I apologise.  I should have said at the outset 
we will be beginning in your file marked DD20A which contains your 
affidavit.  When I refer you to page numbers?  I am referring you to the 
numbers in red on the top right-hand corner and we are at page 4 and 
10 
you deal from paragraph 6 with the mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if he did not have his file in front of him.  It 
seems to me that we might not have asked him to confirm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So you might have to do that first. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela, can I ask you to turn back to 
page 1 and can you confirm that that is the affidavit you provided to the 
Commission? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I confirm, Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if you turn to page 42.  Is that your 
signature under – where it says deponent? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair.  That is my signature. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you confirm that the contents of the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 27 of 146 
 
affidavit are true and correct? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I confirm, Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  You were about to tell us about 
the AG’s mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is on page 4. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is on page 4. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, the Auditor-General of 
South Africa is a supreme audit institution of the Republic of South 
Africa.  Its mandate stems from Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the 
Republic of 1996 herein referred to as the Constitution.  Which means 
10 
that it exits to support the constitutional democracy. 
The Auditor-General is independent.  Subject only to the 
Constitution and the law and must be impartial in exercising its function 
with fear, favour of prejudice.  The Auditor-General accounts to the 
National Assembly by tabling its annual report in Parliament. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you Mr Sokombela is the Auditor-
General required to audit an entity such as SAA? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, the Auditor-General is – in terms of the 
Public Audit Act there is a section there that is called – that is Section 
4(3) and Chair Section 4(3) then is a section that ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four – 4(3) would four – Section 4(3)? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Subsection 3.  In terms of Section 4(3) of the Public 
Audit Act the Auditor-General is empowered to audit South African 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 28 of 146 
 
Airways.  Ja.  So that is the answer, Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You say it is empowered.  My question is 
whether it is required? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Required in this case means obliged. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, the Auditor-General is not obliged.  The 
Auditor-General can make a discretion – has got a discretion whether 
he can audit South African Airways or whether he can opt out. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you and what the kinds of factors that 
the Auditor-General would consider in deciding whether to audit an 
entity itself or to opt out? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, there are many factors that the Auditor-
General will – would consider.  I think one of the key factors for an 
example is the capacity.  Is whether the Auditor-General has got the 
capacity and  the technical expertise to audit that particular entity or 
not and one of the most important things then is to ensure then that we 
have got the right people – they are the right people that will audit, 
because these – some of the State Owned Entities can be very complex 
and very technical. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  So capacity is one issue.  Is – are 
there any others that you – that the Auditor-General would consider 
20 
before deciding whether to take on the task of auditing a particular 
entity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair.  I think one of the key one is skills and 
capacity and also there may be other factors that the Auditor-General 
may deem appropriate depending on him. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 29 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you say skills and capacity.  You look at the 
two as separate factors.  Is that right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and as far as capacity is concerned when you use 
capacity in this context do you mean enough people? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To do the job? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you refer to the skills you are referring to 
people who have – who may have particular skills that are required in a 
10 
particular entity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Before we talk about the role 
and the duties that Auditors both private Auditors and the AG bear.  I 
would like to ask you about something that is not addressed in your 
affidavit which is about the – because we are talking here about State 
Owned Entities.  What are State Owned Entities required to do 
internally from an audit perspective? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Okay.  Maybe they need to clarify further Chair in 
20 
terms of when you are saying internally.  What does that mean? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am talking about the internal audit function 
of State-Owned Entities. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 30 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you very much Chair.  Chair, in terms of the 
Public Finance Management Act the – and one of the governance 
requirements is that the State-Owned Entity is supposed to have an 
internal audit function that is fully capacitated with skilled people and 
also that reports to the Audit Committee functionally.  Yes.  So that is 
the requirements, Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And because it is something we are going to 
come to later.  What is meant by the term “internal controls”? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, the words “internal controls” in simple terms 
– if I may simplify it, Chair is basically the controls to actually ensure 
10 
then that the financial administration of the entity is at the right level.  
I.e. you have got policies and procedures.  You have got the Standard 
Operating Procedures internally to ensure then that when transactions 
are done they are done in a manner that will not, you know, will not 
actually cause wastage or will not cause fraud. 
I think an example that I can give is that for an example if 
you are purchasing the bottle of water in an entity.  The person that 
orders – that places an order and the person that approves the 
transaction and the person that pays ideally for the internal controls to 
be at least – to be believable is – needs to be separate people. 
20 
For example you need to have segregation of duties, because 
if it is one person that will buy that bottle.  There is a risk that the 
person may not actually buy a bottle.  Might buy something else or 
maybe the money might go somewhere else.  So that might be my 
simple explanation. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 31 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is simple.  It is basically measures.  Internal 
measures taken by the entity to ensure that from a financial point of 
view things are done properly? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  I would like now to move to the 
role of External Auditors.  You deal with that on page 6 of your 
affidavit.  I refer you to your affidavit simply to orientate you.  Can you 
tell us what the role is that External Auditors play for State Owned 
Entities and elaborate on the importance of that role? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chairperson, the role of External Auditors in the 
context of State-Owned Entities is to provide the independent 
assurance to the users of the annual report or the financial statements 
of that State-Owned Entities.  The users include those that are charged 
with governance and actually ensure then that also provider assurance 
on performance information. 
Also 
provide 
assurance 
also 
on 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations to ensure then that there is compliance with those laws and 
regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When reference is made to External Auditors in this 
20 
context we know the AG’s external to all the entities, but is it included 
when you use External Auditor in this case – in this context or External 
Auditors is meant to refer in this context to private Auditors? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chairperson, it is – even the private sector Auditors 
in the context that I have explained in terms of what their roles are is 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 32 of 146 
 
the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I accept that you are referring to them.  What 
I am not sure about is whether you are also including the 
Auditor-General or whether what you have just said does not apply 
necessarily to the Auditor-General.  You are referring to or focusing on 
the private firms or whether that’s meant to include the Auditor-General 
as well. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   That includes the Auditor-General Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you, certainly Chair in the legislation 
10 
when it refers to private firms it uses the word private. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.    
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr Sokombela I would like to pick up on 
something you say on page 7 at paragraph 15 of your affidavit.   You 
say there that an audit does not provide absolute assurance, can you 
explain what you mean by that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the audit – the reason why we’re saying the 
audits does not provide an absolute assurance is the fact that there are 
many factors like for an example the audit evidence on itself is you 
know you may find out that we are not always at the audit or at the 
20 
client at times.  The people that are always at the client is 
Management, or those people that are charged with managing the 
entity, so – and even how we plan and approach our audits we don’t 
test everything Chairperson, we normally select a sample because at 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 33 of 146 
 
times it can be very – it can impractical for us as Auditors to come and 
test for everything.  
 
So there is that chance that there may be something that the 
Auditors will leave so even in our wording we are very careful in terms 
of how we actually put – that is why then it becomes our own audit 
opinion and we like using words like “in our judgment”, it is our 
judgment to actually ensure then that you know we have not seen, just 
rely 100% in terms of what we do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      You mentioned that you don’t look at 
everything within the business and you look at samples, how do you 
10 
determine a sample? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair how do you determine a sample 
...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure whether you seek to say how they 
select the samples. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed Chair, thank you, I am indebted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how do you decide on what samples to look at? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Thank you Chair.  Chair we’ve got I think the 
auditing standards because the sampling is a scientifically tested 
method where in a set of population an Auditor based on the 
20 
understanding of the population itself, for example I will give you an 
example on let’s say I am testing whether the revenue that the NDT is 
reporting I am testing whether then the revenue is really valid revenue. 
 
Then what then we normally do is that then based on the 
understanding of that entity then we’ve got tools then that we have 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 34 of 146 
 
when then they will determine in terms of then how do then do I select 
then the sample size. 
 
For an example other firms will have their own methodologies, 
for example the Auditor-General the minimum sample for instance that 
we test is 30 items and then depending then on the magnitude of or the 
size of that particular population it can go up you know because the 
most important thing is to ensure then that you get sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence. 
 
So it is scientifically tested – it is a scientifically tested 
method so that is basically, it is as simple as like that to say if I go to, 
10 
if there is a population for revenue for an example then I will then 
based on the audit methodology then determine then whether then how 
much samples should be selected, and that is based on the audit 
methodology basically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You talk about population of revenue, please explain 
that some of us need to be educated on the – on Auditors.  
MR SOKOMBELA:   Thank you Chair, I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no you use language that you are used 
to. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chair.   Chair when I am talking about the 
20 
population for example if I am selling vetkoek for R2 each you then find 
out then that in a day then 20 vetkoeks will be sold.  Then I will record 
then in my books that each – for each transaction I have received R2 
and those transactions will be 20 transactions.  Then that 20 – those 20 
transactions then it becomes a population. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 35 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, right thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      Mr Sokombela another thing you say at 
paragraph 15 is that External Auditors do not audit to identify and 
report on fraud and corruption.   But the audit processes could identify 
a possible fraud and corruption which should be reported to 
Management.  Can you explain what you mean by that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the objectives of the audit process is to 
express fair presentation of the financial statements, and also to 
identify if there are any material findings in compliance with legislation 
and also to identify whether there are any also significant findings on 
10 
performance information or the key performance indicators in the 
annual report. 
 
So that is basically so then the objectives of the Audit process.   
However as explained here in paragraph 15 in the quest then of testing 
and of auditing we may come across on issues of corruption and then 
when you come across then with those issues of corruption then we 
report them to those charged with governance for further investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I wanted to ask you earlier, let me ask you now, 
the tools you use to select the samples that you are going to look at 
how much room do they leave for an Auditor to miss something quite 
20 
critical that later on people might look at and say but how could he 
have missed it.   How much room do those tools that you use leave for 
that kind of thing, or should one understand that those tools enable you 
to select samples that will lead you to something that is critical if really 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 36 of 146 
 
there is something critical you have missed the fault is not with the 
tools it is with you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Thank you very much Chairperson, that is a very 
good one.  Chair before we go and decide with SAMBO to select I think 
the steps that perhaps maybe I should have talked about it is the duty 
of the Auditors to perform rigorous risk assessment processes, because 
it is important and it is – for the Auditors to actually ensure then that 
they obtain an understanding of the entity’s environment and to also in 
the process also be able then to project in terms of which transactions 
or which issues might pose a risk in the audit process. 
10 
 
So Chairperson that process then gives you then an 
opportunity then to say when I am going then to select my sample if 
they have identified that there are issues of risk that I have already 
identified in my risk assessment processes, I will also go and identify 
those issues and put them separately, and then I will test those ones 
specifically, we call that a specific selection, we are not using a sample 
there, you know. 
 
Chairperson we use a sample then when the remaining 
population to say what is remaining, this is the remainder but let’s just 
test then this remainder. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Ja, but it is incumbent then to ask as Auditors to 
ensure then that we perform those risk assessments to identify where 
the problems might be. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 37 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.   Now – excuse me, would the rigorous 
exercise that you talked about that an Auditor would need to do before 
going in, into an entity, would that include in the case of an SOE for 
example checking news about the entity in the public domain, what is 
being said about it, for example there have been articles about 
corruption about a certain contract, and certain tenders that’s been in 
the news and then collect those and put them together and then say 
when I go in I want to find out about these.   Would that include 
something like that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chairperson it will include something 
10 
like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  Chair I see it’s 11:15, it 
might be an appropriate time for the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will take the short adjournment and we will 
resume at 11:30.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s continue. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      Thank you Chair.  Chair I can confirm that 
over the break our Bundling Team has attended to the proper 
arrangement of those files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      Thank you.  Mr Sokombela, just before 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 38 of 146 
 
the adjournment we were talking about External Auditors identifying 
fraud and corrupting and you indicated that while that’s not the 
objective, they can do so in the course of an audit.  Can you help me 
with a few concepts?  Can you tell me what irregular expenditure is? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair irregular expenditure is an expenditure 
where it has been occurred, however, in the course of it being incurred 
there was non-compliance with the legislation.  In most instances the 
PFMA. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   An irregularity in the context of an irregular 
10 
expenditure is not confined to a process – to a legal process is that 
right or is it confined to a process? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair it is confined to a process Chair, if I may 
Chair, just to make an example, a simple example will be that the PFMA 
might say, when you’re purchasing goods and services you need to 
obtain three quotations, but if an official of an entity then didn’t go and 
obtain three quotations then – but then only sourced one quotation, 
then that expenditure then will be become irregular because the official 
ought to have invited three quotations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying it doesn’t speak – irregular 
20 
expenditure doesn’t speak to whether the funds were used for the 
purpose for which they were supposed to be used.  In other words, if I 
take R10 000 of the entity and use it to buy a computer but I followed 
the right process in terms of tenders or whatever but I’m using it to buy 
a computer when it was meant to be used to do something else, that 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 39 of 146 
 
would not fall under irregular expenditure it would fall under something 
else, or would it – because that’s not the process that’s using it for a 
wrong purpose or is it regarded as process? 
MR SOKOMBELA:     Chair in the example that you gave, if the monies 
were intended for something else but were utilised for something else, 
if the due process was followed i.e. those that have initially approved 
that this money is for something else, but when then the change was 
made, there was due process in terms of the approvals that were made 
and there was no non-compliance that was identified, that may not be 
irregular expenditure, however, if these monies were intended for 
10 
something else but were utilised for something else and there was no 
approval for that, it may become irregular expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what if the right – what if nobody’s supposed to 
approve that this money be used for something else and nobody has 
approved that it be used for something else but it has been used for 
something else, would it fall under irregular expenditure or would it fall 
under something else? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   If there’s no legislation Chairperson that regulates 
the utilisation of that money it may not be irregular expenditure it may 
be something else. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and is there a particular heading under which it 
would fall as far as you know, or not necessarily, in terms of a job’s 
Auditor.  If I use money for something that it should not be used for, I 
use it to buy my – well maybe I shouldn’t make an example that might 
confuse further.  So in other words, if it’s – if – what the money is used 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 40 of 146 
 
for is not the lawful purpose for it, I don’t know whether I should say 
authorised purpose, the normal – there’s no normal label that it would 
fall under or the normal label would be irregular expenditure? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair it – depending for an example if the money is 
not utilised for the benefit of the entity itself it may become then 
classified as fruitless and wasteful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   That’s another concept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, so – but that concept looks at whether the 
purpose for which the money used added any value to the entity, is that 
10 
right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you, I was indeed about to go to 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure, so that’s helpful.  Mr Sokombela, 
would you agree that – then that while irregular expenditure and 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure is not always because of fraud and 
corruption, they can be indicators that fraud and corruption has taken 
place in an entity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chair I agree, hence in our approach, once we 
20 
identify irregular expenditure we always recommend to Management 
and those charged with governance to investigate. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be a correct understanding of these two 
concepts, irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 41 of 146 
 
to say the fruitless and wasteful expenditure is the more serious – is 
more serious than irregular expenditure, generally speaking? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the fruitless and wasteful expenditure is 
where it’s confirmed that there’s no value added to the entity, however, 
on irregular expenditure as well an investigation might reveal that in 
actual fact there was no value that was added. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I want to establish is that, on the fact of it 
when somebody says a certain entity or Government department had 
irregular expenditure amounting to R50 million the picture that the 
citizenry should have should not necessarily be that money was wasted 
10 
because the process might have been not right but whatever was done 
might have added value and may have needed to be done, it’s just that 
it was not – the right process wasn’t followed, whereas with fruitless 
and expenditure – fruitless and wasteful expenditure I would imagine 
that the citizenry should say, so these people have wasted our money.  
So in other words, without going further, once the Auditor-General says 
its fruitless and wasteful expenditure, aren’t we entitled to say these 
people have wasted tax payers money, whereas, with irregular 
expenditure it might simply mean that – not that they wasted money but 
that they didn’t follow correct processes but sometimes in not following 
20 
correct processes they might be corruption and so on but sometimes 
there might be no corruption, it might just be failure to follow 
processes, is my understanding right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chairperson you’ve actually unpacked it very 
well. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 42 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you, the final concept I’d like to ask 
you about is a reportable irregularity, what do you understand a 
reportable irregularity to be?  
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, the reportable irregularity is a concept in the 
Auditing Professions Act where there may be certain transactions that 
may lend themselves to plausible or in comfort explanations where 
there may be non-compliance that has been committed by a person 
responsible for the Management of the entity itself and the duties then 
of the Auditor, then in that instance, is to immediately write to the 
10 
Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors and the details of that 
reportable irregularity and also then, the Auditor then is also required, 
within 3 days, of identifying that irregularity and reporting it to the 
Independent Regulatory Board to also then report to Management and 
those types of governance and also should give them the opportunity to 
explain whether then this really is a reportable irregularity and I think 
one concept that I forgot here to explain, Chair, is that for it to be a 
irregularity there should be a material financial loss that has been 
incurred by the entity, there should also be a breach of fiduciary duties 
by those that are charged with governance in the entity and in my 
20 
explanation Chair, I said then the Auditor should provide then an 
opportunity then to those charged with governance to – one is to 
actually just to give comfort to the Auditor whether the Auditor was 
correct to say this is a reportable irregularity and submit information to 
the Auditor and based then on that information then the law then – I 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 43 of 146 
 
think it’s actually Section 45 of the Auditing Professions Act, it requires 
then within 30 days the Auditor to report back to the Independent 
Regulatory Board.  It’s either then – when they’re reporting back they 
need to specify whether, in their opinion that, no in actual fact there is 
no reportable irregularity and that would be in a case where maybe the 
Auditor is satisfied with the explanation of the entity or also the other 
important thing is that it may not – it may be taking place or it may be 
continuing, then the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors can 
continue then with their own processes to deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you could just repeat for me what the essential 
10 
features of the reportable irregularities are, if you are able to.  In other 
words, how does somebody see that the this is a reportable 
irregularity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair for it to be reportable irregularity, there 
should be non-compliance or there should be fraud, or there should be 
theft and also this should have resulted in a material financial loss to 
the entity or suspected – it can also be a suspected financial material 
loss and also, I think, what is also important is that this loss should be 
to the entity itself or it can be to the shareholder or it can be to the 
employees or to other stakeholders of the entity itself.  So those are 
20 
the critical features and also, I think, one other key issue, the issue be 
committed by somebody that is in Management or maybe in the Board 
of Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR SOKOMBELA:   So I think those are the essential features. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 44 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay and theft and fraud, at that level they 
should be – it’s fine if they are suspected not necessarily – the person 
shouldn’t necessarily be sure that they have been committed or should 
they be sure that as far as they are concerned, there has been theft 
and there has been fraud or if they suspect there’s enough? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair you’re quite right, if they suspect, as long as 
there are indicators to a person that something might be happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      Thank you Chair.  Can I ask, what are the 
sorts of documentation that you’re looking at in order to identify 
10 
irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure?  The 
Chair asked before the break about external documents in the media, 
and you confirmed that that is something to which you would pay 
attention.  What about things within the entity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Chair, I think, the key issue – maybe I must just 
explain in terms of how we got to – maybe how do we get to the issue 
of identifying, maybe the irregular expenditure itself.  I think I’ve 
mentioned, I think, in the opening remarks, the issue of the risk 
assessment process and if you remember Chair, it’s when then you 
asked if maybe we do consider the media and stuff but the most 
20 
important thing that – when we’re doing that risk assessment process is 
to document a business process and when documenting that business 
process is to ensure then that the processes of the entity also are 
aligned to legislation.  One of the most critical things that we look at is 
the Supply Chain Management bodies of the entity because the Supply 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 45 of 146 
 
Chain Management policy of the entity needs to comply with Section 51 
of the Public Finance Management Act which Section 51, also is 
derived from Section 217 of the Constitution where the procurement 
process should be fair, equitable, transparent, and competitive.  So we 
do then that business process, we’re looking the Supply Chain 
Management policy, we also in the process, look at allegations of fraud 
that has been made.  What are the allegations of fraud that have been 
made to the entity, we look in terms of then the controls, in terms of 
then their people that are scaled, for example, in that Supply Chain 
Management division, is the capacity of the Supply Chain Management 
10 
division there and also we even do the walk through?  You know let’s 
say just do the walk through to find out if things are happening in the 
ground like they are saying is happening, their policies and procedures.  
So those are the things then that we are looking into, then we will – 
then based on that process, I think I’ve mentioned the media, based on 
that process then we’ll be able to identify those high risk transactions 
that we’ll have to look into them and then the rest then of the 
population then will test it as part of the tender processes.   
 
So those are the things – that is then the process then that we 
follow.  The documents, then that we look into for example, look at 
20 
tender files, we look at tender files or if it’s the quotation processes we 
look at quotations, the invoices, we basically re-perform what 
Management was doing, that’s basically what we do.  We re-perform it 
and in re-performing the work that has been done by Management in 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 46 of 146 
 
terms of their own policies and procedures, we then looking whether 
then there was – they actually complied or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess when you – maybe one of the benefits of re-
performing the task is that you will see whether you arrive at the same 
outcome or result as them and if the result you come to is vastly 
different from that of Management you may decide that maybe 
something needs to be looked into further, is that right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair and the other important thing that 
I mentioned, when we’re re-performing we design procedures.  We 
design our own procedures to say based on that understanding of that 
10 
process, to say okay the process is like this, so when we are testing 
tenders there are then the procedures that we’re going to – that is 
going to execute and then the outcomes then of those procedures are 
the ones then that tells us whether Management has followed their own 
processes or not and also whether they have complied with the law or 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you do that, namely re-performing the 
tasks that Management expected to have performed does it – is it easy 
to pick up if there’s been a manipulation of the functions of anything or 
is that not necessarily easy.  Take for example, in terms of tender 
20 
processes, if somebody has interfered with description of goods to be 
supplied or services in order to favour a particular company which 
might end up bidding and so on, is that something that’s easy to do – to 
pick up when you re-perform or that might be difficult? 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 47 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair it’s not easily, it’s very difficult Chair 
because us, as Auditors we always talk about the inherent limitations of 
the Audit process because the Audit process is persuasive than 
conclusive because things that are done behind the scenes because us 
as Auditors, we’re not there.  Things that are done then behind the 
scenes, and if Management is very clever and ensure then that the 
documentation and everything is done properly, we may not be able to 
identify if there was no – if there was any manipulation of things or not.  
So that is inherent in the process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay thank you.    
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:      Thank you, Mr Sokombela I’d like to move 
on to the duties that apply to Auditors, External Auditors, you deal with 
that at page 8 of your affidavit.  I see there at paragraph 16 in fact that 
Chair, answers the question you had earlier where it says the external 
Audit of public entities is performed either by the AGSA or by a private 
Audit file. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   So external includes both private and the 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Can you tell us Mr Sokombela, how the 
requirements differ for the AG and private firms, if they do at all? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair there is no difference in terms of the 
requirements between the private Audit Firms and the public Audit 
Firms, however, I think I just want to qualify my statement in the sense 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 48 of 146 
 
that, in the public sector or in government there is more focus on 
compliance with legislation, however, in the private sector the focus is 
whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the financial reporting framework.  So I think, to answer you’re the 
question Chair, is that we all adhere to the same auditing standards, 
we all audit the same financial statements for example, in the case of 
South African Airways, how they are auditing South African Airways is 
not different to how the private sector firms ought to have audited 
South African Airways. 
CHAIRPERSON:      But would it not be true that what you referred to 
10 
as public Audit Firms government firms the AG, there will be much more 
experience – they will be much more experienced with checking 
compliance with legal prescripts that are applicable to public entities 
than would private firms because private firms insofar as maybe most 
of their clients are private companies, they might not be dealing a lot 
with pieces of legislation such as PFMA and whatever, whatever, so in 
terms of experience would public Audit Firms not be more experienced 
in that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the Auditor-General will be more experienced 
than the private sector firms as far as compliance – testing compliance 
20 
is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But I guess nevertheless, any Auditor from a private 
Audit Firm who accepts the job of auditing a public entity would be 
expected to familiarise himself or herself properly with what the AG’s 
Office would do in performing such a task and make sure that the fact 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 49 of 146 
 
that they are a private firm should make no difference in terms of being 
able to pick up what the AG’s Office would have picked up? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair and also we work a lot with the 
private firms. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes, yes because of the capacity issues as well, 
they do perform some of our audits, so I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you think that I should approach the matter 
of private Audit Firms performing auditing for public entities on the 
basis that for all intents and purposes there is – there should be no 
difference in how they audit public entities and how the AG audits those 
10 
entities, I can judge them by the same standard? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you.  Mr Sokombela if you then turn 
over to page 9 and you deal here with instances where the AG opts not 
to perform the audit of a public entity, what broadly are the duties of 
private Audit Firms in that circumstance? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, I think the most important thing is that when 
the private Audit Firms are auditing entities that the Auditor-General 
has opted not to audit, then the duties then and responsibilities of the 
20 
private Audit Firms there are responsibilities that are legislated and 
assigned, you know, to the Public Audit Act, I think it’s part two of 
chapter three of the Public Audit Act and the most important thing is 
that that Auditor that is doing the audit of the public entity, the most 
important thing is that – they need to take note of the content of the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 50 of 146 
 
Public Audit Act and must adhere to the requirements that are – for 
example the appointment of Auditors in terms of Section 25 of the 
Public Audit Act, that appointment must be in accordance with that 
requirement Chairperson and also the discharge of the Auditors, also 
must comply with the process that is prescribed in Section 26 of the 
Public Audit Act and the Auditor must comply with the duties ascribed 
and may use the powers that are provided for in Section 27 of the 
Public Audit Act.   
The most important thing also is that the format and content of 
the Auditor’s report Chair, must adhere to the requirements of Section 
10 
28 sub paragraph 1 and sub paragraph 2 of the Public Audit Act read 
with the Auditor-General of South Africa’s reporting guide.  The 
reporting guide is attached to my affidavit as PS2 and the Auditors’ 
report template, we’ve got a Auditors’ report template as the Auditor-
General that we use, the private audit firms are actually required to use 
that template Chairperson, it’s also attached to my affidavit as PS3 and 
also we’ve got guidance – guidelines as well that the Auditor-General 
published and these guidelines, in our website Chairperson and also 
we’ve got relationships with these firms as well because we also gave 
them – if there’s a guide that comes from our technical department we 
20 
submit that to them.   
The Auditors’ report also that has been signed, also it should 
be submitted to the auditing, it should also be submitted to the Minister 
– the relevant Minister, if there is a Minister and also Auditor-General 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 51 of 146 
 
and National Treasury in accordance with Section 28 sub paragraph 3 
of the Public Audit Act. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And what broadly, is the role of the 
Auditor-General in the circumstances where the Auditor-General opts 
not to do the audit, does it play any role when a private Audit Firm 
carries out the audit of a public entity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the role that we play as the Auditor-General is 
for us to say we are there if you need us.  We do offer to attend Audit 
Committees, we attend Audit Committees when for an example there are 
certain technical things for an – especially when it comes to compliance 
10 
issues, and also issues related to the audit of performance information.  
We offer ourselves to say we are available, because what we do not want 
is for the firms to feel that maybe they alone you know, in that.  So that is 
basically then the role that we play.  We do not want to step in their toes 
as Auditors, because these are professionals, you know they are they are 
qualified professionals in their right so we very careful as the Audit Office 
then in terms of then how then do we play that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When the AG’s Office opts out, does it then fall upon 
the SOE for example or Government Department to get private – a private 
audit firm or is it the AG’s Office which says because I am opting out I am 
20 
going to appoint a private auditing firm to then perform the function that I 
would otherwise have performed if I did not opt out? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, once the Auditor-General opts out of the – 
from auditing that specific State Owned Entity then the Auditor-General 
then would not appoint the Auditor, would leave then the appointment to 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 52 of 146 
 
the Board and the Shareholder and however before that appointment is 
officiated then in terms of the Public Audit Act then a concurrence of the 
Auditor-General is required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  So, in a way nobody can – no private 
firm can go and audit a Public Entity without the Auditor-General having 
said it is fine? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and would the Audit-General’s Office, would there 
be circumstances where the Audit-General’s Office would say we are not 
happy to concur, maybe for example because they look at the firm and 
10 
they do not think that it has got the skills and capacity to do this function 
in a particular entity, or do they always concur? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   There are times Chair where the Auditor-General may 
not concur but in most instances, I think it is very few chances, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, most of the time it will concur? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair, I do intend to deal with the 
process of that concurrence and indeed with an occasion when that 
concurrence was not given in the context of the SAA Audit.  Mr 
20 
Sokombela can I take you to the directive that you have attached to your 
affidavit?  It is at page 141.  This is the directive issued in terms of the 
Public Audit Act.  Are you there?  Sorry your microphone is not on. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   I am there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can keep it on throughout. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 53 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr Sokombela I would like you to turn to page 
163 of that document. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   I am there Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you tell us what this is? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair this is the monitoring checklist for audits not 
conducted by the Auditor-General of South Africa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And if we go through that checklist, it is what 
you describe as a monitoring checklist, it – in the second table, lists 
various requirements under the Public Audit Act, if you go over the page 
to 164 it lists further requirements under the Public Audit Act, and then 
10 
there is a conclusion at the bottom and where it is indicated whether 
further requirements are complied with or not.  If you turn over to 165, at 
the bottom it then says evaluated by AGSA Business Executive Senior 
Manager.  So, you indicated earlier that the AG lets the audit firm get on 
with it, but it does seem there is an element of monitoring and oversight 
that takes place, is that fair? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And just explain to me at what stage in the 
auditing process this gets completed and submitted?   
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, the – this checklist gets submitted normally at 
20 
the end of the audit process, when the audit report has been signed and 
it gets signed by the engagement partner that is responsible from the 
firm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who would be the engagement partner in a firm, is it 
the Chairperson or the most senior person or the person responsible for 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 54 of 146 
 
the auditing of the particular entity.  
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the engagement partner at a firm will be the 
person that is allocated to be the one that is responsible for that 
particular audit and will sign the audit report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.  Mr Sokombela can you explain 
what the impact is of there being non-compliance with the various 
requirements listed in the checklist.  What does the AG do if it receives at 
the end of the audit, a monitoring checklist which indicates that there has 
not been compliance? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, I think Chair the, in terms of then the question 
itself, for an example if you look at the checklist, for an example, it is in 
most instances, is looking at the requirements of the – in terms of the 
Public Audit Act itself of which in most instances if for an example there 
were challenges during the audit process, those challenges ought to have 
been deliberated with the Auditor-General or the representative of the 
Auditor-General itself.  So if for example there is non-compliance with 
one of the requirements here, I think where I am sitting it is then 
something then that needs to be escalated to the firm itself.  For an 
example if there is a non-compliance with the requirements of the PAA 
20 
and the General Notice, or if there is the Auditor’s report to the 
accounting authority was not submitted within the timeframe, depending 
on what the transgression is, some of the transgression is for an example 
may even be reported to the Independent Regulatory Board, for Auditors 
to look into them. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 55 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Might it be a basis not to give concurrence 
the following year if that Auditor is seeking concurrence for a further year 
of the same audit. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   It may Chair. It may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess depending on the seriousness of the non-
compliance? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr Sokombela if we can go back to your 
affidavit to page 12. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that that checklist gets done after the auditing 
process has been completed is that right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say that during the auditing process or even at 
the beginning, if there is a situation that the firm knows is going to give 
rise to non-compliance they should bring that to the attention of the AG at 
that stage, is that right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chair. Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if – in other words if the AG has not been told 
anything until they receive this checklist from the AG’s point of view they 
20 
would be entitled to expect that there is nothing that the firm was aware 
in advance would be problematic in the auditing process, as far as they 
are concerned. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 56 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I assume that once the AG’s Office has concurred 
to – in the appointment of a particular firm, the AG would designate one 
of the Auditors in the AG’s Office to say this is your baby, if they – if 
some correspondence comes you are the one to deal with it. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr Sokombela I now want to turn to the issue 
we have been eluding to which is the process that is followed in order to 
determine whether to concur with or to reject the appointment of private 
10 
Auditors.  Can you tell us what process the Auditor-General follows in 
order to do that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, if I may get the page number in the affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Sorry, we are at page 12 of the affidavit. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Page 12 of the ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And in fact you deal there with the process – 
you deal there with the legislation and then you, over the page on page 
13, you deal with the process that is actually followed by the AG before 
since the Public Audit Act came into effect? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair.  Thank you Chair.  Chair I think it is 
20 
important that I mention that the Public Audit Act was promulgated in 
2004, and when then the Public Audit Act became – before it became 
effective the appointment of Auditors were regulated in Section 58 to 62 
of the Public Finance Management Act, but then when then the Public 
Audit Act became effective those provisions in the PFMA became 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 57 of 146 
 
redundant and then that particular schedule in the PFMA then was 
repealed and then was replaced then by the requirements of the Public 
Audit Act.  And then that process now is regulated Chair by Section 25 of 
the Public Audit Act and Chair I do not know if you would want me to read 
it in verbatim for the purposes of the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe not necessarily, I think Mr Mbikiwa also 
indicates not necessarily. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want to ask this, as a result of the repeal that 
you are talking about in the PFMA and the replacement as I understand it 
10 
of the particular schedule, is the position that therefore if you go to the 
Public Audit Act and the PFMA you will find that there are these 
provisions which are similar or even identical that deal with this particular 
issue or there are only in the PFMA? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, I think after Section 58 to 62 was repealed, so 
in the PFMA there is no duty for the entities to appoint their own Auditors.  
That has been conferred to the Audit-General. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, yes, okay, yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed, Chair the provisions simply do not 
exist.  They have been repealed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr 
Sokombela 
instead 
of 
reading 
the 
provisions of the Act, the Auditor-General as I understand it has a 
particular way of complying with the Act, and a particular process that it 
follows.  Can you talk us through what that process is? 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 58 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Thank you Chair.  Chair what the Audit Office does, 
the process that it follows is that prior to the commencement of the 
financial year of the Auditee, the Auditor-General will consider whether to 
perform the audit of that public entity or not.  And then Chair in the event 
that the Auditor-General opts not to perform, opts to perform the audit of 
the public entity that it has not audited during the previous year, what 
then the Auditor-General does, the Auditor-General notifies the Auditee or 
the entity of its decision to perform that audit.  The notification Chair to 
the Auditee will be given prior to the commencement of the financial year 
of that audit.  The affected Auditee must prior to the commencement of 
10 
the next audit and before the commencement of its financial year, select 
an External Auditor after following a Public Procurement Process in 
accordance with that Auditee Supply Chain Management Policy and 
procedures.  The financial year end of the public entity is usually the 31s t 
March and the appointment or reappointment of Auditors occurs at the 
entities Annual General Meeting.  That is approximately June or July but 
in some cases, they can even go to September/October depending on the 
scheduling of that.  The selected Auditor Chair must be an Auditor in 
private practice that is registered with the Independent Regulatory Board 
for Auditors.  Chair, once the Auditee has selected a suitable External 
20 
Auditor in accordance with the Public Procurement Process and its Supply 
Chain Management Processes, and prior to the appointment of such 
Auditor by the responsible Board or executive authority, the Auditee must 
notify the Auditor-General in writing of the name of the selected Auditor, 
and provide all information required by the Auditor-General as provided 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 59 of 146 
 
for in the audit directive.  The audit directive is attached as PS4.  The 
Auditor-General must within 14 days Chair of receiving the notification by 
the Auditee, evaluate such notification and notify the Auditee of its 
decision to concur with or reject the appointment, the proposed process 
and of any appropriate conditions that the Auditor-General may have 
determined.  If the Auditor-General has no objection to the appointment of 
the Auditor selected by the Auditee, the Auditee must proceed with the 
appointment of such Auditor.  Once appointed the Auditee must inform the 
Auditor of such appointment as well as any conditions that the AGSA may 
have determined.  Once the Board or the Minister responsible for the 
10 
Auditee has appointed the selected Auditor, the Auditee must notify the 
Auditor-General of such appointment and acknowledge acceptance of the 
conditions that may be set by the Auditor-General of South Africa.  So, in 
essence that is the process then that is followed Chair.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you so the beginning of that process is 
where the Auditor-General notifies the entity if it opts to perform, if it 
does not notify it, it is deemed not to opt to perform.   
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   You began your evidence by telling us some 
of the factors that would be considered in making that decision, such as 
20 
skills and capacity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   What are the factors that are considered in 
this decision as to whether to concur with or reject the appointment of 
private Auditors? 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 60 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, the factors then that are considered is the 
independence considerations, you know and the Auditor-General then 
what it does is to assess whether then the recommended audit firm is 
sufficiently independent to perform the audit of that public entity, and in 
this regard then the Auditor-General is guided by the relevant provisions 
of the Code of Ethics of Professional Accountants issued by the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, hereby referred to 
as IESBA ...(intervenes).  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can I pause you there?   
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes.  
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Sorry. 
 
I 
just 
want 
to 
understand 
independence a little bit more.  What do you mean when you talk about an 
audit firm being sufficiently independent? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, I think the most important thing that we look 
into on the independence is independence to ensure then that there is no 
conflict of interest, there are not threats you know that may impair the 
independence of that entity.  One of the considerations from the example 
that we normally look at to say, does this firm perform non assurance 
services to the public entity for an example consulting work if maybe they 
are performing this consulting work, how big is that? Is it bigger than the 
20 
audit fees that they going to receive because if it is bigger that the audit 
fees then there is a risk that it might have an impact on the on the 
independence and the objectivity.  And in the opening remarks Chair, it 
was mentioned that also the independence should also be in appearance 
because the perception then that if this audit firm is also have other 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 61 of 146 
 
interest like your financial interest to the entity then that might impair.  
There are other considerations in the independence Chair for an example, 
the issue of familiarity threat, because familiarity threat to independence 
as well you know can be an issue where for an example maybe the firm 
might be or the or the particular audit partner might be auditing that 
entity for many years or there is a family member that is working in the 
public entity that you know that might create also that conflict of interest.  
So when you are looking at independence those are the considerations 
Chairperson that we look at it is not all of them, but I am just mentioning 
the few.   
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Yes, thank you.  Can you continue telling us 
what the factors are ...(intervenes)?  
CHAIRPERSON:    I am sorry.  In order to established whether these 
factors that you have mentioned are present or whether those you might 
not have mentioned are present for purposes of the AG determining 
whether the firm has the requisite independence on appearance of 
independence.  Does the AG’s Office put certain questions to the 
particular firm to answer so that it can know whether there is a relative or 
family member who works in that particular entity or how does it get the 
information that maybe relevant to determining independence? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Chair there are certain declarations on that we 
request.  Firstly, even from the entity that is appointing the External 
Auditor.  They need to declare to us especially the issue of non-
assurance services that are provided.  So, this is basically then how we 
source that information to say please make declaration to us whether then 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 62 of 146 
 
this information is like that or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And the non-assurance services, what would that be? 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Chair the non-assurance services will be maybe 
consulting work that maybe the firm is assisting the entity with, let us say 
to ensure then that the assets of the entity are accounted for properly. In 
the financial statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words if the entity already has some 
relationship with the firm then you want to look into the nature of that 
relationship? 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Absolutely Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Among you, you mentioned declarations that 
have to be made.  Among these do firms – are firms required to disclose 
joint business relationships with entities that are linked to the audit 
client? 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Yes Chair, yes Chair.  Those declarations are 
required. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you 
CHAIRPERSON:    You said also that you look at whether the firm has 
been doing auditing for the particular entity for a long time.  Do you have 
20 
a cut-off point that guides you to say look a firm should not be – a firm 
that has been doing auditing has been auditing a particular entity maybe 
for five years should not continue beyond that.  Is there some guideline 
as to how long is too long in terms of that relationship? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Ja Chair, Chair, Chair I think for the turner of the firm 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 63 of 146 
 
itself there is not necessarily guidelines.  However for the engagement 
partner or the person that is going to be signing the report I think 
normally we look at five years or if maybe it is more than five years we 
would want to know the safeguards what are the safeguards that are 
going to be put in place? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay and the five years is not a guillotine.  It’s – 
you look at it but if there are certain measures in place you might allow it 
to go beyond five years. 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you.  Mr Sokombela If you could 
continue then telling us the factors that AG considers in order to 
determine whether to give its concurrence? 
MR SOKOMBELA:    There – I have mentioned the independence Chair 
and the second factor is compliance with public procurements prescripts 
and I think what I want to mention here is that on the compliance where 
the public procurements prescripts we look at this at a high level and we 
determine whether then the audit – sorry the Auditee has sourced the 
services of the private firm through its Public Procurement Processes and 
has complied with its own Supply Chain Management Policy and 
20 
Procedures and I think it is important that I mention that we look at this at 
a high level it is not an Auditor – sorry it is not an audit whether we say 
give us all your documents whether then audit whether you have done this 
thing properly or not.  The other factor ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Can I sorry – I just want to pause after that 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 64 of 146 
 
factor as well.  Does that mean that- that where an Auditor is irregularly 
appointed that will be a basis on which the Auditor-General will decline to 
give its concurrence? 
MR SOKOMBELA:    It may be a basis Chair.  It may be a basis Chair.  
Chair the other factor is the audit quality and the Auditor-General then 
considers how the quality of the firms work has been assessed and this 
regard an assessment is conducted by the Auditee’s Audit and Risk 
Committee as well as any firm and engagement inspections that are 
perform by the independent regulatory report for Auditors.  Those are also 
taken into consideration.  In the case of a new appointment because the 
10 
Audit Committee might not know the firm, so we rely heavily then on the 
inspection report by the independent regulatory report for Auditors. 
The other factor is adherence to formal and procedural 
requirements. Where the Auditor-General verifies the Auditees adherence 
to the procedural requirements for the appointment for the External 
Auditors that are outlined in section 25 of the Public Audit Act and the 
Auditor-General also verifies that the firm is registered with the 
independent regulatory report for Auditors. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.  Now you indicated that the 
Auditor-General must give its concurrence every year, how is it dealt with 
20 
when an entity runs a procurement process but makes an appointment for 
Auditors, say for a five year period? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, on one side is the Auditor-General there, we 
do not prescribe in terms of how long that appointment should be, 
however what is very important to us is the Auditor-General to ensure 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 65 of 146 
 
then that there is still – the public entity come backs to the AG every year 
and request for concurrence because if you look at the Company’s Act.  
The Company’s Act, I think it is Section 90 if I am not mistaken of the 
Company’s Act that also regulates the appointment of Auditors.  And in 
most instances that responsibility is allocated to the Audit Committee of 
the state-owned entity because that is their Governance Committee that 
the External Auditors works with in most instances.  So, there are 
instances whereby then an Auditor then gets re-appointed.  And in terms 
of law you cannot say I am going to appoint you for 10 years.  There are 
certain considerations that needs to be done.   
10 
An audit is done, it is completed, the audit report is signed.  
After then that is done the Audit Committee requires them to assess that 
particular firm.  They need to assess whether they still remain 
independent.  They still need to assess whether they have performed the 
audit in terms of then the quality standards.  The Audit Committee may 
come and say, we are not satisfied with this Auditor so we need to 
discharge this Auditor.  And that is allowed in law.  Hence then the 
Auditor-General then will ensure then that they still come and show us 
that due process that has been followed for the reappointment of 
Auditors. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So is it fair to say then that if an Auditor is 
ever appointed by a public entity for more than a year it is always subject 
to the risk that the Auditor-General might not concur with its continued 
appointment. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 66 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, the first opting out on the part of the AG’s Office 
happens mostly if not all the time at the instance of the AG’s Office.  But 
the subsequent acts of opting out in the years that follow might happen at 
the instance of the entity.  Is that right?  In other words, initially the AG’s 
Office might not have been asked to opt out because I guess nobody 
should ask them to opt out.  But if they themselves that is the AG’s Office 
decides we will opt out, they say we will opt out this year, they do not say 
we are opting out for the next five years. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it may be that the following year they were going to 
opt out but maybe before they make the decision the entity request them 
to concur to the firm to continuing to audit.  Is that right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes, Chair because the Auditor-General may say I am 
opting out this year but the Auditor may come next year and say I am 
opting in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  In actual fact, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Sokombela I would now like to 
get into the process that was in fact followed for the years from 2011 to 
2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mbikiwa I am interrupting you again. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No problem Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 67 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does the AG’s Office at some stage becomes suspicious 
when a particular entity keeps on asking the AG’s Office to concur in the 
appointment of a private firm?  If it has been happening for too often 
does it becomes- does the AG’s Office becomes suspicious to say, why do 
these people want that firm to continue and they do not want us to come 
in for so many years?  Why are they not leaving it to us to decide if we 
are opting out each year? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, not necessarily because once the Auditor-
General opts out, we leave then the decision to the entity itself.  It is 
when then the Auditor-General has decided to opt in then – where then 
10 
there is push back.  Then that maybe the Auditor-General might be 
suspicious of maybe why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would there ever be a push back when the AG wants to 
continue with his job? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Not that I remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not really but if it happened it would be suspicious. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I just find it strange.  I would imagine that 
because the auditing of every public entity is primarily the job of the 
Auditor-General and it is up to the Auditor-General to opt out in a 
20 
particular year.  I would imagine that an entity which has received an 
opting out notice from the AG this year and the AG has concurred in the 
appointment of a private firm to do the job, I would have imagined that 
that firm should have no problem if the following year the AG says, I am 
coming back or I continue with opting out and therefore I would expect 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 68 of 146 
 
that they will be neutral. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather than them seeking a situation where the AG 
keeps on – is kept out. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand my ...(intervenes)? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I do Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Sokombela can we turn to the 
concurrence that the AG gave in the course of the SAA audit.  We pick 
that up on page 18 of your affidavit.  Can you explain to us who was 
appointed to the SAA audit and what view the AG appointment in 
2011/2012? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, I just want to mention that in 2011/12 financial 
year I was not personally involved in the appointment of the External 
Auditor for SAA.  I only became involved in the 2015/16 financial year.  
However, I have been briefed by my colleagues that were personally 
involved with this that during 2011/12 financial year the Auditor-General 
20 
opted not to perform the audit of South African Airways and on 5 
September 2011 South African Airways consulted the Auditor-General to 
appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as well as Nkonki Inc as joint Auditors 
for a period of five years.  However, I just want to – in my affidavit I said 
for a period of five years.  I just want to clarify that Chair because the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 69 of 146 
 
appointment that was made was for 2011/12 financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One financial year? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was for one financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was not for a period of five years.  However, they 
ended up staying for five years.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Ja.  So, I think I just want to clarify that in the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But what is important is whether the request from 
10 
the SAA that the AG concurs in the appointment of PwC and Nkonki, 
whether that request asked that the AG issued – let them go on for five 
years even though the AG said one year this year then allowed it the 
following year, one year at a time.  But was the request that the AG 
should allow them for five years?  Do you know that or do you not know? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair the request was for one year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For one year. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was for 2011/12 financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It may be Mr Mbikiwa that there should be a 
short supplementary affidavit that just clarifies this part. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 70 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair then when that request then 
was made the Auditor-General concurred in writing for one-year 
appointment and notified the Chairperson of the Board of SAA on 12 t h 
September 2011.  There were no issues of concerns that were identified 
and a copy of the concurrence letter that was sent is attached as 
Annexure PS11 to this affidavit.   
Chair on the 23 r d of July 2012 South African Airways consulted 
the Auditor-General on the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
and Nkonki again as joint Auditors for the 2012/13 financial year.  And 
also ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just to cover this in a practical way.  You 
did say that you were not involved in 2011/12. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You only got involved in 2016 or 2015? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  2015/16 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja.  But what you are dealing with here – are you 
dealing with matters that appear from records that are available to you at 
the Auditor-General’s Office? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair I am dealing with matters that are available to 
me at the Auditor-General’s Office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  And the conversations in our deliberations that I had 
with my colleagues that were responsible at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair maybe for the purposes of this hearing maybe I 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 71 of 146 
 
must say from 2011/12, 2012/13 financial year, 2013/14 financial year and 
2014/15 financial year South African Airways requested the concurrence 
of the Auditor-General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Each year? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Each year.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  And there were no issues that were identified by the 
Auditor-General and the concurrence was given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I just want to summarise instead of going to each and 
10 
every ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, that is fine.  That is in order.  And the 
documentation reflecting that request and the granting of that request, 
the concurrence, is all attached here? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is all attached Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes, it is all attached here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Sokombela in those years that 
the AG was giving its concurrence. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Was it disclosed to it that the appointment had 
only been for one year? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So, SAA told the AG that in 2011/2012 it had 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 72 of 146 
 
run a tender process that was only for a one-year appointment? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So why in 2012, 2013 and 2014 did the AG 
give its concurrence? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair the – I must say the Public Audit Act itself I 
think was a new legislation 200 ...(indistinct) 4 and the issue of us or the 
issue of concurrence has grown or has matured in the organisation.  The 
– Chair the Gazette or the directive that Mr Mbikiwa referred me to is one 
of the latest Gazettes that we have.  However, the Gazette that was 
applicable at the time, I think is attached here, at the time did not have 
10 
that requirement for us to actually look at the public procurement process 
whether the public procurement process is done.   
We would rely heavily on the assessment that has been done by 
the Audit Committee, by the Board and also by the Minister.  And then we 
will rely then on those determinations then that they have made.  
However, as the time goes by and as our processes also are maturing 
then we did then start to consider whether then there was procurement 
process or not.  So, in hindsight where I am sitting here to say maybe in 
those years should we have considered whether maybe they have the 
public procurement process was followed or not, definitely yes. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Maybe we should have considered that however we 
are a growing organisation as we grow, we do then deal with certain 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I – is my understanding correct that you are saying 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 73 of 146 
 
during those years it was not a legal obligation on the Auditor-General to 
check whether before concurring the firm that is proposed to do the work 
has been appointed in compliance with the PFMA for example?   
Or are you saying it was an obligation but we had a certain 
understanding which has since changed.  We now look at it but at that 
time we did not look at it because we did not understand that to be our 
obligation?   
Or we understood it to be our obligation but we were quite happy 
in being guided in regard to that by what the risk and Audit Committee 
says.  Which of these two is the right one or three, I think? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes, it is three Chair.  Chair in terms of the law it is a 
requirement to go through the procurement process however I think what I 
want to emphasise is that the appointment of Auditors is quite tricky in 
the sense that for an example in 2011/12 there was procurement that was 
done meaning that how the Auditors were brought to SAA there was a 
process that was done.  But then where then the trick comes in 
Chairperson is when then you are dealing with re-appointment because 
the Auditors are already here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh extensions. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes, Chair or the extensions because the Auditors are 
already here.  And there is then the company’s Act requirements then that 
the entity then follows which is a due process.  It is not necessary to say 
there is no due process there.  There is a due process that they follow 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 74 of 146 
 
and we at the time then we looked at that – we only relied on that 
particular instance.   
And also, in practice as well it is not practical to have an Auditor 
only for one year only.  Because in most instances an Auditor for one year 
is just to understand how your business is.  And subsequent then to that 
year that is when then the Auditor starts to add value to the particular 
entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, is your answer therefor that even during those 
years the AG’s Office was under a legal obligation to check whether there 
had been compliance with PFMA for example in the appointment of the 
10 
particular firm in regard to SAA in 2011 a process had been followed 
before the first appointment?   
Whereas we as the Audit General’s Office now in 2020 we regard 
it as our duty that even when there are request for extensions or re-
appointments that we should check that the PFMA is complied with.  But 
at that time, we did not understand this to be an obligation on us.  Is that 
what you are saying? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chairperson, that is what I am saying to say we did 
not understand it to be our obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  At that particular point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  And also, I think one other important aspect as well is 
on our side to say the re-appointment of Auditors in the company’s Act is 
governed by the company’s Act in terms of then how the re-appointment 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 75 of 146 
 
of External Auditors needs to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  And at the time we understood that to be 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Enough. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  An enough process.  As long as they stick to what 
they did in 2011/12 financial year.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But your understanding now is that apart from 
the process in the company’s act there must also be compliance with the 
process in terms of the PFMA even with re-appointments and extension? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair it is our understanding.  However, what also we 
do not want to do as an audit office is to make it difficult for the state-
owned entities to appoint Auditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Because I think the law itself is quite tricky in the 
sense that it says the appointment should be for a period of one year 
however, myself as an Auditor I know that is not practical to have an 
Auditor only for one year.  So, there may be then due processes then that 
needs to be followed.  For an example Chair some of the entities what 
they normally have is to have a policy on how they need to appoint 
20 
Auditors which is a policy that is not necessarily the Supply Chain 
Management Policy.   
But to say we are going to have a police example to say we are 
going to appoint Auditors let us say for a period of five years however 
when you signing a contract with them we are going to have provisors 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 76 of 146 
 
that says that you are going to be valid for a year and then we will 
reconsider each year in terms of then what happens.  So that is basically 
then the – that is a trick – I think that is a trick if I may put it in this 
particular – it is not like the procurement of any other goods or services, 
it is a statutory procurement.  Is it procurement of a statutory Auditor?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is important that I know what the position is.  
And it is important for me to know what the AG’s understanding of the – 
what the position is because the AG deals with these things all the time. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I need to know if there are challenges that are 
10 
posed by the law as it currently stands because it may be that some 
recommendations need to be made to say, the law as it currently stands 
either creates confusion or is difficult to implement because as Auditors 
we know that an Auditor goes in for one year.   
Really that year is used for the Auditor to get to know the 
business so it is impractical to and unrealistic to say there should be 
appointments for one year because we know almost invariably it is more 
than one year.  So maybe it should be more than that.  So, I just want you 
to know that I am interested in understanding that.  But as I understand it 
at a certain time it was an obligation but the AG’s Office understood it in 
20 
a certain way. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore, acted on the base of that understanding.  
Right now, it understands differently and it acts in accordance with the 
new understanding. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 77 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, just on the issue of the concern you 
have raised.  This will be dealt with in more detail in the evidence 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But certainly, other State-Owned Entities have 
found a way to deal with this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if I can just refer to the – an Eskom RFP, 
10 
as I say this will be referred to in the evidence tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But the condition of the tender says: 
“The appointment will be made for a period of five years 
relating to the audit of five financial years from the 
2014/15 financial year onwards subject to the following 
conditions. Annual consultation with the Auditor-General 
before the appointment for a specific year is finalised.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So, there is a sort of practical ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, way. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Illustration, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask one follow up question Mr 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 78 of 146 
 
Sokombela.  In those years after 2011/2012 so in the years after the 
Procurement process had been run but to which the procurement process 
itself did not apply.  Is it fair to say that it was for – now I am saying 
SSA.  Apologies Chair.  Was it for SAA to indicate to you what 
procurement process had been followed?  Was it for SAA to disclose that 
to you? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did it do so? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  In 2011/12 I have been made aware that they did so.  
Subsequent to 2011/12 what then they gave us is then the resolutions 
10 
from their own governance structures that they have considered the 
competency of the Auditor, the quality control issues.  They are happy in 
terms of the conduct of the Auditors and they would want to re-appoint 
them.  So, they did not submit the procurement issues. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, it will be important to understand whether 
from SAA’s point of view there might have been any confusion about 
whether for the subsequent years they should do that.  It may be that 
20 
there was no confusion, they knew they needed to do that.  But it may be 
that they did not know whether for the extension they needed that as well.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair we will address it tomorrow but the 
documents reveal that there was no confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 79 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela can you then – actually Chair I 
am going to move into the 2015/16 financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Which is a more detailed issue.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And I see that we are at 12:55. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you suggest we use the 5 minutes before 13:00 
or are you suggesting that it might be convenient to ...(intervenes)? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am suggesting it might be convenient to 
adjourn now Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Just because I will begin but will not really get 
into the following issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No, that is fine.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment and we will resume at 14:00.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Sokombela before the 
20 
lunch break we had dealt with the concurrence of the AG to the 
appointment of PwC and Nkonki between 2011/12 and 2014/15.  Can 
you explain to us what happened in 2015/2016 and I understand that 
this is when you were in fact responsible for it?   
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair.  I think in 2015/16 when – then 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 80 of 146 
 
the request for the Auditor-General to concur was made was then when 
I was involved and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just to make sure because later on when 
one reads the transcript it might not be clear.  When you say in 
2015/2016 you mean during the 2015/2016 financial year? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair and also that was the year when 
the Board of South African Airways was requesting their concurrence to 
the Auditor-General for the 2015/16 financial year.  Yes Chair.  
10 
Chairperson the request for concurrence was made I think on the 24 t h 
of July 2015 where then the South African Airways was making then a 
request to appoint Nkonki Incorporation as a sole Auditor of SAA for the 
2015/2016 financial year.  And upon ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That sounds strange to me.  Maybe it is 
because I am not an Auditor.  I would have thought that a request for 
concurrence would be directed to the Auditor-General’s Office prior to 
the commencement of the 2015/2016 financial year rather than in the 
middle of that financial year.  But maybe it is because I am not an 
Auditor and I do not know that the actual performance of the Auditor’s 
20 
job comes towards the tail end of the financial year. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  Yes I think just to clarify Chair 
that be – the requirement to – for the – before the start of the financial 
year is when the Auditor-General make a decision whether he is opting 
in or he is opting out.  However there is no requirements in terms of 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 81 of 146 
 
then the timing of the consultation than that needs to be done because 
in as much as in July 2015 the 2015/16 financial year has already 
started.  However normally the audits they start later on when the 
transactions have already happened.  Because as External Auditors we 
are auditing history.  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  So the request was on time? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes it was on time.  So Chair what happened then 
after we received then that request for the appointment of Nkonki as 
the sole Auditors we evaluated the request and what we then requested 
further from SAA was then for SAA to submit to us the Audit Committee 
Resolution that was made recommending the appointment of SAA to – 
as a sole Auditor to the Board.  And also the other information that we 
requested Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is requesting the appointment of not SAA, is it 
not?  Of the auditing firm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Nkonki. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Nkonki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nkonki ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Nkonki.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said SAA. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 82 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair.  So what we did Chair because upon 
evaluation of the request itself there was more information that we were 
looking to gather so that we can determine whether then we can concur.  
We can recommend the Auditor-General to concur with the appointment 
or not.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And you in particular were now in charge of looking 
into this request? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair.  So Chair what – what we did then 
when I was doing that task I was doing it with Mr Nicholas Mokwena 
who at the time was the – was my Manger.  I was his Line Manager so 
we were working together at the time.  So what then Mr Mokwena did 
was to request then this information from SAA the Audit Committee 
Resolution that was made to the Board to recommend the appointment 
of Nkonki as the sole Auditor of SAA.  The other information Chair that 
we were seeking is then the Board Resolution that was made where 
then the Board was recommending to the shareholder or the Minister to 
say that SAA is appointing Nkonki as the External Auditors.  We also 
20 
requested SAA to furnish us with their policy on the appointment of 
External Auditors so that we can be able then to evaluate whether then 
have this adhered to their own internal policy on the appointment of 
External Auditors.  And then SAA responded to the – to our request for 
information and what they submitted is an undated letter submitted to 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 83 of 146 
 
us by the Company Secretary and the letter was explaining the 
appointment of Nkonki as the sole Auditors of SAA.  And Chair we have 
over-touched the copy of that letter is attached to this affidavit as 
Annexure PS16.  They also submitted to us an excerpt of the draft 
minutes of the continuation of the SAA Board of Directors Meeting.  I 
think the meeting number is number 2015/04 that was held on Friday, 
10 July 2015.  And a copy of that Resolution Chair is also attached as 
Annexure PS17.  They also submitted to us Chairperson the SAA Policy 
on Supply Chain Management.  Remember I said we requested the 
policy on the appointment of External Auditors but they only submitted 
10 
their SAA Supply Chain Management Policy.  So Chair upon then 
receiving this information we evaluated the information that was 
submitted to us and – but we could not confirm whether or not the 
appointment 
of 
Nkonki 
complied 
then 
with 
the 
Supply 
Chain 
Management Policy because after requesting the policy on External 
Auditors – upon requesting policy on External Auditors we were 
furnished with the Supply Chain Management Policy.  So then our 
evaluation then instead of us evaluating with the policy on appointment 
of External Auditors we ended up evaluating then that on the 
appointment in terms of their own SCM Policy.  I must specify Chair 
20 
that this was not an audit.  It was just a high level inspection of 
whether maybe then was the appointments then in adherence to their 
own policy or not.  And we requested then SAA – because we could not 
see how the SAA has complied with that – with its own SCM policy or 
Supply Chain Management Policy.  Then we requested ...(intervenes). 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 84 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  The document they did not give you 
which you had asked for was a document relating to the process to be 
followed in appointing External Auditors, is that what you said? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You asked for that they did not give you that but they 
gave you an SCM Management Policy? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And bearing in mind why you would have wanted their 
policy relating to the appointment of External Auditors were you 
comfortable with proceeding with looking into this without the document 
10 
that would have shown the process – their policies for appointing 
External Auditors? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair it became evident that SAA did not have a 
policy – a separate policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  On the appointment of External Auditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Auditors.  Oh okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Hence they submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  The Supply Chain Management Policy to us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was because they did not have it. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  They did not have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they should have had it or it is not obligatory? 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 85 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is not obligatory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  But it is best practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair you know because in some of the – I must say 
because SAA was new to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  You know when it came to me because you 
remember that it moved from Public Enterprises to National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So it was new. One of the entities also I was 
responsible for an example that was also the same situation as SAA 
was the Development Bank of South Africa – of Southern Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  They had a policy on the appointment of External 
Auditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So when we assessing their request to concur we – 
they would also – they would furnish with us then their policy and their 
policy then was quite detailed and also covered the requirements of 
20 
how they appoint and also how they do the re-appointment of the 
External Auditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Thank you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 86 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I think as I said that when 
then we evaluated then this sole appointment of Nkonki in terms of the 
Supply Chain Management Policy.  And – but we did not have – there is 
information then that we did not have where we requested SAA then to 
furnish us with evidence to confirm that Nkonki appointment complied 
with the Supply Chain Management Policy.  You know because you 
looked in terms of the SCM Policy we looked at the Resolutions that 
they gave us.  We could not see how the appointment was done and 
upon us making that request Chairperson SAA then furnished us with 
the Board Resolution number 2011/B24 dated 22 November 2011 in 
10 
respect of the appointment of External Auditors for the 2011/12 
financial year.  And a copy of that Board Resolution Chair is attached 
as Annexure PS18 to this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I missed what you said in terms of what you 
asked SAA for when you could not see how they had complied with their 
Supply Chain Management Policy. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said you asked for something and I missed 
that. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair upon us receiving the Supply Chain 
20 
Management Policy when we were looking at the Supply Chain 
Management Policy and also the information that they already furnished 
us with we could not determine how SAA got to a decision of appointing 
SAA in terms of its own Supply Chain Management Policy.  So then we 
said, please give us evidence how did you comply with this policy when 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 87 of 146 
 
you were appointing ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Nkonki as the – as their sole Auditor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
MR SOKOMBELA:  That is then when Chairperson then they gave us 
then Board Resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Number 2011/B24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Of 22 November 2011. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  And the other information Chair that they gave us is 
SAA’s Bid Adjudication Councils Report dated 22 August 2011 
recommending also the appointment of PwC for the 2011/12 financial 
year.  And also this report is attached Chairperson as Annexure PS19.  
They also gave us Chairperson an extract of the In Committee Minute 
of SAA’s Audit and Risk Committee that was held on 24 August 2015 of 
the ratification of Nkonki as the External Auditors of SAA.  A copy of 
that extract also Chairperson is attached as Annexure PS20.  So this is 
– they gave us – this is the information that they further gave us.  They 
20 
gave us when we requested.  And when we received then that 
information what we did was to – we performed an assessment of the 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed am I right in understanding that 
they just supplied you with these documents without supplying you with 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 88 of 146 
 
any letter or statement from somebody at SAA saying, this is how we 
complied with our SCM Policy and what we are attaching is – are 
documents which support what we say in terms of how we complied. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chairperson ja it is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding correct? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I actually forgot to mention that that was 
accompanied by the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  From the Company Secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Of SAA at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which specific how they had complied? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then the documents were attached as 
support documents? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So Chair upon us receiving then this further 
information and this information revealed to us that SAA did not have a 
separate policy for the appointment of External Auditors therefore our 
20 
view as the Auditor-General then was that the appointment of External 
Auditors had to be treated like any other supplier at the time and also 
in terms then the Bid Adjudication Councils Report also of 22 August 
2011 PwC had been recommended on conditions that SMME Consortium 
Plan has to be incorporated into the contract between SAA and the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 89 of 146 
 
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Chair the Board Resolution 2011/B24 of 22 
November 2014 – sorry 2011 – I am sorry Chair about that also 
confirmed that the resolution to appoint Nkonki and PwC as External 
Auditors of SAA for the 2011/12 financial year jointly and on a 60/40 
basis in favour of Nkonki Incorporation.    Chair the excerpt also from 
the minutes of the Board Meeting of 10 July 2015 confirmed the 
appointment of Nkonki as External Auditors of SAA for a period of five 
years.  That is basically what it says.  But the challenge that we had 
was that there was no evidence that SAA applied the principles of its 
own Supply Chain Management Principles.  You know so I think those 
10 
were the challenges then that we had and we held a view at the time 
Chair that the appointment of Nkonki as the sole Auditors of SAA 
should follow a new procurement process.  And the reason why we did 
that is because Chair in as much as they gave us the 2011/12 as an 
evidence that there was a procurement process but that procurement 
process was a joint appointment.  And at the time we assumed then, 
excuse me, in as much as it was a joint appointment process and also it 
was for one year the subsequent years was – were like renewals of the 
contract.  However if then you come in the fifth year and then the other 
entity in the joint – in this joint relationship is taken out to us then it 
20 
say then that – it means then that it is the end of a relationship.  So 
you need to start afresh and go and look for a new relationship.  So 
that was the view Chairperson that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that view was based on the fact that the decision 
to appoint in 2011 related to two entities that were to act jointly? 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 90 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now what was being sought was to continue with one 
only? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was not the same as before? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that could affect capacity as well. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Apart from anything else? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela that seems to be one of the 
issues with the documents that were submitted to you. The fact that it 
was PwC – sorry it was – it sought the sole appointment of Nkonki 
when the original appointment was for joint Auditors.  Were you 
concerned though that the documents they submitted to you as proof of 
compliance with their SCM Policy was in fact – was effectively 
documents that showed an appointment for one year in 2011/2012? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  In actual fact I think in our deliberations internally 
you know because I had to think back you know five years ago and I 
20 
remember that in our deliberations that is one of the issues that were 
concerned.  However like I said I think before lunch Chairperson that 
the appointment of External Auditors in terms of how we have been 
looking at it on our side as Auditors was to say Auditors they get 
appointed but also they can also get reappointed.  But what was 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 91 of 146 
 
significant for us was then – was the – was then the relationship now 
with the joint audits that was stopped.  But then we said if then the 
relationship with the joint Auditors is stopped it means then that maybe 
SAA then maybe needs to go and look you know and follow a certain 
due process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you able to remember whether there were 
other respects in which SAA had not complied with its Supply Chain 
Management Policy other than the one you have mentioned?  Or you 
cannot remember? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I cannot remember Chair and also we were not 
10 
involved with SAA.  The only relationship we had was for them to be 
requesting concurrence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  To us yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your – you are looking at these issues was not 
deep in terms of whether there had been compliance with procurement 
or with processes for the appointment of External Auditors.  You – are 
you saying that you were not required to look deep into them?  You 
20 
were required just to have a look and see whether it seemed to – there 
seemed to have been a compliance without necessarily saying we are 
satisfied that definitely there was compliance? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 92 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela did the AG then raise 
concerns regarding the appointment of Nkonki? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair we did raise the concerns however we saw it 
now that us communicating through letters and e-mails is not going 
work and at the time then I took it to myself then to go and have a 
meeting with the Company Secretary so that we can explain face to 
face in terms of what our concerns were.  And the meeting was held on 
the 15 t h of September 2015 Chair and after that meeting I took it to 
myself to ensure then that I send them a recordal in terms of the 
10 
concerns and also the recommendations then that I made.  One of the 
things that I told them at the time was to say they need to reconsider 
the appointment – the process that they followed to appoint Nkonki as 
the sole Auditors of SAA to ensure that it – there is compliance with its 
own Supply Chain Management Policy.  And also once then they have 
actually relooked at that process – they are welcome to resubmit to us 
for our consideration.  And also one of the recommendations that I 
made to them is to say consider adopting a policy as SAA specifically 
for the appointment and reappointment of External Auditors so that in 
future we do not have similar challenges.  Then on the 14 t h of 
20 
December 2015 then SAA submitted to us the documents where they 
submitted an excerpt of the draft minutes of – for the – of the Board 
Meeting.  I think their draft minutes is number 2015/07 that they held 
that meeting on the 9 t h of December 2015 where they were confirming 
the reappointment of PwC and Nkonki for the financial year 2015/16.  
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 93 of 146 
 
Chair the appointment was made on the basis of 50/50 split were close 
split and subject to the concurrence of the Auditor-General of South 
Africa in terms of Section 25(2) of The Public Audit Act.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I just pause you there?  Sorry Mr 
Sokombela.  Do I understand correctly that what SAA is doing here is 
seeking to comply with your indication that their attempt to appoint 
Nkonki on a sole basis would not be concurred with by the Auditor-
General? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And so they sought to comply with that by 
10 
passing a new resolution to jointly appoint PwC and Nkonki? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That would be my assumption Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That would be my assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to your meeting on the 15 September 
2015 with the Company Secretary. 
1. Who was the Company Secretary? 
2. What was his or her reaction to your concerns? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair the name of the Company Secretary was Ms 
Ruth Kibuka.  She understood ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Kibuuka would be K-i-b-u-k-a? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is u-u – double U. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh K-i-b-w-k-a? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  U-u ja not w.  Just for the transcribers 
Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 94 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just to make sure u-u.  
MR SOKOMBELA:  I cannot remember the spelling Chair honestly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember the spelling.  Okay no that is 
fine.  I think Mr Mbikiwa sees it ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes indeed Chair.  I do – in fact Chair it is 
quite an important letter – e-mail from Mr Sokombela following up from 
his meeting with Mr – with Ms Kibuuka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Perhaps we could go to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we could go to that because I want to have a full 
10 
picture of that discussion. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  H’mm.  Chair it is in DD20B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At page 532. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  And it may be important that even 
if he does not read the whole letter he highlights the important features 
of the letter. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of – insofar as it sought to record the 
discussion. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair.  Mr Sokombela’s recollection 
of it has been remarkably good but I will ask him to just identify the key 
aspects of it. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  The aspect – the key aspects 
Chair on the letter is – I think – I think it is an e-mail Chairperson. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 95 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is an e-mail ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I think – it was not a formal ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  But I thought at the time it is important that I recuse 
these – our conversations with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So that she can confirm if I was accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Or I was not accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  In my assessment of our meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  But the key issue ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you like the one that you already mentioned you do 
not have to repeat.  You can just highlight others that you might not 
have mentioned.  I understand you to have mentioned the one about 
your concerns about Nkonki going alone that they may have to do that 
plus the – your concern that they must consider having a policy for the 
appointment of External Auditors.  So if there is something else other 
than those that constitutes important features then you can just add 
20 
that. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela the third bullet point is one 
that you have not dealt with yet. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  The third bullet point in that e-
mail Chair if I may read it?  It says: 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 96 of 146 
 
“The Board Resolution for the meeting held on the 
10 t h July 2015 seek to appoint Nkonki for a period of 
five years in contravention of Section 25(4) of The 
Public Audit Act of 2004.  The External Auditors can 
be appointed for a period longer than one year on 
condition that it is stipulated in the contract that 
concurrence will be sought annually from the AGSA 
or the Auditor-General of South Africa.” 
And – yes I think that is the only section that I did not mention 
Chair in – yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes in terms of what the Company Secretary’s 
reaction to these consensus was then – try – tell me about that at the 
meeting?  Was she amenable, was there resistance or she was going to 
reflect and then you come back to her in due course? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair I – when we got there I had to explain the 
rationale.  You know because I think when we got there I think in their 
mind it was – they were driving the transformational agenda you know 
by appointing a black firm.  Of which at the time also I did tell them as 
well that no, no, it is fine we share the same sentiments however when 
you seeking to do that you got to ensure then that you follow the due 
20 
process and then the appointment as well is done in terms of your 
policies and procedures.  And also the issue of – for them to say they 
are utilising the 2011 procurement process was – it – I explained it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not in order? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was not in order. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 97 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  However after I explained they understood as well 
and they promised that they are going to back – take the matters back 
to the Board for reconsideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  There is a response from 
Ms Kibuuka in the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In the same file at page 558.  It is a very 
brief and cursory response. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We may well deal with it for the sake of 
completing ...(intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything connected with that meeting. 
DV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  558, you said? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  558. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Sokombela, it is quite a short e-mail.  
Would you just mind reading that into the record? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  The e-mail from Ms Ruth Kibuuka 
reads as follows: 
“Dear Polani, thank you for the meeting this 
afternoon and for the valuable input you have 
provided in respect of the appointment of our 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 98 of 146 
 
External Auditors.  We will review our process in 
connection of the concerns raised and revert as 
soon as possible.  Regards, Ruth Kibuuka.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can return to your affidavit at page 23.  
That is in DD20A and you had told us that the New Board Resolution 
had been submitted to the AG.  Can you tell us what view then the AG 
took? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us first hear – let us first deal with the 
content of whatever he received to see whether it – in his view – 
10 
sufficiently addressed his concerns. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that what you were telling me about starting 
from the bottom of page 22.  The – what you were sent there would talk 
to what the Board had decided to do in order to address your concerns. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that is what I want to hear.  They sent you 
something.  You looked at it.  You were happy that it addressed the 
concerns or you were still not happy.  That is what I am looking for. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you very much Chair.  Chair, on the 14 t h 
20 
of December 2015 what then SAA sent us was then the excerpt of the 
draft minutes of the Board Meeting.  The number of those draft minutes 
is Number 2015/2017 held on 9 December 2015.  Chair, in those – in 
that excerpt of the draft minutes what then SAA recorded as a 
resolution is reappointment of PwC/Nkonki Incorporation on a 50/50 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 99 of 146 
 
workload split and subject to the concurrence of the Auditor-General of 
South Africa and also accompanying that Chair is a letter that – by the 
Company Secretary that – the letter was 11 December 2015. 
Where then that letter is informing the Auditor-General of 
South Africa of the Board’s Resolution to reappoint PwC/Nkonki as joint 
Auditors for the 2015/2016 financial year.  That letter Chairperson was 
accompanied by the consultation checklist and a copy of that check – of 
the letter is attached as Annexure PS23. 
The consultation checklist Chairperson is a checklist that is 
in our audit directive where the entities needs to fill it and sign it.  So 
10 
that they can send it to us to see if they complied with the appointment 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that checklist is different from the checklist we 
dealt with earlier? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is sent to the AG’s Office at the end of the 
auditing process. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That – the checklist that we dealt with earlier 
Chairperson is a checklist that the External Auditors when they sign the 
audit report – after they signed the audit report ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Or they finish the audit report.  The audit partner 
would sign – would fill it in and send it to us.  We have not dealt then 
with the checklist that the entities have – that needs to fill it in.  
However with your indulgence Chair maybe we can go to the audit 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 100 of 146 
 
directive.  So that maybe I can demonstrate in terms of how the 
checklist looks like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at this stage I just wanted to confirm that the 
checklist that you were referring to say they sent it to you.  Is different 
from the checklist that we discussed earlier. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is different Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Then whether we deal – we go to the 
directive now or later.  I leave that to Mr Mbikiwa. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We can certainly go there now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is in the same file as your affidavit.  It is 
at page 141. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is Annexure E. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexure E? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes.  I think so. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is at page 166. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  166. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is Annexure E to the directive. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 101 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Yes.  Page 166. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the correct one? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair.  It is the correct one.  However in the 
annexure itself there is a section that deals with the initial appointment 
and oh there is a section that deals with the reappointment.  The 
section that deals with the reappointment is on page 169. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair.  If you look at the checklist itself.  The 
10 
checklist is this – it is for the reappointment of the audit firm and it 
reflects the information that that needs to be supplied – that needs to 
be submitted via the e-mail to section4@hsa.co.za.  There is a 
checklist there Chairperson where the name of the audit firm, the 
address and contact details, engagement – the name of the 
engagement partner, the financial years previously audited are needed. 
There is also details of the Audit Committee’s assessment of 
the effectiveness and efficiency of the performance of External Auditors 
including IRBA’s view – review results.  There is also details of 
significant 
disagreements 
between 
the 
External 
Auditors 
and 
20 
accounting authority or the Board during the preceding financial year, if 
any. 
We – there is also details that in – they were requested to 
indicate any matter that may influence a decision regarding the 
independence objectivity or perceived independence of the Auditors 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 102 of 146 
 
and we also need information there Chair that we need the name of the 
partner in charge for the audit of the year – of the last five years. 
We just wanted to know whether the audit partner was the 
same or it was different partners and also in number 11 there 
Chairperson.  We would need the name of the Senior Audit Manager in 
charge of the audit for the last five years as well.  On the next page 
Chair that is where we need information regarding the cost of audit and 
none audit services provided by the audit firm during the last three 
years. 
Chair, you remember earlier on we talked about the issue of 
10 
non-audit services.  This is where then we also look whether maybe are 
they – is it – are these fees in comparison with the audit fees very 
high.  That is where we do that assessment.  Whether then they will be 
independent or not.  So in essence this is how then the checklist for 
the reappointment then of the Auditors looks like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is the audit firm that completes it? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  No Chair.  It is the entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the entity? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  The entity.  When the entity then is appointing 
...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  The External Auditors.  They are required to fill in 
this checklist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So the auditee ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 103 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Supplies this checklist and the Auditors at the end of 
the auditing process when they have signed their report.  Supply a 
different checklist to the Auditor-General. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  If we can return to your affidavit 
Mr Sokombela.  We were at page 23 and you had just told us that the 
Company Secretary had submitted this letter and informed the AG of 
the Board Resolution.  Can you now tell us what the – what view the AG 
took in response to receipt of that? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Thank you Chair.  Upon then receiving this further – 
this information. We assumed then that the Board has rescinded their 
decision to appoint Nkonki as its sole Auditors.  As they now have 
appointed PwC/Nkonki as joint Auditors and we then said then based 
then on our assessment. 
Then inasmuch as the appointment process was done in 2011 
however then it is – there is nothing that has changed.  We did not see 
any reasons on our side to object.  Not to concur with that and then we 
recommended then that the Auditor-General can concur with the 
appointment. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you and it was on that basis that PwC 
and Nkonki were then appointed as the joint Auditors ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  For the 2015/2016 ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 104 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Financial year.  I would like now to get into 
the year that the AG took over the SAA audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that are you able to tell me when exactly the 
Auditor-General’s Office came to the conclusion that it – its 
understanding of what its obligations were in regard to extensions or 
renewals.  Are you able to tell me when it was that the Auditor-
General’s Office changed its mind and said, no actually we were – we 
are obliged if it is renewals or extensions to satisfy ourselves or to 
have a look – to do a high level ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Consideration. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is what it is of whether there has been 
compliance each year. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair.  Chair, I think I had – during the 
lunch 
time 
I 
had 
a 
conversation 
with 
my 
– 
with 
Advocate Marissa Bezuidenhout who is our - our corporate lawyer.  You 
know, because I was – I just wanted to find out this thing of the 
obligation. 
Whether we really obligated to look at whether they followed 
20 
the Supply Chain Management Policy or it was just a process on our 
side.  To say we are going to look at it and what she advised me on that 
was that we were not obligated to look at whether then they complied 
with the Supply Chain Management Policy inasmuch as in our audit 
directive we have actually put there to say what we are going to check 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 105 of 146 
 
and I cannot remember Chair which year we have put it. 
We have decided to put it in our audit directive to say we are 
going to check it as part of the process, but I think it is somewhere 
around 2015/2016/2017.  In 2017 definitely it is there in the directive, 
but I think it is somewhere 2015/2016 when we decided to say as part 
of our processes we are going to look at it.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am more interested in your understanding 
...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to any understanding by your legal 
10 
advisors. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am more interested in your understanding over 
the years. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether the understanding was right or wrong is 
something else, but your own understanding and I understood you so 
far and you are going to tell me if I misunderstood you.  I understood 
you so far to say that your understanding, and I am now talking about 
the office of the Auditor-General, for a certain number of years was that 
20 
there was no obligation for you – for there to be compliance every year 
or for you to look deep into that, but that from a certain time you 
changed your view about that and started doing things differently.  Is 
my understanding correct? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 106 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at this stage you just remember that maybe 2015 
– during the 2015/2016 financial year it may be that that is when the 
change happened? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Sokombela, I would 
like to move to the audit that the Auditor-General did of SAA in the 
10 
2016/2017 year.  Before we get to that can you just briefly tell me your 
understanding of the audit from 2011 to 2012.  Sorry.  2011/2012 to 
2015/2016.  I am talking about the financial years here. 
What was the overall audit opinion expressed by PwC and 
Nkonki over those years? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, the audit opinion that was expressed by 
Nkonki and PwC in those years was unqualified audit opinion with no 
findings.  The Auditor-General normally refers to that as a clean audit 
opinion.  Yes.  So that is my understanding of the audit outcomes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Just for lay people.  Can you 
20 
tell us what that means?  What is a clean audit?  What does an 
unqualified audit mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Maybe he should start with qualified and 
unqualified, because sometimes I think I understand it, but sometimes I 
think I confuse it, because I think when it is – when you say qualified to 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 107 of 146 
 
somebody looking at the English language.  Thinks that is a good thing.  
It is qualified and if you say unqualified. 
It is like it is a bad thing.  It is an unqualified teacher or 
something else.  So just make sure that I do not confuse them. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Ja.  Ja.  It is understandable Chair.  It is very – it is 
quite funny when you look at it literally, but I think maybe if I may 
explain the audit opinions in terms of how - how they are.  You – the 
auditing standards have got an audit opinion that is an unqualified 
audit opinion. 
What then that audit opinion Chair means is that the financial 
10 
statements of that entity are free from material misstatements whether 
caused by fraud or error.  So it means then that ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says they are good? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It says they are good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Meaning that then the governance processes are – 
there is no material issues that have been ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So there is nothing that came to the Auditor that 
can - can indicate that there was a problem.  So that will be the 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unqualified? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  An unqualified audit opinion. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 108 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we lay people should not place a lot of emphasis 
on unqualified? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So the one that seems to be bad is actually the 
good one? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes.  Yes.  It is a good one, Chair.  It is a good one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then qualified. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be opposite of that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes.  Chair, the qualified audit opinion is when upon 
auditing the financial statements of a particular entity.  We find out that 
we are – as Auditors we are happy with everything except for – in the 
except for we will say we are happy with the financial statements 
except for assets. 
So that will be then a qualified audit opinion, because we are 
saying, ja.  Your financial statements are good, but assets are not 
20 
good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Then that is going be then a qualified audit opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So maybe the best thing is to start with the 
qualified one. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 109 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say if you had no consent – concerns at all it 
would just be an opinion? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  A good opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and if it is just an opinion it is a good opinion, 
because you have some concerns you have to qualify your view of it 
...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you then say unqualified you mean it is a 
good one without any hesitation? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR SOKOMBELA:  Without ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe without any hesitation is not accurate, but 
from an Auditor’s point of view that is the best that any entity can get if 
it is unqualified? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair and also I think us as Auditors also are 
very careful also, because I think when – I think the issue of absolute 
assurance ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is a very – it is a concept on our side that we 
always try to communicate that as ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  As Auditors we do not – we not providing absolute 
assurance. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 110 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Absolute a surety, ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So what that means Chairperson.  Even the 
unqualified audit opinion in the opinion of the Auditor there are no 
material errors or material misstatements.  There may be errors, but 
they may be below a certain threshold or below a certain materiality 
amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that it might not mean it is absolutely clean? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the opinion of the Auditor it is materially fine? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just to follow on from that Chair.  You 
say materially fine.  You have mentioned Mr Sokombela that it is free of 
material misstatement.  Would that also mean that it is free of material 
findings as to for example non-compliance with the PFMA? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, if I can get your indulgence in terms of in the 
context of the Auditor-General in terms of then how then do we look 
20 
into this.  How then in the audit office we have looked into this was to 
say we are going to have categories of these opinions.  The – in the 
unqualified category we have two categories Chair. 
We are going to have a category that will say the financial 
statements are unqualified with no material findings and the reason why 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 111 of 146 
 
we are doing that in terms of the Public Audit Act the Auditor-General is 
required to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements.  
On predetermined objectives or performance information and also on 
compliance with legislation. 
So it becomes then a mandatory requirement then that we 
need to opine on those three areas.  However currently we only express 
an opinion only on the financial statements.  In terms of the audit of 
performance information we only express an opinion in the Management 
reports.  We have not escalated expressing an opinion in the audit 
report. 
10 
So what we do we will have an opinion in the Management 
report, but we will then take out significant findings that we have 
identified and escalate them to the audit report.  So with the 
compliance legislation we do not provide an opinion at all.  We will just 
have material findings and those material findings as well we also 
escalate them to the Auditor’s report. 
So then you may find out then Chairperson that you have got 
this audit opinion.  It is unqualified, but it has got these significant 
findings that we have escalated to the Auditor’s report.  So it makes 
then the audit also not now – not to be good.  As well now, because 
20 
inasmuch as your financial statements you have prepared them 
properly. 
At some cases, because of the capacity issues in the public 
sector.  What we experience as the Auditor-General is the fact that we 
received financial statements as well that have got a lot of errors.  So 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 112 of 146 
 
then we find that there is a lot of effort that is done for us to get them 
to be corrected.  So what we normally do then we escalate that effort to 
the audit report to say. 
Inasmuch as your financial statements are okay, but when 
you gave us they were not okay.  So we will then give them non-
compliance to say the – for example the Public Finance Management 
Act or the Companies Act requires you to submit to us financial 
statements that are free of material misstatements, but when you were 
submitting them to us for audit. 
They had a lot of material errors and misstatements that we 
10 
had to identify through our audit process.  Then that audit then is not 
clean anymore.  Yes.  So that is – I think that I wanted to explain 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That Chairperson.  So that it can be understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is important.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you just remind me what was the audit 
opinion expressed by PwC and Nkonki over the five years that they 
audited? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was in the clean category of these two now.  
20 
Unqualified, but there were no material findings on performance 
information.  There were no material findings on compliance with laws 
and regulations. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But those two was the evidence you were giving just 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 113 of 146 
 
now saying that that is what happens with the Auditor-General’s Office 
as well when it does auditing and that is what happens with most 
maybe many auditing firms.  In other words it is not something unusual. 
Is that what you were seeking to suggest?  If those two are 
not being looked into. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, the – you mean the two – the unqualified with 
findings and unqualified with no findings? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said earlier on in terms of the AG’s – of 
– AG’s Office and this might apply to private firms as well.  You 
expressed opinions on the financial statements, but you do not express 
10 
opinions on certain things. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now I am thinking that what you have just 
mentioned now that they did not deal with was also the same things.  
Did I misunderstand?  I think findings and something else that you said 
you do not express opinions on ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe you should be expressing opinions on. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair, what we should be expressing an opinion on 
is the financial statements.  Is the predetermined objectives or 
20 
performance 
information. 
 
It 
is 
compliance 
with 
legislation 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  But currently we only expressing an opinion on the 
financial statements. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 114 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  On the performance information or predetermined 
objectives we only expressing it in the Management report which is an 
internal document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That we communicate only to Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So out of then that Management report we take out 
significant findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That we take them to the Auditor’s report.  That is a 
public document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That gets to be so.  So in essence we are not 
expressing 
an 
opinion 
both 
on 
performance 
information 
and 
compliance.  It is only on financial statements that we express an 
opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of the standards – professional 
standards – in terms of what is expected of either an Auditor or the 
AG’s Office.  Are you supposed to do anything differently in terms of 
20 
expressing an opinion on those or what you are doing is in accordance 
with what is expected? 
Namely you say you only express an opinion in the 
Management reports and so on.  I want to know whether you are saying 
you know this is what is expected of us, but we know that right now we 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 115 of 146 
 
do not actually meet that standard ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there may be reasons for that ...(intervenes). 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And/or whether you are saying, no.  We actually meet 
the standard.  It is just that maybe we do not do A, B, C, D, but we are 
not expected to do that anyway. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Indeed Chair.  No.  Chair, it is – what we doing is in 
terms of the auditing standards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I must say Chair the difference between the only 
difference between the audit that the Auditor-General performs and the 
audit that the private sector firms – when they are auditing private 
entities performs is the fact that our audit is governed by the Public 
Audit Act and the Public Audit Act requires us to audit those three 
areas ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  But in the private sector ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  The requirement is just to audit financial statements 
only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 116 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did I understand correctly that although 
you do not express an audit opinion on the latter two.  You do express 
material findings in the audit report on those? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   If we can turn then to page 27 of your 
affidavit, can you tell us how it came about that the AG took over the SAA 
audit? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry before that just want to make sure that I 
have miss understood.  You said that PwC and Nkonki for those five years 
of auditing SAA through gave a clean audit, now I know that a clean one 
is the unqualified than a qualified one.   
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is what that is what they did.  You have not 
yet dealt with the question of what the AG’s response was to that is still 
coming, is that right? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   You mean in those years? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, for those, once they became aware in those years, 
20 
Ja? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   No, perhaps we should deal with that now.  
How did the AG respond when each year in its monitoring role, it was 
informed that SAA had obtained ...(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was doing well. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 117 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the audit of South African Airways was 
performed by a reputable firm a global firm which is one of the big four 
firms in South Africa by the name of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and also 
by a medium firm by Nkonki and as part of our con occurrences one of the 
things that I mentioned there is that we would receive an assessment that 
has been done by the Audit Committee in terms of the independence 
issues.  The issues of fees whether there is any non being non consultant 
fees but most importantly there quality results from the Independent 
Regulatory Board for Auditors because as the Auditor-General we believe 
that if then the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors in its 
10 
inspection of the fans has not find anything you know that is suspicious of 
anything.  We had no reason to question whether then the clean audit of 
opinion that has been expressed is appropriate or not.  So yes so that is 
basically then how we looked at it, we viewed at it at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, for the years prior to the year 2015/2016 
financial year, you were not involved? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Other colleagues were involved. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you got involved in the 2015/2016 financial 
20 
year.  Do you know whether the – whether PwC and Nkonki, during any 
one or more of those five year financial years, whether based on what 
was in the public domain, they should have picked up some things which 
they did not pick up and maybe if they had picked those things up, then 
they may have looked at those things and maybe the result would not 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 118 of 146 
 
have been clean audits.  Is that something you have established?  Is it 
something you have not established?  You do not know about? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   We never established that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but did you look into it or not really? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   When I got involved in 2015/2016 for an example I 
would just have high level engagements with them in terms of what is 
happening and share you know specifically I think the areas of 
specialization in the Auditor-General is the audit of compliance.  For an 
example, I would share with them for an example there is a guide from 
National Treasury on irregular expenditure in terms of how that needs to 
10 
be dealt with.  Those will be the documents that I will share with them to 
say look in terms of how then this is done.  So, ja, so that will be – that 
would be the extent that we go into.  One of the important issues Chair 
that maybe I must highlight is the fact that, once us as the Auditor-
General we opt not to audit, we – it becomes difficult then to step in the 
toes of then those Auditors, in the sense that when they sign the audit 
opinion, they sign it in their name.  They become then the people then 
that takes accountability for that specific assignment, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  You – the Auditor-General Office not 
expected to exercise oversight over them or is it expected to do so?  Over 
20 
the private law firms that audit public entities.   
MR SOKOMBELA:   We will provide the oversight Chair but it is limited.  
It is a limited oversight in terms of – for an example – us for example, 
attending Audit Committees with them, when for example they have got 
areas where they are struggling, they can ask us we will give them 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 119 of 146 
 
guidance.  If you remember Chair Annexure D, then when Annexure D is 
completed, by then the partner is then to give them feedback about that.  
We do not go to an extent of saying let me select for an example, let me 
go and review your work, we do not do that ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Yes, Okay, you do not do that out of respect for 
their professionalism ...(intervenes).  
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely, out of respect for example if they are 
telling us that there is no problem, we are fine.  For example you are 
saying in the media they are saying this is what has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. Yes. 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:   They can say no, we have looked at that, it is not 
their issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you can accept their words. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   I can accept that because they are professionals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Sokombela you were 
about to tell us about the, how it came about that the AG took over the 
SAA audit. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, the Auditor-General of South Africa did not 
initiate the take – the take-over or the take back of SAA as an audit.  The 
20 
request for the take-over was done by the then Minister of Finance Mr 
Nhlanhla Nene, and he made that request to the Auditor-General to take-
over the audit for the 2015/2016 financial year.  I must say – also mention 
that when after the SAA moved to the National Department, sorry to 
National Treasury, we also had regular engagements with the shareholder 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 120 of 146 
 
by the name – there was a Team there that was responsible for 
performing oversight to SAA as an entity.  So then the Minister made that 
request in 2015/2016 financial year, I say in my affidavit, it says from 
2016 to 2017 I do not know how we can correct that but he actually 
requested for the 2015/16 financial year and then following then that 
request Chair ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe let us just take care of that.  A 
supplementary affidavit can be made, which you will sign to say you are 
correcting what appears here.   
MR SOKOMBELA:   Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So, you say he made the request in respect 
of the 2015/2016 financial year? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you remember how, how early in the financial 
year he made the request?  Was it before or was it after PwC and Nkonki 
had been appointed? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   It was after we received the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The request? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   The request for the sole appointment of Nkonki. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:   I think the officials of National Treasury, I think upon 
them exercising their oversight, they became aware of this appointment of 
Nkonki and I also think if I remember well they were not in favour of that 
and we received then that request then from the Minister to say instead 
then the audit should be taken back by – should be done by the Auditor-
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 121 of 146 
 
General of South Africa.  Chair upon us then receiving then the request 
from the then Minister of Finance they – we performed a risk assessment 
process, you know to say, okay then there is this request now that we 
need to consider doing the audit of SAA ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was still before the appointment of – re-
appointment of both Nkonki and PwC for 2015/2016? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   It was in that process ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was during that process, okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   It was – it – we received this request I think If I 
remember well after – because the initial request came I think on the 24 
10 
July 2015, but subsequent to that I cannot, I do not have the recollection 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exact dates. 
MR SOKOMBELA:    Of the exact dates, but I think August/September 
that is when then the then Minister then wrote to the Auditor-General you 
know then to take back the audit and then us then as a Team upon 
receiving that request, we conducted a risk assessment to say – to 
determine if we are ready to take this audit back now.  There were five 
considerations or things that we looked into.  The first one being the 
professional and legal requirements associated with the audit of South 
20 
African Airways.  The second one being the skills and the resources 
required to conduct the audit engagement.  The third one being the 
quality assurance measures that will be suitable for the extent and 
complexity of the audit of the size of SAA.  And also, the degree of our 
access to PwC as well as Nkonki, as the predecessor Auditors and as well 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 122 of 146 
 
as also then the independence and ethical requirements that we had to 
look into.  And then Chair once the AGSA – once we have completed then 
that risk assessment the Auditor-General did what he did was to say for 
the 2015/16 financial year we will not be able to take back the audit 
however I may reconsider taking it back for the 2016/17 financial year.  
So that is my recollection of that particular process in terms of then what 
happened, hence then we continued to concur for the reappointment of 
PwC and Nkonki financial year – sorry for Nkonki audit.  Then Chair if I 
fast forward then to 2016 financial year, then I think the Minister at the 
time was no longer the – Mr Nhlanhla Nene, I think it was Minister 
10 
Gordhan if I am not mistaken.  At the time then ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are right Mr Nene had been dropped from 
Cabinet in December, on the 9 t h of December 2015 ...(intervenes).  
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Minister Gordhan had been reappointed to the 
Ministry of Finance a few days after the 9t h December. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Thank you Chair.  Chair then on the, in the Annual 
General Meeting then of – in 2016 of SAA, that is when then the Board of 
20 
SAA made a recommendation to the Shareholder or the Minister to 
appoint them the Auditor-General as the External Auditors of SAA for the 
period 2016/17 financial year which then the Auditor-General accepted 
then that that request, and that is how then we got to be involved and 
start auditing South African Airways. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 123 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but that request was not formally required really 
because if the AG wanted to do the auditing for of SAA  for the 2016/2017 
financial year, all it needed was not to concur in the appointment of any 
External Auditors.  Is that right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   That is right Chair even though I think the practice in 
the office is also not to necessarily push for that.  We do allow entities 
even in the Annual General Meetings to reappoint us, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   But in terms of ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Strictly speaking it is not necessary 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But for a good working relationship it might be a good 
thing. 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.  Mr Sokombela if we can pick it up 
on page 28, you say there that the Auditor-General Mr Makwethu himself 
took the decision and that he lead the high level engagements prior to the 
decision.  Is that the normal practice for the Auditor-General himself to do 
that? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair the Auditor-General normally does not do that, 
however because of the magnitude and the risks associated with this 
assignment, the Auditor-General took it upon himself to be personally 
involved in this decision. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And has he retained a personal involvement in 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 124 of 146 
 
the audit? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely.  He is still very closely involved even 
now. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And you also say at paragraph 52 that the 
sign off was delegated to the National Leader of Audit Services.  Is that 
common practice to delegate to someone that high up? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair it was the first of its kind at the time because 
normally the delegation, the Auditor-General normally delegates the 
audits to be signed off from the level that is just below the National 
Leader.  Because the National Leader needs to be busy with the audit 
10 
strategy of the organisation, so will not have time to be signing the audit 
reports.  But at the time the Auditor-General deemed it fit that the 
seniority in the organisation needs to be demonstrated as well and that 
he is how he took the assignment, the taking back of the taking over of 
South African Airways as very, very important. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And another way in which you indicate it was 
taken seriously was in terms of the resources put into the audit.   
MR SOKOMBELA:   Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you take us through the human financial 
and other resources that went into the 2017 audit? 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Yes Chair you know in – there – in that year what 
happened was that the there was a selection process that was made in 
the sense that myself the I was – before being involved in the audit of 
South African Airways my role was that of a Senior Manager responsible 
for technical support, however because of then at the time of my 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 125 of 146 
 
involvement then I was requested then to lead the engagement and also 
to ensure then that myself and my colleagues then we select the audit 
professionals in the whole organisation that are very good, are very 
sharp, demonstrated competency especially in the space of State Owned 
Entities.  During that selection process we insured that we then need to 
get people that have got sufficient audit experience.  They – people that 
have got technical know-how, especially in the application of the 
international financial reporting standards.  And also the most important 
thing was people that demonstrated performance in terms of then insuring 
that they can perform and can deliver the task.  And after formulating 
10 
then that Team we had a Team then that was responsible for the 
regulatory side of the audit assignment, meaning that the audit of 
financial statements, the audit of compliance legislation, the audit of 
performance information, and also we had the audit Team that was 
responsible for the audit of information systems, excuse me at SAA 
because SAA is a highly IT complicated business, so we needed to ensure 
then that we have got professionals then that are qualified with the know-
how in terms of that.  One of the other important thing also was to have 
people also who have got experience in risk assessments especially for 
tenders – for big tenders and that will be able then to give us insights and 
20 
also people that will be able to do data analytics and analyse complex 
contracts at SAA because SAA has got very, very complex contracts.  One 
other important issue to mention Chair, was that the support from our by 
the name of the Audit Research Development was very important to 
ensure then that that Team at all times, they get priority when then there 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 126 of 146 
 
are complex issues that are there, and one of the things they did for us 
was to ensure then that they get the annual report of the prior year, they 
analyse it the annual report, they identify areas where there might be 
risks, that us as the audit Team then we need to prioritize or be aware of 
and look into them and also our Legal Services Division in the Auditor-
General of South Africa was very closely involved to ensure then that they 
will offer advice on certain contracts and certain issues.  So that was the 
effort then that was made for us then to ensure then that we take this 
assignment, we execute it to our best ability Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And can you describe for us the steps you 
10 
took in order to understand SAA’s business? 
MR SOKOMBELA:   Chair, the preparation of that audit on our side we 
took it very, very seriously and we ensured then that for us to perform 
this assignment successfully we need to ensure that we invest sufficient 
time and resources to it and what we ensured then that we do was to 
ensure then that we engage the Auditee in the name of SAA, and also we 
engage our previous Auditor or predecessor Auditors and we had a lot of 
meetings I think in December 2016, specifically at the level of the Acting 
CEO of SAA, at the level of the then interim CFO at SAA, we had 
engagements with all the heads of departments.   
20 
We requested a lot of information from your policy documents, 
governance documents, the Minutes of the Board, you know for us to 
ensure then that we assess, we evaluate in terms of then to understand 
the business of SAA.  In January 2017 also we continued to ensure then 
that we learn in terms of how the business is wired, you know?  And one 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 127 of 146 
 
of the critical issues then that we need to do is to engages these 
stakeholders to have training and consultation as well, and one of the 
things if you look at page 31 of the affidavit form paragraph 60.1 is that 
what we did was to ensure then that when we get there we need to get 
trained by an Aviation expert and we requested one of the big four audit 
firms, you know that have got experience globally, that audit airlines to 
get us that expert.   
That expert then was based in London so he flew to South Africa 
at the time and he conducted training and also he was available for 
consultations also throughout the audit process.  One of the key topics 
10 
that he covered at the time was the economics of the aviation industry, 
the profitability of the airlines, what are the challenges that are faced by 
the carriers especially the ones in Africa among others.  We also had a 
lot of engagements with PricewaterhouseCoopers as well as Nkonki 
Incorporation with a view of gaining insights in terms of the risk areas 
that require attention and also I must mention that this is a requirement 
of the auditing standards as well because when you come as a new 
Auditor it is incumbent then to you to actually ensure then that we engage 
with the predecessor Auditor.   
The Executive Management Team of SAA was very helpful 
20 
Chairperson as well as in terms of insuring they were available when we 
needed them.  And also we requested them to do an induction for us, you 
know to induct us in terms of their business you know what are they 
doing, you know because it is easy to go to an airport and see and get 
into a plane and get into a destination but we wanted to know the 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 128 of 146 
 
mechanics you know that are involved in terms of then running the 
business.   
We wanted to understand their strategy in terms of what is it 
they want to achieve as a business.  What is their role in the South 
African economy?  And also we wanted to understand the subsidiaries, 
the divisions that South African Airways has and the Engagement Team 
also we – as the Engagement Team also we conducted our own regular 
engagements because as we go out to engage with all of these various 
stakeholders, we needed then to come back and reflect as a Team in 
terms of – out of all this information that we are getting from these 
10 
engagements, what are the risks?  What can go wrong you know in the 
business itself?   
So we call those engagements risk assessment sessions, where 
then we deliberate everybody in the audit Team will have an engagement 
then to contribute.  The other conscious decision that we made was to 
say perhaps let us get another private firm that has got an experience in 
auditing aviation entities.  And when we made then that decision, because 
what we did not want to do is to get into SAA and pretend that we know 
how the industry operates.  And when we get there then we ensure that 
the high risk areas in that industry, then the professionals from the firm 
20 
itself then are going to be involved in terms of providing guidance to our 
Teams, giving insights in terms of how certain areas needs to be dealt 
with and if I can mention a few in terms of then these high risk areas, it is 
the issue of growing concern because SAA was – had significant or 
serious liquidity challenges at the time.  And there is cash flow focus that 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 129 of 146 
 
they do based on the passenger numbers and the revenue that they going 
to make and those assumptions can be quite complex so we needed then 
to gain insights from people then that have been there that have looked 
into things.   
One other important component that – for SAA is very complex is 
the airline revenue, the revenue from tickets.  It is a very, very complex 
area to look into.  There are also specialised components in the aviation 
industry where you do not find them in other entities that are not airlines.  
For an example, they have got a balance that is called maintenance 
reserves and that balance is also very, very complicated because there is 
10 
a lot of assumptions that are made there to have that balance.   
And also there is also another balance also that is called 
provision for lease liabilities because that balance also – because SAA 
has got a lot of aircrafts that they have leased out and there are certain 
conditions then in those leases where then SAA needed to return the 
aircrafts in the conditions that they were delivered at.  So, then that 
creates a liability then for SAA to ensure then that they keep on 
maintaining the aircrafts over their useful lives as they are utilising the 
aircrafts.  So, there is a lot of assumptions that are made there.  There is 
a lot of transactions and these transactions can amount to billions of 
20 
Rands.  So those were the very, very complex areas.  Definitely the 
property aircraft and equipment also as a balance is a very, very 
complicated and specialised area.   
Chair our Internal Quality Control Business Unit also was very, 
very involved because we did not want them the quality control to come 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 130 of 146 
 
only at the end of the audit process.  But we wanted quality control to 
happen on a regular basis to ensure then that any non-compliance from 
our Team with the auditing standards is picked up early enough to ensure 
that we do not get into a risk of expressing an inappropriate audit 
opinion.   
And also, what we did also we looked for a private firm that has 
got a person that has got experience in aviation also to do an external 
quality control assessment control as well in the audit.  We call that pre-
issuance review.  A pre-issuance review what it means is that before the 
audit report is signed that person needs to review the work and needs to 
10 
say, I am happy with this audit opinion.  So that is one of the critical 
areas then that we ensure then that we need to deal with.   
SAA also is a taxpayer in terms of them having to pay the 
personal income tax, the value added tax and those tax treatments of 
their transactions as well can be quite complicated.  And we ensured then 
that we needed to get a tax specialist to actually be part of the Team as 
well so that they can be able then to provide us with insides in terms of 
then the tax matters at SAA.   
Chair throughout the audit of South African Airways I think it is 
worth noting that we engaged and communicated on a regular basis with 
20 
all the governance structures, the Audit Committee, the Chairperson of 
the Board, the Board Members, the Executive Management Team to 
ensure then that everybody is kept abreast in terms of then how the audit 
process is happening.   
Chair I think one of the things that I think I have highlighted in 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 131 of 146 
 
paragraph 61 of the affidavit is the issue of this learning of the business 
and the operating environment at SAA.  It came with a significant 
financial investment to the Auditor-General of South Africa.  When we 
were doing our budgeting in terms of then how much is it going to cost us, 
we thought then this is going to cost us 5 500 hours and I want to 
mention that these hours we said is going to be our investment time.  
What it means is that we are not going to claim it at SAA because we 
need to learn the business and that learning curve it needs to be – we are 
not going to bill SAA.  We said, okay audit fees, we are prepared to write 
off 5 500 hours on an equivalent of 7 million Rands.   
10 
However, Chair the actual number of investment hours that we 
ended up with were more than 14 000 hours and we ended up writing off 
about 40 million Rands in terms of the potential audit fees that we ought 
to have claimed at SAA.  Because we thought that it is important for us to 
invest quite a lot of time to have – to understand the business Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how big was – what was the number of the group 
that audited SAA from the AG’s Office?  I am just thinking about this very 
high number of hours, 14 000. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair it was a big group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  I used to joke when I talked to people that at SAA, we 
had including the contracted in resources we would be about 70 people.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So, it was quite a big group. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was quite massive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 132 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was a massive Team.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  When we were having meetings, we will have them in 
an Auditorium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would the size of – would that big size of the 
group have been decided upon because of what – because the AG’s 
Office might have realised there were huge problems?  The opinions that 
had been expressed before that everything was fine were possibly very 
wrong or was this size decided upon because there was a sense that 
there is a lot of trouble here?  We need a lot of people.  Or is that 
10 
something you would not know because you did not make the decision on 
the size? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair the size was because of the size of the audit of 
SAA.  Because SAA at the time was the biggest State-Owned Entity that 
we had because they generated revenue in excess of 30 billion Rands.  
So that was a big Team.  The issue of risk as well Chairperson, yes, we 
did consider risks also we were formulating the Team.  However, I think 
one of the big factors was the fact that SAA is a big company.  So, we 
needed to ensure then that we have got sufficient resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  How did this investment that you made in the 
SAA audit compare with other audits that the AG performs? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It was – Chair it was a big investment.  It was a big 
investment in the sense that I think in other audits we do write off fees 
but not to this magnitude.  So, when I look into the investment time that 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 133 of 146 
 
we did not claim at SAA visa vie other Auditors that I have been involved 
with, this is the biggest. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It occurs to me that something I did not cover 
earlier in the context of the mandate and role of the AG is the way that 
the AG generates revenue.  Do public entities pay fees to the Auditor-
General rather than the Auditor-General be allocated funds? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair the – there are independent issues that I think 
the laws I think have been made specifically for the Auditor-General 
because the Auditor-General does not get an allocation or an equitable 
share.  So how the Auditor General operates his business model is that 
10 
you need to have professionals that are going to bill the clients and that 
ensures our independence.   
So, when we audit, we also like any other audit firm table the 
budget in the – with Management in the Audit Committees and requires to 
them to approve like any other person.  And we have to justify why a 
certain audit fee needs to be paid as oppose to us given an allocation 
because that would impair our independence.  There may be unintended 
consequences for us as an audit office to be given an allocation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed.  Thank you.  I would now like to turn 
to the substance of the audit in the 2017 financial year and in particular 
20 
the areas of concern that you identified.  I am aware I have skipped over 
the completion of the audit in your affidavit but I think it makes sense to 
deal with that when we get to the end of it. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just before you proceed. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 134 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I heard evidence some time last year that one or 
more of the years from 2011 to 2016 – 2015 may have been a year or 
there may have been years where SAA failed to present their financial 
statements and so on for some time.  Is that something that you 
remember? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair what I can remember is that both the 2014/15 
audit results and the 2015/16 audit results were only released in 
September 2016.  Those two financial years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would that timing indicate that there may have been 
10 
problems or not? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  The challenge Chair at the time was SAA not being 
able to prove its going concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Whether it is a going concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why – and that was during some of those years 
that you are talking about. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Because I seem to remember that at a certain 
time when Minister Nene was still the Minister of Finance and I think it 
20 
was during a time when there were issues about airbuses and some deal.  
There was an issue between the Board of SAA and the Minister of 
Finance about the presentation of submission of financial statements.  Ja 
okay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 135 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In fact, in 2017 there was a delay in the 
financial statements, was there not? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You deal with that at paragraph 65.  Would you 
like to explain that? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Or before you do that let me ask this question.  Would a 
delay in submitting financial statements on the part of a public entity like 
SAA be the kind of thing that would indicate to an auditing firm that there 
may be problems or not necessarily?  Would it be something to be 
10 
flagged?  Would it be something that attracts their attention to say let us 
look deep into this? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair it depends in terms of what it is that is maybe 
making the entity ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reason for the delay. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Delay, the reason for the delay.  For and example at 
SAA one of the things that they could not be able to prove was whether 
they will be able to continue to operate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Excuse me- because of money. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes, they did not have money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But is that the kind of thing that would say to an 
Auditor who is responsible for auditing that entity when you audit this 
entity you need to be really careful – look carefully before you issue an 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 136 of 146 
 
unqualified audit or not really? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  It will be one of the factors Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  To say you – we call it in auditing professional 
scepticism. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  You need to be sceptical and ensure then that 
whatever was troubling the entity before you sign the audit report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  If there is no issue, you are sure that there is no 
10 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  You were going to explain the 
delay in the financial statements specifically in 2017. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair in 2017 it became – it was the same issue.  
Because I remember when we joined – when we became the Auditors of 
South African Airways there was a problem with SAA not being able to pay 
its loans or its debt when it is for due.  So, there were lots of 
deliberations that the executive Management Team and the Board were 
making with the Consortium of Banks at the time because the financial 
20 
situation at the time it was very difficult for them and the banks also were 
not willing to extend for a longer period of time.   
For an example they will extend it for three months and extend it 
for three months and then the challenge then that SAA had is that if you 
extend, made to pay you in three months’ time, the financial reporting 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 137 of 146 
 
framework that I prepare financial statements using as SAA requires me 
to make a declaration in my financial statements that in the next 12 
months I will still be able to operate.  So, if I am not able to pay my 
creditors or the banks within the next 12 months I do not have – I cannot 
demonstrate that I will have the money.  Then the accounting framework 
then does not allow then for the financial statements to be prepared on a 
going concerned basis.  It would be maybe on a liquidation basis or 
whatever basis then that they need to be prepared with.   
So, then that in 2017 Chair then that became a big issue 
because there were no – there was no funding that SAA can have.  And 
10 
the Board was not comfortable at the time to submit financial statements 
to us for audit.  For an example in terms of the legislation the public 
entity like SAA is required to submit financial statements for us to audit 
by 31 s t of May each year.  However, in 2017 they could not submit the 
financial statements because they could not prove going concern at all.  
And they had to obtain a formal commitment form their shareholder which 
is South African Government whether then their shareholder will be able 
then to inject further equity into the business. 
Ja, so I think that was the challenge Chair that they had even 
though they ended up giving us I think financial statements by 31s t of 
20 
October 2017 because there were a couple of – there were funds then 
that the shareholder at the time National Treasury gave to SAA and they 
were able then to prove going concern. Then they submitted to us and 
then we ended up signing the financial statements on the 8 t h of December 
2017. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 138 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – sorry.  That difficulty that SAA struggled with 
which you have just told me about in 2017 about these financial 
statements not being able to prove that for the next 12 months they will 
be able to be – to pay creditors.  I get the impression that that is a very 
serious situation that any company can find itself in – any entity can find 
itself in.   
Is it possible that an Auditor who had been auditing such a 
company for the previous four years or so could issue a clean audit for 
each one of those previous years without having picked up any problem 
10 
that shows that in due course there is going to be this problem?  Or is it 
possible that they may pick such a problem up but it would not be the 
time for them to say there is a problem because maybe the problem will 
manifest itself in another financial year?  But I would have thought that 
when you do – when you audit this year you are supposed to alert 
Management to what problems may arise in the financial year – in the 
next financial year as well if possible.   
I know you said that you Auditors audit history but are you able 
to assist me?  If you ask me on law, I will tell you that if a certain a 
problem in a case arises on the last day of the trial, I might be able to tell 
20 
you that that problem should have been picked up much earlier. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, is this not possible in auditing? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair I know that I said we audit history.  And the 
issue of going concern is one of the exceptions to that because if you find 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 139 of 146 
 
out that the entity has got liquidity problems, they may be able to 
convince you as an Auditor that, withing 12 months we can still survive.  
But there might be a lot of uncertainties in that process as an Auditor.   
That is why then an Auditor then – the auditing standards 
especially that deals with going concern, because there is a specific 
auditing standard that deal with going concern, gives then an Auditor an 
option to highlight the uncertainty in the audit report to say, in as much 
as this entity is saying that they are a going concern I am highlighting to 
you that there are these uncertainties that are there.  And the reason for 
that Chairperson is that there are many people that uses financial 
10 
statements and the audit report is the one that most people that are using 
financial statements they always go and read. 
And it is important then that for you as an Auditor then you 
highlight those challenges so that when then people are making decisions 
based on those financial statements, they know then that the Auditor has 
highlighted those specific issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And actually when you audit an entity is it not the 
position that part of the usefulness of your report is that other people who 
may do business with this entity may look at that report or look at to see 
whether this is a financially viable entity to do business with.  Is that 
20 
right? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So therefore, when any Auditor audits it is one of the 
critical things to do to see whether what they say about the financial 
health of this entity is accurate. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 140 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they know other people and other businesses 
may rely on this report to do business with them for the next 12 months or 
whatever. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Is there – just to pick up on that Chair.  Is 
there other reliance that is placed on audit reports other than by other 
businesses? 
10 
MR SOKOMBELA:  There is a lot of various users of reports Chair.  If it is 
a public entity from the shareholder of that public entity because we will 
rely on the audit report to see if governance issues – if maybe the Board 
is running the entity properly.  Parliament especially then the oversight 
like your Portfolio Committees in Parliament would like also- would rely 
on that audit report.   
Creditors or the suppliers of the business because for then to 
see that their monies are safe also, they need to see in terms of how the 
audit reports looks like.  The employees also of the entity because also 
they want to see their prospects whether then their salaries are still going 
20 
to be paid or not.  Ja, so there is a whole host of different users with 
different objectives and different agendas that they would want to utilise 
the audit report for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And well from what you are saying it seems to me that 
therefore any Auditor auditing an entity would pay particular attention to 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 141 of 146 
 
the question of the going concern status of the entity going forward for 
the next whatever maybe 12 months of whatever period.  Is that correct? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair that is correct because we even have an 
auditing standard that deals with going concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So that is then – that then demonstrate the 
seriousness of evaluating going concern as an Auditor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now against that background or maybe I should 
ask the question.  Had PwC and Nkonki in their audit reports of 
2011/2012 financial year, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and even 
10 
2015/2016, had they indicated anything that showed you that there may 
be problems – there could be problems of on the status of SAA as a going 
concern or had they not? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair based on my inspections of the report I have not 
seen any of those on their audit reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I know I may be going much ahead of you but 
maybe for completeness it is important to deal with it now.  Having looked 
at what PwC and Nkonki had done did you form any opinion whether how 
20 
it came about that they did not flag this issue?  How they could have 
missed it?  Is that something that you are able to establish to say, well 
maybe it is inexplicable how they did not pick it up.  Any Auditor worth his 
or her salt would have picked this up.   
Or it was a little tricky, it is complicated, it is understandable if 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 142 of 146 
 
some Auditor did not pick it up.  Or you might say, no but really these 
were very experienced Auditors.  This is a big auditing firm PwC, Nkonki 
is a medium firm as you said, there is no way they were not aware of this.  
So, if they did not flag it or say anything it must be pointing to something 
else. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know I may be putting you in a difficult position. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I want to try and understand because one of the 
things that we are trying to do is what happened, why were certain things 
10 
not picked up for SAA to be where it ended up being and in terms of State 
Capture who played what role?  And did everybody do their part the way 
they should have done? 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Chair on my side I would not like to speculate in terms 
of what were the circumstances that the previous Auditors had to – or 
were faced with or they had to evaluate at the time.  However, if the 
circumstances were the same as our own circumstances when we took 
back SAA audit.  Ja, it would be surprising why they would not have 
highlighted that.  However, I think the most important thing Chair is that I 
am very careful to say I am going to go to the period that I was not 
20 
involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Because there may be specific considerations or 
certain considerations that they may have made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 143 of 146 
 
MR SOKOMBELA:  That made them not to highlight the issue of going 
concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I think you have put it quite carefully and I 
think – so you say if they were faced with the same circumstances that 
you were faced with looking at SAA, you would be surprised why they did 
not pick it.  You do not know if they were faced with the same 
circumstances, can I then put this, but being an Auditor of many years’ 
experience have got any reason to think their circumstance may have 
been different?  In terms of what an Auditor needs to have in order to pick 
up certain things.  Is there something that you think might have been 
10 
different?  I know you are – I am not asking you to be definite. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Yes.  Chair maybe what I can say is that when we took 
back – when it took SAA the audit of SAA, there were loans that were 
extended to end of December 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  And SAA did not have money to pay them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  The audit reports were signed on the – on September 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Then that is October, November, December, that is 
three months after the audit report has been signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  So, I do not know whether maybe they when the audit 
report was signed whether they had sight of those challenges or not. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 144 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  However, when we came we were inundated with 
those troubles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOKOMBELA:  Where SAA could not demonstrate their ability to pay 
the loans from the banks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, that might be an appropriate moment at 
which to adjourn.  I see it is 16:00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How much time do we need to finish with him? 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I would think probably an hour and a half 
perhaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the other witness for tomorrow is likely to 
take how long? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The remainder of the day Chair but we are 
relatively confident we can complete with some hesitation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must know that you are on your own on making any 
undertaking. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I checked first Chair.  I checked first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe that is fine.  Should we start a little early 
20 
tomorrow or should we stick to normal time? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair perhaps we could start at 09:30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If that would be convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your feeling is that maybe even 10:00 might be fine. 
20 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 216 
 
Page 145 of 146 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Even 10:00 might be fine indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, can we leave it at 10:00 on the understanding 
that if I change my mind and advise you in the course of this evening, you 
might be able just to advise the witness as to be here a little bit earlier?
