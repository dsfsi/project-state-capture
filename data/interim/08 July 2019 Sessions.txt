questions without mentioning the initials on the page numbers so do not 
get confused when she does that.  She will just focus on the numbers 
without the letters.  So for example when she says page 4 she will be 
meaning JMM4 so… - so but you were right to say JMM4 because that 
is what is written there.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a supplementary affidavit which will deal with this 
to say in this affidavit I have picked up the following corrects. This is 
how it should have been.  Basically what you have told us to be put in 
an affidavit form.  Okay no that is fine. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  
Thank you.  Ambassador can I please take you to – to page 8 that is 
where your profile appears.   
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Could you just summarise – you have started it 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 14 of 183 
 
– it starts from 20 – in fact it starts from 2006 maybe you should start 
from page 7 because that is where you start from 2001, 2006 and then 
take us through your career and where you have served the country as 
an ambassador in various states throughout the world.   
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Chair I had two lives.  
There was a life before 1994 where I served the current ruling party as 
their envoy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  In foreign countries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  In Sweden where we run 
the office to mobilise international support, solidarity and the resources 
to support the struggles in South Africa.  And then the then President of 
the ANC Oliver Thambo then moved me from Sweden to Japan, Tokyo to 
open up the first ANC office in North Pacific dealing with Japan, South 
Korea, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei all those countries in the 
North Pacific again for the same reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  To mobilise support for 
the ANC.  Mobilise material support to conduct the struggles, to ask the 
20 
countries to implement sanctions.  Internally speaking to make people 
conscious about the brutalities of apartheid.  And then Chair in that 
context I received President Mandela twice in Japan. In 1990 when he 
was released and 1991.  And then after the ruling party was unbanned I 
used to come home temporarily.  We were given a week to come home 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 15 of 183 
 
and back into exile or three weeks to go back into exile.  That torturous 
period of your life where you taste home, then you go back into exile.  
But finally Chair I came back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  After voting in Tokyo.  I 
voted in Tokyo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In 1994? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  1994. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Then I came home with 
10 
my family and then work came into DIRCO 1 August 1994.  We were 17 
of us who were former ANC envoys abroad called Chief Representative 
who were then moved to the then Department of Foreign Affairs as 
Deputy Directors.  So that is how I was inducted and that was my 
second life now.  This time around serving a democratic South Africa.  
And then Chair I was then posted to India as the first South African 
High Commissioner to India to open up the embassy there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  In India until 1999.  
Came home, get promoted to a Chief Director and served in the office 
20 
of the Director General at that time.  And in 2001 I was then posted to 
Belgium to European Union as and Envoy there but also covering the 
Grand Duke of Luxemburg.  So it was both bilateral Belgium/South 
Africa, Luxemburg/South Africa and multilateral with the European 
Union and part of that was because at that time the European Union 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 16 of 183 
 
was the biggest trading partner of South Africa, close 60% of our trade 
was European Union.  And there were a number of agreement to be 
negotiated with the European Union for market access of our products.  
Like wines and spirits we were a mid-size marketing of wines and 
spirits to the European Union and wanted to take up the – more quotas 
and part of that was because of job creations in the wine industry.  But 
also because of the foreign exchange so we managed to get additional 
quotas from 21 to 52 – 51 million litres of wine.  And then the auto 
selling of the cars.  Because Chair you recall the new democracy the 
local content of our cars there was about 5/6% but we are revving up 
10 
local content.  We are producing more parts in South Africa.  And once 
they reached 66%, 67% local content the – that threshold the – in terms 
of the – the ruse of origin you can say it is my car.  So that at the time 
we reached that threshold of 66% of content of the cars we could then 
send them duty free to the European Union.  So we had to have that 
agreement.  And the third one was on the Science and Technology 
Agreement because we are a new democracy obsolete technologies you 
have 
to 
again 
mobilise 
new 
technologies 
for 
the 
input 
into 
manufacturing in particular.  Telecommunication and other systems.  
Health education.  So we then had an agreement with the European 
20 
Union on Science and Research.  So for every scientist they sent here 
we sent scientist to European Union in that case we create the capacity 
and you know for manufacturing.  But the sum total of all this Chair was 
that you see a growth in terms of the quant ant of trade from mineral 
resources, from raw material you see the quant ant increases.  So that 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 17 of 183 
 
was part of responsibility.  But also because we used to get a grant, an 
envelope, European Development Fund in the region of about 130 
million Euros free grants to help South Africa and that fund was very 
necessary for us because you recall Chair we are still developing the 
capacity of local government, provincial government, even national 
government departments in terms of policy system procedures.  It was 
a period where we – this new democracy was building systems to make 
sure that we can function efficiently.  At the same time establishing 
institutions like Human Rights and others for accountability purposes to 
make sure that there is a – there is a system of accountability.  So the 
10 
executive can be held accountable.  So this was very nice and very 
fragile, very new systems so we needed grants that does not burden 
the fiscus in that area of work but also to expose bureaucrats, officials 
to those countries to go and lend, to go and study how other countries 
have dealt with these issues.  The issue here Chair was to make sure 
that as this new democracy take roots in the Parliament, in the 
executive, in bureaucracy at all level of governments there is a 
capacity being created because it does take time.  More so it was in the 
context 
of 
transformation. 
 
Racial 
issues, 
perceptions 
issues, 
movement of people from rural to urban, new departments, new 
20 
officials, new acquaintances, governance.  So it was a period where 
there was so much influx so we needed that type of envelope from 
European Union which could be used to capacitate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  For example we – then 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 18 of 183 
 
we got funds in 2003 for Limpopo to train local government officials to 
know what it is to be a local government.  To be MEC, to be a Mayor, to 
be MLA, how to respond to the people’s things, how you study 
legislations etcetera, etcetera.  So that was that period.  So part of our 
responsibility Chair was to make sure that that money continues to 
flow.  Chair I was giving the extension by President Mbeki.  President 
Mandela was – when he was India now President Mbeki is in charge so 
he sent me to Brussels.  So he gave me one year extension because at 
that time I was assisting with the Congolese issue.  You recall there 
was a Sun City Process. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Where South Africa was 
helping the Congolese. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  To find peace and now 
most of them were based in Brussels in Belgium so I have to make sure 
that they are assisted to go to Sun City so that the – as exclusive as 
possible, transparent so that at the end of the day Congolese at home – 
abroad can own up to the process and that is what [indistinct] is.  So 
for this reason President Mbeki gave me an extension.  So I came back 
20 
in 2006.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  When I came back 2006 
Chair I was then given various responsibilities in government.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 19 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  You know I was a DDG 
Asia / Middle East. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And part of that was 
because perhaps President Mbeki thought I know Asia since I went 
there in 1988. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And I dealt with those 
countries in the area.  But part of this was because – part of my career 
was to develop the strategy for government, the policy for government.  
10 
So then we had to develop the strategy for India, strategy for China, 
strategy for the Gulf, strategy for Japan.  How do we access those 
markets?  And we have a role to play because we saw a huge potential 
in Asia / Middle East.  At that time Chair the trade between South Africa 
and Asia / Middle East was not that pronounced but we thought we can 
do better.  And so over a period of time like now you see the biggest 
market of South Africa is no longer Europe anymore it is Asia / Middle 
East.  Almost  R880 billion close to a trillion with the EU is almost half 
of that so you could see that change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Or the [indistinct] South 
African Foreign Policy from Europe, Asia / Middle East, Latin American 
and Africa have borne fruits for the economy.  So that was part of our 
responsibility to do but at the same time we had to deal with BRICS 
formation.  I developed the BRICS strategy.  What the government 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 20 of 183 
 
should do in the BRICS.  What is IMPSA focal point India, Brazil and 
then we have the multilateral engagement.  So you have South Africa, 
Africa and China it is called FOCAC I was the focal point of that.  How 
do we as South Africa and Africa deal with China?  Then you have 
Japan, Africa, it is called TICAD I was the focal point for TICAD.  India, 
Africa I was focal point for India, Africa.  So we have these polo lateral 
arrangements where Africa was trying to access this huge merging 
market going forward. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  At the same side Chair I 
10

Could you just in summary then we do not know what Ambassadors do 
but what we know is that when you go overseas and you go to the meet 
the Ambassador you get entertained, taken to lunch, but exactly what 
is… 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Taken to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To lunch.  Ja.  We have had very kind 
Ambassadors in New York I hope you are that kind?  But…

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I am not sure Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja but what in summary what is it that 
Ambassadors are supposed to do really for the country when they are 
posted elsewhere in the world? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Chair Ambassadors 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 23 of 183 
 
called Plenipotentiary and Extraordinaire.  In other words they are the 
representatives of the heads of state.  Where a head of state through a 
letter of credentials, letter of credence says to a counterpart in the 
receiving state let me say in Belgium.  I am sending Jerry Matjila as my 
trusted person so please accredit him to do the job there.  If you have 
any sensitive issue you want to communicate to me that is my person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is my representative. 
AMBASSADOR 
JERRY 
MATTHEWS 
MATJILA: 
 
That 
is 
my 
representative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So you are the ears, the 
eyes and the spokesperson all the heads of state.  And you represent 
all government departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  That is why – that is 
why you fly the flag in your car.  The car has your flag of the country.  
And that is why in your house you call it the residence there is a flag of 
the republic there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  In the office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  That is why in your 
house you have the heads of state photo there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  The Ministers photo 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  In your office you have 
them there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because you are 
regarded as the representative of the heads of state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why I guess you are – you are referred to 
as His Excellency is that – does that come in? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Precisely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Excellency Bruce 
Koloane ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  That is why you are His 
Excellency.  Very few people have this title His Excellency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So – but you have made a very important 
point to which I think you were – Ms Norman was still going to come.  
You say the head of state is saying to the receiving head of state this is 
my trusted representative. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore I am – I take it that a person occupying 
the position of Ambassador must have a high degree of integrity, is that 
correct? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Integrity, knowledge, 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 25 of 183 
 
expertise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And a trust of the head 
of state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The trust of the head of state. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because that is why 
when you come there Chair that letter from your President you take it to 
the head of state.  You meet the head of state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja face to face. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And you hand it over to 
10 
the head of state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Who opens it, read it 
and then you sit down with the head of state whether it is a King, the 
Majesty, the President, you sit down and then you discuss a 
relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Will ask you thank you

AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  She receives it, looks 
through it when it comes into The Netherlands and then have a chat 
over a cup of coffee arranged by Protocol.  It is just a small ceremony 
because some – some people make very elaborate ceremonies.  Going 
there by house card, queen’s card.  I do not know how I must go there 
but something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  It is a very elaborate 
thing.  You know you going to the queen’s … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  You know.  Those who 
go the majesty’s but some of us we are not going there.  It is just a 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 28 of 183 
 
small thing but the majesty’s one.  Sometimes they make it very 
elaborate, very pomp and then you have that discussion with the 
majesty in which the majesty welcomes you and ask you to – to thank 
Heads of State but the same time it might be a letter recalling the one 
who was there before you.  So that it is not you and somebody else.  
So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So this is the letter

Page 29 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We go to what page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I was just asking that this be admitted as 
exhibit Mr Chairman – FF12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  We … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We had not done that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We had not – yes – we had not done that 
yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ma’am.  The file containing a letter from 
Dr Cassius Lubisi Director-General and Secretary to the Cabinet 
addressed to Mr Peter Pedlar will be marked EXHIBIT FF12. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As the Chair pleases.  Thank you.  Thank 
you Ambassador, can you go back now to EXHIBIT FF11 which has your 
affidavit. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We have covered paragraphs 1 up to five 
with the process that you have already testified to.  Could you then tell 
the Chairperson - you were asked by the Commission is that correct to 
20 
answer certain questions.  One of the questions that you were asked 
was …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I saw that Ambassador you took an affirmation and 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 30 of 183 
 
not an oath – not an oath but I see that this is in oath form.  Is that fine 
with you - your statement/affidavit? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Yes.  Yes it is oath 
form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine.  Is it fine? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Well Chair I was asked 
is it oath or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Affirmation. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I took oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Then she says if I am 
not a practicing Christian or religious then affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I thought it is the same 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  But Chair if it is not the 
same thing I will stay with the oath. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You have no problem? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I do not have a problem 
with the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   No that is fine.  That is fine. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I just thought maybe I 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 31 of 183 
 
have a leeway to move either way but (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine.  I just want … 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I have to be very 
consistent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I was just wondering whether there was a mistake.  
So – okay no that is – that is in order then. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Then you were asked just to 
give a summary of what is the process that DIRCO would engage in 
10 
when there is a request from a foreign country for landing in South 
Africa and then you deal with that process in paragraph 5.  Could you 
just briefly tell the Chairperson what that process is? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
Chairperson 
once 
DIRCO through the bilateral desk receives a note verbale from the 
resident mission foreign in the country.  The bilateral desk notifies the 
protocol of the receipt of that note and then in the note we expect them 
to indicate the purpose of the request, the timing of the request and the 
places … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess the purpose of the visit? 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Of the visit yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and the time … 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The time when the visit is proposed to happen? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  That is right. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 32 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And the nature - is it a 
State Official, is it working or it is private.  So once that part has been 
agreed upon we have to find if the Head of State – our Head of State is 
okay with the request especially the timing because there are 
(indistinct) issues and once we are certain that indeed the President is 
okay with this type of visit and is affirmed then the preparations start 
and part of that preparations may entail convening interdepartmental 
meetings to say here is the request from country A for this kind of visit 
and our President has consented to this visit. 
10 
So we then develop content.  What should be achieved?  
Were there any agreements to be signed?  What should be the outcome 
of the visit and then the protocol looks into the facilitation of the visit.  
The place of the visit?  Where is going to be the arrival of the visit?  
What movements will it entail?  The venues, the hotel, the 
transportation. 
This is the protocol to arrange transportation.  How many 
people will be coming there?  So we – we then – we then prepare a 
submission to the Minister and to the President to say we think the best 
way of making sure that this is a success we need to address the 
20 
following issues.  Economic diplomacy, let us talk about market access.  
We talk about this - technology, security, issues of Africa. 
So we – we go through all these issues to make sure that the 
visit is – because it is – it is costly.  It is costly.  So you make sure that 
it is money well spent but also because you are building a relationship.  
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 33 of 183 
 
You want to make sure that the ceremonial issues by protocol is up to 
mark.  To leave a lasting impression to our guest.  That you are ready 
to strengthen relations – to expand the relationship. 
So protocol we go into those ceremonial issues like – is it 
going to be a dinner, lunch, it is going to be a breakfast.  Will be a visit 
maybe to a museum or to the Cradle of Mankind or a project.  
Something that is long lasting for the Heads of State and then the 
second part protocol we then also deal with the maybe in a separate 
note verbale when we know the arrival, the number of guests in the 
plane and the date of arrival. 
10 
Then the protocols and the defence and (indistinct) services 
then is arrival.  Are you going to have a guard of honour at the airport 
or not.  For instance if it is a – a private visit you do not have to have 
that but then and where are you going to mount the – the ceremonial 
welcome by our military personnel.  Where will be the 21 guns to be 
fired, taking salute or not. 
So that is the protocol.  It is very – very (indistinct) and 
delegate issue because if something slips there the whole content is 
gone.  So – so ceremonial part is what markets the country.  That is 
first impression, lasting impression.  Of course content is also very 
20 
important but you cannot underestimate the impact of properly arranged 
ceremonials.  So that is where the protocol is to make sure that that 
part – so both protocol, content (indistinct). 
Now if for instance it is going to be at a military base or at 
the airport – some Heads of State arrive at ORT because of the size of 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 34 of 183 
 
the aircraft the 747.  Mostly they arrive there.  Some at Waterkloof Air 
Base etcetera.  There is as different process now which needs now the 
security and the protocol to work on and once all of us have gone 
through our internal processes. 
Example the – the defence will assess the availability of the 
facility.  The condition of the facility and work everything internally and 
then they say to DIRCO no we do not think our facility is available or it 
is available and then our role is to notify the requesting mission that 
yes let us go ahead or please not at this one but that is the – that is 
the defence to decide because they going to (indistinct) have airport. 
10 
The defence will then agree.  So once the defence agrees 
they apply their mind going through the internal processes.  Then we 
trigger the preparation – the arrival ceremony all – all those kinds of 
things happen.  So that is what normally happens … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  But if Chair choice of 
aircraft is like those big 747s.  We then say no land at ORT because 
our runway does not handle that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At OR Tambo Airport? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  OR Tambo yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
Then 
we 
trigger 
arrangements there.  It is a civilian airport.  So we make arrangements 
there.  If it is Cape Town, Cape Town Airport.  It is easier for us when it 
is Waterkloof because it is exclusive … 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 35 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  But not many land there 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  With big aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So it is a decision that 
we normally take together.  If it is at OR Tambo then ACSA kicks in.  So 
we go with ACSA, Home Affairs and relevant … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Department.  What is 
going to happen there?  It differs.  If it is Cape Town it is going to be 
international part or domestic part.  It would be like for incident 
President Obama did go to Cape Town.  So we then make arrangements 
there.  If it is a summit it is the number of Heads of State.  The protocol 
say okay so many of them land at OR Tambo, so many Waterkloof, 
maybe so many at Lanseria. 
They will distribute them and create a mechanism to make 
sure that the – wherever they land they are all welcome to South Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So that is the in short 
without compromising security.  There is a lot of security issues that 
Chair you may save me from not saying them.  Understanding that we 
still have to protect the Republic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 36 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and – and then coming to the 
issue that we are dealing with which is the Waterkloof landing of Jet 
Airways.  When did you become aware of that landing for the very first 
time? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Chair I became aware of 
that through the news. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Are you – are you asking the actual landing or 
the proposed visit prior to the landing? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes.  No.

CHAIRPERSON:  The request …

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.

aware of the request that Jet Airways wanted to land at Waterkloof? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  It was after the arrival. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the arrival of … 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  After … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the aircraft? 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Ja.  When … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.

social media …

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Before that you did not know anything? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  No, I was not in the 
picture Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes; and normally you would not get involved? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Normally I would get 
involved after an interdepartmental meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I normally get involved 
if it is Heads of State … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
And 
I 
have 
been 
advised that the note verbale clearly indicates it is a Head of State 
coming … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And then in that case I 
will then confirm with the Chief of State Protocol and the DDG of that 
20 
area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  If it is from America it is 
the DDG of America.  Europe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 38 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because that DDG we 
then convene an interdepartmental meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Prepare preparations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And they will come to 
report to me.  Then I will make the Ministers aware … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

forum called the DG Forum …

CHAIRPERSON:  Meetings. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Processes … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
Where 
they 
send 
department – an official at the appropriate level where the issues can 
be discussed and sometimes the President might say no look I want a 
ministerial committee on this issue.  So a few Ministers will be put 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 39 of 183 
 
together to – to do (indistinct) but in normal circumstances the note 
verbale comes then I request the DDG responsible for that region to 
start the preparations, the content, to call the other colleagues, DTI, 
Home Affairs. 
Defence always – Intelligence Services are always part of the 
process because you need to – to make sure that the defence family is 
– is aware of what is happening and then they then make a submission.  
We discuss them.  Then I advise the Minister to say Minister I think we 
are ready.  This is what we have to – to realise.  So that is in terms of 
the content. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Then in terms of the 
preparation ceremonial … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe before you get to the preparations - you 
spoke earlier or you said earlier on there could be two note verbale.  
One just making the request and another one later on – later on coming 
with details. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normally at what or who at DIRCO would receive the 
first note verbale? 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  The first note verbale 
ordinarily goes to the bilateral desk.  Let me say it is Japan.  The 
Japan desk will receive that note verbale … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And then make protocol 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 40 of 183 
 
aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the protocol officer? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Protocol Officer of – of 
DIRCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, of DIRCO yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Being aware that there 
is this request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
Then 
we 
go 
for 
consultation first.  We go – it goes into a facilitation process. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  To make sure that the 
Minister and the President are okay.  Before you go to any preparations 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  You want to make sure 
that the principals … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 Are 
on 
– 
are 
on 
agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  When the principals 
have agreed and then you trigger ceremonial issues and then you 
trigger the content development.  Now the second note verbal maybe 
about the landing rights.  It maybe containing the – the where to land 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 41 of 183 
 
the type of aircraft and requesting the flight route all those issues. 
Normally I saw that thing been dealt by the defence attaché 
of the mission.  Let me say again it is Japan.  The military attaché will 
then trigger that because now that is where security comes in.  That is 
the protection of the principal or of the guests.  The mode of the route 
come in.  You do not expose the route from Tokyo to Johannesburg. 
So very few people are then aware of the route of the flight, 
the time of the landing and the preparations and then they will deal 
with the – the defence – appropriate defence person and then maybe a 
person from protocol to be aware but this is – it is not a huge number 
10 
of people made aware.  It is a very risky thing because of security 
sensitivities. 
Also because there maybe the – you know – application of 
the number of arms brought by the protecting party of the – of the 
guest.  The type of arms, serial numbers.  So all those things are done 
very quietly and sensitively.  So that might trigger a different one from 
the global note verbale asking for a – for a visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you would – if it is a visit involving a Head 
of State you would become aware of the first note verbale … 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite soon after it has arrived at DIRCO or not? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be quite soon? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I will – I will get almost 
from the DDG to say DG we are in receipt of this … 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 42 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because my rule is to 
(indistinct) the Minister … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And then (indistinct) the 
President … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And – so (indistinct) to 
start.  So I will be aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay and as the preparations move 
10 
forward you would be aware of what is going on and you will … 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I will be kept … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be kept informed? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I will be kept informed 
by the relevant …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  People? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So 
that relates to the arrival of a Head of State.  What happens when there 
20 
are Ministers visiting the country?  Do you get as informed as you are 
when it is the Head of State visiting? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Normally at Ministers 
level there are Ministers – Ministers also differ.  Instead of defence of 
intelligence of DIRCO normally as a different category because of the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 43 of 183 
 
nature of their work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  They get sort of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some special treatment? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I am not saying that.  I 
never said that.  I said that it is some consideration and some 
consideration given because of the nature of their work … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And that consideration 
means that certain things are done but maybe if the Minister of Home 
10 
Affairs comes Minister of Tourism comes it is a different consideration 
but still if a Minister comes we still get a note verbale.  That note 
verbale may we request – let me say the Minister arrives at ORT. 
Then protocol will then receive the Minister concerned from 
the flight through the protocol lounge of DIRCO.  So – so you still need 
a note verbale. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  For – for that particular 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  As low as an Executive 
you need a note verbale. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Whatever position or 
station in … 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 44 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  In the Executive you 
still … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  You still need a note 
verbale. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I must just ask this question you spoke 
about two note verbale.  Now is the position that there must always be 
10 
two?  Is the position that there must at least be one but sometimes 
there maybe two? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Chair it differs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Let me say you receive 
Hilary Clinton.  She travels with a special aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  She is not coming 
commercial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So – and again because 
of profiling because all guests are profiled by the state security.  They 
are graded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  High risk, low risk, 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 45 of 183 
 
medium risk … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Or it is Jerry okay let 
him come in.  It differs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but Jerry may be His Excellency? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Well but Excellency 
really with not much risk because South Africans like that person … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  There is no risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  But certain people have 
risk.  You have seen if American Heads of State arrive you could see 
the level of preparation.  It is among the top security.  You can see 
even the amount of American Intelligence amount of America Special 
Forces arriving.  The – the type of cars, helicopters, armour.  You could 
see because it is high risk because they are targets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  They are targets but of 
course if the President of a neighbouring country comes you do not see 
that huge – there is a level.  So we are guided by the grading by 
20 
Intelligence Services on the Head of State and accordingly we calibrate 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
The 
security 
arrangements. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 46 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  The rules … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  The – what do we do?  
The hotel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  It – it triggers so many 
other … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Things that happens. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  If it is a Minister – 
Minister from Iran for example or Minister of these countries that have 
global attention you also trigger arrangements but maybe a Minister 
from Lesotho we may not trigger such a huge arrangement but there 
will be security … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Details … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Done but … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  They all differ … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Depending where they 
come from … 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 47 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And the protocol also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
Recalibrates 
its 
arrangements accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So but for us we are led 
by Intelligence Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  What is the grading? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but to go back to my question there are times 
when one note verbale is sufficient.  There are times when two note 
verbale are required or is the second one always optional? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I think for Heads of 
State normally I think if I recall well there will be two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Agreeing then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And then the details … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because whether it is 
private whether it is official, ceremonial, state the security of the Head 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 48 of 183 
 
of State of any country … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  You do not want to 
answer back something you are not ready for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because once they land 
they are your guest.  So their lives are in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So – and hence the 
protection … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Around them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and I guess that whether it is one note verbale 
it might – can contain all the details that you would have expected from 
a second note verbale in a different case? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Well in some cases but 
as I said you will (coughing) Chair that - that different functions are 
triggered for preparations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  For instance in the first 
note verbale they may not ask for landing rights when they do not know 
whether we accept … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The request? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 49 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  The request or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  For instance if the 
President flies to the UN like he does every September the note verbale 
are triggered by defence – defence attaché with the American State 
Department and then we are notified that there is going to be - because 
of security.  So I suggest that maybe the second one is triggered by yes 
we agree.  Then work on the finer details which are not for public 
consumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Thank you Mr Chairman; and then – 
then you commented then on the report that Ms Sindane and 
Dr Swemmer and – and others had prepared and you deal with your 
comments on the report from page 4 onwards and then you comment 
specifically on what is termed under the post arrival stage or phase and 
you deal with when you first got to know about the landing and the 
steps that you took.  Could you take us through that process please? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Yes.  On – as I said I 
only heard this on post arrival and in Mr – Ms Sindane’s document you 
are referring to … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you looking at FF1?  That is 
Ms Sindane’s bundle. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  FF1? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  FF1? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 50 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What page are you looking at? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  I think I am looking at 
2.3.3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  That should be I think 
2.2.3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page – page 19.  On top it would be page 
19.  Is that right?  Not. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Let me come there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry.  Yes.  It will be page 19 2.3.3. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The bottom page is marked 15. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Page – page 19. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  19 on top.  Page 19. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Page 19. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  This is the first time 
now. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Because as a DG of 
20 
DIRCO I am also the Member of NICOC - National Intelligence 
Coordinating Committee - principal. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  So that is where we 
meet to take aboard the State security and other issues.  So there was 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 51 of 183 
 
a meeting convened. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
For 
the 
NICOC 
principals on 1 May. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  To come and – this is a 
day after the incident. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  To come and discuss 
this issue because it attracted so much attention … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And I am sure the 
principals were worried about it.  So in preparation for this visit and 
having learnt that the GCS Cluster – GCIS called communicators 
because there was so much media hype.  I then invited the then 
spokesperson 
or 
he 
is 
still 
the 
spokesperson 
of 
DIRCO 
– 
Clayson Monyela – around 1 o’ clock to come and brief me because I 
wanted to make sure what is happening and what has happened and 
then also I called His Excellency Ambassador Koloane to come and join 
us at NICOC because so much was said about him in the media space. 
20 
 
So I, Ambassador Koloane and Didi (indistinct) went to the 
NICOC principal – it was extended.  Extended means other people who 
do not normally attend – are attending.  Normally I do not take anybody 
there but on this case it was extended especially from those 
department that had people like implicated like defence, police all 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 52 of 183 
 
those people were brought to NICOC. 
So we met them at the NICOC Headquarters until time 
indicated in the – until 21:00. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From 4 o’ clock until 21:00? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  Nonstop. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA:  And then part of the 
recommendation was to immediately brief our principals.  If you see on 
20(I). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA: 
 
“Every 
General (indistinct) with their Ministers and advised 
against attending the wedding”. 
You recall we all – like myself I received an invitation.  We all received 
invitations.  Most of the DGs and it was going to be I think that.  So I 
had to call the Minister Nkoana-Mashabane to say Minister I want to 
see you to brief you about the outcome of the NICOC Meeting and 
indeed the Minister consented and I think 21:30 or 10:00 pm I went to 
meet the Minister but for the sake of transparency I also invited 
Ambassador Koloane and Mr Munyela who were with me at NICOC to go 
20 
and see the Minister at her residence to give her a briefing of the 
discussions so that in her mind she really understands the issue very, 
very well not only from social media. But that the department have 
reported, Home Affairs have reported, State Security reported, all 
relevant departments. So we met the Minister until the early hours of 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 53 of 183 
 
the 2 n d of May. When we left home, her and we briefed her and acquaint 
her 
some 
of 
the 
recommendations 
especially 
Roman 
10 
that 
immediately brief their Ministers. And so that was the time that I heard 
about and the more the details about this, first time. Second time, the 
Ministers of the JCS cluster were called to a meeting. The Minister 
went there and I accompanied her to go to the cluster meeting where 
the NICOC principal presented the report to the Ministers for the 
Minister’s processing and Minister’s advice. It was in that meeting that 
the Ministers decided to establish the DJG committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Investigation team? 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  To investigate the whole thing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  So after then all these meetings which are 
interdepartmental, inter-Ministerial then you deal in paragraph C with 
your call to the High Commission of India. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Now Chair, we are coming to the 
details now and part of… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and the C you are talking about Ms Norman is, 
have you gone, have you changed lever files to another one? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:   I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am still at page 20. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh, I am sorry. I have gone back to the 
statement of Mr Matjila. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 54 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. Okay are you, in what page are you? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 4? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, thank you. Sorry, that is FF111. Or is 
there something that you wanted to refer to in Ms Sindane’s report, 
Ambassador? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  No, I am following you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh, you are following me? Oh, thank you. 
Could you go back your statement then, page 4 of your statement? 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes, where are we? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. Then you mentioned and after having 
these meetings with your principals then you made a call to the High 
Commission of India. Could you tell Chairperson about that call? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, part of our role all department 
was to verify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  There was an issue of note verbal. 
20 
Now as a NICOC now I took over. Then I called, I telephoned the High 
Commissioner, excellency the High Commissioner of India to establish 
his we are not sure who were the guests, who were the people in the 
aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 55 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  We heard there were Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  There were officials, they were the 
family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Because as I said earlier on, if it 
was Ministers and issue of protocol preparation kicks in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, would have kicked in much earlier. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes. Then I called the High 
Commissioner, Mr Gupta who is very different from the Gupta. He is 
10 
another Gupta. Like you heard Matjila here who is another Matjila. So 
Chair, do not say that Matjila’s. It is a different Matjila. So it is a 
different Gupta. So indeed, His Excellency Gupta took my call. I think 
you may had been to Sun City already at that time. So I asked 
precisely, High Commissioner were there Ministers in the flight? He 
says no they were not Ministers. They were State Ministers. Now Chair, 
I was Ambassador… (indistinct) to India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you knew? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  State Ministers is the equivalent of 
our. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  MEC? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  MECs here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Right now MECs have a different 
category. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 56 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  In terms of visits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So I then established and informed 
the NICOC that there was no union Minister, they call them union 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  National Minister? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  National Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  It was provincial or State Ministers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So that was very, very important 
because then it goes to the content of the note verbal that was 
supposed to have been sent. So that is the first call I did to the but 
also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. I am sorry but still in note verbal was to 
have been required even if it was State Ministers or is there something 
you are coming to deal with? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  I am not sure whether State 
Ministers needs a note verbal. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because that, ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Ja, it is not a national. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Of course they might be very, very 
important but they still, we mind our security to. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 57 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  To know their visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  The second thing that I asked him 
was, were you asked by the Gupta family to facilitate. He says no I was 
never asked to facilitate. So two issues I wanted to get from him. Were 
these union Ministers, national Ministers or not. Secondly, you as the 
High Commissioner responsible, the eyes of the Prime Minister of India 
were you approached by the Gupta family to help, he says no I was not 
approached. So I conveyed that, Chair, to the NICOC principals to 
10 
satisfy are so that they were not. He was not approached and then he 
did not set the note verbal. No, there were no union Ministers. The 
second time, if I continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Then I said to him, can you come to 
my office. I think it was on the 3 r d of May. Can you please wherever you 
are, can you come to my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  For in-depth discussion because this 
was telephonically. So he came to my office.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And at that time could appreciate the 
gravity of what has happened and I thought as a responsible person 
and as a fellow diplomat but also to maintain relations because you do 
not want this thing to sour everything. You want to continue to make 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 58 of 183 
 
sure that the warm relations between… (indistinct) and India continues 
so that this incident is not a cause of the rupture of something that has 
been built over a period of time especially the special relations 
between South Africa and India. Chair, it does not need to do with 
because I was High Commissioner to India. It is a historic relations that 
Mahadi Magandi was here. He is a founder of India. You know that 
historic issues. So he came to my office High Commissioner Gupta and 
again I made him aware of what have they followed, the procedures in 
the Indian High Commission they have followed especially around the 
note verbal. That we, it is unacceptable for us something like this has 
10 
happened under his watch. I did not ask whether he was aware or not 
but I am sure you may be aware. So the idea of the second meeting 
was for him to know the issue of note verbal of no note verbal has 
caused a major problem and is something South African diplomacy or 
government that we take very, very serious. Of course, he apologized. 
He knew there is a very, very serious oversight from his. Now oversight 
is a diplomatic term. They cannot say we failed. So Chair should de-
quote what I say from time to time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  I have to stick to my, this is my… 
20 
(indistinct). This is where I earn my living. So, no can he say I did a 
mistake. He said it was an oversight but I can de-quote to say it was a 
very, very serious; very serious. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Error or mistake. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Error from their part. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 59 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But also… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at that stage, I am sorry. At that stage I go back 
to the question that I asked earlier. Now at that stage when you were 
speaking to him in the meeting, you knew that there were no national 
Ministers. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  He clarified that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if there were no national Ministers and there 
were and I am assuming and I know that you said you were not sure; 
assuming that there was no need for, was there a need for a note 
10 
verbal if it was just State Ministers? Because there might be no 
oversight or mistake to send a note verbal if no note verbal was 
required. Have you determined that at that stage? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, if this was a real wording 
party it ought to… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which it was? Is not it? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  It would have landed in a civilian 
airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  In that case, is just a wording party. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  No need for note verbal. They are 
coming here to have a nice time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  They are guest. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 60 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  They go to where they go, enjoy and 
go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But once you go to a military base. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  The civilian part goes away because 
now you are coming to a very exclusive area, a sensitive security area. 
So you need to provide documentation why you come to a highly 
secured area in this way. But we do have a lot of high-profile wordings 
10 
which are not were South Africans because they… (indistinct). We have 
a lot of people who come and marry here, who come and below the 
radar. It is a lot of high-profile people coming here but they do not 
attract 
attention 
because 
is 
low-profile. 
So 
it 
could 
have… 
(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do they go to Waterkloof? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They do not? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  They do not go to Waterkloof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Waterkloof they can go if it is a 
requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  By special arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 61 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But it will be such and is very few 
and far apart. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think we will take the short tea adjournment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, maybe can I finish last one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to make the last one before we take 
adjournment? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes, because in the same meeting 
with the High Commissioner because there were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  It was those; the second issue was 
the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  The whereabouts of the party. We 
agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  That the aircraft on the 2 n d must go 
to OTIA. 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To OR Tambo? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  OR Tambo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Everybody must leave from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But then we got the reconciliation 
from Home Affairs. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 62 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  That some people are missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  The State Ministers 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So I said, how Commissioner, where 
are these people? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  He said, oh Ambassador Matjila they 
charted a private aircraft to Cape Town. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  After landing at Waterkloof? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  After enjoying in Sun City 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  They charted an aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  To Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And I got even more worried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Even if they are State Ministers if 
20 
something happens in Cape Town, we may be blamed as South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  We are not notified that they would 
fly differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 63 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  We thought they will come to charted 
aircraft and leave the charted aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  At Jet Airways. So they went to 
India. Then I said but also somebody is missing in reconciliation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Where is the somebody? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So we managed to identify the State 
Ministers in Cape Town. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And were informed and what 
happened which is true, they left through Emirates via Dubai back to 
India. So I just want to finish that part before break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. No, that is fine. Before we take the 
adjournment, I just want to ask this question. This was as I understand 
the position an aircraft that was coming to South Africa to bring guests 
who were going to a private wedding and some of the people who were 
said to be included in the aircraft to be in the aircraft were State 
Ministers of India. Did and as I understand it, even day were not going 
20 
to have any meetings with any government officials as I understand the 
position. So their trip had nothing to do with any; there are coming to 
South Africa had nothing to do with any government official. If my 
understanding in regard to those issues is correct then it just seems to 
me that this was a completely private visit for everybody. You could 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 64 of 183 
 
have a situation where maybe I do not know, State Ministers from India 
are coming to South Africa. They are going to meet some MECs maybe, 
I make an example. There is going to be some government business to 
do and maybe as while they are in South Africa, there will also attend a 
private wedding. Something suggests to me that under those 
circumstances it may be that it might be viewed in a certain way, I am 
not sure but it seems that this was just completely private. They were 
not going to meet anybody from government and have official 
government business and that for that reason for all intents and 
purposes, this was private. Is my understanding correct? 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, as we deep deeper and 
deeper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  It came to transpire that some of 
them privately also went to I think Free State to meet MECs there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But we are not sure because this 
was a cloak in secrecy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  We are not privy to their progress. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  We just understood that it seems 
some of them in Cape Town did meet some people in private capacities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Some were to Free State to meet 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 65 of 183 
 
MECs there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But we did not have any official 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Is what we had to say, where is so-
and-so, what happened to so-and-so; that actually some of them did 
meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Their counterparts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  In some provinces. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But as DIRCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  As DG, I was not privy to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So in terms of official documents to which 
DIRCO had access or with which DIRCO had been furnished, there was 
no intimation that any of those State Ministers were going to meet any 
official from government. Anybody that might have known anything 
20 
might have known it on the basis of unofficial sources. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, we are normally guided by the 
noted verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  On the purpose. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 66 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Of the visit, what the guest want to 
achieve and the facilitation that we do and then the program is 
developed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  I said it triggered two things… 
(indistinct] program and protocol ceremonial. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So we could have been aware even 
if it was private but then is a request that during the privacy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  There will be a dinner with so-and-so 
MEC to discuss this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So and actually in some private visit 
this do happen Head of State meets some you, know companies, meets 
some but you are aware although it is private. But in this case as a DG 
I had no hint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Of their actual purpose. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Who to meet and not to meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it that around the time when you were 
dealing with this issue immediately after the landing, you would have 
been furnished with all relevant documentation that anybody at DIRCO 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 67 of 183 
 
had access to. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore, you would know. You would have 
known if there was some document that had been given to DIRCO that 
indicated that there was a plan for them to meet some MECs. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. We will take the short adjournment 
and we will resume. It is 25 past. We will resume at 20 to 12. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS FOR TEA 
CHAIRPERSON:  Urgent meetings that sometimes take place during the 
tea break about Commission work. Thank you. Let us proceed, yes  
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Mr Chairman. Thank you, 
Ambassador we were still at page 5. You had finished the part about 
these guests and the questions that you had put to the High 
Commission of India. And then you deal in that same paragraph where 
the meeting HC, you deal with deviations from normal DIRCO 
processes. Could you just highlight those? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, the deviation was as I said 
20 
after we have gone through, we trigger the issue of interdepartmental 
meetings. It is that forum that looks into the whole visit and make 
recommendation in terms of content to be achieved and State protocol 
services. So that is the one thing. But also the bilateral test needs to 
assess and says we agree that this visit takes place. So those were 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 68 of 183 
 
some of the deviation that some of us see in this process. That the 
bilateral test concerned was not engaged fully in the whole process and 
so you could not advise the executive or the top management of the 
department to go or not nor was any interdepartmental meeting 
convened. So those were some of the deviation that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Identified. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. And then having now regard that 
the information and having interviewed the High Commissioner of India, 
what was the recommendation at the end of it all as to what were the 
10 
steps that had to be taken and could you just highlight what those 
recommendations were going to be? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Well, Chair following the procedures 
and the outcome of the investigation on this Waterkloof airbase then 
there was an issue of department concern establishing teams to go 
further. Chair you will recall that DIRCO belongs to the public service. 
So Public Service Act guides us and defence they belong to a different 
dispensation. So once they were going through this process and then 
we were requested that each department carries out. So in DIRCO part 
we have to see the provision of the public service SMS handbook, 
20 
disciplinary procedures in the department. I am sure the Secret Service 
is did their own work, given their own prescript, their own guideline, 
their own… (indistinct) provision but we were, had to deal with our own 
colleagues within the Public Service Act. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. And then which officials did you then 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 69 of 183 
 
decide to implement those disciplinary charges against? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  In the DIRCO, the DDG of human 
resources as in his portfolio the disciplinary hearing is part of his 
responsibility. And so I wanted to sort of distance myself because I was 
engaged through. So I did not want to prejudice the college implicated. 
So I said to the DDG HR who is now happened to be the DG of DIRCO, 
please trigger in the disciplinary procedures. Make sure that you follow 
the prescripts, you follow everything and to make sure that the 
colleague implicated is given the chance to come and appear before the 
panel. In that context therefore, Chair, the DDG HR even this thing as 
10 
his own portfolio triggered in disciplinary hearing. Now in the DIRCO 
disciplinary hearing is about, is a corrective process identify, we 
correct and rehabilitate. It is meant to be humane orientated process 
especially if the person cannot have a final say. For instance, we do 
not own any military base. So we look at that that we are not the one 
who have a final say as DIRCO. So it is the defence. So we then trigger 
that process. Then the DDG HR followed his procedures, prescripts, 
came with a submission to me identify the relevant people to form the 
hearing in DIRCO. I think in this case it was Advocate NB Motlajwane 
from the Pretoria bar to lead this because we needed somebody from 
20 
the legal fraternity. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, who was going to be disciplined? The 
person that was going to be disciplined. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  In this case Ambassador Koloane 
was identified from the hearing as person to which I should make some 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 70 of 183 
 
disciplinary procedures. And therefore, I then invited the DDG HR to 
trigger to say, look this application from the hearing. Ambassador 
Koloane has been implicated. Can you carry this thing over within the 
prescripts of the Public Service Act and relevant prescripts, procedures 
of a disciplinary hearing? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. And maybe just to refer you. There would 
be a bundle Exhibit FF3 which contains. It is in a very, in a smallish 
lever arch file FF3. It contains Ambassador Koloane’s disciplinary 
proceedings. There is a letter which bears your name in the FF3 at 
page 3. That will be under the divider marked one.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On which Exhibit are we now? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  We are on Exhibit FF3 Mr Chairman. I just 
want to… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not seem to get Exhibit FF3 here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Maybe to put it behind you, Chair. It is just a 
letter of suspension. If the witness may just be allowed to identify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got Exhibits 2A and B. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  4, 5, 7,8. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 6, 9 and 10. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  3 you said. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Chair, I do not know what happened to it but 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 71 of 183 
 
the Chairperson had it last week and I had asked that all of your 
bundles be returned this morning. I just wanted the witness to just 
simply identify if you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may be able to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  To find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do without. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, I apologize for that. Could you please 
that letter… (intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what should be done is every morning 
somebody must check from the legal team that everything that I should 
have is here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, Mr Chairman. Thank you. Page 3, are you 
there, Ambassador? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  3 on top it will be VBK003. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Is it this file? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Look at the spine it will be FF3. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  FF3. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at the spine of the lever arch file and see 
whether it is written FF3. Okay she will help you.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Chair, may I in the meantime just hand up a 
spare copy for your? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 72 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Just so that you can be able to follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number that you want? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Page 3 Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 3 of Exhibit FF3? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  That is correct. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Okay, I saw it ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. Did you suspend Ambassador 
Koloane? 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes, in the morning of the 2 n d we 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2 n d of May? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Of May. Recall in the evening when 
we briefed the Minister, she said Ambassador Koloane should be 
suspended. But you see bureaucrats are there to assist the executive 
to do things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The right way. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  That is your say. Is to help to guide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  We can understand the sentiment of 
the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But our role is to make sure that 
things are done appropriately without victimizing anyone. That is why 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 73 of 183 
 
after we had a short sleep, we came back and drafted this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say at that meeting the Minister took this 
position that Ambassador Koloane should be suspended. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  That was early hours of the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  But as an accounting officer I am 
directed by the certain procedures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And legislation? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And then also I am advised by the 
DDG HR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Who actually happened, came from 
public service commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  On the legality of doing things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  So that the colleague is not unduly 
compromised or his human rights are undermined because he has a 
20 
right; recall is an allegation. So with the advice of the DDG HR I 
drafted this letter… (indistinct) and then called in Ambassador Koloane. 
To say, by the way he was also in the meeting with the Minister but you 
know we said we will follow the procedures. So after I drafted it, I 
called Ambassador Koloane to my office and said, Ambassador, we are 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 74 of 183 
 
going to have these procedures followed. I think it triggered the same 
with other departments. Then he looked at the letter and I said, 
Ambassador you can take it home, consult your lawyers because he has 
a right that after certain date he can say, Ambassador I am going to 
question. I am going to question this or but after he read it, he applied 
his mind. Ambassador Koloane countersigned. But Chair, I understand 
at that time I think the media was just too much on him and I cannot 
understand is feeling and his family and everybody. I think there was an 
overexposure which I thought was not appropriate at that time because 
we had no facts. So Ambassador read it. I gave him a chance to do 
10 
because I am by the law to give him to him, study it, have any legal 
advice, 
then 
sign. 
So 
indeed 
Ambassador 
Koloane 
after 
the 
discussions, he read it by himself in the premises. Then he signed. 
Then I said, Ambassador you will be contacted by the HR. So we are 
going to trigger this process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, thank you. Thank you. You may then put 
aside FF3 aside Ambassador. Then a disciplinary process then as you 
have already indicated was embarked upon which led to Ambassador 
Koloane pleading guilty to three of the charges without facts and 
evidence as we read the record of the proceedings. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes, Chair. Then the DDG HR took 
over and I stood back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And allowed him to do his job per his 
profile and scope. So DDG HR, DDG Marhwayi then went to consult, 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 75 of 183 
 
identify the appropriate people to deal with the inquiry. As I say in this 
case, Advocate MB Matlejwane from Pretoria bar was identified and 
Chair. And then we identified Doctor HN Manzini from Independent 
Development Trust to represent the department and Ambassador 
Koloane chose to represent himself. No legal… (indistinct). So the 
charges I want to presume were read to Ambassador Koloane. He went 
to see them and on the 27 t h of May, Ambassador Koloane was served 
with notice of disciplinary hearing and he actually received thereof. And 
then there was three charges that were laid. And after the processes by 
both, I think they met on the 11 t h, hearing on the 11 t h and 22 July. Then 
10 
the employee in this case Ambassador Koloane had pleaded guilty to 
the charges. And again, the parties were given an ample opportunity to 
present mitigating factors before the Chair could issue the sanctions. I 
think thereafter then on the 29 t h of July the sanctions were issued and 
pronounced. Suspension without pay for a period of two months as an 
alternative to dismissal in terms of Clause 2.74 of the, Chapter 7 of 
SMS handbook; that is the Chairperson and a final written warning 
which shall be placed in the employee’s personal file and shall remain 
valid for six months. So this is the submission that I finally at the end 
again through the DDG HR. To say I have finished my work DG and this 
20 
is the outcome. So my role was to implement the sanctions as such. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  And it was indeed implemented? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And they were duly implemented, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your role there is important. It was to just implement 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 76 of 183 
 
the, irrespective of what you may have thought about the sanction? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes, Chair because I presumed that 
they had all the facts at their disposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Both the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And the like their mind thoroughly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And the HR who, DDG HR who 
advised me also knowing the system and SMS handbook and 
10 
disciplinary code. They all satisfy themselves that is appropriate 
sanction given what has transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  And Chair, mine was to implement 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. You might not have anything to say about this 
because your role as you say was to implement. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Chair, let me tell you why I 
implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  When we started in 1994, and we 
came few of us in government he went to DIRCO. I think Ambassador 
Koloane went to DTI. Very few skilful knowledgeable people who were 
not in government came in to try to drive the new government, new 
policies. Remember this was 99.9% white establishment in everything. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 77 of 183 
 
So we needed a highly intelligent, highly knowledgeable, highly skilful 
and confident and qualified people to go into government to issue 
transformation. Ambassador Koloane was one of them. Ambassador 
Koloane was sent by the DTI I think in Tokyo. Then I met him there. 
Recall I spent six years in my previous years in Japan. It is a very 
difficult environment because they do not know South Africans. It is 
very far. They do not even understand English, let alone their culture. 
So for a diplomat to penetrate the market in Japan to attract investment 
between South Africa you need an extraordinary capable person to do 
that. Ambassador Koloane came from that stock. We were young 
10 
people. And I am saying this thing because I have been around in this 
for a long time and I understand the need, the knowledge of a person. 
And I am sure I was the only few South African at that time when I was 
with the Japanese. Actually Asia, I do not think there was any other 
South African who understands Asia like I did. So when I went to Japan 
because part of my work, Chair, was to try to transform DIRCO into new 
concept of strategic planning because we found that they were just 
working. So we were adopting some concepts from private sector to 
make sure that government functions efficiently. So we borrow from 
private sector that these functions like strategic planning, annual 
20 
performance basis. So that was my role, so I used to go all over to 
train diplomats on the spot about these new concepts. That is when I 
met some of my old friends in Japan in business bureaucracy. And I 
found that Ambassador Koloane then he was official in DTI not in 
DIRCO was equal to that task. So when we expanding our footprint in 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 78 of 183 
 
Asia especially in China and we were opening up a diplomatic post in 
Shanghai; is a heart of Chinese economy. I said to the then President, 
that we need somebody to understand business. Shanghai is business. 
So Ambassador Koloane was identified from DTI as the head… 
(indistinct) General in Shanghai, the one who can effect this because 
he had the knowledge of Asia. So and I must confess, he did an 
excellent job, excellent job. New mission but you could see the 
investments. You could see the procurement from South Africa. As a 
result, then Ambassador Koloane was asked to go to Beijing as a 
number two in Beijing for Greater China. But because of his 
10 
performance, the President promoted him to be an Ambassador and 
sent him to Spain. Spain is part of the EU and as a barrier area, we are 
trying to reinforce our relationship. So then Ambassador Koloane was 
not promoted from (indistinct) General deputy to an Ambassador in 
Spain. Now some of us who see these young people growing over a 
period of time, of course you do stumble in life. You know all of us we 
make mistakes. So that is why when I got this report from the 
Commission and I understand the totality of the Ambassador Koloane is 
and I saw this, you know has a mishap. He could not you raise the total 
picture of his contribution to South African diplomacy and economy. 
20 
That is what, Chair I implemented as a corrective way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question that I was thinking of asking you, I am 
not going to ask you because I think I should reserve it for somebody 
else other than you. But you do accept, do you not and as a general 
principle that there are certain things that if you have done it does not 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 79 of 183 
 
matter how good you are, you may have to go? I am not talking about 
this specific matter. I am just in general; you accept that? In general, 
not about. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:   In some specific things, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  In some areas, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In some areas, yes. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine. Thank you. Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, thank you. Thank you Mr Chairman. Then 
10 
Ambassador there is a report which appears at page 10 of the same, if 
you go back sorry to Exhibit FF11. There is a, no that is the one that 
has your affidavit. FF11. 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  This one?

NICOC but you have already summarized everything that is your 
interactions with the High Commission of India and the meetings of the 
DG’s and the Ministers, all of that you have summarized that report. 
20 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. I just want you to identify it and a letter 
which you wrote forwarding it, appears at page 9. Is that correct? 
AMBASSADOR JERRY MATJILA:  No, it is in the file that is.

CHAIRPERSON:  If I refuse your request, what will happen to South 
Africa in the family of the nations?

CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairperson is 
Ambassador Koloane but before I lead Ambassador Koloane his legal 
representatives would like to place certain matters before you, thank 
you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV MAHAN:  Thank you Chair, just for purposes of formality to place 
ourselves on record, I represent Ambassador Koloane, it is Advocate 
Mahan assisted by Advocate Chavalalah.  Ambassador Koloane was not 
formally subpoenaed but was requested to appear by the Commission’s 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 82 of 183 
 
Legal Team on the 27 t h of June, he has made arrangements to be here 
at their request.  We – the impression that we got from the letter was 
obviously that the Commission’s Legal Team intended to lead the 
evidence of Mr Koloane and I understand that that is what they intend 
to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHAN:  We will if so advised we may re-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine. 
ADV MAHAN:  As it please you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman 
Ambassador Koloane does not have a formal statement that has been 
placed before you.  There has been some misunderstanding as to what 
is it – the break, the period that was requested on Tuesday but be that 
as it may he is willing to testify and I would beg leave to lead him.  
Thank you.  May he be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Administer the oath or affirmation to him. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    Vusi Bruce Koloane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
20 
oath? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    Definitely not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider to be binding on your conscience? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 83 of 183 
 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  If so please raise your right hand and say so help me 
God. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Ambassador as Ms Norman 
has indicated we do not have a statement from you, but because of 
what she says was a misunderstanding but we do have material where 
10 
your name is mentioned in regard to the incident that we want you to 
share your knowledge about.  I just want to indicate to you that you will 
be asked questions by Ms Norman, I may also ask questions, just feel 
free, answer to the best of your ability, and if you do not understand a 
question feel free to ask for it to be repeated, and it will be repeated, 
and give your answers to the best of your ability and as honestly as 
required when anybody is under oath.   
 
The whole purpose is to understand what happened, what role 
everyone who is mentioned played, had played and since you are 
mentioned we also want to understand what role you played and it is 
20 
important that I should understand as much as possible because in the 
end I will make findings.  I must understand your own perspective as 
well as to what your role was, what may have been in your mind in 
dealing with matters in a particular manner, so this is an opportunity 
where you can just share with the Commission exactly what you know 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 84 of 183 
 
and your perspective so that when you are done we have – I have a full 
picture of what your role may have been, you understand? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:    Yes I do Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you, you may proceed Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Ambassador 
is it correct that you are currently serving as an Ambassador in the 
Netherlands? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Yes it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and as you have indicated you have 
been invited then to tell your version of what – the persons that you 
10 
listened to last week, the evidence of Ms Sindane, the former Director 
General of Justice and Constitutional Development and the evidence of 
Major Ntshisi, you were present when those persons testified, is that 
correct? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Yes I was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, now shall we then just deal briefly 
with how you got to know about the landing of the Jet Airways at the 
Waterkloof, the very first time that you were told about it, who told you 
and ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The request ...(intervention)  
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  ...and the request ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The request for the landing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The request for the landing yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Well I got the request for 
the landing for the – to know about the request for the landing was 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 85 of 183 
 
when I got a telephone call from the former High Commissioner of 
Indian, Ambassador Gupta, who called me and informed me that they 
had applied for a flight clearance for landing at Waterkloof and it has 
been over six days but they have not had a response whilst not a few 
months earlier they had heard the President of India visiting South 
Africa on a State visit and it took less than three days to get the flight 
clearance, so he wanted to say to me Ambassador can you check for 
me and follow up to find out what is keeping it for this long, that is the 
first time that I heard about it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, now ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we proceed there, maybe let us just 
hear what your usual role is in regard to requests for visits for Heads of 
State, Ministers, or private visits in terms of what your function was, 
your job was at that time. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Okay.  Thank you Chair.  As 
the Chief of State Protocol and I am talking about the portfolio, not the 
individual, one of the things that is principally your responsibility is the 
maintenance of cordial relations with all the diplomatic missions which 
are resident in South Africa.  You become the first point of call to South 
Africa because any person coming to South Africa first interacts with 
20 
Protocol before they can even meet with the political principals, and 
therefore in servicing all the diplomatic missions I get requests of – 
that are wide-ranging, ranging from saying Ambassador assist us, there 
are people who park right in front of our Embassies and therefore I 
have to engage the Diplomatic Police and say can you please go and 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 86 of 183 
 
assist the Embassy of Singapore is complaining, and they will go and 
check and they will see that maybe they may need to demarcate the 
area so that it is clearly mark that it is only diplomatic parking or it may 
also go to the extent of a request for flight clearances coming into the 
Republic of South Africa, and I think as was also indicated between 
Wednesday and Thursday when we heard the testimonies of the people 
that you have mentioned earlier there are three ways, I think it was 
stated under oath there as well that such requests may come, they may 
go directly to the Department of Defence or they may come through 
DIRCO, I have forgotten the third one that they mentioned.  In this if 
10 
they come through DIRCO what normally happens is that I will say, I 
will anyway normally as the DG said earlier I would have known about it 
because if it is a State visit during the meeting that is convened by the 
DIRCO General called the DGF where all the DDG’s sit we share the 
programs of work in terms of what is going to be happening.  If it is 
somebody, a Head of State from Europe who is coming, for example 
they will say to me in the meeting the DDG in charge of Europe will 
then report to the DGF and say by the way we have a State visit coming 
from Spain and the Presidency has confirmed availability and so has 
the Minister, so we have just received the correspondence from them 
20 
through the note verbale and we are now going to be sending it to the 
Chief of Protocol so that we can start triggering the actions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   So the initial note verbale 
does not come to me, it goes directly to the DDG dealing with the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 87 of 183 
 
program area and then that is actually what happens and then all we do 
on our side without then interacting with that mission because once 
they receive the response from the responsible Deputy Director General 
dealing with the branch then they will start writing directly to me 
because the response will say to them the Minister has confirmed the 
availability of the President for the dates that have been requested, 
please start liaising with the Chief of Protocol on Logistical matters and 
they will put my contact details and accordingly the mission then will 
start liaising with us in sending the note verbale request and the flight 
clearance, and I would like to also clarify something, maybe to 
10 
demystify one minor issue about the note verbale, the note verbale they 
will send to us will contain all the details as was earlier indicated by 
both the official from DTI, Matjila, not the one who was testifying today 
but the one on Thursday, as well as General Ntshisi from Defence.  The 
details of what size of a flight is that, how many people on board, who 
is head of the delegation etcetera, so we do not ourselves in Protocol 
draw up the note verbale, we forward that note verbale that we will 
have received and say please find attached a note verbale that has 
been sent etcetera, etcetera. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, no I do not recall anyone saying that 
20 
DIRCO does draw it, our understanding is exactly the way you put it, 
DIRCO does not draw it but it receives it. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Ja, I was just clarifying 
because when I was sitting on Wednesday in the responses I heard a 
response saying there will be a note verbale coming from DIRCO so I 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 88 of 183 
 
was trying to clarify it that yes there will be a note verbale forwarded 
by DIRCO but not emanating from DIRCO as the writer of the note 
verbale. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Alright, now let us just take this one step 
at a time.  You have just given an answer that the DG would know that 
there is a request coming from a foreign country and then the DG then 
will bring that particular DG will bring that to your attention? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   No I said the DDG. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The DDG. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Who deals with the 
10 
particular branch, say in this instance it will be Asia and the Middle 
East so the DDG will then report in the meeting of the DGF that there is 
going to be this State visit.  Even if the DDG for whatever reason either 
is not able to attend the DGF but his office will at least convey to the 
office of the the Chief of State Protocol that please note that the DDG 
asked us to inform you that the President has agreed to the following 
days etcetera, etcetera.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Alright, okay let us talk about this 
incident then.  We know that there was no Head of State coming, is that 
correct? 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I would – now yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Now you know. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Okay now at the time what was your 
understanding of in respect of whom was the request being made? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 89 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR 
VUSI 
BRUCE 
KOLOANE: 
 
 
When 
the 
High 
Commissioner, as I indicated earlier that my first time to hear about it 
was when the High Commissioner of India called me and I was not in 
the office when he called.  He said to me we have submitted a flight 
clearance request for a Ministerial delegation coming from India but we 
have not had a response, so that was for me, that is why I took it that it 
is a Ministerial response. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, no, no but then there is no mention 
of a Head of State there is it? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   No in our discussion he did 
10 
not mention anything about the Head of State. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, so at that time when then the 
request, when this was brought to your attention by the Head of State 
you knew that there was no Head of State ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  By the High Commissioner. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   By the Commissioner, I beg your pardon, 
thank you Mr Chair.  Okay, may I just repeat that, when the High 
Commissioner of India called you he did not mention that there would 
be a Head of State in respect of the request that he was following up 
on. 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  So at what point, if any point at all, 
did you then get to understand that there would have been a Head of 
State? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I think during the meeting I 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 90 of 183 
 
had with NICOC they indicated that it was first the Head of State and 
then it was downgraded to a Minister and then further to an MEC 
equivalent, but that is information I had not been privy to because the 
request for such a flight clearance was sent directly to Defence and not 
to DIRCO, hence I would not have been privy to that information. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, so then the High Commissioner 
called you and says look there has been some delays and we know that 
usually these things are done quickly, so what was the first thing that 
you did? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   The first thing I did was to 
10 
call my personal assistant and I said to her my dear I have a challenge, 
I just got a call from the Head Commissioner of India complaining, 
because that is what he was doing, can you please follow up with our 
official who deals with these issues to find out what is the bottleneck.  
At that time I was under the assumption that the Indian High 
Commission had submitted all the documents through DIRCO, hence my 
recommendation to my PA to contact the gentleman by the name of Mr 
Matjila, who works for DIRCO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, so then you said look into this, you 
say to your PA look into this, that is Ms Morris, is that correct? 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   That is correct, it is Ms 
Morris. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Is that Ms Morris? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So you say to her look into this thing, 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 91 of 183 
 
there is a complaint from the High Commissioner, India, they say there 
is a bottleneck. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I did not say bottleneck I 
just said ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Find out where the bottleneck is? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Maybe can I rephrase and 
state it as I am trying to express it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I said to her I received a 
call from the Indian High Commissioner complaining that they have filed 
10 
an application for flight clearance, which on average takes two to three 
days because a few months earlier they had had a visit, a State visit, 
but this  has taken over six days and hence he is edgy and wants to 
find out what is the cause of the delay with the processing of the 
application. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, so at that point then when High 
Commissioner called you, you also had no idea of what he was talking 
about? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Correct, I did not have any 
idea, that was the first time that I heard about the visit. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before we proceed, the information you got from 
the High Commissioner was that it was a Ministerial visit or there were 
going to be Ministers on the aircraft? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Correct Mr Chairperson, he 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 92 of 183 
 
just said to me there are Ministers who are coming, I think he said six 
or eight and that they submitted an application, it is more than six days 
but they have not had a response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, on your understanding would your office or 
DIRCO be involved in anything relating to flight clearances in 
circumstances where an aircraft might have ministers from another 
country who are not coming into the country on official business, would 
DIRCO or your office be involved normally in such a case? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I think that will depend on 
the what they call the threat assessment that would be conducted by 
10 
the security, because sometimes the ministers come for purely private 
visits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   But because of the threat 
levels it may be deemed to be too high then DIRCO may get involved in 
facilitating that they get protectors and things like that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, but if there is no suggestion of any threats 
and it is just they are not going to meet any government official or 
ministers or anybody, it is really a private visit would your office being 
DIRCO be involved, would DIRCO be involved at all? 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   At the request stage Mr 
Chair yes because if they send the request, if for example the Indian 
High Commission sends a request and says – and they are applying for 
in the note verbale format complying with the procedure but stipulating 
in the note verbale that this is a private visit, people coming for a 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 93 of 183 
 
private visit but it is ministers can you request defence that you can 
land at Waterkloof.  We do not have the legal mandate as DIRCO to say 
sorry you cannot land, yes you can, that is the principal domain of 
Defence, so we as DIRCO would be like a post office that will take and 
pass it on to Defence and then if Defence says yes they say yes if they 
say no they no, and that is how – that is the nature and the limit of our 
involvement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so to some extent whether the embassy office of 
the relevant country makes such a request is a factor to be taken into 
account but if it does make such a request even with a private visit 
10 
yours is just to pass on the request to the Department of Defence? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Correct Chair, I can actually 
provide an example to that effect which maybe the Chair may also want 
to verify, the mother of the King of the e-Swatini has landed on a few 
occasions at Waterkloof on a private medial visit, coming for private 
medical reasons, so all we do is just process as to what criteria they  
use to allow her to land or not to land is fundamentally the 
responsibility of Defence, so ours is just to process and we are like a 
post office, a conduit, if one may use the word of interaction between 
diplomatic missions and Defence when it comes to requests of landing 
20 
at Waterkloof and I mean as you – I am sure the Chair will agree that 
the mother of the King of the e-Swatini is neither a public office bearer, 
a politician or Head of State but I am saying she has landed, not once,  
at Waterkloof, but again if you were to ask me Chair sitting here what 
criteria was utilised to decide that she can land I would not be able to 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 94 of 183 
 
answer it because like I said earlier that is the principal domain of the 
Department of Defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is that the case whether it is a State visit, official 
visit or private visit, namely the people who must decide in the end 
whether they allow the landing of an aircraft falling under those 
categories is the Defence Force? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Correct, if the request is to 
land at Waterkloof Chairperson, because it may be that they are doing 
renovation of a runway, so I will not have that knowledge sitting in 
DIRCO so they are only people who can know whether all their systems 
10 
up to date, everything is good for them to accept the size of the aircraft 
etcetera, so whilst DIRCO and the Presidency may agree to receive a 
particular Head of State on a particular date but the decision to land in 
Waterkloof will not reside with the President or the Minister of DIRCO 
either it will depend on the availability of Waterkloof and the only 
people who will know about the availability, the size of the aircraft 
etcetera will be the people who are given that mandate constitutionally, 
which is the Department of Defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the difference be that if it is a State visit or 
official visit DIRCO and your office would have had certain roles to play 
20 
in order to make sure that South Africa played its role if that visit 
happens? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Yes Mr Chairperson as was 
earlier also indicated, if it is a State visit I will then also coordinate an 
inter-departmental meeting where it just ...(intervention)  
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 95 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the State visit is only one which involves Heads 
of States? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   It can be the head of State 
or the Deputy Head of State as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   In  some – whether it is the 
President or the Prime Minister or the King depending on the form of 
governance in a particular country.  In that instance I personally will 
call a meeting, an inter-departmental meeting, which will include 
amongst others SAPS, particularly the presidential protection services 
10 
team, I will call people from maybe DTI if the (indistinct) was coming 
we will call them, but normally we will call people from Home Affairs, 
we will get people who are dealing from the Intelligence Sector as well 
who deals with the issues of accreditation to make sure that they will 
address issues related to accreditation, that they will also make sure 
that they put together a security strategy and plan identifying the 
routes because as you work on the program and we know which 
meetings are going to be taking place and where we need to decide on 
the best logical route to take given the traffic, we then get also people 
from the Metro Police to come in because we will also request some 
20 
escorts so yes we get extremely involved because it is the – it is a 
Head of State meeting that is going to be happening but only in as far 
as dealing with and organising the logistics and not the substantive 
component of the visit by the Head of State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 96 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So then let us 
talk about then your secretary would have made enquiries, what did you 
discover, did she report back to you as to what she discovered? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Yes she called me and said 
the gentleman from DTI does not seem to know anything because they 
have not sent anything to him, he has not received anything, and I 
called the Ambassador, the Head Commissioner of India I said there 
does not seem to be anything and he said oh but we we sent it directly 
to Defence, and again I assumed like I said earlier that a few months 
earlier they had had a State visit that they had submitted all 
10 
documentation as per the previous exercise, and I then asked, because 
I did not have the number, I did not even know the name of the person, 
I then asked to be given the number and the name so that I could call, 
like I do also call other government departments when there are issues 
to make enquiries. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then who did you then call? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: I called is it Ntshisi? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, so at that point when you were 
20 
calling Mr Ntshisi you had not had sight of any documentation? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I had not, I was just acting 
purely under the assumption that there has been total compliance with 
the administrative requirements in terms of documentation that must be 
submitted etcetera, because a few months earlier they had had a visit 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 97 of 183 
 
of their Head of State and they had complied fully to the extent that 
they had been granted the flight clearance to land at Waterkloof. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, so then what did you convey to 
Warrant Officer Nshisi, at the time he was a warrant officer. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I the said to him please sir 
can you held because this High Commissioner is on my case, can you 
please process this application. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At that point you had not had any 
documentation with you, you had not had sight of any application? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I was out of my office, 
10 
although I cannot, as you will imagine it was more than six years ago, I 
cannot recall exactly where I was but I was not in the office so I was 
only dealing with this by phone, I had not seen any documentation 
whatsoever.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, you have already told the 
Chairperson that you have no powers over defence, I am just trying to 
understand the basis upon which then without any documentation at 
your disposal at the time would you then have to ask Warrant Office 
Ntshisi to process the application, I just want to understand the basis 
upon which you did that? 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Okay, as I indicated earlier 
if an Embassy of Singapore complains that there are people who are 
parking right in front of their embassy where they are supposed to be 
parking because according to the Vienna Convention provisions we 
need to give them at least two bays where they can park their officials 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 98 of 183 
 
cars.  If they complain that there are people parking all the time 
because they are not demarcated I call the Diplomatic Police, although 
I do not have power for decision making but I call them and I say 
please can you attend to this problem because it is going to create 
unnecessary diplomatic tensions since my responsibility is to ensure 
that we have cordial relations and I am the conduit, and in fact when 
they arrive and I receive them before they get their credentials I 
explain that if you have any problem whatsoever, irrespective of which 
department protocol dictates that you come through me and I will 
facilitate that you have somebody attending to the matter.  Equally with 
10 
calling Defence I understand fully that I do not have authority over 
officials working for Defence but to request that the process should not 
be an issue because all I am saying is process, I am not saying issue 
or not, processing is can you address or attend to this business 
because it is creating unnecessary problems. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, what did Warrant Office Ntshisi say to 
you when you said to him please process this application?  
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I think when ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, maybe let us start with the question 
whether when you phoned him he was aware of the application as at 
20 
that time as far as you recall?  Or was he hearing about it for the first 
time from you? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   No I think he already was 
aware of the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 99 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   That is the impression that I 
get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman, so then what did 
he say to you then, if he was aware or the impression you got was that 
he was aware of the application, and you said to him please process it, 
what was his response? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Although I cannot accurately 
10 
recount the words verbatim but I think he said something to the effect 
that I think there was note verbale attached or something like that for 
him to be able to enquire into all the necessary processing that is 
necessary. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then what was the discussion 
among the two of you? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   Although I do not recall like 
I said every single thing we discussed but all I remember saying, 
because it was standard approach I used with everybody, irrespective 
of government department, I would say to them if there is an issue with 
20 
the application revert back to the embassy, the High Commission, so 
they know what the issue is because keep quiet for six days is just not 
you know healthy for our standing in terms of these countries must look 
at us. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In the end what was the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 100 of 183 
 
understanding between you now and Major Ntshisi? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   I am not sure I understand 
what you mean. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In the understanding you had made the 
call to him to process it, did he report back to you that now we have 
processed it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you can just tell me the full conversation that 
was – that the two of you had accepting that it is quite some time back 
10 
that this happened but also accepting that you have had access to 
documents and reports I think of what different people may be saying 
happened and I assume even with regard to Mr Ntishsi’s own version if 
you can just tell me this is my recollection of what transpired during 
that conversation? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct.  According to my 
recollection Chair as I indicated earlier mine was to say to him please 
can you make sure you process – expedite processing the Flight 
Clearance Application you have received from the Indian High 
Commission.  And again I want to stress the word processing the 
20 
application.  And he indicated that there were documents missing and I 
asked which ones. He said I think one of them is a note verbale.  And I 
said please just check everything that is not in order and revert back to 
the embassy rather than sitting for 6 days and not going back to them 
so that you can – you can address the matter.  I think in essence that 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 101 of 183 
 
was actually what transpired and I had also – I think he called my PA or 
my PA called him thereafter I am not sure but my PA – and also I had 
asked my PA to convey the same thing that I actually want to see that 
this matter is processed.  And I take note of the email that my PA sent 
which I think was either a misunderstanding on her side or maybe a 
failure on my side to present it the way that she put it understand it 
properly because the email she sent subsequently said, Ambassador 
Koloane approves the issuing of the flight clearance.  Obviously I have 
got no authority Chairperson because I think if you think about this 
there are certain things that must be met to be able to issue a flight 
10 
clearance.  One of them is that you must be able to have access to civil 
aviation information otherwise if anybody can just issue that bodies 
would be falling from the skies because planes will be crashing.  So I 
do not have access to that.  So I cannot issue it because when you 
issue you have to issue coordinates, etcetera that people must utilise 
when they take off or when they arrive for landing or even en route 
coming to South Africa.  I do not have access to that information.  I do 
not know if the Department of Defence would be having a ceremony or 
an event on that particular day.  I cannot know that so that is why I say 
it is either a misunderstanding on her side or maybe my failure to 
20 
explain it properly to her because [indistincty] discussion with her that 
all I want is to see this matter being processed which is my 
responsibility to make sure that it is processed.  As to whether the 
answer is yes we issue or no I will convey whatever answer comes 
because I cannot and also particularly given that one of the most 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 102 of 183 
 
notorious government departments for following protocols stringently is 
the Department of Defence.  So I would not.  I mean I had been doing 
this – this work of facilitating flight clearance through my team of 
course not directly myself for over two and half years and therefore I 
was alive to the realities in terms of procedures and processes that I 
had no legal mandate whatsoever to dictate to any government 
department.  Even when we had an inter-departmental meeting I could 
not dictate to the police although I was the Chair of the meeting I will 
say to them, you know you have a role to play to provide security, what 
is your plan?  Have you identified people?  Who are the names so we 
10 
can put them on the list?  But I did not ever give myself power that I 
never have because I knew my limitations in terms of the statutes and 
there is no way I will have actually given instruction that I order an 
official from another department to issue when also there are – there 
are processes horizontal processes in that department that must be 
followed.  So – and furthermore I would just like to state for the record 
as well Chair that I even further said to my PA, please make sure that 
the following people are also copies so that because I am in a meeting 
they can also follow up.  And the Director of State visits that was 
referred to earlier on Wednesday Ms – or Thursday Ms Grace Mason 
20 
you will note is copied on that email and somebody as well I think Ms 
Sally. There are two people copies who was senior managers.  So if I 
was of an agenda to do something dubious why will I say let us copy 
some senior managers within protocol who know exactly processes 
must be followed.  I think for me there was purely an issue of either I 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 103 of 183 
 
fail to get across to her properly or it was either an issue of pure 
misunderstanding.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Sorry… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then in your interactions with Warrant 
Officer Ntishisi did he ask you for anything in writing or something in 
writing? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No.  He did not and then I 
got a call from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry should we not go to that letter from the 
10 
PA? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or do you want to deal with that later? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No I wanted – I can go to it Chair it is at 
page 199 of Exhibit FF – at page 199 Exhibit FF4.  Ambassador you will 
find it is that big lever arch file next to you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  FF4? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just look at the spine of 
that – is that FF4? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 199? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 199 yes.  Thank you.  It will start 
from – we have on line 8 – okay.   Yes this is from – you have already 
identified Ms Morris is your secretary at page 199 and that is dated the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 104 of 183 
 
9 April 2013. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you mentioned somebody who had 
been copied there? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes cc Ms Mason. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ms Mason was the Director 
of State Visit who would be the person in the event of a Minister 
coming who will then appoint protocol officers that will take care of that 
business.  Ms Sally Ramokgopa was my Deputy Chief of State Protocol 
10 
at the time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then what does Ms Morris 
convey to these people? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  As I stated earlier she says: 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can read the letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It says: 
“Ambassador Koloane has telephonically approved 
the request.” 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is writing to: 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  He is writing to William. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mr William Matjila? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  William Matjila. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 105 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What does he say in the email? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I repeat she says: 
“Ambassador Koloane has telephonically approved 
the request.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no there is something else there.  
Could you just read the entire email please? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Oh. 
“As per your discussion with Ambassador Koloane 
with regard to the request for flight clearance and 
landing at Waterkloof AFB for the Indian delegation.  
10 
Kindly note that Ambassador Koloane telephonically 
approves the request.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now if he – if she says Ambassador 
Koloane has telephonically approved the request, what request would 
that be? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Again like I stated I only said 
that I want – I authorise that they follow up to make sure that this 
whole application is processed but that is why I am saying it either 
20 
must have been a misunderstanding on her side because I am not the 
one who drafted the email but the orders or the instructions I could only 
give – give them a mandate is to say to them can you please follow up 
and check is happening or can you push that they process this thing so 
we can give the response irrespective of what the outcome of the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 106 of 183 
 
person will be. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now let us take a situation where let 
us say it is a head of state from another country who has applied or 
requested to land alright. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that request is sent to DIRCO. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is nothing wrong about it and you as 
DIRCO all the processes that you said you follow you would have 
followed and you quite comfortable.  You have checked with the 
10 
Presidency as you would say, you checked with the Minister and you 
comfortable that that aircraft should be allowed by defence if it is 
defence to land, would you in those circumstances say, DIRCO is 
comfortable and DIRCO approves the – or – approves the landing? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  The answer is no Ma’am.  
Like I said earlier DIRCO does not have any legal mandate whatsoever 
to determine whether any flight can land in Waterkloof or not.  All we do 
we are like a conduit, a facilitator for passing applications to defence 
and then defence will decide like I said.  Because they could be 
renovating the runway or anything like that so DIRCO cannot including 
20 
the Minister of DIRCO cannot authorise that the let – the plane land in 
Waterkloof.  All we do we really facilitate that information be moved 
from the diplomatic mission to defence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  When did you discover for the first 
time that your secretary had sent this letter – or this email to Mr 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 107 of 183 
 
Matjila? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not remember but it 
must have been quite some time later.  I do not recall.  I think in fact I 
might have only learnt of it when the NICOC investigation had started if 
I remember well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then when you then discovered 
that there was this investigation and yoh now you secretary had issued 
something like this what steps did you take? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I did not Ma’am because it 
was post the landing phase and also as I was earlier indicated by 
10 
Ambassador Matjila on that same following day the Minister had taken a 
decision that I be suspended from the department so that I will not 
interfere or tamper with potential witnesses.  So any direct engagement 
with her would have constituted if you like tampering with evidence. 
Albeit I was not happy with the manner in which I was suspended 
because in terms of the Public Service Prescripts I should have been 
given seven days to write back to tell her why I do not think I should be 
suspended and that was not done.  As you can see from the letter that 
Ambassador Matjila showed earlier of the 2 May it was exactly a day 
after and the letter was given just like that.  And I did indicate when I 
20 
accepted the letter that only because I want to cooperate I will accept it 
but I believe that my rights have been violated again. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now let us deal with that – before we 
deal with the rights insofar as your suspension is concerned I just want 
to understand – because from – what you have told the Chairperson the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 108 of 183 
 
very first time you got to hear about it is – it is when this high 
commissioner called you about it and you would not have been involved 
in anything else that was intended to either facilitate this landing or in 
any way that would be seen to be you having tried to assist other than 
the call that you made to Warrant Officer Ntshisi? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I assume we are talking 
about the request for the Ministerial plane for the alleged plane 
carrying Ministers that was requested to land at Waterkloof? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No nothing else. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Nothing else?  Okay.  What else would I 
be talking about? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I think it is from the reports it 
is common knowledge that I was invited to a meeting at OR Tambo 
International Airport wherein there was then former Minister Ben Dikobe 
Martins. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And there was the CEO of 
ACSA and myself and there was a Mr Gupta there and they wanted to 
request landing at OR Tambo International Airport.  So the Minister 
20 
wanted to get an advisory opinion from both the CEO of ACSA and 
myself because they had also requested the use of the diplomatic 
lounge at OR Tambo and the OR Tambo falls under the management 
under the Chief of Protocol in – I mean the – the protocol lounge also 
falls under the management of the Chief of State Protocol so I had to 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 109 of 183 
 
come on [indistinct] advisory.  And I did advise in that meeting that I do 
not think it is going to be viable, I do not think it will work because it is 
also used by our own protocol leadership, our executives as well as 
diplomatic missions so therefore I advised against that and so did the 
CEO of ACSA who also equally advised against arguing if I remember 
well although again it is some time back but I think his argument 
gravitated towards saying we have got regular clients that keep our 
business going we cannot chase them away only to accommodate you 
for a one or two day event. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And the Minister of Transport 
said I take your advice and he advised them accordingly that sorry on 
the basis of this advice you cannot land at Waterkloof and we then 
further went beyond that during that meeting then recommended that 
they may want to contemplate approaching private airports like 
Pilanesberg and what is the other one called?   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Lanseria? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Lanseria airport.  And with 
that the matter was dead. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then when… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to the call you received from the high 
commissioner. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Sir. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 110 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the meeting that you have just talked about.  
Which happened first? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:   The first meeting was the 
meeting that was called by the Minister Ben Dikobe Martins who was 
then Minister of Transport.   
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And then it was like the 
matter died for some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And I thought okay nobody 
10 
followed up so the matter then must have been sorted out either at 
Pilansberg or Lanseria as per the recommendation that we had made in 
the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That happened before you got a call from the 
high commissioner of India? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct.  The call from the 
high commissioner of India Chair was made to me after they had 
already submitted the application to the Department of Defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And definitely long after the 
20 
meeting that we had had at OR International Airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright.  Now at OR – at the OR Tambo 
meeting. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have been told about a number of people who 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 111 of 183 
 
attended then Minister Ben Martins was there. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were there? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  The CEO of ACSA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The CEO of ACSA. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And Mr Gupta was also 
there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it Mr Tony Gupta who was there or was it another 
brother of theirs? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I think it was Tony Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tony Gupta. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Although – although I might 
be mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I take it that at that meeting Mr Gupta gave 
full information of what this was all – this trip or this visit, this landing 
that they wanted at OR Tambo was about? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chair I am not sure whether 
20 
full information will be appropriate but he gave some information 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Which I think was critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  For the Minister to consume 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 112 of 183 
 
in order to be able to make a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And one of the things he did 
say categorically is that there was going to be a wedding and that there 
were guests that he is expecting to come and some of those guests will 
be Ministers and there might even be one of the Vice Presidents 
coming and that is why he was requesting the use of the Protocol 
Lounge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And that is how that part 
10 
came in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  So that is the information that was 
revealed.   
1.  It is a wedding – wedding. 
2. There would be some Ministers or maybe some Ministers. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  He actually said there will be 
some Ministers Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he said there will be some Ministers. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And there may be a Vice 
President. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There might be a Vice President. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And also that they would 
have liked to get an area where they could have a cultural performance 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 113 of 183 
 
to welcome and receive these special – the special guests. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  As they were presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And as you understood the conversation at that 
meeting was this cultural reception or welcome ceremony was it 
supposed to happen on the tarmac of the airport near where the aircraft 
would have landed or is that a detail that you cannot remember? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I would not remember that 
level of detail because my principal focus was on the matters dealing 
with protocol but I do recall that the CEO of ACSA did say something 
10 
and again I am not quoting him verbatim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I want to stress that but he 
did say something along the lines of – look that is a very busy time, we 
dealing with a lot of processing of immigration etcetera so we cannot 
just take our regular clients that come to us and use this airport every 
day and put them aside for you who are coming for a one day event so 
it is going to be disruptive and that is why you cannot support it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I see we are two minutes or so past one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the lunch adjournment. We 
would normally take an hours – an hour long lunch adjournment but 
there is some urgent commission business that I have to attend to. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 114 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am going to adjourn until three o’clock to attend 
to that urgent commission business. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we will resume at three. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Ambassador I would like to 
refer you to the Exhibit FF1 which is the Exhibit that contains the 
statement of Ms Sindane.  It is a small presentation file.  Yes thank 
you.  And I would like to draw your attention to page 10.  It would be 
under the second divider marked number 2.  Are you there? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  The sequence of events 
are recorded there but what I would like to ask from you because that is 
also recorded in that paragraph is whether it is correct that at the 
20 
meeting that you held at OR Tambo together with the Minister of Trans 
– former Minister of Transport and Mr Maseko from ACSA whether in – I 
beg your pardon Mr Tony Gupta whether it was mentioned that the 
request that they were making at that meeting would – they would – the 
aircraft or whoever would have Ministers on board and four or five 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 115 of 183 
 
Ministers on board. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes it was Ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And then having received then the 
call from the High Commissioner did you link the two incidents that 
there was a talk by Mr Atul Gupta of five Ministers and now you have a 
call somebody is saying look our request is taking long for it to be 
processed? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It happened a few months 
apart and initially I did not put any link to the two but when the actual 
landing happened I was actually in a position to say probably this must 
10 
be linked. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So between the time of the landing 
which should have been on the 30 April and this meeting of February 
2013 you yourself… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman have you got your – do you not want to 
say between the time of that meeting in February and… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes and the …this is what happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the landing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman this is what 
happens when I eat a lot during the lunch break.  Sorry.  Thank you.  
20 
During – you got the call from the High Commissioner would you say 
when you got that call from the High Commissioner was it at the 
beginning of April or just a few days before the landing in April? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not fully recall but I 
know that in the records it is there but I think if I remember well it was 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 116 of 183 
 
probably a week or two prior to the landing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Prior to the landing? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So… 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But I mean the dates of 
course are somewhere in one of these documents. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes.  Alright.  So then when you then 
contacted Major Ntshisi at that time when you contacted Major Ntshisi 
did you at any stage give him certain details about who is it that was 
going to be landing in the request that you were asking them to 
10 
process? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  When I initially contacted my 
office to contact Mr Matjila then Mr Matjila spoke to Mr Ntshisi and then 
subsequently I spoke to Mr Ntshisi myself but I do not recall whether 
there was too much detail in terms of who was going to be in that 
because I would not have known the information, the details of who 
would be in the – in the plane because the request for the flight 
clearance went directly to defence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Whereas if it came through 
20 
DIRCO then we will actually have – would be privy to the list of the 
people who will be on board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  When you contacted Mr Matjila what 
did you talk to him about? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  As I indicated earlier I was 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 117 of 183 
 
worried about the fact that I had received a phone call from the High 
Commissioner of India who was complaining that they had applied for a 
flight clearance and normally whilst it takes two or three days it has 
taken longer can I assist.  Then I called to say can they please process 
that that was what I really wanted them to do to process that and 
whether they were going to say we are granting or not granting was not 
in my hands. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No but we talking about Mr Matjila now 
from your department. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I also asked Mr Matjila to 
10 
from my department to actually follow up and find out what is the bottle 
neck that is delaying the issuing or not issuing of the flight clearance. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is it possible that in your conversation 
with Mr Ntshisi you might have mentioned that there would be Ministers 
on board? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not recall. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not recall at all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Now. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well would … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Of course the High 
Commissioner himself had indicated that they have sent an application 
for a Minister – Ministers will be coming on board that plane so 
although I do not recall there is a remote possibility that I might have 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 118 of 183 
 
mentioned it because the High Commissioner did mention it to me as I 
said earlier on in the morning session. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why do you say remote possibility because that 
is what you had been told at least that there would be Ministers. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Chair I do agree that I 
had been told by the High Commissioner that there will be Ministers but 
in the discussions that I had with for example everybody else I am not – 
I do not recall that I mentioned the name Ministers but I might have 
mentioned… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I accept that.  I accept that. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  That is why I am saying 
remotely – that is why I am saying there is a possibility that I might 
have said that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I accept that you say you do not remember 
whether you mentioned that or not but I was thinking that it must be 
just as possible as anything because that is the knowledge you had 
namely in terms of what you were told  - you had been told unless your 
knowledge had changed.  You had been told by the … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  High Commissioner. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  High Commissioner. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both – well you had been told by the High 
Commissioner in the telephone conversation with you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Chair. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 119 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had also heard from one of the Gupta 
brothers in the meeting that you had at OR Tambo that there would be 
Ministers? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But Chair I am trying to 
delink this because in my view there are two delinked processes.  The 
one of the Gupta’s mentioning the Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Was a request made in 
February to land at OR Tambo airport to a meeting that I was invited to 
by the Minister as well as the CEO of ACSA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And we decisively advised 
the Minister not to approve that they use that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And for me that was the 
chapter closed because we had done that and the Minister in our 
presence also informed the Gupta’s that unfortunately we cannot help 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So that is why the issue of 
20 
the Ministers that they are talking about there was different to the 
notion.  The only mention of the Ministers who were requested to land 
at the Waterkloof Air Force Base was mentioned to me by the High 
Commissioner Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I think mentioning one is good enough.  You 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 120 of 183 
 
know the one what the High Commissioner said to you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other one was just an extra and we can put that 
aside. So what I am saying is I am reacting to you saying there is a 
remote possibility that you may have said – mentioned Ministers but I 
am wondering why you say it was – it would be a remote possibility.  I 
would have thought you would say it is possible because that is what I 
was told.  You know it is not like necessarily remote but it could have – 
it is very – it is possible. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Well maybe if it pleases the 
10 
Chair for me to clarify like that.  Yes there is a possibility that I might 
have said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Because they – from – in your mind at 
that stage that is what you were talking about an aircraft that you had 
been told would have Ministers. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Please Chair bear with me 
because English is not my first language.  Sometimes I fail to express 
myself appropriately. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well so far I have had somebody who speaks 
English very eloquently. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Thank you.  I will take that 
as a compliment Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 121 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And in fact it would make sense to 
mention that to Major Ntshisi because you want the relations between 
South Africa and India as you have indicated not to be really spoilt by 
these delays.  So it would make sense to say, look I am told that there 
is going to be Ministers coming please look into this process. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Ma’am but also I think 
remember I think also in the morning session it was explained that the 
person who is the real custodian of strategic relations between South 
10 
Africa and their own countries is – will have been in this case the 
Indian High Commissioner.  So he is the one that we really service the 
most but like I said now with the advice from the Chair there is a 
possibility that I might have mentioned the word – the further – that 
there were Ministers who were going to be coming on board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And other than Mr Matjila from 
DIRCO and Major Ntshisi from defence did you mention – did you speak 
to any other person from defence? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who is that person? 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  The lady that Colonel 
Anderson who used to work at the Air Force Base. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  At what point did you speak to her? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I spoke to her when – I mean 
on a few occasions. First of all like I said I had been in the Portfolio for 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 122 of 183 
 
more than two and a half years so as the Chief of Protocol and we have 
had regular interactions and we were regularly in contact with each 
other because of work related issues.  Every time whenever we are 
going to receive is there anybody there she was on a point of call so 
there was regular interaction so I would not really – it is not like there 
will be quietness for months.  So there were regularly engagement for 
all other related matters that applied to both our portfolios. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes but about this incident.  About the 
complaints that you had received from the High Commissioner did you 
speak to Colonel Anderson about it? 
10 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I did mention it to her I think 
I cannot remember in what context but I did mention that I am 
frustrated because this Ambassador is busy nagging me and I am not 
sure where the process is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Was this before you spoke to Major 
Ntshisi or was it after you had spoken to Major Ntshisi? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I think it was around that 
time whether after or before I cannot have the appropriate recollection 
but it was around that period when I was – I had received the call and I 
was trying to ensure what is it that is the challenge so that they will 
20 
process the issue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you would have also mentioned to her 
that look I am frustrated, Ambassador says there will be many stars but 
I do not know where the process is, would you have mentioned the 
Ministers to her? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 123 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ja definitely I would have ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You would have? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And what is it that you wanted her to do 
about – about that? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Like I said I cannot 
remember the context in which the discussion happened whether I 
called her or she called me but like I said we were regularly in contact 
with each other so I would not really recall what was the – like who 
initiated the contact whether it was me who called when I mentioned 
10 
that or it was when I had called that I had mentioned that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  But what I would like to know 
Ambassador is what is it that you wanted her to do?  We know what you 
wanted Major Ntshisi to do?   You said you wanted them to – to work 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think you may be speaking at cross 
purposes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what he is saying – the point he is making is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that it may have been Colonel 
Sanderson – Anderson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Anderson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who called. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 124 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She wold have been the one who wanted something 
from him and therefore he cannot remember.  But he says he cannot 
remember whether he is the one who called.  So I think that is the 
distinction he wants.  Because your questions says, what did he want 
from her/ 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think what he is saying is I cannot remember 
whether … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Whether I wanted something from her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am the one who called in which case you are right to 
10 
ask me what I wanted her to do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether she called me.  In which case she would 
be the one who would have wanted something from me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – Ambassador is that – is my understanding 
correct… 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the point you wanted to make? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct Chair but also I think 
20 
the point I am really trying to clarify is that I am aware that we spoke a 
lot with her around the period when I was also following up to establish 
what is the bottle neck regarding the issuing of the flight clearance.  So 
I would not know whether it was before I spoke to Colonel Ntshisi or it 
was after but it was around that period because it has been quite a 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 125 of 183 
 
long tim. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  That has elapsed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at least from what you say maybe it does clarify 
at least in part… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Slightly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say at some stage when you were speaking to her 
you sought to establish what was holding back the processing of the 
application but what you cannot remember is whether it was before you 
10 
spoke to Mr Ntshisi or after. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  With her Chair I was 
expressing my frustration at the fact that I have been nagged by the 
High Commissioner of India regarding the non-issuance of the flight 
clearance and I was trying to establish if she knew at all what – you 
know where the process was in as far as the [indistinct] concerned.  
Whether I asked her before or after I had spoken to Ntshisi I do not 
really recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is what you cannot remember. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  How long did it take for this 
issue to be resolved?  Did it take weeks, how long did it take? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not really remember 
Ma’am.  But I think we can establish that by checking the date on the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 126 of 183 
 
flight clearance because it will guide us in terms of when it was issued. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back before – let us go back to your 
conversation with Warrant Officer Ntshisi.  You have already testified 
about that. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said what the gist of the conversation was.  
As far as you are concerned did you capture everything important in 
regard to that conversation? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Sir I think I did Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. yes.  And you would have read what I think 
is recorded in the – in the report.  I think Warrant Officer Ntshisi if I am 
not mistaken says that one of things you said was that Number 1 or the 
President was aware of the – this request for a visit and as I 
understand what is recorded and I for now I leave out what Major 
Ntshisi said when he was in the witness stand because it may be 
necessary to recall him to clarify certain things.  Is there – is your 
understanding that that is – that reference to Number 1 or the President 
does relate to that conversation or is it a later conversation? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chair as of course in 
20 
attempting to respond to the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Since of course there has 
been a big leg of time between the incidents that happened in my 
recollection I doubt that I would have actually used that word at all. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 127 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no let us take it step by step.  For now let me not 
deal with what your version is.  I am saying did you see in the 
documents that have been made available including the report of the 
Directors General that there is a suggestion that the version that was 
told to them was that in a conversation with Warrant Officer Ntshisi you 
said Number – you referred to Number 1 either Number 1 or the 
President that he was aware of the visit and you said something to the 
effect that the – the application should be approved either approved or 
processed but you mentioned Number 1 or the President, are you aware 
that that is what is in the documentation and is attributed to you before 
10 
we can talk about whether it correctly reflects what you said. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Chair I am sorry Chair I am – may I approach? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes come.  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  I beg your pardon Chair but I think in fairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  In fairness to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  We should identify  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  The particular paragraphs of the report which 
20 
you have in mind because to my recollection what the report suggests 
is not that that exchange took place in a conversation between 
Ambassador Koloane and Mr Ntshisi but rather between Mr Ntshisi and 
Colonel Anderson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No but you should listen to my question.  I 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 128 of 183 
 
asked him what his understanding is of what the documentation says.  
So in other words I said is his understanding that that was a 
conversation with Mr Ntshisi then or later in which case if his 
understanding is that the documentation does refer to any such 
conversation with Ntshisi where he mentioned that he can say no, no, 
no I am not aware that the documents have such a reference.  I am 
aware that the documents refer to which mention that are documents 
relating to a conversation I had with somebody else. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you understand? 
10 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I am not aware Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not aware? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I am only aware as indicated 
of the – the reference to the discussion between Colonel Anderson and 
Mr Ntshisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Norman do you… 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And Chair must also indicate 
that maybe when the Chair deems it appropriate I would also like to 
20 
raise some serious issues I have about the report itself because the 
bulk of the questions will be based on the report of the JPCS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And I think if it pleases the 
Chair I would just like to make some comments around that. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 129 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no definitely 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  That is of course when 
they… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will give you the chance to do that. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman do you want to take that question 
forward? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Maybe I should just 
direct… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am under the impression I may be wrong… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am under the impression that Ntshisi is reflected as 
having said that but I may be wrong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He does confirm certain paragraphs in the 
report and I will take the witness through those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Could we – just a 
minute please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well to the extent that if you are going to go to the 
20 
report it may be that this might be the time that we allow the witness to 
mention … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The areas of concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His concerns about the report. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 130 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we can go into it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to deal with that Ambassador? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes Chair thank you very 
much for according me the opportunity.  Chair as we listened to the 
testimony of one of the witnesses by the name of Ms Sindane on 
Wednesday she under oath indicated that a cluster of ministers 
appointed for people to be – to form the JPCS that will then be tasked 
amongst other things with the – engagement the implicated people, 
getting reports from what has been done in the past etcetera.  And she 
10 
further indicated that under when – under cross – under examination 
she indicated that she tried to arrange and meet with Ms Anderson 
unsuccessfully so.  I just want to go on record Chair that I as one of 
the people who was implicated was never ever invited by the committee 
of the four people so that they could sit with me and say to me there is 
some contradictory information we have received which conflicts with 
the statement that you had given.  Never.  So I was never subjected to 
that.  Secondly I would just like to indicate Chair that one of the people 
in that committee it came out because all of this for me is new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Is that Mr Tom Moyane was 
part of that committee but he never sat in the meetings where I was 
interrogated by a committee of about fourteen people which meant Ms 
Sindane will be the only people who will actually be influenced in that 
together with Ms Ndlomo but I want to go on record that I was never 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 131 of 183 
 
given an opportunity to interact with the information not necessarily 
people, individuals but even to be told that you have said this but there 
is somebody who can collaborate you information they say the opposite 
what do you have to say?  That exercise was never done.  Lastly Chair 
I would like to state that I was called by the committee – the only 
committees I met with I think I must make the statement to the Chair 
allows.  The first meeting is the one that was referred to earlier this 
morning a meeting of the NICOC extended NICOC meeting wherein the 
Deputy General in the Presidents recommended that a committee 
comprising of DG’s of all the affected departments be formed.  I was 
10 
invited by that committee through the DG to a meeting in one of the 
security houses in Eastern Pretoria.  When I got there they asked me a 
lot of questions and I asked – I said to them, in the letter that I 
received I was told I am only going to meet Mr Ndlomo.  Mr Ndlomo not 
the one put in the newspapers as Thulani Ndlomo but the other Ndlomo 
who actually his name is Dennis Ndlomo who was Ambassador in 
Algeria.  He was the Chair of that meeting.  But there must have been 
about thirteen or fourteen people I do not recollect.  They asked me a 
lot of questions and I said to them, what is the legal status of this 
gathering?  And they said to me, it is a formal and legally constituted 
20 
structure to conduct an investigation about the landing of the Gupta 
plane in Waterkloof.  I then asked them I said, Do you not think it would 
have been appropriate for you to inform me accordingly so that I will 
have exercised my rights to legal representation if I so choose?  They 
then said no it is fine can I be excused for a few minutes.  I was.  After 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 132 of 183 
 
that they called me back after quite a long period and they said okay 
we are going to give you questions in writing so that you can have a 
chance to consult with your legal counsel.  I did that.  I responded to 
those questions within a very short period of time in less than three 
days and I sent it back to them.  Number of weeks elapsed and then 
one day again through the DG they called me to the same guest house 
and they say I must come and clarify some of the answers I had given 
to them in writing.  But that to me was just an exercise in futility 
because the same day that they called me they had already given the 
report to the Minister Jeff Radebe who was already reading it.  So the 
10 
question is what was the purpose of calling me by all these committee 
members?  It presupposes that some of these members did not know 
that there was a final report out there already because they will not 
have wasted their valuable time sitting and trying to establish that. So I 
actually have a number of concerns about the inaccuracies in my view 
what I see as inaccuracies expressed in the report.  And again if it 
pleases the Chair I would request that the commission establishes from 
the lady who was here testifying if they ever made… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sindane. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ms SIndane thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry Chair I am just – the 
technicians are – they are saying that their system is a bit down.  
Whether you – yes if you could allow them just five minutes so that they 
can deal with that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  We are not being recorded we are not being 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 133 of 183 
 
heard or something like that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes that is what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us take a short adjournment to allow 
the technicians to attend to what they need to attend to and then we 
will continue.  Hopefully five minutes will be enough. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Figure out what it is that is a problem but we are 
going to proceed because I understand whatever the problem is has not 
affected our recording for the purposes of the transcript. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will – we will continue.  Let us continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Thank 
you 
Mr Chairman.  
Ambassador Koloane was still mentioning matters that you found to be 
20 
matters of concern in the JCPS Report. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  That is right.  I just wanted 
to indicate Chair that on the very last meeting when I was called into 
clarify the answers that I had provided when I got onto my radio 
Minister Jeff Radebe was also reading on television the outcome of the 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 134 of 183 
 
work of the JCPS Cluster … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Which to me was extremely 
worrisome that I would be called to come and account and to provide 
my own account of issues but already there is a pre-delivered report 
which has been presented.  It – it raises questions to me over and 
above what I said earlier. 
None the less having said that I am willing to cooperate with 
the Commission if they want to raise issues on I wanted to go on record 
that the manner in which the final report was compiled by the JCPS 
10 
smells fishy and normally if it smells fishy it is fish and I am raising 
that because I have explained Chair that the people that interviewed 
me I would have expected that they are the people who are also 
associating with this document but now there are people who never 
said (indistinct) wrong but they are part of – they are the ones 
compiling the final report. 
I just wanted to go on record on that and that I will be willing 
to cooperate fully … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  With the Commission but I 
20 
just wanted that serious concern noted because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It raises a lot of questions in 
my head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 135 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Particularly given that the 
Chair of that Committee in our first interaction at NICOC she was the 
first one to pronounce that I must not be allowed to use State funds to 
– to defend myself legally and I was not sure where that came from 
either because I thought I was being if you like interviewed for what 
happened during the execution of my job as Chief of Protocol so I was 
not sure. 
So I thought there was already a bias and then when the 
report comes in the way that it did.  It definitely raises serious 
concerns on my side.  I just want to go on record on that and then and 
10 
whatever questions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I can Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  So what you attacking about 
the report is the process but you have not identified factual 
inaccuracies in the report? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  There are. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you please identify them? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  One of them that for example 
Ms Sindane also made reference to is that I told her – I told somebody 
that the Minister of Transport has approved landing in Waterkloof.  
Surely – surely you will also appreciate that I will not be that naive to 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 136 of 183 
 
expect a Minister from Transport to supersede the Minister of Defence 
when the - Waterkloof is the base falling under the authority of Minister 
of Defence. 
So surely the only thing I wanted to – to go on record again 
on is that yes the Minister of Transport spoke to me about the landing 
in OR Tambo but never did I make reference to it landing in Waterkloof. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What – what other inaccuracies are 
there? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I cannot recall all of them 
now because if maybe you ask a question I will be able to indicate 
10 
because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
There 
was 
a 
lot 
of 
information.  Maybe I may also indicate that a lot of information was 
given to us extremely late Chair and maybe to correct also the 
impression created that we - we requested a postponement to Monday 
because we wanted to make an affidavit is inaccurate.  It was because 
we got some of the documents actually on Friday.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I could not prepare.  I could 
20 
not prepare … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Properly without access to 
that.  So that was the only reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 137 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Primary reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
Why 
we 
requested 
an 
extension.  So clearly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  With all the documents in 
your – in the possession of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It has been a very difficult 
period for us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  I - I will just refer you to what 
I believe which is – which is something that Major Ntshisi has 
confirmed because as you – I think you would appreciate the fact that 
the conversations that you had with Colonel Anderson and with 
Major Ntshisi are critical conversations.  So I would like you to 
comment on those. 
So if you do not mind could you please look – have a look at 
20 
EXHIBIT FF1 which is the report – where the report is contained and 
then you can just tell the Chairperson where you believe that … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  FF1 page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  FF1 if you could please turn to page 11. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  11. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 138 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it will under or next to paragraph 
2.1.12. 
“On 2 April 2013 the Chief of State Protocol 
contacted the Political Advisor to the Minister of 
Defence and Military Veterans to inquire as to the 
progress with the request.  The Ambassador stated 
that he was under pressure from number one on the 
matter.  The Political Advisor stated that he was not 
in a position to respond at that point in time.” 
Is that statement correct? 
10 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No it is not ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  All of it or certain parts? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I did ask – I did call the 
Advisor after the – the Ambassador of India said he is aware that the 
request has been elevated to the Minister.  So I wanted to find out from 
him if – if the Minister had made or applied her mind to the – to the 
said request. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So which part of that paragraph that 
I have read out is not accurate? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  The reference that I was 
20 
under pressure from number one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Only that part? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  In fact – sorry. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 139 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, sorry. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ja, ja.  It is – that is 
basically it yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then paragraph 2.1.15. 
“On 9 April 2013 the Chief of State Protocol 
telephoned Sergeant Major Ntshisi at the Air Force 
Command Post to inquire as to the progress with 
the 
clearance 
request 
from 
the 
Indian 
High 
Commission.  Ntshisi informed the Ambassador that 
the base could only receive flights transporting 
10 
Heads of State and their Deputies.” 
Is that paragraph so far correct or the contexts of that paragraph so far 
correct? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not have a proper 
recollection of the – the content of the discussion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I accept that it was about 
following up on whether the flight clearance has been processed or not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; but would you have – would – 
Major Ntshisi would have told you what – what would they normally 
20 
allow? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I – I suppose so but as I 
indicated earlier ma’am I would have also asked him why they had 
allowed the – the mother of the King of Swaziland to land at Waterkloof 
if those are the only categories but I am just saying if – if that was my 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 140 of 183 
 
objective but that was not.  My objective was just to establish if they 
have issued and/or processed the flight clearance. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So what do you say about that 
paragraph?  You are not sure. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not – I do not remember 
that at all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Let us move. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us – let us put it this way according to this 
report Warrant Officer Ntshisi at the time according to the report told 
you in that conversation that the base could only receive flights 
10 
transporting Heads of State and their Deputies.  Do you remember him 
having said that to you or are you saying you do not remember he may 
have said so but you do not remember or you say he definitely did not 
say so? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chairperson I doubt that he 
would have said so and I will give you reasons why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
Because 
when 
he 
was 
testifying sitting here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  He indicated that people who 
have utilised Waterkloof is the Head of State, the Deputy Head of State 
and Ministers if they are doing business – Government business.  So he 
would not have restricted himself to only Heads of State and Deputies 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 141 of 183 
 
because he knows the work.  He is being working in that area for quite 
some time. 
That is why I am saying I find difficulty in associating with a 
statement which is incomplete because I will have expected him to 
actually say even including special envoys for example which also land 
at Waterkloof.  So that is why for me that statement makes me feel 
uncomfortable again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can imagine that he might have said Heads of 
State and their Deputies if he did not intend giving the whole list … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chair … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if he was then asked are those the only people 
then if he said Heads of State and their Deputies only.  Then he would 
have appreciated that he was now being asked to give the full list or 
what do you say? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I think Chair it would have 
been an anomaly for him to do – to say that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Because the application for 
the landing was indicating that it is Ministers not Heads of State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So he will have to responded 
to it  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
And 
said 
sorry 
these 
Ministers … 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 142 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Because of this we are 
denying them the right to land. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So I would have understood 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your recollection that at this stage he knew or he 
had seen the application or the papers that indicated details … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the request? 
10 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I would not be able to tell 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
Because 
as 
I 
said 
unfortunately the request had been sent directly to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  To the – to the Minister of 
Defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May we then proceed 
Ambassador? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 143 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
“Then 
the 
Ambassador 
responded that there would be four to five Ministers 
on board.” 
Does that accord with your recollection? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  As I indicated earlier I could 
have said that because the Minister – the High Commission of India had 
told me that there will be four - four.  In fact I think I said six or eight 
Ministers will be on board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  He added that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Going to the point that you made in regard to the 
statement to say you would have been surprised if he gave an 
incomplete list.  If indeed he did say landing at Waterkloof was for 
Heads of State and their Deputies then it would be understandable 
would it not if you then said you know the people who are coming 
include 
Ministers 
because 
you 
were 
aware 
that 
according 
to 
Commissioner – the High Commissioner it was Ministers who were 
going to be involved in the plane in terms of Government Officials and 
20 
not other people. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chair the way I read it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Again subject to correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 144 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Is that if he says to me it is 
only the Heads of State and their Deputies who land there and that is 
an understanding we have both established.  I think it will make more 
sense than for me to say oh yes by the way there is a Deputy President 
in the plane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So for me it does not 
suddenly follow that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  The mentioning that there 
10 
will be Ministers is linked to the statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  That he might have made 
earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that last bit. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I am saying to – to Chair I 
am trying to indicate Chair that there is no direct link between the two.  
They may be or they may not be linked because if he said sorry we only 
allow people like when you go to some places they say sorry we only 
allow people who are 18 years and older.  They say of course I am 18.  
20 
You then show that. 
You do not say I am 14.  So even in this case when they say 
it is only Heads of State and their Deputies for me to make an – to 
continue engaging based on that.  I will have had to say indeed also in 
this plane coming there is a Deputy President or a President. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 145 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless of course your understanding was that 
Ministers can also land there under certain circumstances despite what 
he was saying. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I agree Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And I am sure also that even 
in his understanding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  He knows that Ministers land 
there and … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Earlier this morning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ambassador Matjila made 
reference for example to Hilary Clinton who has landed there manier 
times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So – do - Ministers do land 
there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And I am 100 percent sure 
that he knows that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No what – what I mean is if he said to you 
Heads of State and their Deputies land here and you know that 
Ministers also land there under certain circumstances it appears to me 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 146 of 183 
 
to be natural for you to say - to refer to Ministers because that might 
just remind him that do – Ministers do also actually land there or you 
do not think so? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not recall Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But of course I could have 
said that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Ministers but I do not recall 
or … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not recall ja but it is possible but you do not – 
you are not sure? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not recall that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  He added that: 
“The Minister of Transport Mr Ben Martins had been 
given instructions by the President to assist the 
Gupta family.  That the Minister of Defence and 
Military Veterans has no objection.  That at a 
meeting of the Minister of Transport, the CEO of 
20 
ACSA and the Guptas he had been told to assist 
and that this was a unique case.” 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I deny categorically that 
statement.  It sounds very much like the media statement I read after 
they discovered at meeting that Minister – of Ben Martins had had in 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 147 of 183 
 
OR Tambo. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So everything that I have read is – is 
inaccurate? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I – I do not recall that at all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then: 
“Ntshisi requested a note or a letter from …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well some of these are important pieces.  So I just 
want to draw attention that if you do not recall - if you say you do not 
10 
recall what it means is that it could be that you said it.  It could be that 
you did not say it.  So it is important that you make up your mind as to 
whether the position is that you do not recall.  It could be that you said 
it. 
It could be that you did not say it or you are quite clear that 
you did not say it.  In which case if you are quite clear that you did not 
say it then you say I definitely did not say it.  So I just want to explain 
that so that you – you understand what – what meaning I attach to a 
statement when you say I do not recall. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that you can make sure I – I get exactly what you 
want to convey. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chair, may I ask … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  For clarity on the question? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 148 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  If you read the line that was 
just read to me for example it states that – it says: 
“He added that the Minister of Transport had been 
given instructions by the President to assist the 
Gupta family.  That the Minister of Defence and 
Minister of Veterans had no objection.  That at a 
meeting of the Minister of Transport, the CEO of 
ACSA and the Guptas he had been told to assist 
and that this was a unique case.” 
10 
Who would have told the Minister of – I am just thinking 
aloud.  I am not trying to ask – I am the ones answering questions but I 
am trying to highlight the other inaccuracies in this report.  Who would 
have told Minister Martins when we had indicated that the people in the 
meeting was myself, the CEO of ACSA, Mr Gupta and Minister Martins 
and we already reported what transpired in that meeting but the way 
that reads it is like Mr Martins had been given an instruction to assist 
and that is what I am trying to say I am getting – you know – confused. 
Who would – you know – inform Minister Martins to – to 
actually do so? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well where it says: 
“He added …” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take that to be a reference to you.  Is that correct? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 149 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that you added.  Same sentence that you are 
dealing with just now.  At the beginning of it. 
“He 
added 
that 
the 
Minister 
of 
Transport 
Minister Ben Martins had been given instructions 
…” 
My understanding that the “he” is a reference to you.  Is that 
your understanding as well? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  If that is what is meant then I 
hear but … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not think that takes care of the point you 
have made.  It maybe – maybe I might have misunderstood.  My 
understanding is that because the previous sentence relates to you. 
“The Ambassador responded to that there will be 
four to five Ministers on board.” 
Then the next sentence. 
“He 
added 
that 
the 
Minister 
of 
Transport 
Mr Ben Martins had been given instructions …” 
That “he” I understand to be a reference to the Ambassador.  
That would be your understanding of – of this as well or not really? 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  If you clarify it like that Chair 
but again like I said I do not recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If it is read like that then you understand it but 
you do not recall? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes sir. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 150 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then of course it says: 
“He 
added 
that 
the 
Minister 
of 
Transport 
Mr Ben Martins had been given instructions by the 
President to assist the Gupta family.  That the 
Minister of Defence and Military Veterans has no 
objection.  That at a meeting of the Minister of 
Transport, the CEO of ACSA and the Guptas he had 
been told to assist and that this was a unique 
10 
case.” 
This last “he” … 
“…he had been told to assist …” 
My initial reaction was that it is a reference to the Minister 
and if read like that it seems to me it would mean the Minister was told 
at the meeting involving ACSA at the airport to assist but it is possible 
that that “he” refers to you having been told to assist because this is a 
unique case.  I am not sure.  I am just putting ideas that come to mind 
as I try to understand what is being said.  You - you understand that? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I think the – the distinction 
20 
that the Chair is identifying of the two meanings is exactly what I was 
also saying.  I was identifying as confusing in that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but you say whatever the – whoever the “he” 
is referred to you – you have no recollection that … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No I do not recall Chair. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 151 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  This – this was said? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and even if the suggestion that it was said by 
you – you say … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not recall? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you appreciate the distinction that I have 
just said about … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Being – about saying I do not recall or never – I 
never said it? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair; and then: 
“GC requested a note or a letter from the 
Ambassador …” 
Do you recall that? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  He did say that you send 
something in writing and that is when I asked my PA to send an email 
20 
saying that can they please process that – the application which 
unfortunately I think we went through it in the morning was sent in way 
which said I have authorised it when I do not have such powers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
“…and the Ambassador responded that challenge 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 152 of 183 
 
was that this could not be put in writing.” 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No.  I - I could not say that 
and then immediately instruct my PA to send an email to confirm that I 
want them to process and also ask my PA to copy two of the Senior 
Managers 
in 
the 
Protocol 
Section 
that 
is 
my 
Deputy 
Ms Sally Ramokgopa and Ms Grace Mason. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So: 
“He 
added 
that 
He 
had 
met 
with 
Lieutenant Colonel Anderson the previous week to 
show them around the area.” 
10 
Did that happen?  Did you at any stage meet with 
Colonel Anderson?  Did you go around the area?  I would imagine 
maybe at Waterkloof. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  The only time that I met with 
Colonel Anderson at Waterkloof was when we went there to do a dry 
run before the arrival.  Like for whenever you have got delegations 
coming landing there some would request that they would like a pre 
inspection to see how they are going to plan it and it was something 
standard that we used to do in the two and a half years that I worked 
there which also I am sure will appear in the – in the report of the 
20 
meeting with the Public Protector which was held to verify that very 
same point. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes but – but this showing around did it 
relate to the landing of – of Jet Airways? 
AMBASSADOR VSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I – I just do not remember that 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 153 of 183 
 
at all ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  You do not remember it or it never 
occurred? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No, no I know that there was 
an inspection because I did I asked her to – if she could arrange to 
meet with the people and I know that there was a – what do you – there 
were people who went there to – from events management company 
who went there to actually see how they could actually do the décor for 
the arrival. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So this would have been for the 
10 
arrival of the Jet Airways Aircraft? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
For 
the 
– 
for 
the 
(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For the Gupta wedding? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So this then according to you and 
your recollection Ambassador this would have happened prior … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Before the landing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Before the landing? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and it would have also happened prior 
to 9 April because that is the date when you spoke to Major Ntshisi? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I am not sure of the – I do 
recollect the dates ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You do not … 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 154 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It has been a long time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So what else – what else were – did 
you – did you become part of in preparation for the landing other than 
for the events management company for the Gupta wedding that went to 
– to have a look at Waterkloof?  What other activities did you – did you 
participate in prior to the landing? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I am not sure I understand 
what you mean by activities ma’am but as far as I know that is basically 
– my – my job was only in protocol and I had no other business in all 
other – you know - portfolios because those fell – fell under different 
10 
people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So can we agree then that at this 
point when you went together with Colonel Anderson to look at 
Waterkloof this aircraft had not received clearance at that point? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No ma’am.  The only time 
that you can allow people to come and do a pre inspection is only when 
they have received the flight clearance and then after receiving 
clearance then they arrange to go and do a pre arrival inspection about 
how they are going to deal with the things there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes but then let us just retract.  Rather let 
20 
us – let us retrace our steps.  If on 9 April that is the day when you 
were speaking to Major Ntshisi. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the day when the clearance had 
not happened but already you were telling him that Colonel Anderson is 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 155 of 183 
 
aware of this because she had been to Waterkloof.  Well you have just 
told us now with the events company – management company.  Now at 
that point there were – there was no clearance when Colonel Anderson 
went. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I think ma’am I think you 
meant to say the company went because Colonel Anderson worked at 
Waterkloof.  So she was always perpetually there.  That is one.  
Number two, I am saying again ma’am although I do not recall the exact 
sequence and the date because of the time lag all I am certain of is 
that there is no way that I would have said to him that we have already 
10 
had a pre inspection if the – the flight clearance had not been issued.  I 
do not remember the exact dates like … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  You know – as they are like 
that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  We are going to come back to the 
dates and I am going to show you Ambassador that at the time when 
you were telling Major Ntshisi that Colonel Anderson had been there 
Major Ntshisi had not issued a clearance certificate because if it – if it 
did not happen – if it happened before the 9 t h then clearly when 
20 
Colonel Anderson went to do – with the events company to go there - 
there was no clearance that had been issued for this aircraft but we will 
get back to that.  I do not want us to … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It is okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I want us to deal with what we are dealing 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 156 of 183 
 
with now … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It is okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But I will show you that.  Thank you.  Now 
the Ambassador – sorry.  I beg your pardon.  We were – okay: 
“…to show them the area.  GC should contact the 
Lieutenant Colonel to confirm this.” 
So 
you 
are 
telling 
GC 
on 
that 
day 
that 
he 
must 
contact 
Colonel Anderson to confirm this. 
“The Ambassador stated clearly that this was for 
the Gupta family wedding.” 
10 
So would that accord with your recollection? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No I do not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You do not recall? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What is it that you do not recall?  
That you would have told him that it was a Gupta wedding or the fact 
that he must contact Colonel Anderson because she had been there. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I do not recall telling him it 
was a Gupta wedding. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
20 
“He instructed Ntshisi to call him back.” 
Do you recall asking Ntshisi to call you back? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  When I tried to call initially 
and I did not get him and I left a message and then secondly I said 
once they have established whether they were granting or not granting 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 157 of 183 
 
then they must call me back to let me know so I could converse that 
information to the High Commissioner of India. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and then on 13 May 2013: 
“The Director-General in the Presidency stated that 
at no point did the President give instructions to 
Ambassador Koloane or discuss the issue of the 
landing of the aircraft with him.” 
Would that statement be correct? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Regarding specific … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have lost you where you are.  I was looking for 
something else. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair.  It is the last 
paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the report? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  At page 11.  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You see on page 11. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We dealt with: 
“…instructed Ntshisi to call him back.” 
And then on 13 May 2013: 
“The Director-General in the Presidency stated that 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 158 of 183 
 
at no point did the President give instructions to 
Ambassador Koloane or discuss the issue of the 
landing of the aircraft with him.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I – I missed you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was looking for something else. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is Chair at page 11? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I am on that page. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to talk about something that you may have 
asked already. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In – in that paragraph after the part that we were 
dealing with which you could not recall relating to somebody being told 
to assist and this was - and that this was a unique case.  It is reflected 
that Mr Ntshisi requested a note or letter from the Ambassador and that 
the Ambassador responded that the challenge was that this could not 
be put in writing.  She probably has asked you this.  What is your 
20 
answer to … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No I responded Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether there was that exchange or not? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I said that is not an accurate 
reflection of what – of what I did. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 159 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It was on the contrary I 
instructed my PA to send an email that yes I do want them to continue 
processing the application and then let us know so that we can inform 
the Indian High Commission about the outcome thereof and I had asked 
my PA to also copy two of Senior Managers in the process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Because I had no issues to 
hide.  So why would I have – I would not have said therefore that I 
cannot put it in writing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say you never said that or you cannot 
remember whether you say – you said it the statement that on this page 
is 
attributed 
to 
you 
and 
it 
is 
said 
that 
it 
came 
from 
Warrant Officer Ntshisi. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No Chair unfortunately like I 
said I do not recall at all some of these things becue of the time lag 
and unfortunately had the JCPS Team called me at that time when all 
was fresh in my mind I would have been in a better position to respond 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But now I am sitting with this 
six and a half - more than six years later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And obviously it is something 
I have been trying to put behind my back in the first place. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 160 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So I do not have a very vivid 
or accurate recollection of some of the sequencing and some of the 
issues that had transpired there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you … 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But of course … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Like I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please finish. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And of course like I said I am 
10 
trying to cooperate with the Commission to the best of my ability 
despite the challenges that I have indicated getting the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I understand that. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE: 
 
Some 
information 
– 
documents on Friday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  And having to try and 
squeeze with my legal counsel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Based on their availability. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Try to recollect and recall 
some of the things.  It is rather difficult … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But nonetheless I am not 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 161 of 183 
 
using this as an excuse for anything. I am just trying to say that I may 
not have a fair recollection when it comes to date or the timing for 
example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. I know that your legal team did ask that you be 
given a chance to give evidence this week to which I agreed and I said 
Monday at the time we spoke. I think it would have been Tuesday or 
Wednesday. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  It was on Tuesday, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Tuesday. I know that at that time your legal team 
and you were still waiting to be furnished with certain documents and I 
10 
know that, I think Ms Norman indicated or somebody indicated from the 
legal team that you would be given documents as soon as possible. I do 
not think at that stage there was any contemplation of a delay in terms 
of documents that the Commission did have already but you have 
indicated that you only got some on Friday. Is that correct? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Chair, first correction is that 
the request was made on Wednesday when we came here not on 
Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  It was not Wednesday and we 
20 
were promised that we will get them on Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  But unfortunately we only got 
the first batch on Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 162 of 183 
 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So I am just trying to indicate 
the sequencing and if you look at the bulkiness of the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  We are to deal with, it is, I 
think it is you know. It is… (indistinct) I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Otherwise I could have used 
an argument that I have not been given enough time, I need a month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  I requested a months’ 
10 
extension but I just wanted to subject myself to this process so that I 
can continue with my work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me tell you something in relation to the 
Commission that may assist. The Commission was going to sit 
tomorrow in order to hear other evidence but have been told that the 
witness was going to give evidence tomorrow is not able to do so due 
to family situation. Now I wonder whether to the extent that you may 
have a complaint or concern that you have not had enough time to look 
at the documentation, you think it would help if we adjourned and 
allowed time and then come back tomorrow. I understand you only need 
20 
to leave later for I assume the Netherlands? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  No, we can continue, chair. I 
was just indicating because I do not really believe that if we extend up 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 163 of 183 
 
until tomorrow given that my legal counsel also has got other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Legal obligations with other 
clients… (indistinct) have time to consult with them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  So I might just as well, it will 
just be a waste of the Chair’s time as well as that of the Commission to 
do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No, it is fine and I will ask what your Counsel’s 
attitude is. I am saying this because we do want to make sure that 
10 
everyone feels that they have a fair opportunity. Let me hear if your 
Counsel has anything to say in regard to this. Where we can we would 
not like a situation where later when everything is done there is still a 
feeling that had I been given a little bit more time, you know I may have 
dealt with issues differently. Yes, Counsel? 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Chair, in the greater scheme of things the 
difference between a journey now and continuing is really negligible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  We, the instructions that we have had thus far is 
given the peculiar nature of this witness does having been posted 
20 
overseas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  It is difficult to coordinate. So we thought it best in 
an effort to be corporative to try and use the time as fruitfully as 
possible. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 164 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  And that remains our instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  But we of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  I am constrained to reserve my client’s rights 
obviously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Given the amount of time but really I think in 
essence what we are saying is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  If we really want to utilize the time fully as a 
normal witness would and leaving aside our efforts to try and be as 
corporative as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Well then, it would not be possible to give evidence 
this week. We would have to adjourn and he would have to come back 
at a later date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  We do not want to go there as presently advised. 
20 
We want to use the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  And so our attitude at this stage is we would like to 
continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 165 of 183 
 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  But with a reservation of rights. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay alright thank you. I think what your counsel 
has said seems to be in accordance with what you have said. 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes, Chair. And again maybe 
I may just also add one thing toward what my legal counsel has said. 
That our reservations do not only emanate from the timing but also from 
the fact that when we requested some of the testimony that was utilized 
by the former people who appeared before this Commission we were 
told that that is classified, we cannot have access to it and yet it was 
admissible to be used here particularly implicating me. So in terms of 
10 
being able to prepare myself properly I feel that my rights were 
prejudiced because I am engaging with people who have probably seen, 
listened and heard what they are talking about and given that a six-
year period had lapsed. I have been denied that right to also have the 
same access but yet the information is admissible to be utilized by this 
who are leading the interrogation. So I am just feeling, Chair, and again 
please bear with me for my naïveté. I may not necessarily understand 
that you know certain processes may be allowed for those who are 
leading evidence to have, to be the only ones with access to certain 
information and those affected be denied because of it being exclusive. 
20 
You know, but to a layperson it says there is something just not right. 
You know, that is all I was just trying to say, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I do not know exactly what documents you have 
in mind but there is no document that I am aware of as we speak that 
the Commission has which may not be made available to you. Whether 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 166 of 183 
 
or not it may have been available sometime last week I do not know but 
as I speak now I am not aware of a document that may not be made 
available to you. But I do know that on Thursday, as Thursday there 
was a transcript or recording that the Commission had wanted which is 
not be made available to the Commission and despite certain promises 
have been made. And I drew that to the attention of the Chief of the Air 
Force who was giving evidence and asked him to facilitate the release 
of the document or the recording which he undertook to look into and 
over the weekend or on Friday I was told that either that had been 
made available at some stage or was going to be made available over 
10 
the weekend. So to the extent that you might refer to that, I can assure 
you that I have not seen it but I have been told that it is there. I have 
not even seen it myself. I was told that there was I think a memory stick 
or something like that and it was left at the gate with the police at my 
official residence. I was told but it has never reached me. So as we 
speak I do not know about that. But anything that you want to have 
sight of nobody can or should deny that without me having a final say. 
If anybody says you are not entitled to have it, you can raise that your 
lawyers with me and then I can hear what the problem is and can make 
a ruling. So I just want to mention that part but I do not know if there 
20 
are other parts but I see your counsel is back in front of me. So I think 
maybe probably would prefer that he speaks. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Thank you, Chair. Yes, Chair, your characterization 
of the events is what was relayed to us and we certainly have no 
reason to doubt that. But where we have some concern is not that 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 167 of 183 
 
necessarily the documents are being or recordings are being 
deliberately withheld but that once they are becoming available, they 
become available during the course of the testimony and the witness 
does not have an opportunity to consider them before he is questioned 
in relation to the contents of those conversations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  So what springs to mind in particular is specific 
recordings that I believe are on record as having been held between 
the Ambassador and Colonel Anderson and in my learned friend’s 
questioning this morning she did touch on some of the conversations. 
10 
And I withheld an objection to that point but we place on record now 
that we have some concern if there is going to be questioning in regard 
to those conversations before we have had an opportunity to listen to 
those recordings. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no with special reference to that one, I mean to 
the recording to which I have made reference, my understanding is that 
the evidence leader intended to lead evidence on that and to ask me for 
leave to play it. But if you have not had a chance to listen to it and he 
has not had a chance, I would be inclined to think that might be a 
reason for us to adjourn and then continue tomorrow so that you get 
20 
that opportunity to do that. What is your attitude to that? 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Yes, Chair. That is certainly something we would 
want to take you up on that offer and of course that goes for any 
recordings or any documents that are intended to be used I think that is 
a matter of principle. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 168 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but what it does also even though you and your 
client might have taken a different view is that it also does give him 
and yourselves an opportunity to look at any other documents that have 
been given to you on which he might not have had time to reflect 
properly. And then when we continue tomorrow hopefully, the 
documents that he might not have had enough time to look at. He might 
have had some more time. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Yes, Chair, I am not sure it necessarily solves the 
problem completely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  It mitigates the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it mitigates, ja. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you. Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you have to say about these things? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Chair, there were only no documents that 
were withheld on the basis that they were not to be made available to 
the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  The only document that had not been 
declassified as of this morning was the FF12 which I referred the 
chairperson to which is the documents that were from the Presidency 
and also the DIRCO report which is attached to Ambassador Matjila’s 
evidence. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  We got then the declassification from the DG 
of DIRCO insofar as that report is concerned. That is the one thing. The 
second thing, the recording was made available to me yesterday 
afternoon on Sunday and I did mention to the representatives of the, of 
Ambassador Koloane. That that recording is not made available to me 
but it is made available to the chairperson and I cannot simply just play 
it without the chairperson giving me authority to do that. And this is 
something that we discussed during the lunch, the long break. I have 
no difficulty with an adjournment but I am just concerned Mister 
10 
Chairman that we may come back tomorrow and then the witness 
testifies tomorrow and he goes back and says but still there is 
something that I did not get. I would prefer a situation where the 
witness because he has been brought here by the Commission the 
Commission’s expense. If the witness is of the view that he has not 
been afforded adequate opportunity for him to prepare thoroughly, I 
would prefer a situation where he is given the time that he wants. So 
that he does not come back later on and say look I was not afforded 
adequate opportunity. I am concerned, chair, that if you listen to the 
recordings tonight and then he comes back tomorrow morning and 
20 
certain questions are asked about the process as a whole again 
tomorrow morning, he may again say look if the cluster had asked me 
this I would have told them this. I am not comfortable with the approach 
that they are adopting because the Commission does not have time. We 
cannot keep on going back to matters simply because people are not 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 170 of 183 
 
comfortable. I think I would suggest, chair, that the best way they must 
indicate to the chair, how much time do they require to prepare fully 
and then once they have given that indication, chair, affords them that 
opportunity. So that when they come back he is ready to answer all the 
questions and probably he might even want to prepare a statement and 
deal with the JCPS cluster report in whole, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which documents? Alright let me put it this way. As at 
Wednesday last week. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he has counsel requested that he gives 
10 
evidence this week and not last week. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What documents have they been given already and 
what documents had they not be given? You see there are a number of 
documents that are relevant to his evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if for example one goes by when they had how 
much of the documents and whatever was left one knows exactly what 
was outstanding and when the part that was outstanding was given to 
him. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I am in a position to assess whether the days 
that he had, the time that he has had is adequate. But if I do not know 
when he got what then is difficult. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Chair, I can easily establish that because 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 171 of 183 
 
Mister Derek De Beer who is the one who sent the first batch of 
documents that was requested were given because on Wednesday I 
think they had a problem with the link. They were given the link and I 
think they got some documents and they did not get some, if my 
memory serves me well. On Thursday then there was another request 
made with a long list of documents that they requested. Some of those 
were not in our possession. For instance, they wanted the certain 
Annexures to the report and they wanted the audios that we are talking 
about which we do not have and I was advised by the secretary of the 
Commission that on Friday a link was also given in respect of those 
10 
documents. But then at the time when that was established, there was 
already a letter that had been received from Ambassador’s lawyers 
saying that you still have not given us documents and we took and we 
went to Mr, to Derek, Mister De Beer and was said to him, please check 
whether the documents that you sent have been downloaded. And he 
confirmed that yes they had been received and there was one download 
and the letter had to be caused to be written to say, we confirm that 
that has been sent and there has been a download already. But without 
giving evidence from the bar I could establish all of that information 
and I would give it to the Chair exactly what was given. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would have been when? Wednesday or 
Thursday? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  That was on Thursday. I beg your pardon, 
chair. I am confusing it because we did not sit on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 172 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  That was on Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Thursday? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, yes but I could establish, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So on your understanding, if there were documents 
that you think Mister De Beer sent on Thursday were sent. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much was outstanding by the end of the day or 
by Friday morning? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  My understanding is that he would have sent 
everything that he had in his possession because he extracted most of 
10 
the documents. I was, I remember that I was upset with him that he did 
not send them early on Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  But because he had to extract those matters 
that are relevant and to Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Then that took a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, but my understanding I have not received 
anything like as of today to say you have not given us this particular 
20 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Or something like that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. Of course we are not in a situation 
where Ambassador Koloane for his legal team came this morning and 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 173 of 183 
 
said we are not ready. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need more time. That is not the situation but we 
want to make sure, I want to make sure as far as possible that there is 
fairness to everybody. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that there are certain matters that we can 
still cover this afternoon and maybe others tomorrow; that is one option 
but it may well be that maybe if certain issues are quite central to 
everything that maybe we should adjourn until tomorrow in the hope 
10 
that this would add to the time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if Mister Koloane’s counsel come tomorrow and 
make an application for and they say they cannot continue; Mr Koloane 
cannot continue then we take it from there. They would have to make 
an application for a postponement if that is the case. My understanding 
is that they would like to avoid that. They would like that this time be 
used as much as possible. But I think you make the point that they 
might have to be put to any election so that we do not have a situation 
where we spend this time and go on and then later on they say there 
20 
was fairness because they were not given time. Whereas if they say 
look is not going to be fair, we need more time. We might decide to, say 
okay if they have make out a good case we will adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think what you have in mind is, if we 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 174 of 183 
 
proceed not knowing where they stand it might defeat the whole 
purpose. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you, chair. Chair might I also mention, 
chair that because we anticipated that we would play the audio at this 
hearing, we had invited Major Ntshisi to be present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  So that we do not have to replay it when he is 
recalled by the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Maybe with your leave, chair, would it be 
10 
possible to allow the play of that. The one recording is five minutes. 
That is the recording between Ambassador Koloane and Major Ntshisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  And then the other one is 22 minutes which is 
various recordings of the conversations between Major Ntshisi and 
other officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I am reluctant to allow the playing of the 
recording before they can hear it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  As Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let me hear what counsel for Mister Koloane has 
20 
to say and then we try and finalize this. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you, chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Thank you, chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 175 of 183 
 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Again in regard to the production of documents, we 
do not point fingers at anyone to the extent that they were not given. 
We do not suggest that was not purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  And you know the Commission does what it can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  We understood that we would receive documents 
late in the day on Wednesday. That we understood it was undertaken 
which was given. We understand and we accept at face value what my 
learned friend says that that attempt was made and that a link was sent 
10 
on the Wednesday but it was not received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  On the Thursday, a link was sent and that is 
attached approximately, will not approximately 519 pages’ worth of 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  And then on Friday afternoon, a further link was 
sent, sorry then I think. Yes, on the Friday for the link was sent and 
that although there was some duplication between the first bundle and 
the second bundle now contains 776 pages of documents. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  What the Ambassador had been given prior to 
appearing to give evidence on Wednesday was nothing more than only 
the Rule 3.3 notice which attached to it an Annexure A and an Annexure 
B which is comprised of Ms Sidane’s statement as Annexure A and 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 176 of 183 
 
JCPS cluster report without any Annexures as Annexure B. That is all 
that he had before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  So you will appreciate Chair, that it is a voluminous 
extent of documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  We do voice our concerns about the prospect of 
having the recordings played before we have had an opportunity to 
listen to them which adds to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  What you, as I understand it Chair now have is a 
suggestion by my learned friend that rather than putting us to pressure 
and trying to do it all this week that perhaps we arrange a mutually 
convenient dates in the fullness of time. And the Ambassador will then 
go back to the Netherlands and by way of an arrangement we will then 
come back in a few weeks or months or whatever it is. I have not had 
an opportunity to take instructions on that. It seems somewhat sensible 
to me as I am standing on my feet but honestly all of this is subject to 
what you may roll of course, Mr Chair. So in regard to if there is a 
suggestion that he must either be put to any election and be held by it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  And if there is a suggestion that as an alternative 
to that we, my learned friend and I talked about mutually convenient 
dates in the fullness of time, I will need an opportunity to take 
instructions on either of those. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 177 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  But perhaps I could inquire as a matter of principle, 
chair, whether you would be receptive to either of those approaches 
perhaps arranging dates in due course or whether you would insist on 
the matter preceding this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I would like us to make use of the time that has 
been set aside unless there is. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Prejudice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless there is going to be unfairness to him and if 
there is going to be unfairness it would not be on the basis that the 
10 
next time he comes would necessarily depend on agreed dates. We 
want to try and we talk to people who are concerned as far as possible 
but we want to retain the right to fix the dates because otherwise if you 
are going to wait until everybody has agreed you will not get anywhere. 
So subject to that I would like only to consider an adjournment that 
goes beyond to do tomorrow or this week only if I am made to 
understand that otherwise there would be unfairness and the unfairness 
I think would; it will be a question of whether bearing in mind what he 
would be asked questions about. Whether he has been given adequate 
time of looking at the documents and so on. So in other words there 
20 
would have to be, I would have to be convinced. At this stage, I remain 
open to be persuaded. I am inclined to think that it ought to be possible 
for us to continue and finalize without any unfairness to anybody 
particularly if we are going to adjourn to allow more time until 
tomorrow. But if your side takes the view that definitely is going to be 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 178 of 183 
 
unfairness and it would rather apply for an adjournment, a long 
adjournment then I would consider that at that time and look at the 
grounds. That is why I have asked now, how much of the documentation 
was given when and so on because although there is a lot of 
documentation here, my understanding is that that a lot of it might not 
really relate to his role. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know. Although, his role it seems to be quite 
important, it seems to be narrow. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To me. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore it ought to be possible to have certain 
documents that relate to his role that are important and to apply one’s 
mind to them and finalize. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  Yes, of course we would have to consider all the 
documents to determine whether they are relevant or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I accept that, I accept that, ja. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  The other complication, chair, and again I raise it 
just thinking out loud is of course in order for us to form a view on 
20 
whether the Ambassador would be prejudiced in continuing or not, this 
question of the recordings is a spanner in the works. We would 
obviously want to listen to them first before we make that election. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  So perhaps, my suggestion would be if we could 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 179 of 183 
 
obtain a ruling from you that we are entitled to those recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  And if we could have them immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
LEGAL COUNSEL:  We could consider them overnight and then 
tomorrow we could come back and inform you, chair, what our position 
is whether we are inclined to continue or whether we would seek a 
postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me. Thank you.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you, chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now with regard to what you received over the 
weekend in regard to the recording of the conversation between as I 
understand the position, Ambassador Koloane and Major Ntshisi. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ambassador Koloane and Colonel Anderson, that 
is available to him. There is no problem with that. Is not it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  No, no chair. It is available. I was waiting for 
Chair to give directions. I had indicated to my learned friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  That the chair had not seen and had not heard 
20 
any of these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but is not classified or anything? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  It has been declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Declassified? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Declassified now, yes chair. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 180 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That can be given to him then. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then what is the other confidential document or 
something? There is nothing else? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  I am not made aware of any other document 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought there was something else that arrived today 
or something this morning. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh yes, the FF12. That is his letter of 
appointment as an Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  There is nothing contentious. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  And the, I beg your pardon, chair. There is 
also the DIRCO report which is in Ambassador Matjila’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The disciplinary hearing report or what? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  No, no chair. That is in FA12. That is just the 
one-page report that Ambassador Matjila identified as a report which he 
20 
forwarded to Nico. That was the other document was declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is available to him? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, it has been declassified, yes chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  We can make it available to him. 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 181 of 183 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is nothing that as far as you know should not 
be made available? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you, that we have. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  No, chair. Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay those can be given to him or his lawyers 
immediately. So it, but it seems to me that we should adjourn until 
tomorrow morning so that they can then have, they can listen to the 
recording and number one. Number two, use the time to for particular 
the witness but his lawyers may need to as well. If there are any 
10 
documents that they have not had a chance to apply their mind to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my understanding of his role suggests that even 
with documents it should not be many documents that need to be 
referred to that are in the bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, yes chair. But we decided to give them 
all the bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  As far as understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  But. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it your understanding too that those that really 
relate to him is very limited number? 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 182 of 183 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Very limited, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very limited number. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  That would be FF4, FF3, those matters that 
really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes and FF1, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. I am happy to adjourn. We can adjourn to 
tomorrow at 10 and everybody understands why we are adjourning. And 
10 
then when we resume tomorrow at 10, we can then hear if the witness’s 
counsel has, can indicate to us what the position is but as I speak my 
inclination is that as far as possible, it ought to be possible for us to 
continue without there being any unfairness to the Ambassador. But I 
will be told if there is any feeling that there will be unfairness. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you, chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. Ambassador, you have been listening to 
everything, you understand where everything is going. 
20 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes, I do chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do? Ja, I am going to adjourn the proceedings 
now and we will resume tomorrow at 10 o’clock. The adjournment will 
serve the purpose of allowing you and your legal team to listen to the 
recording but also to have more time to apply your mind to whatever 
08 JULY 2019 – DAY 128 
 
Page 183 of 183 
 
other documents, whatever documents you might not have had a 
chance to apply your mind to. And tomorrow we will be looking at 
proceeding but you and your legal team are free to make any 
application 
that 
you 
might 
consider 
making 
about 
a 
possible 
adjournment and then I would make a ruling on it. You understand? 
AMBASSADOR VUSI BRUCE KOLOANE:  Yes, I do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. We are going to adjourn then until 
tomorrow at 10 o’clock. We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 9 JULY 2019
