PROCEEDINGS ON 10 MAY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Good morning.  Are you ready?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Volmink yesterday when we parted 
ways we were just about to deal with the T-Systems with particular 
reference to page 48 paragraph 105 of your witness statement.  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Could you please proceed dealing with 
those issues there? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair this section of my evidence 
deals with an award of the IT Data Services tender initially to T-
Systems which was then subsequently withdrawn and awarded now to 
Gijima.  I will take you through what I say in paragraphs 105 and 
following Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is page 48 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  48? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair so I point out in my statement 
that during January of 2010 Transnet entered into the initial agreement 
with T-Systems for the provision of IT data services.  It is a critical 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 3 of 82 
 
service for Transnet’s operations.  Effectively it enables access to all 
critical IT data pertaining to the rail operations, ports, pipelines, 
personnel, a range of functions that Transnet requires in orde r to 
operate effectively and efficiently.  I then say that after that initial 
tender was – the contract was entered into a series of variations or 
extensions in value to that contract then occurred.  And I explain those 
variations in one of the annexures w hich I would like to take you to.  It 
is not directly germane to the issue of the award to Gijima which 
subsequently followed but I thought just for context I would like to give 
the commission a full sense of the history of the matter.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And how many variations are you talking 
– are you referring to? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  There were in total five variations.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And those were between 2010 and 2019?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And for that period no services went out 
on tender? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Sorry? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  During that period no services went out 
on tender.  It was all extended on variations?  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It was extended on variations but 
parallel to that… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The new tender process was being 
evaluated and awarded and so on. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 4 of 82 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Then may I refer you then to…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry extended on varia tions means what?  
Extended on variations, what does that mean?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No it is um – I use the term 
somewhat interchangeably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  To extend the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that it was extended. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Or varied in the sense that  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. Okay. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And the value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But basically you mean it was extended?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Volmink may I then refer you to 
Exhibit BB2.1C.  Chair that should be the third file with particular 
reference to page 1086. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the reference to third file reference to Exhibit 
BB2.1.C? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  1C yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So that at least it becomes easier.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair to locate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the page?  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 5 of 82 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The page number it is page 1086. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1086? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Volmink are you there?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I am there Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes could you please identify that 
document for us? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair this document is a document 
which was initially prepared by our Group strategic sourcing function 
10 
one of the units within the procurement department.  It was a report 
which was delivered to SCOPA the initial intended date of the 
presentation was for December 2017.  That engagement finally 
happened in January of 2018 and the document has just been updated 
to reflect events that have occurred  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Subsequent to January 2018. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And can you then take us please through 
those several variations and extensions that you alluded to?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair what the document then 
20 
reflects is that the initial award to T-Systems was a five year contract 
with an option to extend for a further two years.  So the option was 
incorporated into the initial contract which was to run from 1 January 
2010 to 31 December 2014 with a total initial contract value of about 
R1.9 billion. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 6 of 82 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That was the initial amount? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And subsequently?  You can take us 
through the variations then?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The variations then were as follows 
Chair.  Firstly the first variation related to the exe rcising of that two 
year option. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just take you back to this issue of variation 
and extension.  Technically variation might be correct when you mean 
extending but normally or rather I associate variation with an 
10 
amendment of  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The contents of the agreement.  Okay.  So I just want 
to confirm that wherever in this document there is a reference to 
variation should I read it as extension or sometimes variation is used to 
mean something other than extension? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  No Chair it would be the former 
meaning that…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Wherever we refer to variation  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It is an extension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An extension. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In both time and value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh oh 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 7 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So it is not just the time extension.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh oh okay so…  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  With the time extension would be a 
value [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so so variation might be more accurate in that 
context.  That is not just an extension of time?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is also a variation of the price?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Effectively an amendment of the price that must of 
10 
necessity come with the extension of time?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. Alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Would that also include the variation of 
the scope of what was inten ded to be performed? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Sometimes that may well be.  It 
would be extended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.   
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I was then referring to the first 
variation Chair which involved really the exercise of that two year 
option that I had referred to earlier which then extended the contract 
from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.  There were various 
reasons given for the exercising of this – of the option.  Some of the m I 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 8 of 82 
 
will mention briefly.  In essence Chair it was said that the Transnet had 
contracted Gartner to review all the current services that were being 
received from T-Systems to develop a new strategy.  To issue a new set 
of specifications.  The RFP had to be  written and the motivation that 
was given was that we – that two year extension was required in order 
to complete that part of the work.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the second extension?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The second extension was for a 
further period of nine months from 1 January 2017 to 30 September 
2017 I refer that is on page 1087 just the following page.  And what it 
10 
says Chair is that the nine month extension was requested to enable 
Transnet to finalise the new IT data services procurement e vent which 
was now ready at the adjudication stage.  So it had progressed but it 
had not yet been completed and a further extension of both time and 
value was then requested. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the initial amount value which was 
R1.9 billion it now became R3.8 billion, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct Chair.  With all the 
extensions there was a significant value extension as well which now 
stood at R3.8 billion. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the third? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The third extension…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is R3.8 billion hey?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 9 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair the third extension …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 1088 Chair. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is on page 1088. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And – and what it related to was an 
initial request actually for twelve months for – to enable Transnet to 
essentially extricate itself from the unlawful award that had been made 
to T-Systems and to award the tender to Gijima as was initially 
submitted by management.  But there was a process of litigation that 
had unfolded and the concern was that the litigation process would not 
10 
run its course within a twelve month period.  Eventual ly National 
Treasury approved the extension but not for twelve months.  They only 
granted an eight month extension during which time I think there was 
considerable attempt as I say for Transnet to extricate itself from this 
initial tender award which I wil l deal with in more detail in a short while 
I am just giving an overview of the various reasons for the extension.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the fourth one?  Page 1089 that is 
where you find the fourth one. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair.  The fourth one the 
motivation that is stated in the document is that Transnet had 
20 
requested this extension for the commencement of what I refer to as 
disengagement processes from T-Systems.  It is not the kind of contract 
where – when the contract ends the service provider moves off and the 
new service provider comes in immediately.  There is a process of 
disengagement.  In fact if recollection – if my recollection is correct the 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 10 of 82 
 
contract made provision for a six month process of transition and 
disengagement and treasury only approved a three month extension 
which was then the fourth variation.  And then the fifth variation …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 1090. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Is on 1090.  This was for the period 9 
September 2018 to 8 March 2019 a nd there has been no further 
extensions after that date.  So that was the last extension.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the entire amount pursuant to those 
extensions or variations was an amount of R4.9 billion.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this contract started in 2010?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is still ongoing or has just ended?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  As currently it is no longer ongoing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The last extension was – it expired 
on 8 March 2019.  
CHAIRPERSON:  This year? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is when this contract ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it – it went on for ultimately about what nine 
20 
years? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Originally it was meant to be five years.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there was a provision for a possible extension?  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 11 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is the point Chair.  May I then refer 
you back to your witness statement paragraph 106 on page 48 and we 
can continue with the evidence from there having now painted the 
context to the Chair. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  From 106 the point we simply make 
is that Governance was involved in the reviewing certain of these 
addenda and was also then quite involved in advising the board to 
reverse its decision to award to T-Systems and to award to Gijima. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You may then proceed to deal with 
the events relevant to Gijima. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes so now if I can focus more 
directly on the award to T-Systems Chair.  In paragraph 107 and 
following I state that during November 2015 Transnet issued this RFP 
to the open market for the supply of IT data se rvices and T-Systems 
responded and Gijima responded and a few others responded.  After 
quite a drawn out protracted tender process a recommendation was 
made by management to award the tender to Gijima.  Having said that I 
should also point out to you Chair  that my understanding is 
20 
management did have some misgivings during the evaluation process 
about Gijima.  There were various commercial and also technical 
concerns that management had raised and they were not at first in 
favour of the award to Gijima.  Bu t after extensive engagements with 
Gijima management came to the conclusion ultimately that those risks 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 12 of 82 
 
had been adequately mitigated.  Based on the view that the risks had 
been mitigated they made the recommendation to award to Gijima.  
What I then go on to say is that during February 2017 the board took a 
decision not to award to Gijima based on those risks that management 
had earlier dealt with and to award it to T-Systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is one of those contracts which were dealt 
with during the period when the board was getting involved in the award 
of certain tenders? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair.  They had 
delegation of authority. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In terms of the delegation of 
authority framework . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  To make those decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And would this be an instance whereby 
the risk factors are only raised at a later stage when they were in fact 
dealt with by the management adequately but they are raised in order 
to not grant the award to the [indistinct] bidder?  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is precisely the difficulty that 
Governance had with this entire transaction.  The risks had been 
highlighted at an earlier s tage and as I testified in the view of the 
technical and other experts who assessed the matter they were 
satisfied that the risks had been properly dealt with.  What then 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 13 of 82 
 
happened is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us talk about that a little bit before you.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Move on and – and it takes us to something that we 
discussed a little bit yesterday namely that if management has a right 
to take a view on a tender on various factors and – but their role is to 
make a recommendation and the body that makes the final decision is 
higher up generally speaking the higher body would be entitled to take 
a view different to that of management on any of the factors, is it not?  
Generally speaking. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Generally speaking? 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes, yes.  Therefore when a higher body takes a view 
different to that of management on any particular issue or factor that on 
its own ought not to raise eyebrows but it just depends on everything 
else. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On all the circumstances of that particular tender 
whether it should raise eyebrows.  But one of the factors that may 
legitimately be taken into account in saying should this raise eyebrows 
or not is the expertise that management may have on a par ticular issue 
20 
knowledge expertise and experience vie a vie knowledge expertise and 
experience maybe of the body that decides.  If it is a – if the subject is 
about some scientific technical thing and management consists of a 
committee of scientists and I a m sitting on a higher body and I am a 
lawyer I am going to be very careful to go against the view of scientists 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 14 of 82 
 
in a field where they are the experts.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does not necessarily mean that I am going to 
rubber stamp their view. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may still question and sometimes I might show them 
that maybe they did not attach proper weight to a particular factor or 
they might even change their view but what I should not do is basica lly 
disregard what they are – the view they have expressed. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  Precisely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just going back to it – to this point which we 
discuss yesterday simply because you – you just mentioned that you 
had a certain difficulty with the fact that the board looked at an issue 
that you had looked at as management.  And my question goes back is.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course they are entitled to look at…  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same issue that you have looked at and they are 
entitled to take a different view. The question is whether their view 
weighed against your view is such that it should point to something.  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would go along with that? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair I am – I am in large measure in 
fact I am in – I am in total agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 15 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  With the – with what you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK : Because I – my evidence should not 
be understood to mean that I am of the view that the board is bound by 
recommendations of management.  It is a board for – it is called the 
accounting authority for a good reason.  That is the body that must 
ultimately make its decisions.  My difficulty does not lie with the 
principle of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Arriving at a different conclusion.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But Chair my concerns firstly is that 
when these risks were properly evaluated at an earlier stage at the 
functionality and the commercial gate and the bidder passed that 
threshold for functionality then in fact we – our own procurement rules 
in Transnet warns against this concept of double dipping where 
someone was properly and fully assessed at any earlier stage and then 
under the guise of a risk evaluation those very issues are now 
revisited.  And – so I think that is the first concern and the second is 
just the rationality of it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Because if management and I am not 
saying management is always right I mean.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But in this particular case there was 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 16 of 82 
 
quite a comprehensive motivation  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Put forward 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja which dealt with these issues.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  To the board which dealt with all of 
the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And one does see a detailed logical  
CHAIRPERSON:  Response 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Analysis on the part of the board.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I… 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  As to why it held a different view.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think that last part which you say is an important 
factor because if the one view is fully m otivated and the opposing view 
is not motived at all or very – or motivated very insignificantly you 
know it is something to look at.  Yes but I think I understand your 
position.  You say it is not the principle.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you have a problem with it is the facts of the 
case. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the fact that at Transnet there was as I 
understand you a rule or policy against what you double dipping.  Okay 
thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Following from the Chair questions of 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 17 of 82 
 
clarification.  You are also giving this evidence against the background 
of a number of transactions that suffered the same fate premised on 
this risk factors whereby a preferred bidder who was being thoroughly  
assessed just simply being ignored and another entity being awarded 
the tender, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that is why – that is why you are 
raising these issues specifically?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair.  This is hardly 
an isolated 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Incident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  We have seen other cases in the past 
where 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Risks are invoked at the eleventh 
hour 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As a reason to overlook bidder A in 
20 
order to go to bidder B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The – the PPM does say that risk can 
be taken into consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 18 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It says it must be a material risk 
such that it can cause severe prejudice to Transnet if it were not 
properly taken into account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR 
PETER 
STEPHEN 
VOLMINK: 
 
And 
must 
not 
involve 
a 
reconsideration of the very factors that were earlier evaluated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So the principle I have no difficulty 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But it is the opportunistic use of risk.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In order to 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Not award to a bidder X 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And to award to what appears to be 
the deferred bidder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Let us proceed to deal with specific facts 
20 
in order to at least you know place them in it proper context.  You may 
then proceed to tell us what happened?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes thank you Chair. So what they 
happened is that Gijima lodged a complaint to the Transnet 
Procurement … 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 19 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just to complete.  Management recommended 
that Gijima be awarded the contract after the consents or reservations 
that management had had – had been mitigated through engagement 
with Gijima. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
the 
board 
did 
not 
go 
along 
with 
the 
recommendation of management and decided that the contract should 
be awarded to T-Systems and largely and if not exclusively their 
reasons were based on certain risks that they articulated, is that rig ht? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Gijima lodged a complaint?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  A complaint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The complaint was then received by 
the Procurement Officer of the Procurement Ombudsman it is one of the 
functions which I have to oversee within the organisation.  But because 
it implicated the accounting authority there is a national treasury 
prescription that when a complaint implicates the account ing authority 
it must not be investigated by the organ of state itself it must be 
referred to National Treasury.  And that process was followed.  National 
20 
Treasury considered the complaint and ultimately came to the 
conclusion that the proposed award to – or the award in fact that had 
been made to T-Systems was invalid and that Gijima should be awarded 
the tender. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And did Governance also agree with 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 20 of 82 
 
what National Treasury was saying?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Governance agreed with the 
conclusion that the tender was invalid  – um sorry that the tender award 
to T-Systems was invalid and that the tender had to be awarded to 
Gijima.  So we shared that conclusion.  We held slightly different views 
on how risks ought to be eval – technical dif – differences that we had 
which perhaps we do not really need to delve into.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But what was then the advice or the 
recommendation of Governance?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well when Governance considered 
10 
the matter produced quite a comprehensive memorandum on the matter 
as well spelling out the various risks and how it had been mitigated and 
we then made the following recommendations which are contained in 
paragraph 110 …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA 
SC:  Page 49 Chair.  Yes you can 
(intervenes). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And we recommended that Transnet 
abide – the first recommendation is Transnet must abide by the ruling 
taken by National Treasury.  Secondly that T-Systems should be invited 
to make representations on how – on Transnet’s proposed decision to 
20 
abide the – the ruling of National Treasury.  We felt it would be 
important to invite – represent - T-Systems had now already been 
awarded the tender and our proposal was well let us withdraw it and we 
thought that a procedurally fair process would be to at least invite 
representations.  The third aspect of our recommendation was that 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 21 of 82 
 
Transnet who should proceed to make the award then to Gijima 
following a judicial process to set aside the award to T-Systems.  We 
were conscious of the rule against self-help and so and we thought it 
would be better to follow a judicial process rather than simply 
withdrawing from one and awarding to another.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And what ultimately happened to that 
tender? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I should perhaps just say that 
he views that we had expressed were also confirmed by senior counsel.  
We had sought the opinions of Advocate  Sibeko and Advocate Ford and 
10 
they were in large measure in agreement with the views that were – 
were expressed.  Chair ultimately what then happened is after much 
deliberation the Board then took a resolution to set aside its earlier 
award to T-Systems and Transnet then approached the High Court for 
an order declaring its earlier award to T-Systems to be invalid a nd a 
direction that it be allowed to award to Gijima.  The matter was initially 
strongly opposed by T-Systems but after some preliminary skirmishes 
they withdrew their opposition and the matter was then set down for 
hearing in the Johannesburg High Court o n 12 December 2018 and the 
court essentially granted the order as prayed for by – by Transnet and I 
20 
have attached a copy of the judgment in the papers (intervenes).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So it was only after all those 
interventions that the Board then d ecided to do the correct thing?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now from page - 113 paragraph 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 22 of 82 
 
113 page 50 you are now dealing with the acquisition of the 100 
locomotives? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can you please take us through it?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I – I was asked by the 
investigators to look at this confinement of the – of - for the acquisition 
of 100 locomotives that was initially confined to a company called 
Mitsui Africa Rail Solutions or MARS for – for short - and a second 
confinement where the initial proposed award to MARS was now 
completely ignored and a second confinement was then motivated for 
10 
the award of the very same tender to China South Rail or CSR and I 
was asked to reflect on – just on the rational as contained in the 
confinement documents itself. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and then what transpired when you 
have – after having reviewed and assessed you know the two 
confinements? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  So Chair in essence I say in 
paragraph 113 and following that the initial motivation was made in 
October 2013.  I said in my initial statement that it was submitted by 
Mr Brian Molefe but upon further consideration of the documents I see 
20 
he did not sign that confinement.  Hence in my amended statement I 
simply make the point that a submission was made rather than but 
apart from that minor change the point that I make is that this 
confinement described in glowing terms the virtues of Mitsui – MARS.  
Why we should award to Mitsui Africa Rail Solutions and for example 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 23 of 82 
 
Chair I point that in paragraph 114 there are a number of sub 
paragraphs.  It says there that these MARS locomotives they were I 
think for the Class 19E - it is a particular class of l ocomotives.  These 
MARS locomotives are known they meet requirements and the 
prototyping is not required.  They have done this before.  It goes on to 
say that the confinement to MARS was required for purposes of 
standardisation because MARS had done a numb er of these tenders 
and a number of the locomotives before.  That there were MARS 
facilities that were readily available for immediate production.  Lead 
times would be kept to a minimum and also there would be significant 
10 
savings.  Across the page on page 51 the virtues of MARS are further 
extolled by the individuals who submitted the memo and it says there 
that the Mitsui models were operating optimally and in fact exceeded 
their design parameters that we do not need to train new – to train our 
drivers on any new model because they have been trained on the Mitsui 
model.  So they also speak about extensive socio economic benefits 
that would be as a result of the award to Mitsui including job retention 
at Transnet Engineering and job creation and ultimately t hey said it was 
not in the interest of Transnet to follow – to award to anyone else.  So 
in essence what we see …  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is a motivation to – to confine to 
MARS based on what were depicted as outstanding qu alities that – that 
MARS had. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that was the justification why not – 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 24 of 82 
 
Transnet was not supposed to go out of – out to tender on a – on an 
open fair competitive bidding system?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That – that was the basis for – for 
the confinement.  That is correct.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  However three months down the 
line there was … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But then correct … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
Correct 
Chair. 
 
This 
MARS 
confinement served at – at a Board – at a meeting of the BADC which is 
10 
a Sub Committee of the Board which is entrusted specifically with 
procurement matters and I was not at that meeting.  I have no personal 
knowledge as to what transpired who said what at that  meeting.  All we 
know from the record is that three months after this initial MARS 
confinement had been made there was now a second confinement.  This 
time to award the tender to China South Rail and no longer to – to 
Mitsui and I have also attached a copy of that confinement to the 
papers. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  If I may refer you to EXHIBIT BB 
2.1D.  You can now ignore C.  We are now going to D.  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  D, sorry.  Let me just put C away.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the meantime I can ask whether the – this second 
submission for confinement meant that there were going to be two 
submissions before the BADC for confinement – one to Mitsui and the 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 25 of 82 
 
other one to China Rail or whether the first one was effectively 
withdraw? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think it is the later Chair.  I think 
the first one was effectively withdrawn because if one looks at the 
contents of the China South Rail confinement the – there it is said that 
Mitsui’s quality and all the various aspects that were firstly p raised in 
the first … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They say no Mitsui is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Not up to scratch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A dilution of … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The praises that had been heaped on Mitsui.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to page 1196. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  1196 or 1197? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  1197.  This will be …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I thought that was D.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  D for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  D for Doris. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  For Doris. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 26 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  D for David.  D for Doris, okay.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 1197 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So that is 11 …? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  97. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Could you identify that document for us 
Mr Volmink? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair this is a submission made by 
Mr Brian Molefe the then Group Chief Executive of Transnet to the 
Transnet Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee – the BADC – 
10 
and the subject simply says: 
“Mitigation of MDS volumes …”  
MDS just stands for Market Demand Strategy.  
“MDS volumes at risk throug h investment in and 
procurement of 100 Class 19E equivalent dual 
voltage electric locomotives and 60 Class 43 diesel 
locomotives.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And he is the one who was motivating 
the award in favour of Mitsui?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That – that is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now if you – while you are still 
opening that memorandum may I also refer you to page 1223 and could 
you please identify that document for us?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  This is a – a submission from 
Mr Brian Molefe 
to 
the 
Transnet 
Board 
of 
Directors 
dated 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 27 of 82 
 
21 January 2014 which has the same heading as the earlier – earlier 
confinement that I quoted.  It also says:  
“Mitigation 
of 
MDS 
volumes 
at 
risk 
through 
investment in and procurement of the 100 dual 
voltage electric locomotives.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But this one a different entity was – was 
motivated for? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct.  This is now the CSR. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now did you have an opportunity of 
reading both these memora ndums?  Are they different in any manner?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the documents – the two 
memoranda are essentially - the substance of it is almost identical.  
Where it differs is where the virtues of CSR are now extolled in the 
second memorandum whereas the qualities of MARS …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Are highlighted in the first …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The first document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  May I now refer you back to your 
20 
statement – EXHIBIT BB 2.1A …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And page 51 and take us through 
paragraph 116 and onwards?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair in paragraph 116 and following 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 28 of 82 
 
I simply highlight my – how I deal with my observations of these 
confinements as I was requested to do by the - by the Commission – 
the Commission’s investigators and what I say in paragraph 116.1 is 
that the confinement to China South Rail firstly invokes urgency as a 
ground for confinement and as we disc ussed yesterday urgency is 
something that has to be dealt with immediately because of a potential 
crisis that is looming and I make the point that three months had 
already elapsed since this earlier confinement to Mitsui which was also 
based on urgency – by the way – and no steps had been taken to 
procure any locomotives during that time and I question whether this 
10 
matter could genuinely be urgent if no action had been taken but I think 
more significantly the second point that I make is that this 
memorandum it misquotes the PPM and perhaps Chair if you would 
allow me.  It is a very short clause from the PPM that I just want to 
read into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you may do – do that. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In paragraph 116.2 I say that the 
memorandum quotes the PPM as stating the following:  
“Where a genuine unforeseeable urgency has arisen 
such urgency should not be attributable to a lack of 
20 
proper planning.” 
And then the underlined words are added.  
“However where a genuine urgency has been 
created by the lack of proper planning urgency can 
still be relied upon as a ground for confinement.  In 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 29 of 82 
 
such cases appropriate action must be taken 
against the individual or individuals responsible for 
the bad planning.” 
Now I say it misquotes the PPM because those  underlined words were 
contained in a draft which we had submitted to the Board and it relates 
to a point Chair which you made yesterday which is to the effect that if 
a genuine urgency has come about but it is as a result – even if it is a 
result of poor planning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There is still an urgency …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To be dealt with …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And it can be relied upon …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As a confinement …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Bu you must deal with the individual 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who has created the crisis …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But when this was tak en to the Board 
at the time they felt strongly that bad planning could never be an 
excuse for confinement and they deleted the reference that has been 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 30 of 82 
 
underlined here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So I think the point is that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The rule which they had now relied 
upon … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is not the – it is a non-existent rule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think furthermore Chair …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I make the point in paragraph 116.4 
… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 52 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am just still thinking about this point about 
poor planning and urgency.  You know – for what it is worth.  I think you 
– you understood the point… 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we had the discussion yesterday.  I mean if – if 
the Commission’s administrative wing was supposed to bring something 
20 
to my attention to say I must please convene a certain urgent meetin g 
to deal with a certain situation because if I do no convene that meeting 
and a certain decision is made we are going to – we will not be able to 
sit in this venue from next week and the commission will have nowhere 
to sit and I think that the administrative wing should have told me a 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 31 of 82 
 
month ago.  I cannot say I am not going to convene a meeting because 
you people had poor planning.  You should have told me last month.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to say you should have told me la st month 
but now that this has happened I must convene the meeting …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  We have to deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we cannot afford not to sit next month - next 
week because we will not have …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will have no venue. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I deal with the poor planning but I recognise that 
there is urgency because - for example – the lease is expiring over the 
weekend. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the meetings that are set – the hearings that are 
set down for next week and the other week will not take place if I do 
not meet with the landlord and say the administration has really been 
poor in planning.  They should have brought this to my atte ntion but 
now they have brought – they should have brought it to my attention 
20 
much earlier but they have now brought it.  Can we do something?  I 
cannot say I am not going to meet with the landlord because they 
should have told me last month. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  I am very fully appreciative of 
what you are saying Chair. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 32 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That also motivated …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The – the inclusion …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of that clause the sentence …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That was underlined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Management felt that if you are 
10 
dealing with a genuine emergency …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Then we cannot close our eyes to the 
fact that  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There could be an operational …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Implosion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As a result of not …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Obtaining a particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Let us deal with that perhaps on a 
confinement basis. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 33 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Sometimes with a heavy heart one 
has to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is right, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Agree to these things …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And – and discipline the person …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But let us acquire the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The product. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If I recall correctly …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The Board’s concern at the time was 
these self-created urgencies and how easily it gets invoked as a reas on 
not to follow a procurement process.  There was a view that the system 
had been subject to abuse – considerable abuse …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Maybe the pendulum swung …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Quite far … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of that ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Onto the one side … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 34 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But I think that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That motivated the exclusion of the 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You may proceed from paragraph 116.4.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In paragraph 116.4 I make the point 
that certain grounds for the confinement that are set out now in the 
CSR memo were identical to the Mitsui memo.  It is as if the grounds 
for confine – there was like a cut, copy, paste exercise done from the 
10 
grounds of confinement for MARS and put into the CSR.  Now they also 
say that: 
“These diesel locomotives from CSR they are known 
and they meet technic al requirements and set up 
costs are not required and facilities are readily 
available for CSR.” 
The very – the very things that were said about Mitsui and I make the 
observation Chair in – sort of in the middle of that paragraph I say 
assuming that these facts regarding CSR were true that they had all of 
those qualities why was the confinement then not made to CSR in the 
20 
first instance and why did it take three months to realise that CSR 
actually had the same attributes as Mitsui in relation to set up cost s 
and prototyping and at very least that suggests bad planning and when 
there is bad planning as we have said that effectively negates a ground 
for confinement and that is the – the observation that is made there.  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 35 of 82 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But let us – let us deal with the effects 
of these numerous confinements.  What they meant was that a party 
that was never subjected to any tender process a name will be 
mentioned and an award will be given to that entity?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is slightly – it is slightly more 
complex than that.  So an entity would be recommended as for the 
confinement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It has to be approved by the person 
with delegated authority …  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Exactly. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But it is still a tender process.  So an 
RFP would then be issued to that one or sometimes one or two or three 
however many entities are listed in the confinement.  Submissions must 
be received.  It must be evaluated.  It must serve before  the Acquisition 
Council.  I think the fundamental difference is that it is not an open 
invitation to - to any – any bidder to (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In this regard there were only two 
memos.  The first one motivated Mitsui?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Only Mitsui. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the next one motivated only …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Only CSR. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  That is the point that – yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You may proceed then. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 36 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I also point out Chair that the CSR 
memo now refuted the very qualities that had earlier been stated about 
MARS.  It now says that: 
“MARS had not done well during the 1064 loco 
process and there was another 95 loco tran saction.” 
I also say that: 
“This SD of MARS was not …  
Supply Development. 
“…was not a key factor when MARS was awarded 
the contract.” 
10 
And then it also says that: 
“If we continue with MARS that would create 
unnecessary risk for Transnet.”  
It says that: 
“CSR on the other hand had excelled in all of these 
SD requirements.” 
And Chair in essence I come to the conclusion having dealt with all of 
this that the about turn in such a limited period of time I think it – it 
defies rationality.  It defies logic at least from my observation.  I should 
also point out and I deal with this in paragraph 117 that it was – in 
20 
addition it was stated that regarding these reputational risks that 
Transnet would suffer it was then said that it was not elaborated on but 
except to say that there was speculation in the media around Mitsui’s 
local partners and their political affiliations and it said that Transnet 
would never entertain awards based on the political prowess of any 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 37 of 82 
 
business partners to an OEM but the risk does not need to be taken 
into account for – from a reputational perspective.  Essentially they 
were saying look we hear some worrying stories but the point is why 
were those worrying stories not a factor when MARS was motivated for 
confinement three months earlier when th ese stories had come about – 
I think – way before that.  So I think all of this – Chair the most 
generous interpretation that I can give is that it is as a result of just 
bad planning and I say that is the most generous.  Whether there are 
other nefarious motives that influence this others will come and testify.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Just clearing those bases, fine.  
10 
Then we can proceed Mr  Volmink to deal with the McKinsey 
confinements. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As far as the McKinsey confinements  
are concerned Chair … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair they are from page 54 paragraph 
118. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I – I say in paragraph 118 that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Volmink. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  When the BADC – that Board Committee – dealt with 
matters such as this – you know – this request for confinement would 
they have the benefit of somebody at that stage - I know the 
recommendation that you expressed going forward.  Would they call for 
somebody with some more knowledge of procurement from within 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 38 of 82 
 
Transnet and say you know there is this request give us some advice.  
What is your view?  You know - is this in compliance is this not in 
compliance with the prescripts and policies or would they rely on  the 
relevant Executive members of management or CEO and so on?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair if memory serves me correctly 
the ADC called the Group Chief Supply Chair Officer …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To attend … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Their meetings … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And to – I would imagine that if there 
were procurement process related issues …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They would look to the Group Chief 
Supply Chain Officer to say …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is this correct or not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So - so they would have at the meeting available 
to them such a person? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Whether that person as present when 
these matters were discussed …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 39 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I cannot say …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But usually …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The Group Chief Supply Chair Officer 
would be present …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would attend, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  At - at these discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Would attend, okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Can you now move on to d eal with the 
10 
McKinsey confinements? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Chair I – with regards the 
McKinsey transactions I’ve also been asked to comment on the grounds 
of the confinement to McKinsey I make the point in paragraph 118 that 
over a three year period  2012 to 2018 there were at least eight 
contracts that were awarded to McKinsey consulting for various 
consultancy work. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And this all eight were on 
confinements? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     All eight followed a confined tender 
20 
process and I – a summary is contained in the bundle in the Annexures 
but on the next page Chair, on page 55 paragraph 1251 to 1258 I 
summarised these confinements. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And what is the value – the total value 
of these confinements? 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 40 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Chair the combined value of these 
various confinements came to about 1.6billion and with some 
amendments and increases to scope of work and value to about 
2.1billion. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    All that did not go out on tender ? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     It did not go out on open tender, it 
was awarded by of a confined tender process.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes now from paragraph 120 you 
express certain views about the justifications that were contained in the 
confinement, could you please take us through them?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Chair I highlight various views 
which I have of the confinement starting with the entrenching of 
monopolies. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     And I say that because in the PPM 
which is our manual of how these things are to be done it, in fact, 
cautions that because confinement is a departure from an open tender 
process it must be dealt with, with great “circumspection” and it warns 
– just lower down in that paragraph I say that the PPM also warns that 
the misuse of confinement has the potential to entrench monopolies 
20 
and as such is at odds with the imperatives with the new growth path 
which was one of the flagship government polices at the time.  I make 
the point, Chair, in paragraph 122 that our procurement procedures 
required our delegated authorities to be vigilant against the creation of 
monopolies and at face value any company who has received work by 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 41 of 82 
 
way of a confined tender process over a two year perio d with eight 
awards being made totalling 1.6billion, on the face of it, that seemed to 
create a monopolistic situation.  What I also highlighted is that there 
was some awareness even on the part of the Group Chief Executive 
about the dangers of monopolies so when certain of these confinements 
were brought forward – I deal with this in paragraph 123 there is a 
submission that served before the Acquisition Council at one point and 
it contained the following paragraph, which you will find in italics 
towards the end of paragraph 123 and it says,  
 
“during post-tender negotiations the GCE raised a concern that 
10 
Transnet had been awarding business excessively to McKinsey and 
Company and as a result this will expose Transnet to insurmountable 
risks should any unsavoury circumstances occur”, 
 
And at that point a decision was made to award part of the 
business to Deloitte’s, but even that ended up in being cancelled and 
the award was made to McKinsey.  So I think, in essence, despite the 
earlier concerns and awareness that we could be dealing with a 
monopolistic situation the award proceeded, nevertheless on all of 
these things. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes take us through the grounds of 
20 
confinement as you discuss in paragraph 1.5.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Chair in 1. – sorry in 125, I just 
again quote what the – our internal grounds are and I say that these 
confinements relied on two grounds, urgency firstly, I mention that as 
ground A) in paragraph 126 and ground D) which is that services are 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 42 of 82 
 
highly specialised and largely identical to work previously performed 
and I just want to engage for a few moments on both of those grounds, 
whether they were justified in the context of the McKinsey transactions.  
Under urgency Chair, it is stated that the ground for confineme nts are 
urgent based on certain revenue related risks.  It was stated that 
EBITDAR is at risk and there’s a need to deliver on MDS, the Market 
Demands Strategy which was a flagship programme of Transnet at time 
and it states that if we don’t get these serv ices we could place the 
whole MDS at risk. 
 
Now as I testified yesterday, the grounds for urgency is that it 
10 
must be a genuine unforeseeable urgency and I say in my statement 
that the PPM contemplates that the situation that gave rise to the 
urgency should not be anticipated and should therefore be genuinely 
unexpected and I question whether the revenue risks that were 
highlighted were genuinely unexpected.  A revenue risk is not 
something which Transnet would realise now, one sees declines in 
volumes and declines in revenue usually over a period of time and I 
certainly don’t think that, that was unforeseeable.  On the second 
ground which relates to the fact that the services from Mckinsey are 
highly specialised and largely identical to work which they previ ously 
20 
did.  I say the following in paragraph 130 of my statement Chair, I say 
that, “all the confinement memos justified the confinements to Mckinsey 
on the grounds that it would result in wasted time and money.  It was 
stated that a new service provider w ould have to acquaint itself with 
Transnet’s pricing strategies, capital programme, overall MDS, whereas 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 43 of 82 
 
McKinsey already had that knowledge” and ground D) does make 
allowance for a situation where I can confine to someone on the 
grounds that it’s a highly  specialised service and I just want a bit more 
from that person based on what they have done before.  We, in 
Transnet we refer to it sometimes as the school fees, the school fees 
clause. We say we have paid the school fees of this consultant he has 
come to learn all of our shortcomings, our difficulties, our systems and 
we want him to do an extra bit of work but if we have to go out on 
tender, I must pay the school fees now of another person whose having 
to re-learn all of these difficulties. 
10 
 
So in an appropriate case, I think there is justification for such 
awards, in fact I think the first few McKinsey transactions – the first 
two or three, I was – I supported that at the time, I thought there was a 
justification for it based on this school fees clause b ut what we have 
here Chair is that it is now said that McKinsey has all of – they’ve got – 
they’re proprietary iron or demand and supply model and they’ve got 
proven 
toolkits 
for 
negotiation 
and 
the 
like 
and 
the 
point...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that since we’re looking – we’re talking about 
quite a high number of contracts that were awarded to McKinsey, I think 
20 
your statement says about eight. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that you might not have just paid, you k now, 
the school fees, you must have taken them to university as well so it 
had to take long. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 44 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     We could have paid for many 
universities Mr Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    On that university note, I see it’s 
quarter past eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay we’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at 
half past eleven, we’re adjourned.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Volmink just before the tea 
adjournment you were still taking the Chair in relation to paragraph 131 
of your statement please continue and summarise what you are saying 
there? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct.  Thank you Chair.  
The point that I was addressing before tea relates to the second ground 
for confinement where it was said that the services are highly 
specialised and only obtainable from Gijima.  What I say in paragraph 
131 is where the PPM…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – did you say from Gijima? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Not Gijima. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Sorry you asked? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We long past Gijima?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You mentioned Gijima. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 45 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We long past Gijima. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Sorry my – my apologies Chair.  
What I – what I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  China South and Mutsui, Mutsui.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes I think we had also past…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where we are. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Past there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh we are past that as well. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I think we are now with McKinsey. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I think I meant to say McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON: Oh we are at McKinsey ja.  Okay.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The point that I wanted to make is 
that where this ground is dealt with in the PPM it says that when this 
ground D is relied upon proper consideration must be given to the 
public interest as well as Transnet’s interest. In other words it conveys 
the notion that it is n ot sufficient for Transnet officials to consider the 
fact that the services are highly specialised and can only be obtained 
from McKinsey.  I make the point that there is an overwhelming public 
20 
interest in open, fair, competitive tendering processes and th e 
avoidance of monopolistic situations.  And had that requirement of the 
public interest being taken into consideration as well when that ground 
D was considered I think it would have pointed us away from repetitive 
confinements to McKinsey when the public  interest in fact required 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 46 of 82 
 
something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And there can in my view Chair be no 
distinction between the public interest and Transnet’s interest as a 
public body.  Chair I then deal with another concern which I p icked up 
and that is that in a number of instances payments were made to 
McKinsey even before the tenders were awarded.  So the tender is still 
underway and payments are being made.  And I deal with that in 
paragraph 132. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  May I then take you to Exhibit 
10 
BB2.1D for David? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  And if you may please go to 
page 1342.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  In order to substantiate what you are 
saying in paragraph 132 you then place re liance on a number of emails 
starting from page 1342 onwards.  Can you please take us through the 
emails? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Gladly Chair.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You can follow the chronology that suits 
20 
you know the version. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair perhaps just for purposes of 
chronology it may be better to start with the first email which you will 
find further down in the annexure.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am on BB2.1D, is that the wrong lever 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 47 of 82 
 
arch file? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  That is the right one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the right one?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  On page  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 1 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  1342. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  1342.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I was on 1242.  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair if we can start on page 1344.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It is an email written by the then 
procurement manager Cindy Felix to Mr Edward Thomas  
CHAIRPERSON:  The one at the bottom?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Right at the bottom.  And it is dated 
the 11 July 2014.  And it says: 
“Dear Edward, I refer to your text message received 
this morning where you have instructed us to create 
20 
purchase orders for payments to be made to 
McKinsey where no contracts exist.  As the P to P 
that is Procure to Pay business process owner for 
TCC she is now describing herself please be advised 
that I require written permission via email from you 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 48 of 82 
 
as the acting Group Chief Supply Chain Officer to 
request my team to create purchase orders as this is 
a deviation in the P to P process and effectively our 
supply chain policy and procurement procedures 
which is based on the regulatory statutes we are 
bound by as a state owned comp any.  It is my 
understanding that the payment requests is from 
Business and it is being approved as duly payable by 
the Group Chief Financial Officer Anoj Singh as the 
respective delegated authority for Transnet and 
10 
custodian of these transactions.”  
She continues: 
“We assume that the applicable risks in making such 
payments have been considered before release of 
these respective requisitions.”  
And she then lists these various transactions where payment is 
supposed to be made.  She says: 
“The tenders according to you affected include the 
following:” 
She refers to: 
20 
“The coal breakthrough of 2 metric tonnes”  
That is one of the confinements to McKinsey.  And she says – she is 
now getting a status update – she says: 
“No evaluation is in progress.  Business is not  
responding and the business owners wanted – noted 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 49 of 82 
 
that business does not agree to this request.”  
In essence she is saying there is no evaluation has happened yet but 
we must pay the service provider. She mentions the next one relating to 
the renegotiation of the Kumba iron ore contract also one of the 
confinements. She again says: 
“No evaluation in progress Business not responding 
and Business owner wanted to…”  
I think she pretty much the same status.  Regarding the third 
confinement regarding the manganes e execution initiative she again 
says: 
10 
“It is currently in evaluation stage.”  
The fourth confinement.  NMPPD Risking and Acceleration currently in 
evaluation stage and Capital Optimisation which is the fifth one she 
says: 
“It is only issued on 10 July and we only received 
supply chain management sign off this week.”  
And she concludes by saying: 
“Kindly be advised that we 
do not and she 
underlines do not recommend that this be paid.” 
And she puts it in bold. 
20 
“Until such time as these contracts are concluded as 
the scale of the risk is significant in relation to the 
payments being made to service providers who 
knowingly took on the risk of doing work without a 
proper tender process being completed.”  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 50 of 82 
 
There are other paragraphs which follow but I think that is …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  That captures the essence. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That captures the essence of what 
she was saying which in my view captures the internal controls 
absolutely correctly. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And then what happened after she  have 
now dispatched that email?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well then Chair we have another 
email from Mr Edward Thomas now in response to the email from Cindy 
Felix and the contents you will find on page 1344 and he says:  
10 
“Dear Cindy firstly a contractual  obligation has been 
created once the confinement process was approved.  
A letter was issued to McKinsey whereby Transnet 
requested them to commence work while the RFP 
was issued and they were to respond to the RFP 
indicating that should Transnet not concl ude the 
procurement event after the RFP was completed 
Transnet commits to pay for work delivered until that 
point.  Thus a contract is in place thus no 
condonation is required at all for any payment that is 
20 
to be made thus there are no risks regarding this  
payment that can be validly made.  The fact that 
Transnet will be negotiating price further through the 
RFP process will be taken into account in future 
payments to be made.”  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 51 of 82 
 
And in essence he is saying that as far as he is concerned a contract 
exists and payments can be made against that contract.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Despite that analysis that really showed 
that the process was incoherent at that stage and there was no 
contracts in place at that stage?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair.  With respect I 
think the contents of this second email – the contents are patently 
incorrect.  A confinement when one gets approval to confine  
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not create a contract?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It does not create a contract at all.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And everybody should know that.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I would imagine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And all it does is to say you have 
permission not to issue this RFP 
CHAIRPERSON:  For open tenders. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For open tender  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But you can now issue the RFP to 
this one or two or three or however many you have confined to and then 
20 
what follows  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is a process which mirror s the open 
tender process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but confined to those  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 52 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But confined to those two or one or 
however many. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And the contract gets concluded at 
the end of that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It is unheard of that one can 
conclude a contract first and then  
CHAIRPERSON:  Evaluate. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Evaluate later. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supplier later. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I have never heard of suc h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean what – what point would – would it serve to 
evaluate whether the supplier is the right kind of supplier if you have 
already concluded a contract?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well precisely Chair because even if 
it is a confined – a confined tender 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It must go through a rigorous 
evaluation process. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  If that bidder does not make any of 
thresholds let us say for functionality or local content that bid der is 
excluded, the bidder falls away.  But if I already have contract in place 
I really put the cart before the horse and I think that is exactly what 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 53 of 82 
 
happened in this instance. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  An email that you want us to – that you 
want to complete with? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It – I think that is then just a follow 
up email where the staff is told that look Eddie has now informed us 
that there is no breach or deviation and payment must now be made.  I 
think that the staff felt that they no w had no alternative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they had made their points and.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  They have made their point, they 
have stated their position. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But someone higher up in the food 
chain had instructed that the payment must be made and I think the 
impression that one gets is under protest the payments then flow.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you take us from page 60 paragraph 
133 onwards? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is back to the statement?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes back to the statement Mr Chair.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  Chair I then just I make the 
point there that there should have been no confusion about this to 
20 
begin with because in our procurement rules in the PPM of the 2013 
version which applied at the time there was a provision which I quote 
on – in paragraph 134 where it says: 
“No employee shall anticipate the approval of 
acceptance of bids.  Therefore no employee may 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 54 of 82 
 
enter into contracts verbally or in writing or place 
any 
orders 
before 
the 
prescribed 
adjudication 
process has been performed.  An authority has been 
duly granted by a manager with appropriate DOA.”  
So that rule was always there and there is a further provision that says:  
“Even if you have a confined tender it says those 
tenders will “close at the relevant acquisition 
council”. 
What that simply means as I have explained before is a tender gets 
issued.  There must still be a closing date.  There must – and all the 
10 
normal processes of adjudication then follows.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And that is what I deal with on – in 
paragraph 134 yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And 135? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In paragraph 135 I say that on the 9 
April 2014 well before these RFP’s were issued the Group Chief 
Financial Officer who was Mr Anoj Singh at the time wrote to both 
McKinsey and Regiments and requested them to “mobilise a McKinsey 
led consortium” he says to have initial discussions with our teas.  But 
20 
we know now from what we have seen it was not just discussi ons.  They 
were mobilised to do actual work and – and I think that for me is a 
fundamental breach of process.  As a result of this Chair we actually 
felt the need to issue a further directive to Business.  And I deal with 
that in paragraph 136 the directive itself I think is attached as PV46 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 55 of 82 
 
which… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair it is on page 1353. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I do not propose to read the 
entire directive Chair save to say that this directive explained to 
Business that a confinement – a confined tender process is still a 
tender process and that no one should jump the gun.  That everyone 
should wait until the tender process is completed be it a confined 
tender process or an open tender process.  There should be no 
engagements with a bidder until that process has been completed and 
only after the relevant delegated body has made the award only then 
10 
can one engage and issue letters of intent and contracts can be 
concluded etcetera.  And that is in essence the contents of the 
directive that was  issued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that directive prompted by knowledge of the 
response to Ms Cindy Felix. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja Felix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was her surname?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Felix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Felix, Felix. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Ms Felix email. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes it was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was prompted by that?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes it was she raised not only Cindy 
but other people in the supply chain community came to Governance  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 56 of 82 
 
and said you must address this issue because we are being asked to 
make payments while tender processes are still underway.  And that is 
when we issued this to the entire organisation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know whether Mr Anoj Singh would have 
seen the directive quite soon after it was circulated or issued or is that 
something you do not know?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair it is addressed firstly to all 
EXCO and extended EXCO members of which Mr Anoj Singh was a 
member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was a member.  Yes so… 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But he would have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so – so he – it was to be expected that he would 
see it? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That he would have seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  But after there was no change of attitude 
in the – on his part after the issuing of this directive in relation to 
payments to this entity?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I am not aware that there has been 
any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not aware. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You conclude on that topic Mr Volmink 
on page 137. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In paragraph 137. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 57 of 82 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Paragraph 137 yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I simply say Chair that it was most 
irregular to engage McKinsey to commence work before the tender 
process and I say that it creates the impression that the confinements 
to McKinsey amounted to little more than an Ex post facto exercise to 
justify the award of Business that had already occurred.  Why go 
through the pretence of a confined tender process when in fact the 
teams are already on the ground doing the work?  And it just creates 
the impression in my mind that this was Ex post facto justification for 
what had already happened. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And from paragraph 138 you addressing 
a new topic.  Take us through it?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  This is now still on the McKinsey 
contracts.  I am raising a further concern that I have with the contracts 
Chair.  And it relates to what we refer to as parce lling of transactions. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  What does that – what does that mean? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Well in essence what it means is that 
you cannot break up a transaction into smaller value components to 
bring it to a lower level of delegatio n when in fact if you take the 
cumulative value it should go to a higher level of delegation.  It is even 
20 
dealt with I think in our code of ethics where it is stated that it is 
considered an ethical breach to unbundle a transaction into smaller 
components in order to avoid higher levels of authority and scrutiny.  
Now I raise that in the context of the McKinsey contracts because I say 
that over a period of four days and that is from the 31 March 2014 to 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 58 of 82 
 
the 3 April 2014 when I reviewed these confinements I noticed that the 
former GCE Mr Brian Molefe approved four confinements with a 
combined value of R619 million.  Now Mr Molefe had delegation to 
approve confinements but only up to R250 million.  Each one of these 
four falls under 250.  So the first one is 1 30 million.  The second one 
was 239, the third one was 150 million and the fourth confinement was 
100 million.  So viewed on their own they would have fell within his 
delegated authority.  But viewed cumulatively it should have been 
referred to a higher level which is the board acquisition and disposal 
committee. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the same transaction?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the same transaction these four confinements?  
Did they relate to the same job?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They relate to the award of different 
aspects of what is broadly the McKinsey confinement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So the coal contract.  The coal 
contract to McKinsey was to appoint McKinsey to help us to improve 
our efficiencies on the coal.  But the iron ore contract which is the 
20 
second one was also geared at enhancing efficiencies, increasing 
revenue.  The third one which was the manganese contract had the 
same essential characteristics it was about how we can get McKinsey  
to help us to improve on our productivity and so on and the NNPP 
contract.  So they – they in essence relate to the same scope of work.  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 59 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were given over  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Four days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few days. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  A four day period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A four day period. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is over a very short period and relates to 
effectively the same project?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Essentially the – exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same project. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And to the same entity. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And to the same entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to the same entity. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  And it seemed to me Chair at 
face value that this amounted to an unbundling of these contracts to 
fall within the delegated authority of the GCE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we will see in the end whether the finding will be 
that that is what happened but on the face of it it does seem that these 
factors that you have mentioned could support what you are saying.  I 
20 
mean the manganese one and the NMPP one were done on the same 
day. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 60 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  3 April 2014 why were they done separately?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the iron ore one had been done two days 
earlier. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Two days earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the coal one had been done one day earlier than 
the iron ore one. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  One day earlier.  That is my concern.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So those factors may well support what your 
proposition may be. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes Chair.  Um and I conclude that 
point over the page where I just say  that the rules around parcelling in 
Transnet states the following and I am on page 63 of my statement.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Paragraph 141. 
“The rules around parcelling says that when the full 
scope of work is known at a  point in time 
requirements may not be deliberately split into parts 
or items of lesser value in order to keep the 
transaction within a particular delegation of authority 
20 
level or to keep it below a particular threshold or a 
person with higher levels of de legation.  This is 
considered parcelling and will be regarded in a 
serious light as it amounts to non-compliance with 
procurement procedures.”  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 61 of 82 
 
So I think the rules around that were clearly stated in the company at 
the time. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And yesterday you did educate us 
about what you termed the confidential confinements and you had an 
exchange with the Chair whether – does that conform with the 
principles of the [indistinct] Section 217 of the Constitution and 
whether can one justify that within the principles of open competitive 
transparent tender system?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you tell us then what did this also 
10 
entail in relation to McKinsey?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In relation to McKinsey Chair I  
indicated yesterday that a number of these confinements were 
classified as confidential.  And I will come back to that aspect in a 
moment but first let me say this that because confinements is a process 
that is – that has great potential for abuse where g rounds are relied 
upon that are actually – that should never justify confinement. Various 
safeguards and levels of revue were built into the process and I 
mention that it has to start with the operating division.  The end user 
department has to motivate for the confinement.  It then has to go to 
20 
the operation division CPO, the acquisition council and the Chief 
Executive of that operating division and then it comes to Group where it 
again has to undergo various levels of revue from the Group Chief 
Supply Chain Officer and there was even a practice although not 
uniformly observed that Governance had to review these as well.  And I 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 62 of 82 
 
said yesterday that when a confinement was classified as confidential 
none of the safeguards applied.  So it sailed past all these reviewing 
bodies and would have gone straight to the GCE.  And…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Were all confidential confinements dealt with by one 
functionary say the GCEO or the BADC or were they dealt with by 
different bodies? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It would depend on the value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that principle still applied?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That principle still applied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But it would not go through any of 
the 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Reviewing bodies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  A confidential confinement in effect meant that 
only one functionary person or body would decide it and there would be 
no multiple stages of involvement by different peopl e? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is precisely the case. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So it would come from the author of 
the document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And be received by the approving 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 63 of 82 
 
authority …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Authority. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  With no intervening …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Levels of scrutiny. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I then state that on paragraph 
149 I make the point that all of thes e levels of review are bypassed and 
then in paragraph 150 … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 65. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  On page 65 …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I say that: 
“Secondly the confinement memos contain very 
little 
if 
anything 
that 
explains 
why 
these 
submissions were classified as confidential.”  
I mean … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – you told me yesterday that the original source 
of this concept of confidential confinement came from delegated 
authority from the Board. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It was in the DOA framework, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is where came … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It came from originally and – you know – you had to 
put into a policy …  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 64 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on.  I do not remember whether I asked this 
question yesterday but was it provided in that original delegated 
authority or was it – was there a provision that said under what 
circumstances a contract or job could be classified or could q ualify as 
confidential – confinement could be regarded as confidential?  You told 
us yesterday and today the grounds in terms of policy - the grounds for 
confinement.  You may confine a tender if one of the following grounds 
exists. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether – was there a similar thing that was put up 
by the Board when they came up for the first time with this concept of 
confine – confidential confinement?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair there were no guidelines 
contained in the DOA framework.  I think there was simply a line that 
said when the – when it is confidential …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It can be considered by the final 
approval authority without directing it to the lower levels of authority.  
So there was in essence to answer your question there were no 
20 
guidelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No guidelines or grounds that were given.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was given the authority to declare or decide 
that a particular confinement would be a confidential one?  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 65 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The origin – the originator …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of the document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Would for various reasons state why 
he thinks it is confiden tial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It would be taken to the final 
approval authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who then review it and if the 
approval authority agrees that it was confidential it would be signed off.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is quite clear from what you – you explain that it 
meant it was not to be dealt with by different bodies and Committees 
and functionaries who otherwise would deal with it if it was not a – a 
confidential confinement.  So – so in effect would it be correct that it 
was therefore to be taken as confidential between the originator – the 
author – and then the …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And the (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Approving body? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Exactly.  That is how it would be 
understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it is quite a strange thing in a – in a State 
Owned Entity.  Somebody says there are certain contracts which will be 
regarded as confidential but we are not saying which ones – you know 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 66 of 82 
 
– what are the … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Criteria for confidentiality and if so and so classifies 
it as confidential it can come to us and then it does not have to go 
through other people and we will – we will then decide if we approve or 
not … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – and that could entail a lot of taxpayers 
money. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well that is exactly the danger here 
10 
Chair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As we have seen in some of these 
instances that I am talking about …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  This concern is not an abstract …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Academic concern.  It is rooted in the 
real experiences of the organisation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PETER STEPH EN VOLMINK:  Thankfully the concept of confidential 
confinements …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Has been removed …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 67 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  By the current Board but it created 
huge risk for the organisation at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever get to know who exactly came up with 
this concept or is there something that you really do not know apart 
from that it came from the Board?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I honestly cannot – cannot say this 
individual or that individ ual and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay but it came from the Board, ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But we know that it came – it 
originated from the delegation (intervenes).  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Originated from the Board, ja but other than - the 
confinement is what was considered to be confidential but once the 
tender had been awarded the tender itself was not confidential.  Is that 
right? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes and I think that in itself is an 
oddity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Because it is confidential up until the 
confinement is approved …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But then you must still issue the RFP 
to that bidder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It must still be received.  It must still 
… 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 68 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that stage it is not – it is not confidential. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And that – that part is not - is not 
confidential which is – which is a further …  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is very strange. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is very strange.  It is very strange, 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it – I wonder whether it was designed to avoid a 
situation where lower management and other bodies would say no this 
is not confidential and it would be difficult for the approving authority to 
keep on overruling them because they may have wanted to – to treat 
10 
those as confidential but management saw nothing suggesting …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Confidential about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well there is a provision that directs 
the lower level bodies … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As to what they must consider when 
approving a confinement and it does say there must be a robust review 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of the grounds of confinement and 
the motivation for the confinement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Before it is taken to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 69 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The final approval body. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The intention Chair is that poorly 
justified …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Motivation. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Or unjustified…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Motivations either for confinement or 
whatever the case maybe …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Whatever the ground of confinement 
may be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And if it is poorly motivated …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It would be dealt with at that lower 
level of review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So that we do not have to  burden the 
final … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, body. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Approval body …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  With a poorly motivated …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Poorly motivated …  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 70 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That was the underlying rationale but 
if you took those reviewing bodies out of the equation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well then it just goes straight 
through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it was a way of ensuring that cer tain 
confinement requests were no subjected to the normal scrutiny that the 
policies and procedures of the company required requests for 
10 
confinements to be subjected to?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it was about?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That – that - it seemed to me that 
was the underlying motivation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was not about keeping secret the amounts 
relating to the tender because once the confinement had been approved 
there was nothing secret about the ten der.  The tender would be dealt 
with as a confined tender but nothing confidential at that stage.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Covering the normal … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normal procedures? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes, yes.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it seems that the idea was to ensure that 
such requests for – certain requests for confinement of certain tenders 
were taken out the normal scrutiny of mechanisms and bodies within 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 71 of 82 
 
the company? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And Chair the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is a strange concept Chair very 
complicated and complex. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Firstly a confinement in its own means 
that it is not open …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is not an open competitive tender.  
Secondly it is confidential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, confidential. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I – I – ja, so it is almost a – you 
know- a deviation within a deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Confinement is a deviation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Why still have a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  A confidential confinement and the 
point that I was making is that apart from this anomaly of the principle 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 72 of 82 
 
if one looks at the substance of the motivations there is nothing that 
strikes me as even remotely confidential about what is contained in 
these memoranda.  For instance it talks – it says that there are 
declining revenues and declining volumes and (indistinct) and a risk 
and that McKinsey is ideally placed to help us to implement various 
projects but why they could not have followed a normal confinement 
process – I mean that – I think on any reasonable interpretation and 
reading of these confinement memos it certainly does not appear that 
there was anything not even an iota of information is contained that 
would convince a reasonable reader that there was grounds for 
10 
confidential – confidentiality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They could have simply said certain contracts – 
certain tenders that require confinement will not go through the normal 
route before reaching the approving authority.  They will go from the 
originator straight to th e – to the approving authority.  In effect they 
could have said that.  Is it not because there was nothing – if there was 
nothing confidential about these things then all – all they wanted to 
achieve is simply that from the originator it should come straig ht to the 
approving authority.  It should not be subjected to …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Scrutiny by other people. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair they could have said that but 
the difficulty would have been that the same risk still e xists where it 
goes from the originator to the final approver whether you call it 
confidential or not without that critical middle layer of review.  
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 73 of 82 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I accept that.  We are on the same page.  I 
am simply saying if one accepts that there  was – there was no basis for 
classifying them as confidential …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that the whole point was that these – these 
requests for confinement should not be subjected to normal scrutiny by 
various bodies because they  wanted to only certain people or certain 
bodies to approve them.  Then all they needed to do is to say certain 
requests for confinement will come straight to us or to the GCEO or to 
the B … 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  BADC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  BADC. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  DC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  BADC.  Then we would have had the same thing.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely there is no scrutiny …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they decide themselves. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You conclude Mr Volmink on this concern 
that you are raising how McKinsey was treated throughout.  You do so 
in paragraphs 151 and 152. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes Chair I – I then just conclude 
that portion by saying that the added difficulty with using confidentiality 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 74 of 82 
 
is that it was sometimes quoted as a ground for confinement itself 
whereas our rules on confinement only recognise four grounds – 
urgency, sole supplier, standardisation and what I refer to ea rlier as the 
school fees clause where there is highly specialised things and – those 
are the four grounds of confinement.  Confidentiality can be cited as a 
reason not to take it through the reviewing process but we see that 
sometimes confidentiality is even quoted as a further ground for 
confinement which I – I think was incorrect.  Chair I am …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You said that you had to incorporate his 
new procedure or requirement of confidentiality into the policy?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the Board had put it into a delegated – 
delegation.  When you put it into your policy documents what did you 
put as the grounds on which it could be initiated.  In other words what 
did – what do you do?  Did you put in some grounds or  did you just do 
what the Board had done. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well Chair we had some debates 
about - about that and if memory serves me correctly the debate was 
resolved that on the basis that the grounds as stated in the delegation 
of authority would be incorporated into the policy.  There was some 
20 
concern – if memory services me correctly – about over regulating or 
over prescribing what may be considered as confidential grounds or no 
confidential grounds.  So it was – it was left somewhat open even in the 
past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you said in the delegated authority there were no 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 75 of 82 
 
grounds. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  So the only ground…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is confidential – is that if it is 
confidential …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No there cannot be a ground. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So the ground … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For bypassing all of these delegated 
bodies … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Would be if some – if it is classified 
as a confidential … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So you just took what was (intervenes) authority?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think in essence it was – it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Completed as such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And paragraph 152? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think it is – I (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  (Intervenes). 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 76 of 82 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The same point in 152. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You are dealing with a further concern 
which is the gap analysis.  Can you explain it to the Chair and take us 
through what you sought to convey in relation to that concern?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I point out in paragraph 153 
and following under the heading “gap analysis” – I say that a National 
Treasury issued an instruction which would have been applicable to 
some of these McKinsey contracts and the instruction I have annexed 
as Annexure PV48 which you will find on page 1389 and what this 
instruction says Chair is that a consultant may only be appointed after 
10 
a proper business case has been done and a – what is referred to as a 
gap analysis – has been done to confirm that Transnet does not have 
the requisite skills or the resources in place to perform this work.  In 
other words it must be confirmed that in the – there is no one among 
the 50 000 employees who work for Transnet that there is expertise of 
this nature and that – and there needs to be a proper motivation for 
that.  There is a passing reference to that in some of the McKinsey 
confinements but no proper gap analysis was done to show – and that 
is a mandatory requirement.  It is not nice to have.  It says that the 
organ of State must conduct such a gap analysis before it can proceed 
20 
to appoint a consultant and I could not find evidence of such gap 
analysis. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and you conclude your statement 
with the last concern that is the remuneration model.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair.  The last 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 77 of 82 
 
aspect which I deal with in my statement relates to the remuneration 
model that McKinsey sought to implement and the McKinsey contracts 
made provision for two kinds of fees Chair.  The first is the so called 
fixed fee component.  So they would say to do preparatory work or to 
do whatever there is - our fixed fee is that and then they would have 
what is referred to as a contingent fee component.  This was usually 
related to McKinsey sharing a percentage of any increase in  revenue 
which would come about as a result of their efforts.  So if I take – let us 
say – the coal or the manganese contract if it could be established that 
as a result of their interventions that revenue had increased by a 
10 
certain amount there would be a predetermined percentage that would 
be allocated to them over and above the fixed fee that they had signed 
up for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was like a performance bonus?  If they – if they 
had done such a good job that there was an increase in revenue then 
they would get extra …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Extra. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Extra payment? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  I suppose one could regard it as 
a performance bonus of – of sorts. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And they were paid those con tingency 
fees? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  Now – now on the face of it 
Chair I was concerned that this contingent fee arrangement was not 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 78 of 82 
 
aligned to National Treasury’s instruction on cost containment which in 
fact there is an instruction that directs  that fees for consultants will be 
subject to certain prescripts.  You cannot – a consultant cannot charge 
you whatever and I think I may even have attached a copy of that - of 
that instruction. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is page 1398 Chair.  Would that b e the 
one Mr Volmink? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  1398 if you just bear with me.  I think 
it is a little bit earlier.  Chair if you turn to page 1389 you will find a 
copy of the cost containment instruction …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And if you turn the page to page 
1390 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And if you look at paragraph 4.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It states the following: 
“Consultants may only be remunerated at the rates 
…” 
And then it lists three categories. 
20 
“A, determined in the guideline for fees issued by 
SICA.” 
Which is a South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.  
“B, set out in the guide on hourly fee rates for 
consultants by the Department of Public Services 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 79 of 82 
 
and Administration…” 
These are called DPSA rates. 
“…or 
prescribed 
by 
the 
body 
regulating 
the 
profession of the consultant.”  
So these are regulated rates and a concern which we had at the time is 
that the – the contingent fee model did not align well with what seemed 
to be regulated rates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the difficulty then – well let me 
say that we then engaged with National Treasury on whether the use of 
10 
contingency fees could be a basis for remunerating consultants and the 
Accountant 
General 
responded 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Transnet 
dated 
25 June 2014 and perhaps I should turn to it Chair.  It is Annexure 
PV49 which is the last annexure in the – in my bundle and …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 1398? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  1398. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And he responds to various questions 
that we had posed to him and under the – in paragraph 7 under the 
heading “Use of Consultants” the Accountant General quotes that 
20 
paragraph 4.2 of the instruction which I have just read w hich says what 
the prescriptions are for remuneration and then Chair he says the – he 
said the following.  
“The above mentioned documents merely provide 
the tariffs that PFMA compliant institutions may pay 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 80 of 82 
 
consultants and these tariffs are not related to 
additional revenue or earnings – if any – that 
entities 
may 
realise 
or 
benefit 
from 
their 
appointment.” 
And it seemed to open the door to the possibility of a contingency fee 
arrangement and I think on – on the basis of this letter Transnet 
proceeded to implement the contingency fee arrangement.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now finally Mr  Volmink you have 
dealt with a number of transactions.  The Neotel Network Services, 
confinement of the CCTV, the award of the IT Data Service Contract to 
10 
T-Systems, the 100 locomotives transaction to China South Rail and the 
McKinsey consulting the confinement that you have taken us so 
eloquently through.  What do you make about these contracts?  What 
do you make about the conduct giving rise to the issues that you have 
raised to – before the Chairperson?  Could you ascribe this as sheer 
incompetence or lack of understanding of the applicable prescripts?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I have sought to give a candid 
view on the compliance with prescripts that – that was followed and if 
the – if the rule that was no followed if it was an obscure highly 
complicated difficult to understand provision then I – I would be more 
20 
inclined to think that there could be just innocent bungling but Chair if 
we look at the rules around how confinements are supposed to be done 
the principle that you cannot pay someone before you award a tender to 
them - all the other breaches that I have dealt with over the last two 
days Chair it is not deeply complex principles that were no followed and 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 81 of 82 
 
it – it suggests in my view an – an element of either gross negligence 
or wilfulness in – in not following the transactions.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair that is – that concludes the 
questions for Mr Volmink. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you.  Thank you very m uch Mr Volmink for 
coming forward to clarify the experiences that you found at Transnet 
with regard to these particular transactions and your understanding of 
the procurement prescripts applicable to Transnet during the times of 
these transactions and if a  need arises you will be asked to come back, 
thank you very much you are release.

MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Thank you Chair, Mr Pretorius will 
address you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Chair the next witness for 
Transnet is Mr Mohomedy he won’t give evidence today because we are 
adjourning early today. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And I understand that Monday as 
well as Tuesday the Chair and others are otherwi se engaged and that 
20 
unless you decide otherwise Chair we will begin on Wednesday once more 
at 10am with Mr Mohammed, his evidence for Transnet.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes we will not sit on Monday and Tuesday we will 
resume on Wednesday.  I was thinking that we should try, next week to 
start earlier than normal to try and – if we can recoup some of the time 
10 MAY 2019 – DAY 92 
 
Page 82 of 82 
 
that we will have lost.  We might not be able to recoup all of it, do you – 
are you able to indicate whether there will be any difficulties from the 
legal team if we start early on Wednesday? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well there’s two issues the 
availability of the witness and the evidence leader that can always be 
arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The other, however, is that the 
legal team are involved in other tasks so it reduces that time but if the 
programme permits, then certainly our preference would be for the normal 
10 
hours but if your concern is to make up time, then we shall just have to 
start at 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do we have an idea how long the next witness is likely 
to be on next week? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Two days and I’m informed by Mr 
Mokoena that if we start at 10 on Wednesday and Thursday we will finish 
Mr Mohomady in two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In two days, okay maybe let’s start at 10 o’clock on 
Wednesday if we need to change we’ll announce.  So on Wednesday we’ll 
start at 10. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, we’ll then adjourn for today, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 15 MAY 2019
