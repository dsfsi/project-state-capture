PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 23 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Petersen.  Good afternoon everybody. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We meant to deal with an application for Leave – for 
a certain witness to give evidence in “camera” – I say in camera in 
quotes.   There is appearance for the Minister of Police maybe we 
should let counsel for the Minister place himself on record first. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Chairperson and the members of the 
commission I appear together with my learned friend Mr Mlaba for the 
Minister of Police.  My name is Griffiths Madonsella. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  I am a member of the Durban Bar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  And so is my junior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Petersen. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair perhaps I should also identify myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Just for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It is Rob Petersen, P-e-t-e-r-s-e-n.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Senior counsel and a member of the 
Commission’s legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair the – an application or notice is now 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 3 of 27 
 
before you concerns the hearing of a witness Lieutenant Colonel 
Dhanajaya Ganguly Naidoo who I refer to as Colonel Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And measures that in our submission need to 
be taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  To ensure that this witness who is under 
witness protection continues to be secure that is to say that his identity 
should not be disclosed in the next context in which he and his family 
are living. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have read the application.  I have read the 
opposing affidavit of the Minister of Police. I understand that there 
were other implicated persons who were served with the application.  
Have you not received any opposing papers from anyone else? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Those are my instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Have you… 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  However Chair Mr Baloyi has indicated that he 
is present on behalf of one of the implicated persons and therefore 
perhaps he should put himself on record at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Thank you.  Afternoon Chair.  My name Is 
Kgangelo Baloyi from Kgangelo Baloyi Attorneys in Pretoria.  I am here 
for General Mphego.  I was also here Chair last week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Chair we have not filed any opposing 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 4 of 27 
 
papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  But we – we would like to make 
submissions insofar as the applications is concerned.  It is going to be 
very brief Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  And perhaps it will help you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   We will – let us see later on how we deal 
with that. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Petersen I was saying that I have read the 
papers with regard to the Minister’s papers I have read the affidavit 
only, I have not read the annexures but the annexures should not tell 
me anything different from what I see in the affidavit.  Have you had a 
chance to read it and have you made up your mind whether you would 
like to file an affidavit to respond? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  At this stage no Chairperson.  I will be able to 
make submissions which take that affidavit into account and essentially 
I will be persisting with the submissions which were filed with you and 
those are connected with a proposed draft order which – a copy of 
20 
which has been supplied to both Mr Manonsella and Mr Baloyi prior to 
this – these – this hearing commencing.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you say at this stage there may be no other 
stage to – if we go ahead with the hearing now. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That is so but – Chair. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 5 of 27 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got to make up your mind.  Do you want to 
file an affidavit or not? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  What I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the hearing. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is decided. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  The answer to that must be no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  However what I also mean by at this stage is 
that if the Minister of Police or any other implicated person wishes in 
10 
response to the Rule 3.3 Notice to make an application to give 
evidence and or to cross-examine Colonel Naidoo they will have an 
opportunity to do that and at that stage it may be necessary to address 
particular arrangements which might be called for depending upon what 
the outcome of any such application is.  But for the purposes of the 
general order which we are asking for today it is not necessary to 
respond further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I was talking about filing an affidavit in 
response to the Minister’s opposition to the application.  The part which 
I do not know whether you have considered is that part where the 
20 
Minister says “but this man testified in open – in the open in 
disciplinary hearings and he was already under witness protection so 
why would he be wanting to testify in camera now. He did not ask to 
testify in camera then.”   So that – that is the part that you might wish 
to deal with. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 6 of 27 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Well it might be that Chair that you would be in 
a better position to evaluate the significance of that if you had an 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It might be that you will be in a better position 
to evaluate that statement – that evidence of the – General if you do 
have before you an affidavit from the legal team organised by the legal 
team.  However I can say as I stand here that in my submission it is a 
fundamentally different situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It was not as I understand it testimony given in 
public but it was testimony given within the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Service and this commission conducts its 
hearings in public as far as possible and so the measures proposed… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes But should that not be – should that not be 
explained … 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In an affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Mr Naidoo – Naidoo in – by Colonel Naidoo in an 
affidavit as to why it is different? 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise you may be giving evidence from the bar is 
it not? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes that is indeed the dilemma.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 7 of 27 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Consequently if you will then afford us an 
opportunity to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And then the application would have to be 
brought before you again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja, no I think it is important because on the face 
of it absent an explanation from Colonel Naidoo on the face of it the 
Minister takes an understandable point to say well the disciplinary 
hearings which took place this man was already under witness 
protection.  He gave evidence and I mean from what he says and from 
10 
the mere nature of the disciplinary hearings in which he gave evidence 
he was facing – he was facing the people that he was implicating.  So – 
so I think it is necessary to have an affidavit that deals with the 
circumstances under which that happened or which places before me 
the distinction. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If any as to why that should not be – that should not 
justify a conclusion that there is no reason why he cannot give 
evidence in the open in regard to here as well.  Particularly because I 
think anyone reading the hearing that – anyone hearing that would say 
20 
well most of the time or quite often persons who want to give evidence 
in camera do not want the persons that they implicate to identify them – 
to know them and in this case if the position is that he did testify and 
they were there – they know him.  It needs some explanation.  It may 
be that what you have in mind is an explanation which you thought you 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 8 of 27 
 
could give from the bar is something that would explain it but I think 
that part does – it would be good if there is an affidavit. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes I will be guided by you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I would just like to emphasise and perhaps to 
the extent that this is being broadcast today it needs to be emphasised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Perhaps because this has been broadcast 
today it needs to emphasised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That Colonel Naidoo is under witness 
protection under the Witness Protection Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That you have already made an order in terms 
of Section 18 of the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  To protect his identity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So that his – to put it colloquially his cover 
does not get blown. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In his new environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Have you got the order that I made with you. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I could just read it again so that everybody 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 9 of 27 
 
is reminded of it.  Okay I think what I will do once we are done is just 
to read it again so that everybody knows about it. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would seem to me therefore that the application 
needs to be postponed to give you an opportunity to obtain an affidavit 
probably from Colonel Naidoo to deal with that and any other point 
raised in the Minister’s affidavit that may be considered to be one that 
should be responded to. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then I terms of the way forward the idea 
10 
was that Colonel Naidoo would begin to – the plan was that he would 
begin to give evidence I think on Thursday?  That – I think that was … 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was meant to be Thursday.  There is no reason why 
we cannot deal with the matter either on Wednesday afternoon or at 
some stage on Wednesday or Thursday morning as far as I am 
concerned it need not disturb the day when he was going to – to be 
here. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course there are two witnesses I think who 
20 
were meant to come before him.  So – so it may or it may not be that he 
would be able to start on Thursday – I am not sure.  I think what should 
happen is that I will hear what Mr Madonsella has to say but it seems to 
me that we – the application should be postponed.  It seems to me that 
there should be discussions after the application has been postponed 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 10 of 27 
 
and maybe it should be postponed to a specific date either Wednesday 
or Thursday morning.  Maybe to be on the safe side Thursday morning 
and if I decide to grant the application that could happen you know 
immediately before he could start giving evidence.  Obviously if I do 
not grant it then we will take it from there.  So maybe it is safer to 
postpone it to Thursday morning.  What it your feeling? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I would say Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Far better than Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But I do have this concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That I do not know what the logistically 
problems will be in getting an affidavit from Colonel Naidoo who is 
under witness protection in a location that we do not know.  And having 
that before you in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Now I am now advised that Thursday would be 
fine logistically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So if you could postpone it then to Thursday 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Thursday. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Would that be at nine o’clock? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us make it – ja maybe we should make it 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 11 of 27 
 
nine thirty rather. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Nine thirty.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I – I do not expect Mr Madonsella to have a 
problem with the principle of a postponement.  I will hear him just now.  
Okay alright Mr Madonsella. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Thank you. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Yes Deputy Chief Justice I certainly 
did not have – do not have any principled objections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  To the matter being adjourned. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  I do want to place on record however 
that it was always our intention to invoke the Provisions of Rule 3.4 
and apply for the Minister to deliver his response as well as to apply 
for a limited form of cross-examination which we – the dilemma which 
we face in that regard was that the extent to which we can respond to 
the – to the allegations that have been made by D G Naidoo are 
somehow related to the objections which we have in relation to him 
testifying in camera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  With the result that it might place us 
in a dilemma not to be able to address particular matters.  Simply 
because they fall within the space of classified information which is the 
reason why the application for a – an in camera application is made 
and we do not know – we cannot have a response relating to other 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 12 of 27 
 
matters but we cannot answer all the matters because of the 
sensitivities around the individuals… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Madonsella.  I do not know why – 
maybe you should come a little closer to the microphone I am not 
hearing every word you say. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Can I start by saying.  Chairperson 
the – we have a dilemma we want to respond to the – to the statement 
appearing in Rule 3.3 affidavit by D G Naidoo.  And we intend to bring 
10 
an application to also be allowed a limited amount of cross-examination 
in relation to a specific matter under Rule 3.4 I think of the Rules of 
this Commission.  The reason why we cannot finalise our response to 
the statement as it currently stands at the moment is because of the 
dilemma which we have as to the extent to which we can be able to 
respond to the statement by D G Naidoo because his identity has been 
hidden thus far.  And we make the point in our opposition that integral 
to his very testimony is who he is; his identity.  So those issues have 
been a bit of a dilemma but we are happy with the matter being 
adjourned to a specific date under the reservation of the rights that we 
20 
might ask on that very day to be given a limited time to file – depending 
on the outcome of that application to deliver your applica – our affidavit 
in response as well as our application for limited cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well two matters.   
1. The application for Leave to Cross-examine I think you might – 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 13 of 27 
 
you might wish to deal with it once you have been able to file 
that application. In terms of your client finding himself in a 
difficult situation because some information that he might need in 
order to respond is classified I thought that your client would be 
in a better position even to assist us.  Because you might or 
might not be aware that Colonel Roelofse who gave evidence last 
week here gave evidence of the office of the National 
Commissioner of Police not assisting to declassify information or 
documents that he says really have no proper grounds to have 
been classified in the first place you know.  And I was actually 
10 
quite amazed at what he – at the evidence he gave.  So one of 
the things that I raised with him was whether he had approached 
the Minister of Police to say the National Commissioner or 
different National Commissioners have not cooperated in the 
hope that the prescripts allow the Minister of Police to intervene 
in that situation.  Now I do not know whether this is a situation 
where the Minister of Police has no power to intervene if the 
National Commissioner of Police will not assist or and so on.  So 
– but I thought that certainly if the Minister of Police needs 
documents that are classified it should not be a problem. 
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Actually it is a problem.  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a problem even for him? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Because he – as I understand the 
workings of intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 14 of 27 
 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Sometimes include the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  And they have a different line of 
reporting to I think standing committee or Parliament or the 
Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  As well as the officer of Intelligence.  
There is a – there are different lines it is not as straight forward as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would be quite strange to me particularly with 
regard to documents read that relate to allegations of misconduct within 
10 
Crime Intelligence which I understand falls within the SAPS which 
would be under the Minister of Police.  It might be different if one was 
talking about other intelligence bodies that fall under maybe another 
Minister so it would be strange if even the Minister can be bypassed in 
terms of important information.  But you say your understanding is that 
sometimes that does happen? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  It does happen yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  As a matter of fact the Minister does 
not even appoint the National Commissioner as we know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  No, no I do not necessarily know that.  Okay so 
– but – but certainly – well I do not know whether you – I mean I can 
say this arising from Colonel Roelofse’s evidence I am very determined 
that 
the 
commission 
must 
get 
a 
decision 
from 
the 
National 
Commissioner whether he will or will not declassify the information and 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 15 of 27 
 
if he will not what the reasons are.  From what I have been told it is 
difficult to understand that there are proper grounds for any refusal or 
unpreparedness to declassify some of the documents.  But I have only 
heard one side of the story.  I have not heard the National Police 
Commissioner side.  But when he is given a chance to say are you 
prepared to declassify or not he will get a chance.  If he says no I am 
not prepared to then give his reasons.  And then we can – we can take 
it from there.  But from what has been explained to me so far on the 
face of it it just does appear that documents which are important for 
investigations into crimes; into corruption are not being declassified for 
10 
reasons that have never even been told to Colonel Roelofse on his 
version to say we know you have been asking that we declassify these 
documents; we are not prepared to do so and here are our reasons.  
That we do not know.  So that is the position as far as the commission 
is concerned.  It is going to want to have a decision by the National 
Commissioner of Police on that.  Now what I do not know is whether the 
Minister of Police was also seeking the assistance of the commission in 
that regard or whether you are simply saying you and he are going to 
look at the situation and see what avenues are available to get 
documents that you need in order for him to respond to these 
20 
allegations that you need to be declassified.   
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  My first – our first prize as legal 
representatives for the Minister is for the matter to be adjourned to a 
later date than Thursday.  Because it is – for he simply reason that the 
Minister at the present moment is out of the country; he is in China and 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 16 of 27 
 
we will not be having time to consult with him on the matters which you 
have raised such as what you have raised.  We only have matters which 
we have consulted with him up until the last time we prepared the 
affidavit.  Now this these matters have been – have arisen as a result 
of your comments Chairperson we may have to consult with him further 
on that – in that regard.  And we are unable to do so between now and 
Friday when he comes back from China or Sunday.  Our first prize 
would have been to have the matter adjourned to a later date to allow 
for that process to take place and for us to be able to prepare affidavit 
in the spirit or in the atmosphere of calm rather than hysteria because 
10 
if we have to do so between now and Thursday it would be a rush job 
rather than a thorough job.  So that is our prize.  But if we are 
compelled to for reasons of expediency to do – come on Thursday we 
are not familiar with the territory of burning the midnight oil we will do 
in our powers to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I think what – I think for purposes of 
Thursday I do not see you needing to file any affidavit because you 
have filed your response and it is just for the legal team to obtain an 
affidavit from Colonel Naidoo to respond and then we can deal with the 
in camera application.  As far as any application you might wish to 
20 
bring for Leave to Cross-examine that you can bring even later. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can bring that even later even if Colonel Naidoo 
has to be brought back some other time so that if Leave to Cross-
examine is granted.  So that can be dealt with later.  Would that be 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 17 of 27 
 
fine? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  That would be fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELLA:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I do not think Mr Baloyi you should have 
anything to say.   
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Thank you Chair.  Chair my initial 
instructions and up until we received the draft order was to concede to 
Part A and C not Part B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  And it may be necessary for us to just file a 
short affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Outlining why we are opposing this stance 
that has been adopted by the applicant now Chair.  So I will discuss 
with the evidence leader.  It will not be a long affidavit it will just only 
outline the basis why we are opposing what we see as Part B of that 
application Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My – my concern about you now wishing to file an 
affidavit is the possibility that the – your affidavit could complicate 
20 
matters and somebody needing to reply and then it delays us.  You 
have not filed it up to now.  We already have to postpone now because 
the Minister of Police affidavit was late and we postponed to – we are 
going to postpone to Thursday morning.  Tomorrow is a public holiday.  
You might say it will be short but we do not know.  One or other party 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 18 of 27 
 
might decide well it is short but it needs to be responded to.  So it 
could cause problems.  So you might wish to – to just reflect whether 
you really need to file an affidavit or it is matters that you can deal with 
the way you had intended to deal with them today? 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Chair I – I will reflect on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  We – I will take instructions but I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  I believe that it could be prudent to 
perhaps… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Come and make submissions/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Because if it is not serious issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  It is just technical issues about the 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Thank you very much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  The application brought by Colonel 
20 
Naidoo for an order in effect granting or directing that his evidence be 
heard in camera is postponed to Thursday this week at half past nine to 
enable the commission’s legal team to obtain an affidavit from him that 
will deal with certain matters that have been raised in the opposing 
affidavit of the Minister of Police.  So this matter will be heard on 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 19 of 27 
 
Thursday nine thirty.  But before we adjourn I am going to read for the 
benefit of the public an order that I issued last week in regard – on the 
17 September in regard to this particular witness Colonel Naidoo and 
after that I would like to be updated on arrangements that may have 
been made between the legal team and – and other legal teams 
representing other persons in regard to the evidence of the witness who 
was supposed to give evidence today after this application and 
thereafter we will adjourn.  Let me now read the order that I made just 
so that the media and the public and everybody is fully informed of the 
order that I made which continues to be operational.  That order read 
10 
as follows:  The heading is “Order by the Chairperson of the 
Commission in terms of Section 18 of The Witness Protection Act 112 of 
1998 and it reads: 
“It is hereby ordered that  
1. In respect of the person referred to as Colonel 
Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo in the evidence of Mr 
Kobus Demeyer Roelofse before the commission to 
day which is still continuing and who is scheduled to 
testify before the commission in due course and is a 
protected 
person 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Witness 
20 
Protection Act 112 of 1998 [The Act]. 
1.1 No person may publish any information including 
an 
drawing, 
picture, 
illustration, 
painting, 
photograph, whether produced through or by 
means of computer software on a screen or a 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 20 of 27 
 
computer printout as contemplated in the Films 
and Publications Act 1996 or not pamphlet, 
poster or other printed matter which may 
disclose. 
a. The place of safety or location where Colonel 
Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo is or has been under 
protection.  Or where he has been relocated in 
terms of the act. 
b. The circumstances relating to his protection.   
c. The identity of any other protected person and 
10 
the place of safety or location where such person 
is being protected. 
d. Colonel Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo’s relocation 
or change of identity. 
In effect the order is that nobody may publish anything 
may disclose the identity of this witness or where he is 
located or those who are protected persons connected with 
him.” 
So that order continues to apply.  And then Mr Petersen are you able to 
update me with regard to Mr Sesoko? 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  No personally Chair may I hand over to 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Advocate Wentzel for that purpose? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  Chairperson as the other evidence leader 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 21 of 27 
 
addressed the other matters might I and Magena and those 
representing the Minister be excused? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you are excused.  Thank you. 
ADV KGANGELO BALOYI:  As Durban is still waiting for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, you are excused.  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair unfortunately – Chair unfortunately due 
to – it seems a misunderstanding Mr Sesoko was informed today that 
he would not be required to give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He was informed that he would not be 
10 
required to give evidence because of the change in schedule.  He has 
apparently taken leave and is intending to attend a church conference 
for the rest of this week.  So because the – the time is now going to be 
limited I would propose that we call Mr Khuba on Wednesday and allow 
Mr Naidoo to testify Thursday and Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is totally unacceptable.  This is totally 
unacceptable.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I can try and get hold of him and 
explain to him that if he can come for on Wednesday we will do 
everything we can to make sure he comes on Wednesday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is unacceptable. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know.  See what you are going to do but 
it is really unacceptable.  If anybody has been scheduled to appear 
before the commission nobody has a right to release that person except 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 22 of 27 
 
myself.  I have not released him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it might not be his fault. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be a problem between the investigators and 
the legal team. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the legal team should take responsibility for that 
because they are the ones who should make sure that witnesses know 
exactly what the position is. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I understand that Chair.  Unfortunately I 
just was not here last week and so I was not informed what was 
happening until Saturday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are going to adjourn for the day and we will 
continue on Wednesday.  We will see which witness is available but it 
is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I think counsel for Mr – Mr 
Abrahams might wish to say something? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes he does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do you wish to say something? 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Good afternoon Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes good afternoon. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:    Just for the record I need to 
place myself on record.  My name I Mthetheleli Phillip Mhlatsi from the 
Bridge Group in Sandton.  Chairperson I deem it prudent perhaps at 
this stage to register a disquiet. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 23 of 27 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Insofar as notification or 
communication with the legal representatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  We received a Rule 3.3 
Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  On the 10 t h September. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Quarter to two. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  In fact this morning I entered 
appearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  On the supposition that the 
proceedings would have started at 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  There was no communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  And as you have already 
20 
remonstrated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  The legal team I do not want 
to take it further but there really has to be on record the fact that we 
prepare ourselves to enter and attend these proceedings and the least 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 24 of 27 
 
that we request from our colleagues is that we need to be informed on 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Because there are logistical 
challenges that we might also need to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  But I will take it – I will leave 
it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  But as matters stand we have 
10 
not been able to agree as to when are we then deferring the evidence 
leading of Mr Mathew Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Would want at least to be 
given ample time or proper timing as to exactly when will that be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  As matters stand there has 
not been any proper commitment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  From the legal team. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I am – it is quite clear that things have not 
happened the way they should happen.  You should have been informed 
quite some time back that today we – the commission would only 
commence at two o’clock because the decision that I would not be 
available in the morning was made some time back and the legal team 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 25 of 27 
 
would have known about it.  Maybe not everybody in the legal team 
knew but the information should have been shared with all relevant 
people particularly anybody who would be involved in today’s matters.  
And lawyers who were going to be here are supposed to have been 
informed so that they could come only in the afternoon.  So it is really 
regrettable that that was not done.  
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sure that somebody will offer an apology 
from the legal team.  To the extent that maybe it might be difficult to 
then get Mr Sesoko to be here on Wednesday when he was told he was 
10 
not needed here.  I mean Ms Wentzel will have to find out who exactly 
told him that and where did they get that information from.  Because I 
never said that he should be released.  Maybe logistically it might be 
difficult to get him to be here on Wednesday and – and it might be 
unfair to you in case you have got other commitments on Wednesday to 
force you to come back on Wednesday when already you were here 
today and nothing happened.  So I think maybe the best way is that I 
should say the legal team must seek to make such arrangements as can 
reasonably take care of your own situation as well.  Normally when it 
comes to – to the determination of dates for hearing we – we cannot 
20 
negotiate them with the lawyers for implicated persons because 
otherwise practically we just – we would not be able to work.  But you 
were here today expecting that Mr Sesoko would give evidence and that 
has not happened.  I think in that situation attempts must be made to 
try and accommodate your situation as an exception. 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 26 of 27 
 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Well – indeed so Chairperson.  
Well Chairperson we do not necessarily wish to be a hindrance to the 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  So perhaps my suggestion 
would be that a new notice is issued out because I am also mindful of 
the fact that there might be others that are implicated so a date of a 
Wednesday or a Thursday or Friday as my learned colleague has 
already indicated that Ms – Mr Sesoko is not available.  It might as well 
as be that it is going to be a date in the future not necessarily this 
10 
week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  On my part I am prepared to 
actually even just appraise my client and say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Look we are not continuing 
but we have additional time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  And I think the best way to 
proceed would be the new or the issuance of a new notice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there might not be to issue a new Rule 3.3 
Notice as such.  They will consider their position because if every 
implicated person did receive the Notice that the matter would be today 
and they were not here it might indicated that they do not – they have 
no intention of attending and that happens quite often.  But your – from 
23 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 169 
 
Page 27 of 27 
 
your side you – your client wanted you to attend and you are the one 
that really needs to know.  So – but I – they will consider their position 
and do the necessary. So I think there might need to be discussions 
between the two of you but if discussions do not bear fruit they need to 
do what they can do bearing in mind the fact today you had come all 
the way and the matter did not proceed.  But we appreciate your 
cooperation. 
ADV MTHETHELELI PHILLIP MHLATSI:  Thank you for your wisdom 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  We are going to then adjourn 
10 
until Wednesday morning.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
