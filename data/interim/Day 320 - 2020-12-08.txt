PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 08 DECEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Dr Ngubane.  Thank you.  
Are we ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are ready Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson this 
morning Dr Ngubane has come back to deal with certain 
10 
transaction matters at Eskom and I believe that he is ready 
to take the oath or affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay please administer I think it is the 
oath. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
DR NGUBANE:  Baldwin Sipho Ngubane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you consider the oath to be binding 
20 
on your conscience? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 4 of 187 
 
say, so help me God. 
DR NGUBANE:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for coming back Dr Ngubane. 
There is unfinished business. 
DR NGUBANE:  [African language]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just – just by way of 
background Chairperson whilst Dr Ngubane was here in the 
10 
previous appearances he testified on the suspension 
issues and we ended at the point where in Dr Ngubane’s 
affidavit he says that there was a serious vacuum as a 
result of the suspension of the executives.  And we have to 
see how you filled that vacuum Dr Ngubane and what 
happens thereafter as a result of that gap being filled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That light which is normally on it is…. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is – as a result it is darker. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody should attend to that.  I do not 
know what the story is with this one.  Ja okay.  If – if it 
causes problems then somebody must tell us.  Okay alright 
continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  And – and the filling 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 5 of 187 
 
of that vacuum will take us into the matters that we are 
focussing 
on 
this 
week 
Dr 
Ngubane 
which 
is 
the 
transactions in regard to the Tegeta matter in the main. 
 
And I will relate the facts and you – you could 
confirm or otherwise explain what happened in regard to 
that. 
 
By way of a starting point Chairperson we will refer 
to Dr Ngubane’s affidavit which is contained in Eskom 
Bundle 9[A].  Dr Ngubane I believe you have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  On – on my bundle there is no indication 
10 
that his affidavit was admitted last time.  Oh I do not know 
what your recollection is.  I would normally write Exhibit 
XYZ on if it was admitted.  So if we did not do it we should 
do it today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if we did do it then I must just 
correct this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mine is also not marked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is – let us do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I suspect that we did not admit it 
formerly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so I think we should get that out of 
the way first. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 6 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  Dr Ngubane Eskom… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page here – what page was it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja it is the first – is the first document 
in the file.  Let us go to page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 4. 
DR NGUBANE:  Oh yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 4 and we follow the black 
numbering.  The black numbering on the left hand corner – 
top left hand corner 
CHAIRPERSON:  The top. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  The top? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the black numbers on the top. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just turn the page – no go the other 
way. 
DR NGUBANE:  Oh alright yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but go back Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:  I have got it yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  He says he has got it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do not read yet all we need to confirm 
is you look at the affidavit on page 4 – affidavit of Baldwin 
Sipho Ngubane.  I think you are on the wrong page. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 7 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  I am at the four executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but I think you are on the wrong 
page.  I want you to go back.  Yes that is right, go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the first page of the affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of the affidavit. 
DR NGUBANE:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the affidavit runs from page 4 of 
the paginated bundle to page 54.  Can you give him some 
assistance? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on a second.  Go to page 54 black 
10 
numbers at the top left corner.   
DR NGUBANE:  Homan and Gilfillan? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja just assist. 
DR NGUBANE:  It might be a wrong file. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 54.  So page 54 that is the end of 
the affidavit Dr Ngubane and there is a signature there 
above the deponent.  You see that signature?  Is that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just switch on – ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is my signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That is your signature. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the affidavit is dated 4 August 
2020.  You confirm this to be your affidavit? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson I will beg leave to have it 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 8 of 187 
 
admitted as Exhibit U19.1. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
affidavit 
of 
Dr 
Baldwin 
Sipho 
Ngubane starting at page 4 is admitted as Exhibit U19.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then Dr Ngubane at 
page 22 of the affidavit. 
ADV MKHABELA:  Excuse me it is this channel, without 
me seeing Mr Seleka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think he forgot about you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please place yourself on record. 
10 
ADV MKHABELA:  The name is Mkhabela for Dr Ngubane.  
I just would like to add Mr Seleka would recall that there 
was a supplementary affidavit.  I have not had mention of it 
and I think for the sake of completeness that too must be 
placed on the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Mkhabela that is.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we already – do we already have the 
supplementary affidavit? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We do have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is an explanatory affidavit of Dr 
Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 9 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  But it is an explanation of that the 
guarantee did not come to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Obviously it will be important to 
know where it is in the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  My junior will find it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can continue in the meantime. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you can attend to that in due course. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dr Ngubane page 22 of your affidavit. 
DR NGUBANE:  Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  22. 
DR NGUBANE:  22? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  [00:09:19] to paragraph 6.1.   
DR NGUBANE:  Appointment of Mr Molefe. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct ja.  So paragraph 6.1 the 
appointment of – the appointment and early retirement of 
Mr Brian Molefe – paragraph 6.1 says: 
“After the suspension of the four executives 
including Mr Matona who was the C – the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 10 of 187 
 
GCEO there was serious vacuum in the 
leadership of Eskom.” 
You see that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that serious vacuum came as a 
result of the decision made by the board to suspend the 
four executives.  But we know that one Mr Koko who was 
the – one of the suspended executives does come back 
ultimately. 
DR NGUBANE:  Right. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the – in July 2015.  So Dr Ngubane 
let us sketch this background and I will come back to this 
appointment of Mr Molefe.  This board is appointed – the 
board of which you were a part is appointed on the 11 
December 2014 by Minister Lynne Brown.  Correct? 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The board has an induction on the 16 
January 2015. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And they are taken through the 
20 
operations of Eskom; what Eskom does and so on.  
Correct? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The board has a scheduled meeting on 
26 February 2015 that meeting gets to be cancelled on the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 11 of 187 
 
eve of the meeting date. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 8 March 2015 the board 
receives an email inviting the board to a special meeting 
the next day which is the 9 March 2015. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is at that special meeting that the 
board is told about an inquiry requested by the President.  
Mr Tsotsi relates that to you.  Correct? 
DR NGUBANE:  It is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the board said look we are new; we 
cannot 
make 
this 
huge 
decision 
let 
the 
Minister 
or 
shareholder representative come and address us. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Two days later the meeting with the 
Minster is scheduled the 11 March 2015. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From that meeting your write in your 
affidavit:  
“It became clear to us that the Minister 
20 
wanted the inquiry to be proceeded with 
and that the executives should step aside.” 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the stepping aside or suspension 
of the executives is executed on the same day.  They are 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 12 of 187 
 
suspended on the same day. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 19 March 2015 the board has a 
meeting and Mr Tsotsi is in trouble. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is a vote of no confidence which 
is ultimately acted upon in the meeting of 30 March 2015 
where Mr Tsotsi tenders his resignation. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The executives are suspended 11 
10 
March.  The following month on the 17 April 2015 Minister 
Brown makes a press – calls a press conference and she 
makes a public announcement that she has decided to 
second Mr Molefe to Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now you have said in your affidavit 
page 23 paragraph 6.3 and this is dealing with how the 
secondment of Mr Molefe came about.  You say: 
“Whilst the search for a new GCEO was 
underway the Minister suggested that we 
20 
consider Mr Brian Molefe.  The board was 
amenable 
to 
the 
Minister ’s 
suggestion 
because we knew of Mr Molefe’s track 
record based on his work at the Public 
Investment Commissioners and Transnet.  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 13 of 187 
 
The board felt that Eskom was in dire 
straits 
and 
needed 
someone 
with 
Mr 
Molefe’s 
skills 
and 
experience. 
 
The 
Minister 
suggested 
that 
the 
board 
approaches Transnet to request for Mr 
Molefe’s release to Eskom.” 
And then you say: 
“I wrote to the Chairperson of Transnet.” 
Now the Minister has put it slightly differently.  In her 
affidavit she says that:  
10 
“The Transnet and Eskom boards negotiated 
discreetly the transfer of Mr Brian Molefe 
and Mr Anoj Singh to Eskom.  My role as 
the 
shareholder 
representative 
was 
to 
approve the negotiated outcomes.  If I 
remember correctly from 2016 Eskom’s MOI 
required me to be noted as a party to the 
appointment of CEO.  I also seem to recall 
that there was a very – a query about the 
legality 
of 
the 
transfers 
and 
leave 
an 
20 
opinion.” 
The emphasis is on her saying it was the two boards that 
discreetly negotiated the appointment or secondment of the 
two.  I only came into the picture to approve the negotiated 
outcomes.  What is your comment on that? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 14 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well we approached the Minister as I say 
– as I have stated Chairperson to present our problem in 
terms of leadership of the organisation.  And she said 
Brian Molefe would help Eskom and we were very happy 
with this because in our minds Brian Molefe had done a 
good job.  PIC, Transnet and so on.  But also at the press 
conference she said the secondment of Mr Molefe was 
discussed with the Deputy President and President Zuma.  
Quite clearly Chairperson this was a very big decision 
which 
could 
not 
have 
been 
undertaken 
just 
by 
the 
10 
chairpersons or the boards of the two organisations.  There 
had to be a higher authority to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So prior to the decision because 
we dealing with the – the pretext to the decision.  The 
Minister says you negotiated the two boards discreetly.  
You are saying well the board – who approached the 
Minister? 
DR NGUBANE:  We did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When you say we who are you referring 
to? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  The PNG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  PNG? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the People and Governance 
Committee of the board of Eskom. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 15 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and I guess doing so on behalf of the 
board. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But the important point is do you go to 
the Minister with a name in mind or is it the Minister who 
suggests the name? 
DR NGUBANE:  No we wanted a secondment of a senior 
official either in government or in one of the SOE’s and 
10 
then she came up with the name of Mr Molefe. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the Minister is the one who 
suggested it as you say in your affidavit. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you – you were looking at 
getting somebody who would be – would take the position 
of Group CEO at Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:  A secondment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a – but you wanted a secondment. 
DR NGUBANE:  For the – while we were busy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh looking. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So somebody would act? 
DR NGUBANE:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Okay, no, no then I 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 16 of 187 
 
understand.  So – and you were saying well it could be 
somebody in one or other government department or one of 
the SOE’s. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at that stage as a committee you did 
not have any particular name yourselves. 
DR NGUBANE:  No we did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  And the Minister 
suggested Mr Brian Molefe. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  And she also suggested that we write the 
board of Transnet. So I wrote to the Chairperson of 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Do you recall around 
about when it was that the PNG Committee approached the 
Minister.  Mr Seleka sketched out the background.  The 
suspensions were on the 11 t h March 2015.  Mr Tsotsi 
resigned on the 30 t h I think of March 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Minister announced the secondment 
of Mr Brian Molefe on the 17 April.  In other words two 
weeks after Mr Khoza, Mr Zola Tsotsi had resigned.  Do 
you have a recollection of when it might have been that the 
PNG Committee met with the Minister? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 17 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  I am not too sure. am not too sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you think it would have been 
before the end of March? 
DR NGUBANE:  It should have been around there because 
the annual report and financial statements were totally 
disappointing.  I mean the auditors that put an emphasis of 
matter in their report which meant Eskom was not a going 
concern.  And also the debt – I mean the previous CEO Mr 
Matona had written or informed the Minister that they 
would not be able to pay salaries from January 2015. So it 
10 
was a very tumultuous situation that we were getting in. So 
we decided that we must ask for a senior experienced 
person to act while we look for a GCEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But should there been around end 
March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around end of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Somewhere yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or so beginning of April. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes Dr Ngubane that 
incidentally seems to coincide with what the then acting 
DG says in her affidavit which I provided you with Ms 
Matsietsi Mokholo.  She says in her affidavit that: 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 18 of 187 
 
“It was somewhere between March 2015 
and 
April 
2015 
that 
she 
was 
again 
requested to accompany the Minister to a 
meeting at Eskom.”   
Now the first meeting is the 11 March meeting where the 
Minister went to meet with the board in that special 
meeting to discuss the inquiry and the stepping aside of 
the executives.  Now this is the second time around she is 
called to Eskom.  And she said: 
“The meeting took place at the Chairman’s 
10 
office at Eskom and included the acting 
chairperson Mr Ben Ngubane – I mean Dr 
Ben Ngubane and the acting CE Zethembe 
Khoza. Also the chairperson of the Transnet 
board Ms Linda Mabaso.  She was – I was 
also present.” 
She goes on to say. 
“With Minister Brown.  It must be noted that 
no minutes were taken during this meeting 
it was just a verbal discussion pertaining to 
20 
the secondment of Mr Brian Molefe from 
Transnet 
to 
Eskom 
which 
topic 
of 
discussion was introduced.” 
And she says: 
“By the acting Chairperson Dr Ngubane.” 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 19 of 187 
 
Let me just stop there and hear your comment on that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well – we were almost at the end of the 
process when that meeting happened.  I had written the 
Transnet board.  They have agreed.  So we were just 
crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s at that meeting.  It was 
not the original start of the request.  Now of course being 
chairman because it was in my office I introduced the 
subject as being the secondment of Mr Molefe.  Not that I 
was initiating that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – when the – when the PNG 
10 
Committee approached the Minister as you said earlier on 
was that approach by way of a meeting or was it a letter 
written on behalf of the committee to the Minister? 
DR NGUBANE:  We discussed the issue to request the 
Minister but then when I met the Minister I am not sure 
whether I was with Ms Venete Klein or with Mr Zethemba 
Khoza but we had to put this request to the Minister 
directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so there was a discussion of the 
issue within the PNG Committee first. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right and then the PNG Committee 
decided that the Minster should be approached. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was not the whole committee. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 20 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That met with the Minister.  It was 
yourself and one other member either Mr Zethembe Khoza 
or Ms Klein? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then on that occasion did the two of 
you meet with the Minister as such on that occasion? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that is where she put – came 
up with the name of Mr Brian Molefe? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your – you cannot remember the 
date but you think that meeting would have been where 
about in terms of dates?  Sometime during March or 
sometime during April? 
DR NGUBANE:  I think it was sometime during March 
towards probably the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So of the two 
meetings Dr Ngubane the PNG going meeting with the 
20 
Minister and this meeting of the two of – chairpersons of 
the board – one of Transnet the other of Eskom with Mr 
Zethemba Khoza which of the two meetings came first? 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which of the meeting took place first? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 21 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well the previous meetings as I say the 
meeting in my office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Was the last meeting 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So this was the last meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Ms Mokholo goes on in her 
affidavit to say that”  
“Mr 
Molefe 
was 
touted 
by 
the 
Eskom 
chairperson that would be 
you in that 
10 
meeting as an ideal candidate for the acting 
CEO position albeit on a temporary basis 
while the board will be embarking on a 
selection and recruitment process.  The 
proposal 
was 
supported 
by 
Transnet 
Chairperson.  Both chairpersons agreed 
that Mr Molefe was a perfect [00:27:26].” 
So she seems to paint a picture that the name of Mr Brian 
Molefe came from your side. 
DR NGUBANE:  No Chairperson.  As I said that was the 
20 
almost final meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  Leading to Mr Molefe’s secondment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Now we had discussed the issue of 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 22 of 187 
 
Molefe’s abilities prior to this stage.  So I was merely 
introducing the subject saying to the Minister and the DG 
we have agreed as the two boards to this proposal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are not saying that you did not 
bring up Mr Brian Molefe’s name in that meeting but what 
you are saying is bringing it up did not mean that the name 
was coming from you.  You were bringing it up because it 
had been brought up already. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say it had been brought up by 
the Minister much earlier.  So you were just saying here is 
a name that has been mentioned. That is what – is that 
what your – what you are saying? 
DR NGUBANE:  Certainly Chairperson the necessary 
processes like writing the letter – exchange of letters it 
had already taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Do we by any chance have a 
copy of that letter in the bundle?  I do not seem to have 
seen it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it the one … 
DR NGUBANE:  I struggled to find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could not find it? 
DR NGUBANE:  I could not find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 23 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Is that – you saying – 
it is your letter to the Chairperson of Transnet? 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
Yes 
and 
the 
response 
from 
the 
Chairperson of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Chair 
we 
will 
check 
with 
the 
investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Dr Ngubane this is either a 
10 
coincidence or an orchestration.  Because the Chair – the 
Commission has heard the evidence of one Mr Hank 
Bester. 
DR NGUBANE:  Mr? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Hank Bester.  He is not from Eskom.  
These are independent – a person belonging to some 
company.  He says to the Commission – he testified in the 
Transnet work stream and says to the Commission that way 
back in or about April 2014 when the company he was 
employed 
by 
seeking 
to 
conclude 
a 
transaction 
with 
20 
Transnet.  They are called to the meeting, firstly with Mr Anoj 
Singh, who is still with Transnet at the time, 2014, April 
2014. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This meeting takes place at Melrose 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 24 of 187 
 
Arch.  Present in that meeting is Mr Salim Essa, who is the 
dominant figure, who does most of the talking.   
 
And Mr Salim Essa is pressing on him that you will take 
the particular company as your Supply Development partner 
which is a company of Mr Salim Essa.   
 
And this is how we will increase the figures in the 
contract, in the transaction that will rise to this level.  And he 
thinks this is ridiculous.  You cannot reach those figures in 
this transaction.  I know the budget.   
 
That meeting is followed by another meeting shortly 
10 
after that where Mr Henk Bester to called to, again, Melrose 
Arch.  And this time around, they meet at JB’s Corner.  You 
are familiar with that restaurant? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a yes Dr Ngubane? 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
Well, 
Chairperson 
I 
think 
every 
Johannesburger knows JB’s Corner.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  So I must be the only one who 
does not know it.  [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I do not know that.  [laughs]   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughs]  Yes, h’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Mkhabela might know it.  I do not 
know this place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think Mr Mkhabela knows it.  
[laughs]   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 25 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   You must introduce him to good company. 
[laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the second meeting, Mr Anoj is not 
there but Mr Salim Essa is there and he is pushing the same 
proposition to include Mr Salim Essa’s company as a Supply 
Development partner in the transaction.   
 
And Mr Henk Bester says, as Mr Salim Essa is talking, 
10 
he also says to him that:  To show you how powerful we are.  
He says, they - (Mr Salim Essa), we have already decided 
that the new boss of Eskom will be Brian Molefe.  Now this is 
way back in April 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must double check Mr Seleka.  My 
recollection is that Mr Bester said that meeting where 
Mr Salim Essa said that was some time in October 2014.   
 
So just double check.  I may be mistaken but I seem to 
think I particularly ask him when it would have been.  
Obviously, because it is important to see where it links with 
20 
what happened in Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you are correct, we will check 
...[intervenes]  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 26 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because there was some time, I think, in 
2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether it was April or October.  I seem to 
remember it as October. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Salim Essa in order to try and convince 
Mr Bester that he or they, whoever they were, up with 
powerful people and therefore he must seriously consider 
taking his company as a Supply Development partner for the 
10 
job his company was going to get at Transnet.   
 
Says the next boss of Transnet is going to be Brian 
Molefe.  And of course, if that meeting happened in October, 
as I think Mr Bester says it did, seven months later Mr Brian 
Molefe 
is 
seconded 
to 
Eskom 
after 
the 
Group 
CEO, 
Mr Matona and other executives had been suspended under 
certain circumstances.   
 
I think Mr Seleka’s point or proposition he is putting to 
you is.  How come there is somebody outside of Eskom who 
speaks like this to a particular party who has got nothing to 
20 
do with Eskom in 2014 and indeed what he says is what 
actually happens.  I am going ahead of him now.  He will tell 
me if that is not what he was saying.   
 
I think he is saying.  It just seems that this whole thing 
was being driven by people from outside and Mr Salim Essa 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 27 of 187 
 
seems to have been at the centre of this.   
 
You will remember that there is evidence saying to the 
effect that on the 10t h of March, one day before the board 
was told that there was a need of suspensions or the 
suspensions 
of 
executives, that he 
was 
meeting 
with 
Mr Koko, and he and Mr Koko had a meeting with or met with 
Ms Daniels. 
 
And met with Mr Abram Masango where they told them in 
separate meetings that there would – certain executives 
would be suspended.   
10 
 
So Mr Seleka is saying.  What do you say to somebody 
who says but Mr Brian Molefe’s ultimate trip from Transnet to 
Eskom was long planned from outside if this evidence by 
Mr Bester is correct? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, this is a very, I mean, strange 
happening.  I do not think we have that many powerful 
prophets in this country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   I mean, when it came to the suspension of 
the executives, we were taken aback and we did not really 
20 
want to go with this until the shareholder indicated that it 
had to be done.   
 
So I will call it a random happening because in terms of 
our own actions, there was no plan.  We just – things just 
developed but there was no ...[intervenes]  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 28 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe there was no...  Maybe there was 
no plan within the board and when I say that, I am not saying 
it as a final thing, but maybe there was no plan within the 
board but certain people outside of Eskom may have had a 
plan and they may have had that plan way before you and 
the new board members got appointed to that board.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If the evidence that we heard from 
Mr Bester is true. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So far, nobody has challenged it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe somebody will challenge it but 
he was here to testify about matters of Transnet. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he, as far as I know, he did not – he 
would not have known much about Eskom except what he 
may have read in the newspapers or in the media, heard in 
the media.   
 
So as he gives evidence, he comes up with this idea 
20 
that, you know, Mr Salim Essa was pushing this idea that:  
My 
company 
must include 
his company as 
a Supply 
Development partner in this Transnet job.  And I did not want 
that.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 29 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was telling me how he would 
increase the price effectively for us to get a lot of money. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I was dismissive of this idea or his. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So as if to show me that I must take him 
seriously. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is powerful. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   He told me that he knows who the next 
boss of Eskom is going to be.  It is going to Brian Molefe. 
DR NGUBANE:   And they ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what he said.  Mr Bester said, 
when later we got to learn that Brian Molefe was Group CEO 
of Eskom, then he thought about that meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I am really surprised Chairperson.  
Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, there are other things 
Dr Ngubane relating to Mr Brian Molefe.  You may or you 
20 
may not have...  You may or you may not be aware that when 
Transnet was looking for a Group CEO after Ms Maria Ramos 
had resigned, it took quite a long time. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She resigned, I think, at the beginning of 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 30 of 187 
 
2009, it took quite a long time.  We will not go into issues 
but by end of October 2010, the position had not been filled.  
Ms Barbara Hogan who was Minister of Public Enterprises 
was dismissed.  Mr Gigaba succeeded her.   
 
And in December of 2010, the Gupta’s launched their 
newspaper, The New Age.  I do not know whether it was the 
first edition or – but in December, I think December – I do 
not know if it was December 10 or 8 or thereabout, they 
published a story which included a statement that Mr Brian 
Molefe was going to be the new Group CEO for Transnet.   
10 
 
This was at a time when Transnet had no Group CEO.  I 
think Mr Wells was acting.  And applications had been 
invited but Mr Molefe had not applied for that position.  But 
that is what The New Age said.   
 
And a few weeks later, I think in January, the Board of 
Transnet – members of the board were given a chance to 
nominate candidates for this position and I think Mr Shaman 
nominated Mr Brian Molefe and I think Mr Sharman is alleged 
to be a Gupta associate.   
 
He nominated Mr Brian Molefe.  And Mr Brian Molefe 
20 
ended up being Group CEO of Transnet, exactly as The New 
Age had said in December even before he applied or was 
nominated.   
 
And then now, you have a situation where Mr Bester tells 
us that in 2014, Mr Salim Essa told him that Mr Brian Molefe 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 31 of 187 
 
was going to be the new boss of Eskom and indeed Mr Brian 
Molefe did become the new boss of Eskom.   
 
But also, you have the meeting between Mr Jonas and 
somebody from the Gupta, who I think was Tony Gupta – it 
may have been Tony Gupta at the Gupta residence on the 
23rd of April 2015, at which, according to Mr Jonas, he was 
told by the Gupta brother who was there that Mr Brian Molefe 
was one of the people who were working with them and said 
something like his career is well-looked after or something 
like that.  That was in October 23(?).   
10 
 
And of course, I think there may be an argument that Mr 
Molefe, you know, went to Eskom, resigned and went to 
parliament and went back to Eskom.  There seems to be 
something quite special, maybe, about Eskom and him.  
[laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   So but I think, the main point Dr Ngubane 
is.  Here are these – some of these very strange features 
where somebody connected with the Guptas, whether it is 
The New Age or Mr Salim Essa, seemed to say what is going 
20 
to happen in Mr Brian Molefe’s life and SOE’s and it 
happened. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson my response to this 
would be.  If it was a mediocre person, an entity as it were, 
who started to be chairperson of the – or CEO of PIC, CEO 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 32 of 187 
 
of Transnet, CEO of Eskom.  I would say, definitely there is 
something amiss.   
 
However, you know, among black people, there are very, 
very, few people with the capabilities of Brian Molefe.  And 
this is a problem because when you fixate on those few at 
the top, there seem...   
 
Well, there was a saying when BEE came in, that the 
same scoundrels were getting all the tenders and all the BEE 
partnerships.   
 
Now in our society, there is a very limited amount of 
10 
people with real skill and capability.  So it can be easy to 
predict someone’s transgressions(?).   
 
I am not saying I was exceptionally gifted but I went to 
be...  When Mr Mandela ask me to be the Minister of Science 
and Technology in the first government of South Africa...  
KwaZulu-Natal was in trouble.   
 
Dr Buthelezi asked me to go back to KwaZulu-Natal to 
Premier for about one and a half years.  President Mbeki 
asked 
me 
back 
to 
National 
Ministry 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology.   
20 
 
One night he called me to his house and he said then, 
the Japanese have said they need an ambassador who 
understands technology.  Say, I want you to go to Tokyo as 
ambassador.   
 
I come back from there.  One morning, around seven, I 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 33 of 187 
 
get a phone call from Mr Pravin.  It was Minister Pravin, 
saying the cabinet has decided that you are going to be 
Chairman of SABC and you are also going to be Chairman of 
Lend(?) Bank.  These two organisations are in trouble.  We 
think you can help them.   
 
I say:  Pravin...  I mean, he was my friend.  We were 
together at Codesa.  I said:  Pravin, but this is madness.  
How can one person take two such organisations?  You 
know, what I am trying to say is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   ...you get to a situation where the same 
people circulate, you know, in different organisations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   So I am not, in a way, too surprised when I 
think about it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   That a person like Brian Molefe with his 
capability can be touted for all sorts of positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Well, the strange part, I would 
imagine you would concede, is in regard to Transnet, a 
20 
situation where that is said when there is a competitive 
process that is going to take place, is it not?   
 
In other words, you might be good but you do not know 
who else will apply.  And one would have thought that when 
there is a competitive process ...[intervenes]  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 34 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you would not be able to or to say so 
and so will.  Maybe if you already know who the other 
applicants are and you weigh them, that might be different, 
but when you do not know yet who will apply, it is strange, is 
it not, to be so sure that so and so will be, unless you have 
some information that other people do not have. 
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson let me remind you.  In our 
development as a new government was in 1994. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   There has been a very strong element of 
deployment of indicators(?).  So it may be competitive but 
when the elite, the governing party, knows someone they 
think can fulfil their objectives, they will make sure that 
person gets it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, one, to the extent that you 
have a competitive process and that is done, that might not 
be right because then the competition is not fair.  If you talk 
about your position that is not subject to competition 
...[intervenes]  
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...like being a minister, that is different, 
you, know.  But if there is going to be a competitive process, 
it is wrong for that process to be undermined like that.  
[laughs]  But I guess you are saying:  Well, it happens.  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 35 of 187 
 
Maybe...  [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I have been in politics.  You have 
been in the judiciary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So approaches are different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Our worlds are different.  [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I will not claim to know what you know 
from politics.  [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   [laughs]   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Dr Ngubane, we are 
going to come back to that because what I was saying to you 
that it is either a coincidence or an orchestration that what 
he said a year before becomes a reality a year later.  Is that 
a coincidence or an orchestration? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I think the Chairperson and myself 
have been discussing this very issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So it could be a coincidence but as I have 
20 
said people are earmarked for some type of jobs(?).  
[Speaker’s voice trails off – unclear]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   As far as you ...[intervenes]  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 36 of 187 
 
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear] 
DR NGUBANE:   ...give you the information and say from the 
cabinet ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...or from the people high up and 
downwards, they could very well predict Dr Ngubane from 
here will be there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but that – that means Salim Essa 
then will be part of the cabinet. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That means Salim Essa then will be part 
of the cabinet or has insight into what happens. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I am just giving you an example. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know you are just giving me an 
example. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But this is a factual example.  What I am 
giving to you is a factual example because the strange part 
of it is, that somebody outside of cabinet, outside of 
parliament, outside of SOE’s, outside of your meetings with 
20 
the minister has said a year before prophetically but we have 
decided that Mr Brian Molefe will be the chairperson.   
 
So that is what is strange about it.  If you and I are 
earmarked for a job by Lesley Nkabela, that is fine.  But if 
the minister’s advisor, as he introduced himself, Mr Salim 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 37 of 187 
 
Essa to Ms Suzanne Daniels... 
 
He is saying these things when he is not - a legal 
advisor to the minister, then it is a problem.  And that is what 
we are dealing with here. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
Ja. 
 
No, 
certainly 
that 
is 
wrong 
Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Chairperson, just quickly on the 
transcript of Mr Bester before the Commission here when 
asked questions by my colleague, Ngube.   
“And who did he say that person would be?” 
10 
 
Ja, let me first read Mr Bester’s response.   
“He did not go into the detail but he said to me I 
must worry about the detail or budget.   
I recall, for instance, he told me that they had 
already decided who is going to be the next CEO of 
Eskom. 
And I could clearly see when it happens that what 
the power is that they have and how they make 
decisions if I do not believe him.” 
 
Then he is asked by my colleague: 
20 
“And who did he say that person would be?” 
 
Mr Bester responds: 
“He said it is going to be decided that Mr Brian 
Molefe will be the CEO of Eskom.” 
 
And my colleague asks: 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 38 of 187 
 
“And this was all during that meeting?” 
 
And the response is: 
“That is correct.” 
“Okay now this ...[intervenes]” 
And then the Chairperson comes in. 
“I am sorry.  This would have been after April 2014, 
you said.  Did you say this meeting would have 
taken place after April 2014 Mr Bester?” 
 
And he says: 
“That is correct.  Yes” 
10 
 
So that Chair would have then been asked about April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just checked.  I think I may have asked 
how long after April 2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes.  But then, it is still 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But we can check.  You do not have to 
check everything ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for purposes of Dr Ngubane’s evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we will do that ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   For any purposes.  It does not matter 
whether it was April or October. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that Dr Ngubane then – he accounts 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 39 of 187 
 
for Mr Brian Molefe.  The announcement is made on the 
17t h of April and you mentioned the minister says you have 
met with the president and so on.  She later had to correct 
that and ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, Chair.  I got a bit of a sinusitis.  My 
ears are blocked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Ja, please raise your voice. 
DR NGUBANE:   I was driving up here from KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please raise your voice Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the minister makes the 
announcement on the 17t h of April 2015 regarding the 
appointment of Mr Molefe.   
 
And as you mentioned, she had said in that meeting that 
she had met with the relevant stakeholders being the 
president and deputy-president but she also included the 
boards of Transnet and Eskom.   
 
Her statement which she later had to correct because by 
the time she made the announcement, she had not met with 
20 
the two boards.  She had only met with you and Ms Linda 
Mabaso.   
DR NGUBANE:   We were representing the two boards. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But you did correct but she did not 
meet with the boards.  She met with the two chairpersons. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 40 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So you go into the meeting of the 
23rd 
of 
April 
2015. 
 
The 
board 
meeting 
of 
the 
23rd of April 2015.  At least you as the acting chairperson of 
the board with the knowledge that Mr Molefe is coming.  He 
has been seconded to Eskom.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Maybe more than you because the 
announcement was publicly made.  So the entire board 
would know this.  Correct? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I think the secondment of Mr Molefe 
became public knowledge immediate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the board goes into this 
meeting knowing his coming because it is in the meeting of 
the 23rd of April 2015 that the board approves Mr Molefe’s 
secondment.  
DR NGUBANE:   Right, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So the resolution is, the secondment 
of Mr Brian Molefe from Transnet as interim Chief Executive 
for Eskom is approved with effect from 20 April 2015. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the approval.  The chairman of 
the board is authorised to sign any and all agreements and 
documents to give effect to the above resolution and the 
chairperson of the board is reflected as you, in fact, acting 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 41 of 187 
 
chairperson at the time.   
 
Then it comes this issue of Optimum which is the focus 
of our attention.  The issue of Optimum, I supposed the 
board would have known this, it comes way back from 2014 
before the board is appointed. 
DR NGUBANE:   It comes back from 2012? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Even way back from 2012.  But when 
Optimum 
goes 
into 
hardship, 
when 
its 
export 
market 
plummets, the export market which it used to subsidise its 
sale to Eskom, plummets.   
10 
 
Optimum falls into difficulties because it cannot sustain 
the price at which it was selling coal to Eskom.  The price is 
way below its operational costs.  Then it goes into hardship.  
This happens – it triggers negotiations in 2014 before your 
time. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, sorry.  Can I – before you get even 
more complicated ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   The issue with Optimum ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   From what I have read or what I have heard 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   There was a period when the export coal 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 42 of 187 
 
price was rocketing in dollars and every coal producer was 
trying to get into the international market.  That time 
Optimum Coal Mine was washing its coal, taking out the 
best for export and giving rubbish to Eskom.  Even that 
rubbish was below the coal supply agreement stipulated 
and this is where the issue of penalties starting coming in. 
 
So they are misrepresenting the issue that their 
hardship started when the export coal price collapsed.  
They have benefited billions at the expense of Eskom, 
while the coal price was up there.   
10 
 
So really, it is pathetic that big organisations like 
this, wealthy as they are, have totally abused us in South 
Africa to cream off all the wealth and take it overseas to 
their shareholders.  I think this was a very well felt 
sensitivity in Eskom that Glencoe and their subsidiaries 
were just interested in profit.   
Whether Eskom boilers burst or suffered damage 
because of the poor coal quality that was being burnt, they 
did not care and hence the hardening of attitudes and 
when we say Molefe told us later that Mr Glasenberg had 
20 
said to him from here because you are stiff-headed, I am 
going to stop supplying Hendrina and this load shedding 
will then become a national blackout.  We all felt it 
because it was real arrogance coming from a man from 
Switzerland coming to tell us how he wants us to bow to 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 43 of 187 
 
his demands to treble the price of coal from R150 to R513 
per time over night.  So I would beg this Commission to 
take some of this evidence with circumspection.  Thank 
you, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is very important, Dr Ngubane that 
you and Brian Molefe and whoever else was at Eskom at 
the time and was involved in these discussions, give us 
your full perspectives how you saw matters so that we 
have, you know, all perspectives.  So we want to hear your 
full perspectives of exactly what caused Eskom to make 
10 
certain decisions, what caused Eskom to adopt a certain 
attitude.  So it is very important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, Dr Ngubane, it is apparent to me 
that you are familiar with the issues, so let us free flow 
into them. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I am not familiar with all the issues, 
but 
I 
am 
talking 
about 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I will assistance with reference to 
documents where we need to. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then this matter of OCM, which 
Optimum Coal Mine, the evidence was led yesterday, 
comes from 20 – and I want to limit it to 2014 where there 
is a cooperation agreement between OCM and Eskom, 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 44 of 187 
 
there is a fourth addendum which is proposed in terms of 
the prices, increases to the supply of coal to Eskom and 
the intention is, as we understand it, all that negotiation. 
Process, the cooperation is done in order to achieve a new 
agreement on the 1 January 2015.  I do not know whether 
you are aware of that.  There is... 
DR NGUBANE:   [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It rings – you can recall.  Let us 
confirm it so that the Chairperson can hear you. 
DR NGUBANE:   Quite so, I do recall. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so it is just the board outlines 
because 
what 
is 
referred 
as 
Excops, 
the 
executive 
procurement committee had agreed on the addendum, they 
then referred it to the BTC for approval.  It comes to the 
BTC in the meeting of 13 or 15 April.  The BTC does not 
decide that matter, it refers it to the board. 
 
Then it comes to the board on the 23 April.  When 
it comes to the board, the board also does not decide it.  
The board decides instead to refer it to the new Acting 
CEO and maybe you could give the Chairperson some 
20 
insight into why did the board make that decision to refer 
this matter that comes way back, at least 2014, to a man 
who is completely new and he would be, what, about a 
week at Eskom and if you are seconding him effective from 
the 20 April, I do not know when does he start, you are 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 45 of 187 
 
making your decision three days about referring this matter 
to him.  Now what – give the Chairperson some insight into 
that decision. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson, I wish I had a video of 
Brian Molefe going to the most troubled power stations.  
He comes in there, staff is gathered, there is an open 
space, he jumps in there and starts jiving and singing.  
That was the man.  And then, one, two, three, all station 
masters are under pressure to produce because their own 
people are demanding efficiency, productivity.  That is how 
10 
we overcame load shedding.   
 
So the fact that he was new, the fact that the BTC 
was refusing to accept the proposal from Excops, which is 
the Exco procurement subcommittee, on an increase in 
price which again I think was about threefold.  They said 
they cannot deal with this, they will not accept it, they are 
bringing it to us and also we, of course, could not deal with 
this because this was a matter of negotiation but we all 
said let us leave it for the CEO.   
 
But, knowing Brian, he came in here boots and all 
20 
and started dealing with it and we were quite happy with 
the way he dealt with it because he was stopping 
exploitation of the people of this country. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Of course, by the time you made 
the decision, he had not gone to a power station, climbed 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 46 of 187 
 
on a platform to dance and jive. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not know anything on whether 
– how he would turn around the situation.  But, anyway, 
you have accelerated it, you say you were happy with the 
way he handled it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because what he did is, a year after 
the cooperation agreement had been concluded, it is 
concluded in May 2014, the parties have entered into an 
10 
agreement that they will negotiate in May of 2015.he 
terminates 
negotiations 
process, 
he 
terminates 
the 
cooperation agreement and he imposes – not impose, but 
he demands the payment of the penalties, the  R2.17 
billion penalties, which you have referred to. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you are saying the board was 
happy with the way he handled it.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now talking of the penalties, do you 
20 
know how the penalty issue was handled? , 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know how the penalty issue 
was handled?  
DR NGUBANE:   Oh, ja.  Well, not fully. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 47 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   But in terms of what I know, this penalty 
issue had originated from 2012.  By the time we came in as 
a board some parts of it because it was happening at 
different stages accumulating penalties for this period and 
so on.  By the time we came in, some parts of it, a big part 
of it was going to – in law they call it prescribe – and from 
what Brian reported, he had no choice but to make sure 
that he does not allow prescription, he does not allow OCM 
and Glencoe to get away with murder and that was the 
10 
approach that was taken, that we will not take your sad 
story of hardship when you are so wealthy, you tell us 
hardship, you tell us Glencoe from Switzerland is refusing 
to give you money every month to run the show.  I mean, 
that was all false.  
 
You know, they could use their reserves to support 
Optimum.  Optimum went into business rescue purely to 
avoid the issue of paying the penalty.  And even when 
arbitration was suggested they refused it.  So they must 
not come here, Chairperson, and be holy, holy and nice.  
20 
They are bad.  I will call them crooks, like many other 
international corporations when they come into Africa, they 
think we are there for the taking, the stupid Africans for the 
taking.  No, no, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 48 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, remembering the evidence 
that was given last year about these issues, one of the 
matters that was strange to me was this, that I think OCM’s 
complaint was that the price of coal that they were bound 
to, in terms of their agreement with Eskom, was a price 
that had been there for ages, it had not been revised.  But, 
of course, the question would be, but how did you sign an 
agreement that tied you to the same price for ages without 
putting in a clause that would ensure that it increased 
according to the inflation or whatever. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Or 
that 
made 
room 
or 
annual 
negotiations to take place to revise the price, but – so 
there was that particular aspect to say when they say look, 
this price that Eskom is enforcing is an old price, all we 
are asking is that let us talk and revise it and they are 
refusing.  Of course, to the extent that Eskom may have 
been refusing, it would have been usual its contractual 
rights. 
 
But the question also from their side, OCM’s side, 
20 
would be but how did you allow whoever signed on your 
behalf, signed this contract, to sign a contract that the 
price would be the same for 10 years or more?  Were they 
sleeping or what was – how could you have signed such a 
contract?  Nobody signs such a contract.  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 49 of 187 
 
 
So there was that aspect.  Of course, it did come 
across, I can say, maybe a little harsh on Eskom’s side 
when they – I think it was Mr Brian Molefe’s – we are not 
negotiating, go according to the contract, go according to 
the 
contract, 
but 
that 
may 
have 
been 
contractually 
permissible but it is important that we get the full 
perspective from Eskom’s side because you have now said, 
for example, they took the cream of the coal and sent it 
overseas and gave you coal that was below standard and 
that is why the penalties came in.  So it is important to 
10 
have all of that in the basket. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, on that note, Chairperson, Glencoe 
came in fairly late into mining in South Africa, Witbank.  
They bought a lot of mining assets.  I think at one stage 
they had about 14 in the coal basin area of Witbank.  They 
bought companies that had been corruptly given very long 
contracts in the apartheid era.  So what they were talking 
about itself was corruption in its own right. 
 
Now they come in because they realise that, you 
know, it is not giving them as much returns, they want 
20 
suddenly to up it, they do not want to pay the penalties.  
No, Sir.   
 
Pembani wanted to buy OCM, I mean there were 
three bidders for OCM.  One of them was Pembani, the 
other one was Tegeta.  I forget the third one.  Pembani 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 50 of 187 
 
came to Eskom to say raise the price then we buy OCM.  
Eskom said no, it will not be done.  So it was not just to 
OCM that Eskom was hard, it was hard even to the people, 
other people who wanted to buy OCM.  Eskom was 
insisting that unless you stick to the established coal 
supply agreement we are not interested in you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I suspect there is going to be a time 
when Mr Seleka will say but was it hard on Tegeta?  But let 
me leave [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think relating(?) to the next question. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Before you say it, Sir, Tegeta offered to 
pay R150 per ton after taking Optimum, so… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there are other matters, Dr 
Ngubane.  Let us take the tea break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tea break.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea break and Mr 
Seleka will raise other matters as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is twenty two minutes past, we will 
resume at twenty to twelve.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
DR NGUBANE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 51 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Dr Ngubane there is 
the issue of penalties and the issue of exploitation you 
referred to just before the adjournment.   I will come to the 
penalties in a moment, but let’s deal with the exploitation 
that you mentioned, surely I gather from your testimony 
that you did not want to deal with Glencore anymore, I 
mean 
I 
will 
be 
the 
last 
person 
myself 
to 
support 
exploitation of a foreign company, the exploitation of a 
local company by a  foreign company, I will be the last 
10 
person to do that, I wouldn’t encourage that situation, and 
so you are saying that to the Chairperson as well, that this 
is what you didn’t want as Eskom, the exploitation of 
Eskom by Glencore or OCM, right? 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson unfortunately issues arise 
here that force one to make certain observations, because 
of electricity at one stage was very low, the lowest in the 
world, that is why we got smelters like Alusav, iron, I mean 
steel and so on and a very strong mining sector, because 
our energy costs were low, but when it came to the coal 
20 
plus mines which were the main suppliers to Eskom Power 
Stations, reducing their production as a way of forcing 
Eskom to give them higher rates, and the cost of producing 
energy escalated and then the electricity tariff started 
going up like it is today.  We applied for a 16% increase in 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 52 of 187 
 
tariff in 2015, NERSA gave us only 8%.  We employed 
McKinsey to do DTC2 which is designed to cost two, before 
that we had business productivity programme, which was 
aimed, mainly, at cost saving, reducing costs.   
The DTC2 was aimed at finding a new tariff 
trajectory which will not require taxation of people in 
buying electricity rise to high but for Eskom to develop 
alternative 
ways 
of 
raising 
revenue. 
 
One 
of 
the 
programmes we had with the University of Stellenbosch 
and the University of Johannesburg was to produce our 
10 
own rooftop panels for solar energy, very advanced.  The 
first factory was going to be built in Soweto and then other 
factors were built elsewhere. The water heating solar 
energy was going to be provided to every home in an 
attempt to ensure equitable access to energy for everyone 
by keeping the tariff low but what’s happened now, we’re 
seeing an escalation in tariff, Eskom is not even making 
the same revenues that we used to make because we are 
paying IPP’s, lots and lots of money for very small amounts 
of megawatts of electricity, they are burning diesel at, 
20 
probably, R1billion a month because the IPP’s can’t 
provide – produce enough wattage or megawatts, sorry, of 
electricity so as was the case with Baseload when we had 
coal fire power stations.  So, what I’m getting to is, we had 
a vision for electricity accessibility in this country to 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 53 of 187 
 
benefit everybody.  They’ve decided to close down the coal 
fired power stations in favour of IPP’s, okay, we’re all 
concerned about climate change, but we are a developing 
country.  You can’t expect a poor person to pay a very high 
tariffs that renewable energy will demand, you can’t.  in 
other words, we’re going to cut-off from electrical supply 
and power, a huge percentage of the South African 
population, 75% probably, because people are unemployed, 
there’s no money, it’s only the ones that are going to afford 
electricity in the future with these high tariffs. 
10 
So, I’m getting back to the point that, you must look 
at the philosophy that we pursued and look at the present 
charges and claims against us.  As Koko said, history will 
absolve 
us 
because 
we 
cannot 
have 
growing 
industrialisation and at the present regime, in terms of 
electricity management and cost, so I just wanted to make 
that remark before we continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You undertook to me that you wouldn’t 
be long-winded. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I said, you undertook to me that you 
wouldn’t be long-winded in your answers. 
DR NGUBANE:   I be? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You wouldn’t be long-winded in your 
answers. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 54 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Oh, I’ll be short, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Laughter]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes so, I was saying Dr Ngubane that, 
clearly from what you’re explaining before the adjournment 
you didn’t want to continue dealing with the situation, you 
were being exploited by Optimum as Eskom, from your 
explanation before the adjournment. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you’re taking too long to think 
10 
about it, but if your decision on the 10 t h of December was 
opposite to that sentiment, I’m going to blame you and 
your Board. 
DR NGUBANE:   10 t h of December…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   10 t h of December, which decision on – 
which one is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The pre-payment decision. 
DR NGUBANE:   Pre-payment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   As far as I am concerned it’s been taken 
20 
totally out of context. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   If you read the motivation, you know, Ms 
Daniels came to my office in the afternoon just before I 
was going home and said, there’s an emergency now, we 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 55 of 187 
 
need to deem this as an emergency and an emergency in 
Eskom is 24 hours. Within 24 hours we must have a 
resolution passed by the Board.  I said, for what, she 
showed me the papers, R1.68billion pre-payment for coal 
to Optimum.  I said, IFC will have to deal with this first, 
she said, no they’ve already taken a resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so when is he meeting with you? 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When is this – her coming to your 
office that would be on the 9 t h…[intervenes]. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Before we put the Round Robin to the 
Board 
members, 
she 
came 
to 
the 
office 
with 
the 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the same day? 
DR NGUBANE:   On the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I had to approve that she starts the 
Round Robin. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   But the condition for any emergency is 
that the most senior officer on site must approve alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, sorry, but you say she also said 
to you IFC has already dealt with this…[intervenes]. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, yes so – in fact, I think I said that in 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 56 of 187 
 
my affidavit alright, and then she explained, we read the 
documents, there was an emergency, the putting of OCM 
into business rescue has created an emergency anything 
can happen if they go into liquidation, we might lose all our 
coal, we might – the workers may lose their jobs, DMR is 
committed on this, it’s the best approach is to pre-
purchase the coal. So, I read the documents and I said, 
well that’s fine then put it onto a Round Robin.  The terms 
of this resolution centred on the fact that if we pre-
purchase the coal we’ll lock in the coal supply for Eskom 
10 
for a year, 5.5billion tons of coal. So, whoever purchases 
or if it’s liquidated, whoever purchases OCM we have 
locked in our supply of coal, they cannot take the coal and 
walk away with it, say export it or do anything, they will 
still have to supply our coal.  That, essentially, was the 
logic of the pre-purchase. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, your decision was to buy directly 
from OCM? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words, you would say to 
OCM, you would determine how much coal you needed as 
Eskom for a year? 
 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 57 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And say to OCM we are paying you in 
advance for coal that will last us for a year. 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, if this succeeds it means 
Eskom would be guaranteed of coal for at least a year. 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would give you or Eskom an 
opportunity to see how to handle the situation beyond 12 
months. 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, OCM obviously had coal available. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, did you pre-pay them? 
DR NGUBANE:   OCM was in business rescue but they 
were going to come out of business rescue for the purpose 
of this transaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but did you pre-pay them? 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you pre-pay them? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   We prepaid them, but the conditions were 
very clear, the funding will not be a lump sum it will come 
in stages. We’ll reduce the inventory of our stockpile from 
54 days to 48 days. Now, the inventory working capital 
reduction is a university applied methodology because 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 58 of 187 
 
when you reduce inventory, that is the stockpile in our 
case, on rand of reduction in inventory results in one rand 
addition into operating cash…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Before you go into those details, Dr 
Ngubane, a pre-payment was never made to OCM. 
DR NGUBANE:   The pre-payment was for coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja but it was never made. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
Well, 
I’m 
talking 
about 
how 
we 
approached the resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but my question was, was the pre-
10 
payment made to OCM? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it was going to be made over time, it 
wasn’t going to be a lump sum payment.  I mean, it’s like, 
what Toyota would call just on time, you know you empty 
your bin of spare parts and then the computer sends the 
message to the supplier of the parts they deliver the parts, 
it was that same sort of approach. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but let’s clarify it because it 
needs to be clarified.  You said it’s been taken out of 
context and we need to contextualise it.  One is that, if 
20 
your pre-payment was meant to go to OCM owned by 
Glencore it goes contrary to the sentiment expressed by 
you, so strenuously before the adjournment, that you didn’t 
want to be exploited.  You took a decision that goes 
contrary to that sentiment. Contrary to the actions of Mr 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 59 of 187 
 
Molefe which you supported, terminating the agreement – 
corporation agreement with OCM terminating negotiations, 
that’s the one aspect, it goes contrary to all that. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, the issue with OCM was wanting R513 
per ton, instead of R150 we were going to buy it at the coal 
supplier agreement price. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By the way, the correct amount is R432 
per ton. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second point is this…[intervenes]. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, I hadn’t finished. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   So, it wasn’t part of the settlement 
negotiations with a second addendum or anything like that 
it was simply purchasing coal for a year because we 
needed the coal, without that coal Hendrina Power Station 
would go out of service.  Komati Power Station would go 
out of service, so it was a critical issue that we had a 
supply of coal for a year. As Chairperson said, well you 
make other arrangements so I don’t see where now, I’m 
20 
contradicting myself, sorry, you know.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that’s alright.  The second point is 
this, and I want to read it from the submission itself which 
is on page 281 of Eskom Bundle 18 Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 60 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 281…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall, Dr Ngubane, whose idea 
this pre-payment was, I know that you said Ms Daniels 
came to you with the paperwork or the submission, I’m not 
sure but did you get to know whether it was her idea or 
whether it was somebody else’s idea? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No Mr Matshela Koko had signed the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so you took it to be Mr Koko’s 
idea? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Also, there was also a letter from DMR 
which was also suggesting the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Can I just piggyback 
on the Chairperson’s questions because according to Ms 
Daniels – I will not lose focus of that point, according to 
Ms Daniels you were the one who called her on or about 
the 7 t h of December so…[intervenes]. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry I phoned her? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, she says in her affidavit you were 
20 
the one who telephoned her, on or about the 7 t h of 
December 2015, you said to her, 
“Suzanne, 
please 
assist 
Mr 
– 
there 
are 
two 
Executives, Mr Koko and Mr Anoj Singh in drafting a 
submission that would be submitted  to the Board”, 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 61 of 187 
 
 
She then set about to do that, gets the information 
from the two Executives in order to put together this 
document I’m about to refer you to. The document is then 
circulated to the Board members on the 8 t h of December, 
today five years ago but much later in the day, in the 
evening, it’s circulated to the Board members for a 
resolution by Round Robin, that’s how she tells the 
evidence, can you recall whether you called her? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I’m thoroughly disappointed with Ms 
Daniels, you know, I relied on this lady for everything at 
10 
Eskom, she was highly knowledgeable, I never initiated 
anything with – I didn’t even know about this project until 
she brought the documentation to me, you know.  So, I 
don’t know why she should try – what is she trying to do, I 
mean, I was hardly involved in primary energy issues which 
is coal, diesel…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But just understand, her evidence is 
that you called to say, the two Executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Let me go to the point I 
20 
wanted to make with you Dr Ngubane, then we’re on page 
281, page 281 paragraph 2.1…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just so that the record will be clear, 
that’s page 281 of Eskom Bundle 18? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18, correct Chairperson, thank you 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 62 of 187 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that Dr Ngubane?  
Paragraph 2 says, 
“Resolution required, then it says, it is hereby 
resolved that the request from the Department of 
Mineral Resources is hereby noted”, 
 
Now you know that, that request is the letter you’re 
talking about, Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That request is that letter from the 
DMR you were talking about. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you have paragraph 2.1.2,  
“The Group Chief Executive, together with the 
Group Executive for Generation and Chief Financial 
Officer are hereby authorised to negotiate and 
conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the 
proposed owners of OCM (coal supply)”, 
 
Now the proposed owners was Tegeta. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   At this stage no, I don’t think Tegeta was 
owning OCM and this stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the proposed owner. 
DR NGUBANE:   Oh, I see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, was Tegeta. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 63 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, explain this paragraph then or 
statement because that’s the required resolution.  You say 
the pre-purchase of coal was to buy it from OCM. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Directly. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, they still owned the mine, I mean, 
the mine was in business rescue, owned by Glencore. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s right. 
DR NGUBANE:   It hadn’t changed hands. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s right. 
DR NGUBANE:   Did it change hands? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, it hadn’t.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The point that Mr Seleka is making, Dr 
Ngubane is this, he says, in terms of the evidence that you 
have already given the pre-payment, according to you, was 
to be an arrangement or agreement between Eskom and 
OCM in order to secure coal for 12 months but he says, 
when you look at this clause here it authorises the Group 
Chief Executive for Generation and the Chief Financial 
20 
Officer not to negotiate with OCM for this deal to be made 
for a pre-payment but it authorises them to negotiate with 
people who are not owning the mine who are proposed 
owners.  So, he is saying, are you able to explain why the 
resolution 
said 
these 
three 
are 
authorised 
or 
were 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 64 of 187 
 
authorised to negotiate, not with OCM or with the rescue 
practitioners but with people who didn’t own the mine at 
the time but were proposed owners, that’s what he’d like 
you to deal with. 
DR NGUBANE:   Thank you for clarifying, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I think this comes from the fact that OCM 
had already stated that they were selling the mine.  They 
were taking OCM out of business rescue under Glencore.  
Eskom – I think I saw a letter to that effect and also that 
10 
two other bidders had fallen away and Tegeta was the only 
one remaining but what I was not understanding was, 
whether in fact he meant that we already knew that Tegeta 
had bought the mine, I don’t think so, but we knew that it 
was in the process of being bought, you know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so the statement here in the 
resolution, which was sought from the Board appears, on 
the face of it, to be inconsistent with the explanation that, 
in your understanding as the Board, you were dealing here, 
directly with OCM in regard to the pre-payment. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, as I said the whole thing is very 
complex but in my understanding the coal would come from 
OCM which was still running the mine, even the one who 
bought it, would be bound by that sale, that payment and 
so the coal, will, essentially, have been ceded to Eskom 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 65 of 187 
 
even before the sale, that was in that context, I was 
saying.  I wasn’t saying the money will be taken to the 
potential buyer in my understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the money will go to the supplier. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But even when it’s sold, we would be sure 
of coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I would have expected that the 
negotiations would be with the owners – the then owners of 
10 
the mine or those who represented the owners, maybe the 
business rescue practitioners, if they were any place at the 
time.  Precisely on the basis that you give that if such an 
agreement was concluded with the current owners or their 
representatives that agreement would bind those who 
bought the mine if it was sold.  So, if that approach is 
correct then it’s difficult to understand why the Board 
would authorise these three officials the CEO, Chief 
Financial Officer and the Group Executive for Generation 
to negotiate with people who are proposing to buy the mine 
20 
and not just negotiate, conclude a deal with them instead 
of the Board saying, negotiate and conclude a deal with 
the current owners of the mine because these proposed 
owners don’t own the mine yet so why should you negotiate 
with them and conclude a deal with them, you see, I think 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 66 of 187 
 
that’s where there are question marks, you understand? 
DR NGUBANE:   I do, I do Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and then the urgency of the 
matter, Dr Ngubane, because you see the DMR’s letter is 
put together on the 4 t h, the 4 t h of December 2015, it is 
signed by Mr Koko on the 6 t h, two days later, of December 
2015, he sent it to the DMR, he’s asking for the DMR’s 
assistance.  The type of assistance is not spelt out, there’s 
a response from the DMR which is undated but signed by 
10 
Dr Ramontja, so we don’t know, when exactly do you 
receive it but apparently it was part of the package that 
went to the Board. In that response letter mention is made 
of the R1.7billion liability that OCM might still have, it’s not 
clear what is this, until you read the affidavit of Dr 
Ramontja which he says – he explains it by reference to 
rehabilitation, Environmental Rehabilitation Fund.  Mention 
is made of a pre-payment and Eskom should actively assist 
in that, that is the letter from DMR.  Your meeting – it’s not 
even a meeting, I beg your pardon, the Round Robin, that 
20 
pack is circulated to the Board but before that we have 
gone through the draft of the submission yesterday, the 
draft 
is 
a 
submission 
to 
IFC, 
Investment 
Finance 
Committee, were you aware of that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I was aware in the sense that Ms 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 67 of 187 
 
Daniels told me that IFC had actually taken a decision on 
the emergency supply. 
ADV SELEKA SC: Ja, well this is how – from the 
documentation, the evidence unfolds.  A draft is prepared 
before it’s circulated on the 8 t h of December, today five 
years ago and it goes out of Eskom right, it goes to Mr Eric 
Wood and Mr Hower [?] and Businessman.  Businessman 
writes an email, he says he doesn’t want – there’s a 
requirement for PFMA approval, he doesn’t want that and 
number two, he says, this thing should not go to IFC, it 
10 
should go directly to the Board, were you aware of that? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, not at all. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that’s how this document changes 
from a submission to IFC to a submission to the Board. 
DR NGUBANE:   But that can’t be, Chairperson, in an 
emergency either BTC can decide or if not IFC can decide 
on amounts like this.  So, without a recommendation from, 
either BTC or IFC this Board Round Robin cannot happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s important, Dr Ngubane because 
it happened, and let me tell you how it happened. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Well then there is something very wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right.  So I will give you the facts. 
So it gets changed.  We went through the evidence 
yesterday. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 68 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From IFC – submission to IFC.  It is a 
submission to the board.  On the 8t h in the evening of the 8t h 
it is circulated to the board members to be decided upon by 
way of a Round Robin.  Right.  It was only when one of the 
board members approving the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually I do remember now yesterday that 
it was Businessman who said the – the resolution should not 
– the matter should not go to the Investments and Finance 
10 
Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should go straight to the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there is an email along those line I think 
Mr Seleka might read it to you from Businessman I think to 
Mr Koko and from Mr Koko to Ms Daniels if I am not 
mistaken. 
DR NGUBANE:  No I – I was not aware Chairperson of the 
background. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No it is one of those things that 
are strange because I said to Ms Daniels it looks again like 
somebody from outside Eskom is giving instructions to 
people inside Eskom when people inside Eskom think this 
matter should go to the Finance and Investment Committee 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 69 of 187 
 
he or she whoever he or she is says no, no, no you people 
take this to the board not to the Invest – Finance and 
Investment Committee.  And then that is what happens. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know they obey. 
DR NGUBANE:  And Businessman is not a DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Businessman is not the DG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  And – and he says you know in 
this submission I do not want this PFMA.. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take it out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The page reference to this is 453. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Bundle 18? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Assist Dr Ngubane to have – so that 
he can have – he can see what we are talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 453. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  453. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So he can see what was happening at 
Eskom while he was acting chairperson or chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  He was the chairperson at the time. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 70 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he was the chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Molefe. 
DR NGUBANE:  But this – this suggestion is totally invalid. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed.  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not be – it might not be a 
suggestion Dr Ngubane.  You see the language there – I 
want the PFMA approval part removed. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not I am suggesting. 
DR NGUBANE:  But then the person does not understand 
10 
actually how the Public Finance Management Act works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe he does not care about that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I was about to say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe he does not care about that.  
Maybe his attitude is you people do not tell me about PFMA 
– no and do not tell me about the – the Investment 
Committee this thing must go to the full board.  He says I 
also think it should be full board not IFC.  Ja.  Okay Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So – so then Dr 
20 
Ngubane so that is the evolution of this document.  It 
changes and changes and ultimately it goes to the board – 
this email is on the 7 December. 
DR NGUBANE:  Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The board receives the pack on the 8 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 71 of 187 
 
December according to the evidence led yesterday for a 
Round Robin.  So the board has not received a notice for a 
meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct 
DR NGUBANE:  You are right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is no agenda circulated a few 
weeks beforehand or two weeks beforehand. 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson that is the nature of an 
emergency.  Those processes are suspended. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – no I think that is a fair point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  I think – I think 32.10.34 are Procurement 
Procedure describes the emergency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Emergency. 
DR NGUBANE:  Procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  [Inaudible] 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is a point. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  No let me write that emergency 
down in big letters and I will come to it.  So the board then in 
the email from Ms Daniels is asked to decide on this by 12 
midday on the 9 December.  Well I do not know whether you 
recall that?  We can find the email to you from Ms Daniels. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 72 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well we do not need to Chairperson 
because … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  It would follow the – emergency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja that is right ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then as Verushni Naidoo on the same 
evening I think after nine she says I approve and mentions 
points there one of which is the matter should go to IFC.  
That is the evening of the 8t h.  And Ms Daniels says she 
10 
acted on that to call an IFC in the morning of the 9t h 
December.  An IFC started at nine o’clock meeting of IFC 
started at nine o’clock.  You – do you know that? 
DR NGUBANE:  No I do not know that because that actually 
invalidates that Round Robin completely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Yes you are right because you gave 
your approval to the submission. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 8:34 on the 9 December before IFC 
had its meeting. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well need I go any further there.  So this 
Round Robin is invalidated. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja Sir absolutely ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the emergency – can I come to the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 73 of 187 
 
emergency issue?  What was – what was the emergency 
here? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well if by putting Optimum Coal Mining into 
business rescue we were actually saying that it cannot trade 
anymore.  So if it was not trading there would be no coal 
supply to Hendrina and Komati Power Stations.  That was 
the essence of the emergency. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So that is how you understood it or 
that is how it was put to you? 
DR NGUBANE:  Essentially when she went with me – with – 
10 
through this document with me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  That was the understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well I appreciate you are not a 
lawyer but the business rescue practitioners when they take 
over as business rescue. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As he word says rescue – business 
rescue they are trying to rescue that business.  The business 
will trade that is why Tegeta is able to come and be the 
20 
middle man between you and OCM.  They get coal from OCM 
and supply to Eskom.  Because that business can still trade.  
It is trying to come out of the difficulties it finds itself in.  To 
be rescued.   
 
But let us – you understand it? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 74 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja.  But I – I – it is contrary to what I 
thought business rescue was about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because it is not liquidation. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are not being liquidated. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sure.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The business rescue comes with a plan 
how to rescue this business and they…he business rescue 
comes with a plan how to rescue this business and they.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are being helped to survive. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja alright.  You are being helped to 
survive. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you know what happened to the – 
your decision for pre-payment Dr Ngubane? By now you 
know by then I do not know whether did you know. 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It gets converted into a guarantee. 
DR NGUBANE:  No that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja it is … 
DR NGUBANE:  Is a mystery. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  it is a mystery? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 75 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja because it is not what the resolution was 
saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right.  So how did it happen 
because it happened the next day on the 10 December? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well again you see I cannot believe that Ms 
Daniels failed to inform the board.  Well it reached me as 
chairperson about this development. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But what do you say about the executives 
who converted it because she did not sign the guarantee 
somebody else signed it. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no I am just talking in terms of this has 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
Because 
she 
is 
the 
custodian 
of 
governance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
DR NGUBANE:  In the company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so she never told you this? 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no never did.  I only learnt about this 
somewhere in April as I was about to leave Eskom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  You know it came through the media.  
Otherwise there was never a submission to say this person 
signed an illegal order or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 76 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you know that the guarantee was in 
favour of Tegeta and not OCM. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well that is what I learnt. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So completely the antithesis to … 
DR NGUBANE:  No absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The resolution. 
DR NGUBANE:  Which undermined this whole thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It – it raises the question Dr Ngubane 
which I kind of said last time when you were here the 
10 
commission has to look at.  We have to remain open minded 
about various issues and conclude when all the evidence is 
in.  But I said in effect one cannot close one’s eyes to a 
certain line of thinking. 
DR NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is important to put it to people who 
were involved so that one hears what they have to say about 
it.  It raises the question of whether there were people 
outside of Eskom who may have been manipulating Eskom 
processes for their own agendas and that includes the issue 
20 
of the suspension of the executives.  So it raises that 
question whether there were people outside of Eskom who 
were manipulating Eskom processes in order to achieve or 
pursue their own goals.  I mean in regard to this we have 
just referred to the fact that here is Businessman sending an 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 77 of 187 
 
email saying take out the PFMA approval I do not want it.  I 
want it removed.  Do not send this thing to the IFC it must go 
to the full board.  We have just told you about Mr Henk 
Bester’s evidence that already in 2014 he says he was told 
by Mr Salim Essa the next boss of Eskom is Mr Brian Molefe 
and then of course you have the Transnet things but with 
regard to Eskom you then have the evidence of – from Abram 
Masonga and Ms Daniels which says before the board could 
know about this idea of suspensions because the board only 
got to know about that from the evidence that I have heard 
10 
on the morning of the 11 t h or on the 11t h March.  But before 
the board could discuss this already on the 10t h March the 
day before if Ms Daniels evidence is correct and if Mr 
Masonga’s evidence is correct Mr – Mr Salim Essa knew 
about it and knew the names of the executives who would be 
suspended and of course Mr Koko you know according to 
their evidence.  And if their evidence is correct Mr Koko 
denies that such a – those meetings happened.  But if I 
evaluate the evidence at the end and if I ultimately find that 
indeed those meetings did take place which involved Mr 
20 
Salim Essa and Mr Koko on the 10 March and that what was 
said included that the four executives would be suspended 
according to Mr Masonga he goes further he says, Mr Koko 
said that although he would be one of the executives to be 
suspended 
ultimately 
he 
would 
come 
back 
after 
the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 78 of 187 
 
suspension but the other three would not come back.  That is 
what Mr Masonga says.  Of course Mr – as I said Mr Koko 
denies that.  But if – if the – if it was true – if it were to be 
true that that meeting did take place and that is what was 
discussed then it would be difficult not to – to seriously 
consider whether there was not one or more people outside 
of Eskom who were manipulating either processes within 
Eskom or even manipulating some people within Eskom for 
their own purposes.  And it is important that all of us look at 
these issues and give our own input because if it did happen 
10 
it is not something that should happen – that should have 
happened. 
DR NGUBANE:  Agree Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Dr Ngubane it would seem that these 
executives were on the frolic of their own. 
DR NGUBANE:  That was? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That these executives were on a frolic of 
their own. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well quite clearly. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From this information here. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And let me tell you I do not know – he – I 
do not know whether you are aware when Mr Anoj Singh was 
at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee he explains the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 79 of 187 
 
rationale for the guarantee when asked about it in this way.  
He says he concluded – he issued that guarantee because 
Eskom could not obtain coal immediately from Tegeta. The 
agreement – the underlying agreement – that agreement was 
concluded between Eskom and Tegeta for the supply of coal 
which is your – to which your resolution relates a pre-
purchase of coal.  It was not concluded with OCM it was 
concluded as per that paragraph 2.1. 
DR NGUBANE:  But there is no mention of Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but the agreement was concluded 
10 
with Tegeta. 
DR NGUBANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course the resolution did not say they 
must negotiate and conclude a deal with OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The resolution of the board said they must 
negotiate – they should negotiate and conclude that the deal 
with the proposed owners of [00:17:45]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which they identified as Tegeta. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And ... 
DR NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson just to – well devil’s 
advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Obviously once the buyer takes over there 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 80 of 187 
 
would have to be negotiations about the coal supply 
agreement and the prices again and so on.  So negotiating 
with the new owner is inevitable because there will obviously 
be regulatory issues that need to be ironed out.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No, no I understand but based on the 
idea of an emergency the emergency if there was one. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dictated that the deal that needed to be 
concluded was with OCM. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there were to be any negotiations with 
the proposed buyers or owners that could come later. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was not urgent.  What was urgent was 
a deal with OCM. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course if the position was that if 
Eskom negotiated with OCM and concluded a deal that bill 
that deal would be binding on the buyers. There would be no 
need for other negotiations with the buyers.  But if it was not 
20 
going to be binding on the buyers then there may have been 
a need for negotiations.  You understand? 
DR NGUBANE:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So the agreement – 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 81 of 187 
 
now we are on the 10 December. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That agreement with Tegeta is concluded 
on the very day the 10 December but it has suspensive 
conditions. 
DR NGUBANE:  To buy coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja pre-purchase of coal. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So on page 719 of this bundle – Eskom 
Bundle 18. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  719? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  719.  And it is signed by Mr Anoj Singh 
on behalf of Eskom on page 722.  You see it on 719?  
Agreement regarding the pre-purchase of coal from – it says 
Optimum Coal. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that 
DR NGUBANE:  I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But see who signs on page 722.  Page 
722. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For Tegeta Exploration and Resources 10 
December 2015 [00:20:51].  And Mr Singh at the top.  There 
is two things I can go quickly to the one aspect.  So this 
agreement is then subject to suspensive conditions and Mr 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 82 of 187 
 
Singh says to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  I did 
this the guarantee because Eskom could not in terms of this 
agreement obtain coal immediately from Tegeta because of 
the suspensive conditions.  There crumbling the theory of an 
emergency.  Do you follow? 
DR NGUBANE:  I do but I mean probably the – the mistake 
was to say the resolution grants the right to negotiate and 
conclude.  Normally in many tender processes the mandate 
is given to the negotiating team to negotiate but not 
conclude.  This forces the issue to come back to the BTC 
10 
where – which have a board committee.  Here this we did not 
include that.  I think this is what led to this type of thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the mistake was on the part of what 
the board? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I mean it is now signed on behalf of the 
board a mandate which was not given directly like this.  It 
was just a mandate to negotiate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No it also said to conclude. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja to conclude yes but on the basis of what 
was before us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me ask this question.  At the time 
that this Round Robin Resolution was that – by the time that 
you considered it. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you aware that it was saying the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 83 of 187 
 
board was authorising the three officials Group Executive, 
Chief Executive, Group Executive for Generation and the 
CFO to negotiate and conclude a deal not with OCM but with 
the so called proposed owners of OCM.  Did you understand 
that at the time or were you under a different understanding 
that something you picked up later – or you heard about 
later? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I must say no that one beat me 
because I was thinking in terms of OCM and the – the 
business rescue people.  But clearly here... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  It gives them authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  To go outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Do you – do you – are you able to 
throw light on whether maybe other members of the board 
were under the same understanding as yourself maybe 
through discussion afterwards or do you not know whether 
other members of the board did understand it that this way 
and approved it like that? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I think on average most people would 
have thought what I did think that it was to buy pre-
purchased coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  From OCM. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 84 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr Ngubane then if go 
– that is the agreement – go to page 723. 
DR NGUBANE:  Of my… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  7 – yes of… 
DR NGUBANE:  This one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where we were looking at the agreement 
– Eskom Bundle 18. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  723. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  723.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now there Businessman again raises his 
head.  There is an email from Businessman to Mr Matshela 
Koko on the 10 December 2012 and there the subject is two-
pager and he deals with what should go into the construction 
of the guarantee.  Three pager between Tegeta and Eskom 
not OCM Tegeta and Eskom salient points Eskom will provide 
bank guarantee for R1.68 billion.  See piece we understand 
those are condition precedents for release is Section 11 
approval from DMR Competitions Commission approval and 
20 
then the rest of it.  That document gets to be forwarded to 
Ms Suzanne Daniels from Matshela2010@yahoo.com.  These 
conditions if you go to page 726 – 725, 26 it is an email on 
7:25 from Ms Daniels on the 10 December still to Mr 
Rishaban Moodley of CDH and she is asking for their 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 85 of 187 
 
assistance in drafting the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CDH I take it to Cliff Decker? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  CDH yes correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Cliff Decker Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She – that is what she testified 
yesterday.  And if you look at the document on page 726 
which she says was an annexure to that email it reproduces 
those points you saw in the email of Businessman on the 
10 
previous page which is the point the Chairperson has been 
emphasising that you see the strings being pulled on Eskom 
by somebody from outside of Eskom.  You see that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja.  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  That is the state capture that is 
being investigated.  I think I am done not to mention your 
emails between yourself and Businessman. 
DR NGUBANE:  With? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You and Businessman. 
DR NGUBANE:  Businessman? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That came in June 2016. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well it happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  It is water under the bridge. Chair 
that I think are the questions I had for Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well Dr Ngubane I want to hear 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 86 of 187 
 
whether having learnt what you have learnt, having read 
what you have read, having heard what you have heard 
about matters or things that were happening at Eskom at the 
time that you were Chairperson whether you do not see the 
possibility – you do not concede at least to the possibility 
that during your time at Eskom there may have been people 
outside of Eskom who were manipulating or who may have 
been manipulating processes within Eskom.  Maybe also 
manipulating or using people within Eskom for their own 
agendas and before you respond I go back to just giving you 
10 
the picture that emerges and I am not saying that that is 
what I believe to be the position but it is something I cannot 
ignore as I hear more and more evidence.  You have a 
situation where in 2010, December the New Age suggests.  
Maybe it is more than a suggestion.  [laughs]  That Mr Brian 
Molefe is going to be the new Transnet Group CEO.  He does 
become the new Transnet CEO.  You have...   
 
Of 
course, 
certain 
things 
happened 
at 
Transnet, 
transactions and allegations of irregularities while he is 
there.   
20 
 
And there, according to Mr Henk Bester, it was at some 
stage in 2014, Mr Salim Essa tells him, Mr Brian Molefe is 
going to be the new boss of Eskom.  And then you and your 
other members of the board are new at Eskom.   
 
And out of the blue, the news comes that there must be 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 87 of 187 
 
an inquiry.  Four executives must be suspended at the same 
time.   
 
When you hear about this, you are opposed to this and 
you want to hear from the shareholder minister.  She comes 
and she says what she said and after that, the board goes 
along.   
 
But the day before, namely the 10t h, now we hear that 
Mr Salim 
Essa 
was 
meeting 
with 
Mr 
Koko 
and 
with 
Ms Daniels and some other time on the same day with 
Mr Abraham Masango.   
10 
 
And saying to Ms Daniels:  What is the procedure that 
must be followed if you want to suspend an executive at 
Eskom?  According to Ms Daniels, that is what Mr Salim 
Essa asked, you know.   
 
And then Mr Masango has his version also in terms of 
what was said.  And then mister...  After the executives are 
gone, are suspended, indeed three do not come back.  Quite 
some money is then to – to let them go.  Mr Koko does come 
back.   
 
And in the meantime, I think about a month or so after 
20 
the suspensions of the executives, Mr Brian Molefe comes.  
Is seconded to Eskom.   
 
And then, of course, on this evidence and Mr Koko is 
still going to come to put his side of the story on some of the 
things about this email and so on.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 88 of 187 
 
 
But on the face of it, it looks like, somebody from 
outside, Businessman is kind of dictating to Mr Koko that 
certain things must happen and Mr Koko passes this on to 
Ms Daniels and so on and so on.   
 
So when you look at all of those things and, of course, 
certain transactions happened at Eskom and there are 
allegations of irregularities about certain transactions.   
 
When you know what you know now, and when I say 
know, I accept that we have not heard all the evidence.  We 
must still here more.   
10 
 
But on the face of it, do you think that the possibility 
that there were people outside of Eskom who may have been 
manipulating Eskom processes, maybe also manipulated 
some people within Eskom or using them for their own 
agenda, is farfetched? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it is quite disturbing because what we 
read here should never have happened.  I mean, people 
actually dictating to us, remove PFMA, the board must do 
this.   
 
So.  However, one must also bear in mind that I think it 
20 
is a bigger problem we have as a country.  The issue of 
governance.  So I do not know how to find it but I see it as a 
problem that the country faces.   
 
Why is information leaking...  I mean, there were 
accusations, 
for 
instance, 
that 
the 
Gupta 
family 
was 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 89 of 187 
 
appointing ministers.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Things like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know.  Why are we having all these 
sorts of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   So the suggestion that there were people 
manipulating, I agree but I think it is a bigger problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Anything arising? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And may I?  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane, I had said that I will touch 
on the penalties.  You know those penalties were settled...  
Well, 
there 
was 
a 
settlement 
agreement 
with Tegeta, 
ultimately, in 2017 on those penalties. 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You know that? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The R 2.17 billion ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...was settled at R 599 million in terms 
of the agreement.  It is a significant drop. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 90 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, as far as I know, it was the 
application process ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   That came to that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And if OCM had gone to arbitration 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...most probably they would have got the 
same results.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it not the position that it was not the 
result of arbitration, it was the result of negotiations? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember when you said – when you 
said – I think you said Mr Brian Molefe adopted a hard 
attitude towards OCM because they were taken all the cream 
and giving it to overseas and giving you all the rubbish. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so on.  And I said:  Well, you know, I 
think Mr Seleka will say but they might not have been hard 
20 
on Tegeta.   
 
So the picture that emerges – emerged, at least, on what 
we know now.  Mr Brian Molefe is still going to come and put 
his side of the story and put his perspective.  Maybe that will 
change when he has done that.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 91 of 187 
 
 
But at this stage, the picture seems to be that when 
OCM was there, Mr Brian Molefe...  Eskom, through Mr Brian 
Molefe, did not even want to negotiate. 
DR NGUBANE:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And yet, when it was Tegeta, one, they are 
prepared to negotiate.  Not just negotiate.  Agree to a 
significant reduction of the penalties from two comma 
something billion to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   To R 599 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To R 599 million. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the story does not end there 
Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then there are deductions on that 
amount but reduces it further to R 255 million.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it does not end there.  Tegeta is 
given 20-months to pay in instalments.  But it does not end 
there.  Tegeta defaults after paying R 121 million.  And it 
remains with a balance of over R 13 million before it goes 
20 
into business rescue.  And Eskom has lost. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  Well, I think Ms Daniels would have 
better knowledge of these processes because she was 
obviously a legal person, advisor, the company secretary.  
But on the face of it, there is a discrepancy that is 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 92 of 187 
 
significant, you know.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I am going to finalise with this 
because this is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is too important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels has not finished testifying 
Dr Ngubane.  She has an email attached to her affidavit and 
I want to get your view on this.  As we talk about the 
seriousness of the control and the lack of corporate 
10 
governance. 
 
On the same bundle, Eskom Bundle 18, page 288.  I am 
going to take you back and show you what is happening 
within your board.  Not by yourself.  Page 288. 
 
Now 
this 
is 
an 
email 
exchange 
from 
the 
22n d of November 2015.  It is the build-up to December 2015.  
It is a parallel process.  Bear in mind, because Tegeta wants 
to acquire OCM.  Tegeta wants to acquire OCM. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They have offered R 2.1 billion to buy 
20 
that mine.  And the evidence, as we see it, is that this 
prepayment resolution we went through which becomes a 
guarantee.   
 
The actual intension is to assist Tegeta in acquiring 
OCM but before they could conclude their agreement, which 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 93 of 187 
 
is concluded on the 10t h. 
 
Incidentally, on the 10t h of December, the very day 
Mr Anoj Singh is signing this guarantee and the pre-purchase 
agreement, 
you 
– 
before 
that, 
see 
this 
email 
22n d of November 2015, is from Mr Mark Pamensky, one of 
your board members. 
 
He is writing to athol@ann7.com and there is Varoom(?).  
Meeting of even date, is the subject and he says: 
“Hi 
Chair. 
 
Thank 
you 
for 
the 
conversation 
...[intervenes]  
10 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is the chair he is referring to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is the chair he is referring to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The chairperson seems to be Mr Athol 
Gupta, who ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who was...  Let us see.  If you turn the 
page Chair, he is the Chairman of TMA.  The signature on 
the email that I will come to after this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he says: 
“Hi Chair.  Thank you for the conversation today.  I 
will action all the items and ensure that they are 
completed.  I will send an email to Terry regarding 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 94 of 187 
 
the lead independent.” 
 
Now I want to get to the paragraph I want to. 
“We 
will 
have 
the 
Shiva 
Uranium 
Board 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that email address – that email at page 
288, Bundle 18 of Eskom is from Mr Mark Pamensky? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 
on 
the 
email 
address 
10 
markpam2@mark.com. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 
then 
there 
is 
mail 
to 
markpam2@mark.com, dated 22 November 2015 at 07:40 in 
the morning or pm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is pm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the afternoon.  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At 19:40. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Twenty to eight. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, pm.  And then it is addressed to 
athol@ann7.com. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mail to athol@ann7.com.  And it is copied 
to varoom@shiva.com.  Mail to varoom@shiva.com.  And the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 95 of 187 
 
subject is:  Meeting of even date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to capture that into the 
record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you Chair.  And I have read, 
Hi Chair.  Then it goes on to other paragraphs.  Paragraphs 
number 1 to 2, 3, 4, starting with the words:  In terms of...  It 
says: 
10 
“In terms of the Investment Committee, I am 
available to start straight away.” 
 
Now 
Chair... 
 
Dr 
Ngubane, 
Mr 
Pamensky, 
Mark 
Pamensky, at this time, he is a member of the board of 
Eskom.  This is November 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In November 2015? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You confirm? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says: 
“In terms of the Investment Committee, I am 
available...” 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 96 of 187 
 
 
Oh, sorry.  He was the Chairperson of the IFC.  He is the 
one who recused himself in December. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So: 
“In terms of the Investment Committee, I am 
available to start straight away.   
As I am at the tail end of the main accusation of 
Optimum Coal, please ensure that a condition 
precedent is that the R 2 billion claim from Eskom is 
withdrawn or it becomes the seller’s problem.   
10 
I am happy to get involved to assist with the 
acquisition and monthly monitoring/analysing of all 
investments from today. 
I can meet anyone you require. 
If you need me in India or Dubai to discuss, I will 
meet you there. 
Travel safe and looking forward to seeing you soon. 
Once again, thank you for today. 
Kind regards, Mark.” 
 
He seems to be talking about Tegeta requiring Optimum.   
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is telling this Mr Athol Gupta:  Let the 
condition precedent of R 2 billion, which is the penalties, let 
it be withdrawn or let it be the problem of the seller of 
Optimum.  Do you see that? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 97 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Before the deal is made.  And you were 
sketching out the problem in corporate governance.  The 
problem which seems to be inherent in our system.  You talk 
of it.  This cannot be any more evident of that problem.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, ja.  I see that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay Dr Ngubane, I know it might be 
10 
a long day but it is important for the recording to capture 
your responses. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said you do see that.  Is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:   I do see that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   And it is unfortunate.  Let me put it like 
that. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you suspect anything on his part at 
the time? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, not at all.

ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that he was a director, my 
understanding, Oakbay? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, he had recused himself from 
...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...that tells the story 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That tells the story. 
DR NGUBANE:   But...  Well, we did not know that he was 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...that active. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Because the email above, which is 
forwarded, 
it 
seems 
from 
Athol 
Gupta 
on 
the 
22n d of November.  It is sent to Giovanni at the same 
meeting and to Rajesh Gupta Tony.  tony@sahara.co.za.  But 
it does not end there Mr Ngubane.   
 
And this may well explain what we were talking about, 
the penalties.  A significant drop of the penalties from 
R 2.1 billion to five.  Five with deductions made it, it 
20 
becomes to R 255 million.  Even that R 2.5 million is only 
partly paid. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then Tegeta defaults.  You turn to 
the next page.  Go to the next page.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 99 of 187 
 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is on the day of the agreement on 
both sides between OCM and Tegeta and between Tegeta 
and Eskom, which is Mr Singh’s doing.   
 
The email below that page, page 289, Eskom Bundle 18 
is on the 10t h of December 2015 at 22:32.   
 
Now that is twenty eight minutes before eleven at night.  
Also coming from Mr Mark Pamensky, the same email 
address.  Oh, no.  This is mark@blts.co.za.  Do you know 
what b-l-t-s stands for Dr Ngubane? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I...  Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know what b-l-t-s stands for? 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, just... which ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is BLT? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the middle of – his email address 
Chairperson.  mark@blts.co.za. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Because that is the first...  You 
know, you always have to read from bottom up, these emails.  
Just show Dr Ngubane. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no.  I see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see it? 
DR NGUBANE:   I see, ja.  mark@blts.co.za. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 100 of 187 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know what that BLTS stands for? 
DR NGUBANE:   I am sure ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a company also. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, it is a company address.  I am sure.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he says ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   It was Blue Label. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, Blue Label? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, he worked for Blue Label? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says:  Hi Chair.  The email...  Well, 
we do not see who it is addressed to but you see the 
response at the top.  Let us read the message first.  It says: 
“Hi Chair.  Congratulations!” 
 
Then there is that word in brackets.  “(Mazel tov)”.  You 
can assist us there Dr Ngubane.   
“Congratulation on a brilliant and well-thought out 
plan and strategized acquisition of the Optimum 
Group of Companies.   
Well done!  I am proud of you all.   
20 
This is only the beginning of the resource group 
growth and many more to come into play.  
I am more than sure that you and the team will make 
a huge success of this acquisition. 
I wish you all the success on the deal. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 101 of 187 
 
The hard work begins now and we as the team will 
produce the results.” 
 
We as the team will produce the results.  Next: 
“Let me know when you are ready to discuss the 
operational implementation. 
I am truly proud to be part of this group. 
Enjoy the well-deserved holiday. 
Mark.” 
DR NGUBANE:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson this capital has met its 
best.  [Speaker not clear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Within the board.  [laughs]  Ja, I can 
only picture, punching the air with his fist.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Dr Ngubane.  If you go back to 
Mr Pamensky’s letter or email at 288, the one where 
Mr Seleka starts, which is addressed to Mr Athol Gupta. 
 
It seems to me that if you ask somebody to make 
20 
another company withdraw a claim of R 2 billion, must be 
that you think that that person is very powerful. 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By any standards, that is a huge claim. 
DR NGUBANE:   H’m. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 102 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   To expect that that person can get it 
withdrawn.  It just seems that you must be thinking – so 
Mr Pamensky must have been thinking that Athol was 
capable of achieving that.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a sentiment that you find also – 
that it agrees(?) with you? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I always thought it was the arbitrator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But now it is clearly the ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the negotiations. 
DR NGUBANE:   [Speaker not clear – speaking too soft.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, it was not the arbitrator at all.  
They settled, saying there were errors in the calculations.  
So that is what they said.  But go back to page 289 
Dr Ngubane, so we can...  You see there is a response then 
at the top of that page?  A response to Mr Mark Pamensky’s 
email of 10 December.   
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That response is from Athol Gupta, 
athol@ann7.com.  It is to Mark Pamensky.  And that these...  
I think they swopped the date and the month, judging from 
the 
previous 
email. 
 
So 
that 
would 
be 
on 
the 
12t h of November or the 11t h of December.  Well, the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 103 of 187 
 
11t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the 11t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I could hear a message from my 
junior(?) out of the chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is copied to Varoom and to Rajesh 
Gupta Tony.  He says – Athol says – Athol Gupta: 
“Hi.  Thank you Mark.  I really appreciate it.  We will 
10 
talk soon.  Regards Athol Gupta.  Chairman, TMA 
Media (Pty) Ltd.” 
 
And that is the correspondence between the parties.  So 
even the board – some boar or one board member, at the 
very least, seems to have assisted the Gupta’s in the 
acquisition of Optimum. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I do not think you can accused the 
board of assisting.  Obviously, this was an individual. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if in the end that deal was 
brought to the board and the board approved, it would be 
legitimate to ask the board to explain.  You accept that? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 104 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   A claim of R 2 billion going down to 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   R 599 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  It would be legitimate to...  I 
mean, I have not checked.  I assume that for such a big 
amount, before they settled, whoever was negotiating would 
need that to be brought to the board to approve.  I am 
assuming because it is a big amount. 
DR NGUBANE:   It was never brought to the board Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was never brought to the board? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   No.  That is why I was suggesting probably 
Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Arbitration. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...is the legal person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   Who might shed light on the processes 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But on your own understanding.  Any 
20 
negotiations that led to an agreement where Eskom’s claim 
of R 2 billion was reduced to five hundred and something 
million or two hundred and something million, should have 
been brought to the board for the board to approve, is it not?  
It is too big an amount to say – to be dealt with by somebody 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 105 of 187 
 
else.  I would imagine. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I would say so Chairperson because 
we were seized with the issue of penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes, yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And they influenced a lot of thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   On the side of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay but you say, definitely it 
was not brought to the board? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, it was not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well...  Sorry, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, 
Ms Daniels has not finished testifying.  But is it not that, she 
had submitted a memorandum to the board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And she requested a mandate for 
Mr Anoj and I think Mr Koko to authorise, to do the 
settlement because she did not want to do it herself.  The 
board had said she should do it.   
 
And she said:  No, you authorised these two executives.  
20 
And this was prior the settlement.  And in her memorandum 
to the board, proposed an amount by which the settlement 
should be concluded.   
 
And she was told:  No less than five hundred million.  
Settle but no less than five hundred million.  But the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 106 of 187 
 
authorisation was then by the board given to Mr Anoj and Mr 
Koko.   
DR NGUBANE:   Not by the IFC.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know but I know that from my 
reading of the documents, the memorandum is made to the 
board and the request is that the board should authorise the 
two executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   I do not remember it Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Do you have the document? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, she says:  I presented the BTC...  
Sorry.  To BTC but the Board Tender Committee was chaired 
by you. 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Khosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it chaired by Mr Khosa? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, there was a time that it was 
chaired by you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   A very short time. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A very short time? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  Once I became acting chairperson, I 
stopped chairing BTC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, that was...  She says BTC. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 107 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I guess, even the BTC for writing of, 
in effect, such a big amount ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would have need to make sure that 
the board went along with that.  I would imagine. 
DR NGUBANE:   They would probably need to make sure 
that IFC approved it and then report it to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is from ourselves Chairperson.  
That is it from ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will this mean we are done with 
Dr Ngubane or are there some matters that he will still come 
back for? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you are not sure? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  I know Chair and I spoke this 
20 
morning ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes about other matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 108 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you will talk to him in due course if you 
need to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think that will be the next call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  Thank you very much 
Dr Ngubane.  We are done with you for today but the work of 
the Commission continues and if we ask you to come back, I 
am sure you will cooperate again as you have done all along.   
DR NGUBANE:   Not on New Year’s Eve or Christmas Eve 
Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
DR NGUBANE:   That is when we are... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but before we finish.  Mr Mkhabela, 
you do not have any re-examination you need? 
ADV MKHABELA:   Not from our side Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you very much.  So thank you 
very much Dr Ngubane.  And we are going to adjourn for 
lunch and then ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I will resume at quarter past two with 
20 
another work stream. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
DR NGUBANE:   Thank you. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 109 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, Mr Chaskalson, good 
afternoon, everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Good afternoon, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Today we are going to finish the 
money flows relating from the kickbacks on the Transnet 
contract. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that, have you been told what the 
explanation is for this delay?  Ten minutes delay about the 
files.  Has somebody given you an explanation? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, no, I was not part of or… 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is just not acceptable.  We were 
supposed to start at quarter past, I was ready, I was told 
certain people are supposed to bring the files, they were 
not here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I can find out what the 
cause of the delay was and maybe report when I am back 
20 
on Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  At least the least we were entitled 
to is an explanation as to why there was this delay.  I was 
kept waiting for ten minutes after we were supposed to 
start.  I understand that it is not the legal team’s fault, 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 110 of 187 
 
from what I have been told. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, only to the extent that we 
were not taking responsibility for getting the documents 
here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine, but please 
do find out. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I will, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright, let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we are going to be finishing 
the Transnet money flows evidence – 
well, offshore 
10 
evidence today and today we are going to be focusing for 
the most part on kickbacks that were paid through the 
Worlds Window network and so we touched on the Worlds 
Window network a fair amount on the last few days but 
maybe 
just 
very 
briefly, 
Mr 
Holden, 
to 
start 
again 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle do we start with? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will be in 6A and 6B today, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, we will u se both. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Most of it will be 6A but there 
will be a little bit in 6B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 111 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can you very briefly 
just maybe go to paragraphs 135 and 136 of your report at 
page 220 where you touch on who the Worlds Window 
network were and the companies in that network were? 
CHAIRPERSON:   220? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   220, Chair, of 6A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   6A, ja.  Okay, alright. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  The Worlds Window 
network 
as 
I 
have 
indicated 
at 
paragraph 
135, 
the 
centrepiece, the heart of the Worlds Window Group – sorry 
10 
the heart of the Worlds Window Network is the Worlds 
Window Group and I provide the website address there 
which www.wwg.c.in.  According got the group website and 
also 
according 
to 
filings 
with 
the 
Indian 
Company 
Registration house, Worlds Window was first registered in 
1997 and it began trading ferrous and non-ferrous metal 
scrap. 
 
Subsequent to 1997, the Worlds Window Group 
opened up a vast array of businesses registered in India 
and elsewhere.  I provide a list of the key entities there 
20 
under.  The first one is provided at A which is Worlds 
Window Impex India Private Limited which is described on 
the Worlds Window Group website as the flagship of the 
group and one of the largest importers in Northern India. 
 
On accessing Indian company records held at their 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 112 of 187 
 
version of Companies House was to able to establish that 
Worlds Window Impex Private Limited was established on 
the 14 February 1997 with the address 75 Khirki Village, 
New Delhi and that is an address that continues to be used 
throughout in relation to all of the other Worlds Window 
subsidiaries.   
Important to bear in mind is that Worlds Window 
Impex Private Limited is 49% owned by International Metal 
and Steel BV which is registered in Holland and IMSBV, 
which is the acronym for International Metal and Steel BV, 
10 
is a wholly owned subsidiary of the European Metals 
Recycling Group based in Liverpool in the UK.  So 51% of 
the centrepiece company was still owned by the Worlds 
Window Group. 
I 
identified 
13 
other 
Worlds 
Window 
Group 
companies.  I am going to just list them by name and the 
reason why I list them by name will become a little bit 
clearer in the evidence but the 13 additional companies 
identified Worlds Window Agro Private Limited, Worlds 
Window Cabs Indian Private Limited, Worlds Window 
20 
Developers Private Limited, Worlds Window Eco Trade 
Private Limited, Worlds Window Estate Private Limited, 
Worlds Window Exim Private Limited, Worlds Window 
Farming Private Limited, Worlds Window Greenfield Private 
Limited, Worlds Window Holding Private Limited, Worlds 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 113 of 187 
 
Window 
Infrastructure 
and 
Logistics 
Private 
Limited, 
Worlds Window Trading Private Limited, Worlds Window 
Urja 
Private 
Limited 
and 
Worlds 
Window 
Wardha 
Infrastructure Private Limited.   
In addition to that the Worlds Window Group also 
maintained and ran one company of particular notice in 
Dubai which was Everest Metals FZE which the Worlds 
Window Group claims was established in 2008 as the 
international trading arm of the group.  The relevance here, 
Chair, is that Everest Metals FCE (sic) was the wholly 
10 
owned Everest Global Metals registered in South Africa 
and as we discussed in relation to the Estina evidence a 
while back, that was the entity which was engaging in a 
loan back scam involving the Gupta enterprise including 
using Estina as one of the payees. 
And then finally worth mentioning is Arctos Trading 
(Pty) Ltd which is a South African company and that was 
registered with registration number 2011/002541/7.  That 
company was a wholly owned – was beneficially owned by 
Vasudhamaa 
Resources 
PTE 
Limited, 
a 
company 
20 
incorporated in Singapore.  On accessing the Singapore 
company records I was able to establish that one or the 
two 
directors 
of 
Vasudhamaa 
Resources 
was 
Worlds 
Window company director as well, his name is Anil Kumar 
Mishra.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 114 of 187 
 
It is very clear from the Gupta Leaks records 
themselves that Arctos Trading was the vehicle through 
which the Worlds Window Group conducted the majority of 
its investments into the Gupta enterprise including mining 
investments and providing another Gupta link is the 
address that registered for Arctos Trading, the registered 
address 
for 
Arctos 
Trading 
is 
144 
Grayston 
Ridge, 
Katherine Street, Sandton, which is an address that is 
shared with a number of other Gupta enterprise companies. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can I ask you to go 
10 
to bundle 6A page 498 which is some financial statements 
for Arctos for 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is in fact 499, Chair, of bundle 
6A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Annexure B and you have 
already mentioned to the Chair that the holding company of 
Arctos was Vasudhamaa Resources.  One sees that at 
page 499 where it says incorporated in Singapore. 
20 
 
Can I ask you to turn to page 512, still part of the 
same document?  And under 4, Investment and Mining 
Rights, can you just note to the Chair what we see there 
and what the significance is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, what we see at paragraph 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 115 of 187 
 
4 there of the financial statements ending 2011 is a first – 
it reads Investments and Mining Rights and the name of 
the company is Idwala Coal (Proprietary) Limited and the 
carrying amount is R165 million and the name underneath 
that is Tegeta Exploration and Resources (Proprietary) 
Limited 
and 
the 
carrying 
amount 
as 
of 
2011 
is 
R197 852 050.  Those two amounts added together are 
R362 852 050.  The relevance here, Chair, is that both 
Idwana Coal and Tegeta Exploration are Gupta enterprise 
companies 
which 
would 
very 
clearly 
at 
Arctos 
has 
10 
undertaken an investment into Gupta enterprise companies 
and therefore the two enterprises, the Worlds Window 
Group and the Gupta enterprise are operating together. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then to develop that point, 
two pages down, page 514 under 11, other financial 
liabilities. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, at other financial liabilities 
it indicates a number of entries, it says: 
“At amortised cost, a Bank of Baroda loan of 
R283 611 482 
which 
the 
financial 
statements 
20 
indicate were secured by investments in Tegeta 
Exploration and Indwala Coal with interest charged 
at 9% linked to prime and repayable quarterly in 20 
equal instalments effective from 28 February 2012.” 
The next entry of relevance is: 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 116 of 187 
 
“JIC Mining Services.” 
It indicates: 
“An unsecured loan, interest free and repayable on 
terms agreed annually for R44 million.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what JIC Mining? 
MR HOLDEN:   JIC Mining is the formal name for West 
Dawn.  West Dawn traded as West Dawn but the underlying 
corporate entity was JIC which is a Gupta enterprise 
company.  Beneath that we have JJ Trading, which 
indicates: 
10 
“An unsecured loan with interest charged at 2% 
percent per annum and payable on terms agreed 
annually.” 
And that is …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just remind the Chair 
who JJ trading is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, JJ Trading is a company 
registered in the UAE, that was beneficially controlled by 
the Worlds Window Group and was one of the primary 
vehicles through kickbacks are paid in relation to the early 
20 
phase of the Transnet kickback scheme.  That indicates a 
loan amount of R9 564 773.   
 
Thereafter there is a loan indicated for Oakbay 
Investments: 
“An unsecured loan, interest free and repayable on 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 117 of 187 
 
terms agreed annually for R96 million.” 
And then finally IMR General Trading: 
“An unsecured loan where interest is charged at 2% 
per annum and payable on terms agreed annually 
for R1 246 922.” 
IMR General Trading, Chair, is a company that was 
ultimately owned by the Worlds Window Group. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then, Mr Holden, can we just 
describe the people who we will come across in relation to 
the Worlds Window Group maybe starting with Mr Piyoosh 
10 
Goyal who we have met already but you describe his 
Worlds Window role at page 223 of bundle 6A, paragraph   
139.  223. 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, the key figure here is in the Worlds 
Window Group for our investigation was Mr Piyoosh Goyal.  
Mr Piyoosh Goyal was the Chairperson of the Worlds 
Window Group during the period in which the Transnet 
kickbacks were paid. 
 
I should mention, Chair, that when this particular 
story and the connection to Worlds Window Group was 
20 
made public, the Worlds Window Group effectively erased 
Mr Piyoosh Goyal from their website and he was no longer 
a director in the Worlds Window Group.  What I was able to 
do is to look at archived copies of their website which 
confirmed that previously and during the time in which we 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 118 of 187 
 
consider he was the Chairperson and he was a director of 
a number of different Worlds Window Groups at that time - 
Worlds Window Group companies at that time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you then go to paragraph 
140 over the page on 224, 6A, where you describe other 
Worlds Window employees who you come across in the 
Gupta Leaks. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, the first individual I 
indicate there is a Shuchi Bansal who was styled as the 
executive assistant to the Chairman’s office, therefore the 
10 
executive assistant to Piyoosh Goyal.  
 
An individual by the name of Amit Agrawal who was 
an accountant at the Worlds Window Group and he 
corresponded extensively with Ashu Chawla in relation to 
payments made by Everest Metals FCE in South Africa in 
relation to a loan back scheme. 
 
Pooja 
Puri, 
Worlds 
Window 
employee, 
who  
corresponded 
extensively 
with 
Ashu 
Chawla 
again 
regarding payments made by Everest Metals FCE. 
 
And then finally Lalit Tewari, a Worlds Window 
20 
employee who the Gupta Leaks record show was involved 
in running Arctos and operated in Arctos email address.  
Interestingly Mr Tewari appears to become integrated into 
the Gupta enterprise as of 2014.  My search of the records 
indicates that from at least March 2014 he was operating in 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 119 of 187 
 
Oakbay address and an Elgasolve address from at least 
August 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if I can take you to 
annexure Z which starts at – let me just get my reference, I 
think it is bundle 6A. 
MR HOLDEN:   597. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   597.  597 where you have a 
collection of Gupta Leaks documents showing Piyoosh 
Goyal’s role in relation to the Gupta enterprise.  The one 
document that I would ask you to describe to the Chair is 
10 
at page 615.  615 of bundle 6A and can you tell the Chair 
what that is?   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, this is an email again 
emanating from the Gupta Leaks, it is sent from Beverley 
Hardy, an employee of Sahara to Jolene Roux, also an 
employee of Sahara on the 4 January 2011 with the 
subject:  TNA Dinner Table Allocation.  That stands for the 
New Age 
dinner 
table 
allocation 
and 
it 
attached 
a 
spreadsheet with the name …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.   I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, 
20 
I think I have lost you, the last page number I had was 
597. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Chair, we have gone down 
to 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:   615. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 120 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Still in the same bundle 6A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And maybe if you can just take 
the Chair again to the covering email that you were 
describing at 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  Again this is an email that 
comes from the Gupta Leaks, the email is saying from 
Beverley Sahara, that Sahara address, she was a Sahara 
employee, to Jolene Roux, another Sahara employee, the 
10 
date is the 4 January 2011 and the subject is: 
 
“TNA Dinner Table Allocation.” 
And TNA is an acronym for the New Age.  The attachment 
reads: 
“TNA dinner table allocation XLSX” 
Which is an Excel spreadsheet.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go over the page 
to 616, is that the attachment or the beginning of the 
attachment? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you take the Chair 
quickly through 616 and then get to 617 where the critical 
information if for our purposes? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, this is a spreadsheet that 
sets out the ways in which seating was to be allocated at 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 121 of 187 
 
the particular that is described here with number 1, the 
first table being described as the President’s table and as 
you can see there the number 1 entry is President Jacob 
Zuma and it provides a number of individual who would 
also be sitting at the table with the former President. 
 
Table 2 is Ashu table, which I take to mean Ashu 
Gupta, who was the Chairman of the New Age at that time 
and he is sitting with a number of notable individuals 
including Malusi Gigaba.  
 
The third table was the Duduzane table which I take 
10 
to mean Duduzane Zuma.  That is clarified by the fact that 
the first entry there is provided M D Mabangela and he was 
a director in Mabangela Investments and it provides a 
number of different individuals who are sitting there. 
 
And then turning to the entry of relevance here on 
page 617 is table 6 which is described as Piyoosh table 
and we can see definitely that this refers to Piyoosh Goyal 
because he is the number 1 entry at that table allocation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is happening at table 5, is it 
one person?  And table 4?  Or maybe it was reserved for 
20 
him and whoever he brought along.   
MR HOLDEN:   I think so.  It is not entirely clear which Mr 
Zuma it is referring to, I am afraid, here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Going to Piyoosh’s table, table 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 122 of 187 
 
6, can you identify any people who would be seated with 
Piyoosh Goyal? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  We have entry number three, 
was the Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, although 
slightly misspelt.  And then of interest to this discussion is 
the entry number 7 which is adviser to Min PE which I 
understand to mean the advisor to the Minister of Public 
Enterprises and the first name is given as Siyabonga, I 
take that to mean Siyabonga Mahlangu, who has given 
evidence before the Commission already.   
10 
 
And then the entry there at number 8 is DG Public 
Enterprise, which I take to mean Tshediso Matona, who I 
think has also given evidence before the Commission. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then very briefly because the 
two Worlds Window entities that we will be focusing on are 
JJ Trading and Century General Trading.  Can you briefly 
describe to the Chair the relationship between JJ Trading 
and Century General Trading and the Worlds Window 
Group? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  The Century General 
20 
Trading and JJ Trading are both registered in the UAE.  
The Gupta Leaks makes it very plain that CGT and JJT are 
both effectively being run by the Worlds Window Group at 
the direction of, amongst others, Piyoosh Goyal and it was 
these two companies that were central to entering into 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 123 of 187 
 
kickbacks with various Chinese rail manufacturers. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at page 225 of your report, 
still bundle 6A, you refer to Ram Ratan Jagati, can you 
describe to the Chair what you know of Ram Ratan Jagati? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  Ram Ratan Jagati 
appears in the Gupta Leaks on three separate occasions.  
He is also listed on LinkedIn on various other websites 
referring to JJ Trading as the managing director or director 
of JJ Trading. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  Then to move now 
10 
to the specific contracts involving JJT and CGT of which 
we are aware, the first is a contract which is attached as 
annexure A at page 298 of volume 6A.  Can you take the 
Chair to that contract and we have seen it before but if you 
take the Chair in some more detail now that we are going 
to be focusing on that contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 298? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   298 at 6A, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, this is a described as – styled as an 
20 
agent agreement which is dated to 13 June 2011.  Party A 
is given as Shanghai Zhenghua Heavy Industries Co 
Limited which, as I mentioned yesterday, is also referred to 
by a separate acronym which is ZPMC.   
 
Party B is JJ Trading FCE and it provides a P O Box 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 124 of 187 
 
address for JJ Trading in Sharjah in the United Arab 
Emirates and the subject is provided as: 
“Contract for two ship to shore container cranes, 
STS, 
including 
repositioning 
of 
existing 
Noell 
Cranes, an addition 5 number ship to shore cranes 
for Transnet South Africa.” 
And slightly further down on that page under paragraph 1.1 
provides the name of the project which then indicates the 
formal name that was given to the project by Transnet Port 
Terminals which is given the code iCLMHQ0762. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you can the Chair to 
clause 2 of this contract at the bottom of that page 298. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  At clause 2 it reads: 
“With a view to facilitating the bidding for the 
project and other relevant matters, party A hereby 
appoints party B as the agent of party A to assist 
party A in handling the bidding for the project and 
other 
relevant 
matters 
as 
per 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions of this agreement and party B hereby 
accepts the appointment of party A.” 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So party B is JJ Trading.  Can 
we look at its obligations under clause 4 on page 299? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, at clause 4, 4.1 indicates 
that: 
4.1 
“The obligations of party B to be to provide 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 125 of 187 
 
information 
about 
the 
project 
to 
party 
A, 
to 
purchase 
the 
tender 
documents 
and 
submit 
documents to party A, to provide copies of the local 
laws and safety codes related to the project and 
information pertaining to local customs.” 
4.3  
To assist the personnel of party A in said country 
for the duration of the contract including issuing 
invitation letters, communications with the buyer, 
hotel reservations, airport pickup and send off.” 
4.4: 
To communicate with the buyer on behalf of party A 
10 
and take part in all necessary activities in relation 
to the project.  All declarations, commitments 
and/or guarantee made by party B to the buyer or 
any other act of party B that might expose party A 
to certain obligations shall be approved in writing 
by party A in advance. 
4.5 
To promote the project in favour of party A. 
4.6 
To provide an interpreter for party A’s personnel in 
the non-English speaking countries at the stage of 
bidding, not contract execution. 
20 
4.7 
To ensure that party A’s personnel can legally and 
uninterruptedly executive this contract.  In cases of 
interruption, such as from union problems, party B 
shall 
make 
positive 
efforts 
to 
eliminate 
the 
disturbance and make sure the contract can be 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 126 of 187 
 
executed smoothly.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then over the page on page 
300 clause 5 deals with commission and other fees.  Can 
you take the Chair through – well, how this clause 
operates? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair. I should clarify, Chair, that 
above at 4.8 which I have not read out, which is the other 
obligation, it reads: 
“To protect party A’s interests.” 
That was party B’s requirements.  Chair, this clause 
10 
establishes a few structure by which party B, which is JJ 
Trading, would be paid.  Under the – there are two 
methods of payment, that I indicated, at 5.2 the method of 
payment A.  It says: 
“Upon 
satisfaction 
of 
all 
the 
following 
three 
conditions party L shall pay the commission in sum 
of US dollars of 3% of price A and 85% of price B.” 
At 5.1 we indicate that party A’s offer to Transnet is 
referred to as price A.  And party B’s price increase beyond 
the price A without impact of party is referred to as price B. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So can you translate that into simpler 
terms for us or...? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, as with other contracts we have 
seen this is an incentive – a contract that incentivises JJT 
Trading to ensure that Transnet pays an amount over and 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 127 of 187 
 
above that which had already been – indicated would be 
the actual cost to the company of providing the contract 
and any amount that is earned over and above – the 
contract has already been agreed, 85% of that would be 
accruing to JJT and 15% would be accruing to ZPMC. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Holden.  Is there 
anything else in this contract that you would want to 
emphasise? 
MR HOLDEN:   Not at this moment, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe just to point to the 
10 
signatories at page 303. 
MR HOLDEN:   Oh, certainly.  We do have, Chair, three 
signatories.  For party B we have a signature there, 
unfortunately we are not able to identify despite quite 
extensive investigations. 
 
For party A we have a signature with a handwritten 
note next to it which appears to read Agwa Shen(?). 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Agwa Shen on behalf of which 
entity? 
MR HOLDEN:   Apologies, Chair.  Agwa Shen on behalf of 
20 
party A, which is Shanghai Zhenghua Heavy Industries Co 
Limited. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And have you been able to 
establish who Agwa Shen is? 
MR HOLDEN:   I am afraid I have not, Chair. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 128 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the first JJT, CGT 
contract that we have come across.  In your report you 
infer the existence of the Century General Trading contract 
in relation to the 95 locomotives project, can I take you to 
Annexure L which is a contract we discussed yesterday.   It 
is at Bundle 6A page 427.  And maybe start at 426 and 
describe to the Chair what it is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  At Annexure L we have an 
addendum to agreement signed between CRRC Hong Kong 
Company 
Limited 
and 
Regiments 
Asia 
Limited 
and 
10 
Tequesta Group Limited dated August 2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now I fear that I have taken you 
– I may have taken you to the wrong contract, because it 
doesn’t say, if you go to page 4 – I have taken you to the 
wrong contract, I must apologise for that.   It is the earlier 
addendum that I wanted to – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be convenient Mr Chaskalson 
for us to take five minutes while you are looking. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair, I would 
appreciate that, my reference is incorrect. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us take five minutes adjournment.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 129 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair we have sorted ourselves 
out, I also have a message from Secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Unfortunately due to leave 
arrangements there is only one person at Secretariat 
working with documents today, preparing for the rest of the 
week and he was stopped by security in this building who 
searched his car before he came in, which is why he was 
delayed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no that is fine.  It is not 
something that happens often. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It does seem to be an extreme 
situation, I also know from the way in which I had 
Secretariat running around with my late requests for 
documents this week that they are short-staffed and being 
possibly being poorly treated by the Evidence Leaders, 
myself included. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No it is just that at least if there is an 
explanation 
one 
can 
understand 
if 
there 
is 
a 
good 
20 
explanation.  It is just that if there is no explanation it 
allows a situation where things just deteriorate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes indeed.  No, no that is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ten minutes, tomorrow it is 20 minutes 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 130 of 187 
 
the next day it is 30 minutes but at least if we know then it 
is okay and if there must be some interventions then they 
can be considered.  Okay, no that is fine, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.  We are on 
page 427 now, Bundle 6A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Holden can you address 
Clause 1.4 of that agreement, or maybe let us start with 
the cover page of the agreement so we know what the 
agreement is, and that is at page 426. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair at page 426 we have the 
cover page which is an addendum to an agreement signed 
between CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Company Limited and 
Regiments Asia and that is dated August the 26 t h, August 
2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair you will recall we 
discussed this agreement last night.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr. Holden can you take the 
Chair to clause 1.4 and show what we can infer in relation to 
20 
in an anterior agreement involving Century General Trading? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair clause 1.4 reads: 
“As for the financial conversation to Century General 
Trading FCE given as CGT under the consultancy 
agreement 
dated 
14 
April 
2012 
consultancy 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 131 of 187 
 
agreement Regiments shall resolve to speak with 
CGT through amicable consultation and show that 
there is no further dispute with CRRC ZELC from 
either side.” 
Which I think it is pretty clear that we can identify that there 
was a consultancy agreement between CGT and CRRC that 
was originally dated the 14 t h of April 2012. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what is the subject matter of 
this addendum so that we can then infer what the CGT 
agreement related to? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair this is in relation to the 95 
elective locomotive project.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then just to confirm this point if 
we can go to the workings document that you took to the 
Chair, that you took the Chair through yesterday that is in 
Bundle 6A page 420, 420, and can you take the Chair to the 
parts of that document that confirm that there was previously 
an arrangement between CSR and CGT in relation to the 95 
project. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair as we discussed yesterday 
20 
this was a workings document that was distributed eventually 
to Ashu Chawla and it indicates the amounts of money that 
were due to be paid under various kickback contracts in 
relation to the 359,100 and 95 project workings.   
As we can see on the fourth column we have the 95 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 132 of 187 
 
project under the heads, it provides the total value of the 
contract and thereafter it provides a calculation of the 
amount to be received by CGT and the rest to be paid to the 
Gupta Enterprise, that is the entry to the left reads: 
“JJT/CJT and expenditures.” 
And the 95 project that says: 
“Out of 20% receivables CGT receive 15% and  
expenditures is 85% percent.” 
The line above confirms that the total kickbacks on that 
contract was to be 20%.  So reading those two together we 
10 
understand that CJT was due to receive 15% of that 20% 
kickback. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And while we on this workings 
document.  Can you take the Chair to the provisions which 
show that JJT, that there was an arrangement between China 
South Rail and JJT in relation to the 359 project and the 100 
project? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair again at the heads we have 
359,100 
project 
which 
are 
treated 
together 
in 
the 
spreadsheet.  It provides as under receivables from CSR 
20 
21% as total receivables, 2% advance excess fee and 19% 
receivables on actual basis when it is due from CSR and the 
line below that is JJT/CJT and expenditures and that reads 
out of 2% excess fee, 1% excess fee for JJT and 1% 
expenditures out of 19% CSR receivables, JJT who receive 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 133 of 187 
 
15% and expenditures is 85%. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    And then to finish this sort of 
digging in relation to the 359 contract.  Can I ask you to turn 
to the contract that we discussed with the Chair yesterday, it 
is a contract between Tequesta and CSR 18 May 2015, it is 
at page same bundle, Bundle 6A page 365?  It is Annexure F 
maybe if we can just go to the cover page which is on 358 
and then come down to 365. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair at page 358 we have cover 
page which reads: 
10 
“Business development services agreement.” 
Entered in between CSR Hong Kong Company Limited with 
Tequesta Group Limited with an agreement date of the 18 t h 
of May 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go down to clause 
3.3 on page 365. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair if I may it might be worth 
clarifying it at 362 the definition is given for this project as 
project 359 so that you know it refers to the 359 project.  We 
turn to 365 clause 3.3 reads: 
20 
“The 
company 
has 
advised 
Tequesta 
that 
the 
previous agreement had been signed between CSR 
Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Company Limited and JJ 
Trading FZE hereinafter referred to as JJT.  However 
the company advise us to Tequesta that in an event 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 134 of 187 
 
that JJT disputes or contest the cancellation or none 
payment in a court of law and if the court decrees 
that the agreement with JJT is valid or the mutual 
agreement is reached between Tequesta and JJT in 
the financial compensation to JJT which will not 
exceed the retention amount that is 15% of the total 
amount payable to Tequesta and this agreement will 
be deducted from the amount retained from Tequesta 
as per clause 6.16 and the balance if there is will 
then be paid to Tequesta within 30 days after the 
10 
company receipt of the last payment and or return of 
all bank guarantees released by the client whichever 
occurs later.  Under this circumstances the invoices 
the retention to the company shall not be claimable 
and returnable to Tequesta.  Tequesta shall resolve 
dispute with JJT through amicable consultation and 
ensure there is no further dispute with the company 
from either side.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So that clause notes that there 
has been a previous agreement between CSR and JJT in 
20 
relation to the 359 project? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not so long ago you read a paragraph or 
a clause in an agreement that seems very similar to this one.  
Would that have been between other parties?  I mean a few 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 135 of 187 
 
minutes ago I think it was those pages that are not very clear 
that are very dark. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair if I can assist you that was 
the clause in Annexure L. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Which that relates to 95 Electrical 
Locomotives Project and this one to the 359.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the clauses are very similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the parties are? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The parties are the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, thank you.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh sorry when I said the parties 
are the same.  The parties to those the original agreement 
had different parties because the original agreement on the 
95 Locomotives was CGT and the original agreement on the 
359 was JJT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, like I said there must be some 
personality, overlapping personality at least if there are 
clauses that are similar, maybe.  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe Mr. Holden is the one to 
ask on that.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
that 
something 
you 
are 
able 
to...[intervene] 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes Chair CJT is another company that 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 136 of 187 
 
effectively is directed by the World Window Group another 
entity that effectively is a sister company to JJ Trading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    There is another, there is 
evidence of another possible contract with CGT.  Can I take 
you to page 304 of the bundle which is, this is an agreement 
between CNR and I think Tequesta.  Ja, CNR and Tequesta 
at page 304 and it is Annexure B, Bundle 6A.  Can I ask you 
to go down to page 306 and there you - can you read to the 
Chair what it says under agreement date and what you infer 
10 
from that? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair there is an agreement date 
that is entered in there which show mean and refer to the 8 t h 
of July 2013 being the date of the execution of this 
agreement which I take to mean that was an agreement that 
preceded this agreement between CNR and the Tequesta 
Group.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Why is that the case?  Why do 
you make that inference? 
MR HOLDEN:   Because the date of the agreement is the 8 t h 
20 
of July 2013 which is prior to the agreement date of this 
particular exclusive agency agreement.  We also notice that I 
am sure the Evidence Leader we will get to it but there are 
scattered references to CGT throughout the document. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well maybe if I can take you to 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 137 of 187 
 
one of those on page 309 clause 7.4, Bundle 6A, 309.  
CHAIRPERSON:   609? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   309 Chair, 309.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Three zero nine? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Three zero nine.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr. Holden can you take the 
Chair to what you see is significant there. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, clause 7.4 reads: 
“The success fee of 2% on the total value of the 
10 
project as stated above were paid by CNR Dalian 
Locomotive and Rolling Star Company Limited to 
Century General Trading FZE hereinafter refer to RAL 
which is actually Regiments Asia Limited which is 
duly 
incorporated 
existing 
and 
the 
company’s 
ordinance of Hong Kong and having as registered 
address at P.O. Box 17398 Hong Kong UAE duly 
authorised and represented by Mr. Salim Essa.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Have you been able to trace any 
payments from CNR to Century General Trading in respect of 
20 
the 323 project? 
MR HOLDEN:   No Chair I have not and it appears that by 
the time that project was finalised with Transnet the 
relationship with CGT had terminated. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And earlier you mentioned that 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 138 of 187 
 
the date of this agreement, the dates, the actual date of this 
agreement was 20 May 2014.  Can I just ask you to go to 
page 305 to show the Chair were that date is? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I was still trying to sort out what I 
think you know because the agreement dates there refers to 
8 July but earlier on it is given as 20 t h May so I was 
still…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …trying to understand what is going on, ja 
okay alright continue. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr. Holden maybe if you can just 
explain your thesis or your theory to the Chair in relation to 
that to correct that or to why you having that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I have gone to the end of the 
agreement to see if I would see any dates there but then it 
says the date written above.  So are you able to shed light? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair my theory is that there was a 
contract that was entered into between CNR and CGT in 
relation to this contract which was dated July 2013 and then 
this was superseded by this agreement but in preparing the 
20 
documentation insufficient care was taken to replace certain 
key clauses in the original contract such as the agreement 
date and you see for example CGT appearing and RAL 
appearing where I think they really mean Tequesta Group.  
So clearly there was a prior agreement that they then edited 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 139 of 187 
 
copied and pasted certain things but 
retained certain 
elements of the original contract by mistake. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And just on that date of 20 May 
2014 maybe to complete this sequence if one goes to 
Annexure C…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have not realised that even the years 
are different. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Annexure C at page 316 we see 
10 
that there was another contract also concluded on 20 May 
2014.  Can you tell the Chair what that contract is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair this is an exclusive agency 
agreement between CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling 
Stock Company with Regiments Asia and on the following 
page it indicates the agency agreement is dated the 20 t h of 
May 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then can we go back to the 
working documents at page 420.  You have taken the Chair 
through this document in some detail last night and I am not 
20 
going to ask you to do that again but if you go up to the 
covering email I just would like us to get those dates 
refreshed in our memories of how this document travelled 
over time.  The covering emails at page 419 and if you can 
just take the Chair quickly through those three dates.  
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 140 of 187 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair we have three dates 
appearing in this email chain.  The earlier state which seems 
to initiate the email chain is the 6 t h of January 2015 and that 
is the email sent from Rupesh Bansal to Sharma.  The 
following day Sharma forwarded that email to Businessman 
to whom we understand that to be Salim Essa that was on 
the 7 t h of January and then…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr. Holden before you 
proceed I see that I was making a note here yesterday in 
relation to Sharma but I did not complete it.  You said he is 
10 
very senior executive at and then I did not put the name. 
MR HOLDEN:   At CSR.  
CHAIRPERSON:   At CSR, okay thank you yes you may 
continue.  
MR HOLDEN:   And then the final date that is indicated 
there is that businessman or Salim Essa sends the document 
to Ashu Chawla on the 22 n d of March 2015.  So the email 
chain begins on the 6 t h of January 2015 and the final one 
that we see is the 22 n d of March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I want to just put a question here Mr. 
20 
Chaskalson and obviously Mr. Holden is listening.  Is it 
difficult to get conclusive evidence as to whose email 
address Businessman was or who Businessman was because 
I think the Fundudzi Report said probably it was Mr. Salim 
Essa.  Is that something that has been done somewhere? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 141 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, what we will do in the 
cause of our – at some stage in presenting evidence is we 
will produce a collected bundle of all of the Businessman 
emails that we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Our thesis certainly is that it was 
Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It all - everything points to the 
fact that it was Salim Essa. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is alright if - because I think 
from what I read in the Fundudzi Report they just made that 
statement that it was probably him but I do not remember 
seeing the factual basis for that conclusion.  I would like a 
factual basis. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Certainly Chair what we can do is 
produce the full bundle the businessman letters and show 
that they are consistent with businessman being Salim Essa 
and 
it 
is difficult to 
see them being 
consistent 
with 
businessman being anyone else. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that will be helpful. Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Mr. Holden we were talking 
about the dates.  Yesterday we had discussed briefly certain 
travel arrangements that were made in late February 2015 
were Sharma, Salim Essa, Tony Gupta, Aashika Singh and 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 142 of 187 
 
Anoj Singh were all booked in the Oberoy in the last week of 
February 2015.  And you had also describe the breakdown of 
the relationship between Worlds Window and the Gupta 
Enterprise around this period and how on the other side of 
this period we see the Worlds Window entities being 
supplanted and replaced in the contracts with CSR and CNR 
by Tequesta and Regiments, I just wanted to recap that.   
What we are going to do now is, is to go back in time 
to a period where Worlds Window and the Gupta Enterprise 
were working happily together and look in some detail at 
10 
what you have described previously as the Hawala Ledgers 
because that is where we get much of our information about 
movements of funds between these two groups and also 
payment of kickbacks to JJT and CGT.   
So can I ask you to go to page 213, Bundle 6A where  
you start describing the Hawala Ledgers.  And maybe if you 
could begin at 167, paragraph 167 on page 230. 
MR HOLDEN:   
Certainly 
Chair 
at 
paragraph 167 I 
indicate…[intervened] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on you said page 213? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Two three zero, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two three zero? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Two three zero.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got it.  It is paragraph 167, 
is that right? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 143 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   What I indicate there is that on the 19 t h of 
August 2013, but Chair I must indicate that that actually the 
date is incorrect there it is the 19 t h of August 2015 not 2013 
that is a typo. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No I think it is 2013, it is 2013 
well maybe quickly we can go to the document thereafter. 
MR HOLDEN:   I was reading in the bundle this morning and 
I think…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we correct the date later?  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The date does not need to be 
corrected Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   The point is I have misdirected myself 
reading the bundle this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
MR HOLDEN:   So on the 19th of August 2013 Ronica 
Ragavan sent an email to Ashu Chawla with the subject line 
SA1(2-XLSX) and wrote: 
20 
“Is this what you are looking for?” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair maybe if we can go to 
that email and the document underneath it which are at 
Bundle 6A page 625.1, 625.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 144 of 187 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Is it bundle A or bundle B? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle A. You missing the point 
6A, 625.1. 
MR HOLDEN:   I appear to be.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well I cannot ask you to identify 
an email that you cannot see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I got it this time.  So often he has got it 
and we do not have it.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you then to do it this 
way. Is 626 the spreadsheets that you call the Hawala 
10 
Ledgers and that was attached to the email to which you 
referring in your bundle in your report, ah Mr Sello’s got 
page 65…[intervene] 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Maybe if you can just confirm 
that 65.1 is the email to which you are referring? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then the spreadsheet that 
starts at page 626 that was attached to that email is quite a 
confusing document, can you take the Chair through that 
20 
document explain what it is and how it operates? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair it might be easier with 
reference to the screen.  Is your screen on Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not on.  I do not know who needs to 
do what to put it on.  Our technical team when we need them 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 145 of 187 
 
the most they are not here.  One of the people who normally 
helps is sick his not here Reverend Stemela and somebody 
else that is usually helpful is also or does not seem to be 
there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair we will be going to these 
spreadsheets in some detail so might I – I must apologise 
but can we ask for another five minutes’ adjournment 
because it is not just the one time we will be using the 
monitor it will be much more Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright we will adjourn. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.   
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  So this set of 
ledgers that starts on page 628 Annexure AA oh sorry 627 
MR HOLDEN:  626. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  626 I am not going to go any lower 
than that.  We call the Hawala ledgers or you call the Hawala 
20 
ledgers can you explain to the Chair how this ledger system 
operates? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  So what we have is 
effectively a recordal of transactions of money flows both in 
cash and as electronic transfers between companies falling 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 146 of 187 
 
under the Worlds Window Group and companies falling under 
the Gupta Enterprise. This is all stored on a shared ledger 
which has a running total balance which indicates at any one 
time who owes what amounts who which individual and 
probably the best way to describe the sheet – I should 
indicate here Chair that there are two sheets of material 
interest.   
 
The first I have indicated here which reads Account 1 
and then in brackets [2] and for your records Chair that 
begins at 628 of Bundle A and runs to… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you say it begins at 628? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  And that includes transactions beginning on 
the 7 January 2010 and the final transaction is indicated as 
the 29 August 2012 on that particular sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HOLDEN:  And then there is an additional sheet which is 
just referred to as Count – Account 2 which continues the 
transaction recordals and that runs from pages 626 to 627 in 
20 
Bundle A.  And the first transaction there is the 26 
September 2012 and then it concludes with the final 
transaction of the 22 February 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No I think you were too fast for me. 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 147 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  First we were at page 626 
and then you said let us go to 628 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I think – I think the confusion 
is that the document is not structured chronologically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So to start chronologically one 
needs to go to 628. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Where there is one spread sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then there is a second spread 
sheet that is later in time but – which is at page 626. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so let us start at 628 just repeat 
what you said because you left me behind. 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay certainly Chair.  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HOLDEN:  So what we have at 628 is the Hawala ledger.  
You may notice at the very top of the Hawala ledger it has in 
purple Worlds Window which indicates that Worlds Window is 
the owner of this ledger.  
20 
 
And the first transaction we can see there is on the 7 
January 2010 and the final transaction which I think appears 
on page 630 is the 29 August 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have seen that ja. 
MR HOLDEN:  And then chronologically the – the accounts 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 148 of 187 
 
continue by going back to 626. 
CHAIRPERSON:  626.  Okay. 
MR 
HOLDEN: 
 
And 
we 
can 
see 
there 
the 
account 
transactions resume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HOLDEN:  With the first date of entry being the 26 
September 2012 and then the final transaction which is also 
recorded on 626 is given as the 22 February 2013.   
 
So reading these two spread sheets together or these 
two sheets together we were able to track the Hawala 
10 
arrangement between the Gupta Enterprise and the Worlds 
Window network between January 2010 and February 2013. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you describe to the Chair 
what the columns refer to and how the ledger works? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair I am going to choose an 
example which might be easy to work through which I have 
indicated on the screen.  I will highlight just so that it is a 
little bit more legible.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And for record purposes can I – 
can you just tell me where you are in which – the 22 June 
20 
2011? 
MR HOLDEN:  23 June 2011 and that is at row 76 and if I 
was to check the bundle it is the final entry on  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Page 628? 
MR HOLDEN:  628.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 149 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the 23 June 2011? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HOLDEN:  So to do – describe the operation of the 
Hawala ledger obviously on the left hand side we have the 
date of a transaction which here is the 23 June 2011. And 
then we have two parties to the transaction.   
In the first column it is JJ for JJ Trading.  In the third 
column it indicated Global Corporation LLC which as we 
described 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Estina 
and 
the 
Liebherr 
10 
discussions is a Dubai based company controlled by the 
Gupta Enterprise. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I stop you there Mr Holden.  Is 
the party in the second column always a Worlds Window 
party? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then the party in the third 
column is always a Gupta Enterprise party? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair.  Unfortunately what that 
means is that there are transfers to and from the Gupta 
20 
Enterprise and the Worlds Window Group so to ascertain the 
direction of travel of funds we will get to that shortly you 
have to sort of read the Hawala ledger amounts according to 
integer but in the – in column D which is the fourth column it 
provides a method of payment and in this case it says bank 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 150 of 187 
 
by which we understand to mean a bank transfer. But there 
are other cases where it refers cash in hand or cash to 
South Africa or some other mode of payment.   
Then it gives the location of the transfer which in this 
case is Dubai. And then the following columns which run 
from 
F 
to 
I 
provide 
the 
transaction 
in 
a 
particular 
denomination where it is a rand amount it is column F and 
then there is an exchange rate calculation tool there and 
then if it is in the amount of Indian Rupees that appears in 
column H over here that also is an exchange rate between 
10 
the dollar and the Indian Rupee at that particular transaction 
date.   
And then finally it – there is an amount here which is 
the US Dollar equivalent of any of the transactions if they 
take place in Rand or Indian Rupees but for our example 
here the transactions took place in Dollars so it is just 
reflected in – in column J as $4 million.  And this is where it 
gets slightly un – slightly unintuitive.   
The Hawala ledger is constructed as if from the 
perspective of the Worlds Window Group.  So whenever a 
20 
payment is made from a Gupta Enterprise company to the 
Worlds Window Group it is reflected as a positive integer 
and when an amount is made the other way it is made – 
referenced as a negative integer which then has an impact 
on the running total balance here at column K. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 151 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Just hold on.  I may be confused 
but I think I need to correct you there.  So if you – that when 
a positive payment – when a positive number is reflected 
that is a payment from Worlds Window to the Gupta 
Enterprise and so the running balance is the amount 
standing to the credit of the Worlds Window Group as a 
whole.  Is that correct? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair.  I – the spread sheet is 
slightly unintuitive and I tend to get – I have to work through 
it every single time I look at it but yes the evidence leader is 
10 
correct here.   
So in this case if we read this particular column – oh 
sorry this row what we understand it to mean is that on the 
23 June JJ Trading transferred to Global Corporation via a 
bank in Dubai $4 million and that increased the balance in 
the Hawala ledger to $4 317 281.00 which we understand to 
mean that according – at this particular point in time as the – 
as my evidence leader indicted the Worlds Window Group 
was in credit to that amount as in if they were to settle up 
this balance at this point in time and to try [00:10:01] Euro 
20 
balance the Gupta Enterprise would make – need to make a 
payment of $4.3 million to settle it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now you have done a fairly 
extensive exercise now that we have access to bank 
statements and bank statements in the Gupta Leaks to 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 152 of 187 
 
corroborate or to confirm the transactions reflected in the 
Hawala ledger.  Can I take you to Annexure RR which is at 
Bundle 6B at page 989 – 6B – 989.  And can you tell the 
Chair what Annexure RR is? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  Annexure RR is an exercise 
where I extracted payments of interest that were reflected in 
the HSBC transaction records in relation to both Century 
General Trading and JJ Trading. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if we look at page 989 what – 
what is that table? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  This is a table that indicates 
all of the payments that are made from JJ Trading FZE to 
Gupta Enterprise companies.  The vast majority are made to 
Global Corporation LLC but as you see on the top line we 
have an entry for SCS Technologies Limited which is a Gupta 
Enterprise company based in India and below that is an 
amount that was paid to Sahara Computer and Electronics. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And this table is extracted from the 
HSBC records or from the records that have been furnished 
to us by HSBC? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we do an exercise of matching 
these authenticated JJ Trading transactions with entries on 
the Hawala ledger?  And for this Chair I think what might be 
easiest – I mean in due course again we will give you this 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 153 of 187 
 
table with the references and line references but for present 
purposes Chair it may make sense to keep that page of your 
file open page 989. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then Mr Holden will go to the 
spread 
sheet 
and 
we 
can 
visually 
see 
the 
matching 
transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Holden can you take us to the 
entries on the Hawala ledger that match the entries that we 
10 
see on the HSBC records extracted at Annexure RR? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  So the first entry under 
Annexure R is a transaction for .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is RR ha or is it R?  You said R? 
MR HOLDEN:  Annexure RR – double R. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  I just want to make sure the 
record does not mislead. 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  RR we – ja okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  And we have an amount that is reflected on 
20 
the 2 January – it is actually sorry indicated on the – on 
Annexure RR as the 3 January 2012 and we can see an entry 
against Sahara Computer and Electronics that is the second 
entry on Annexure RR page 1.  And the transaction date is 
given as the 3 January 2012 and the transaction amount is 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 154 of 187 
 
$2 146 684.46 and that then appears on the Hawala ledger 
at row 138 of the sheet Account 1[2] and if we scroll to the 
right here so we have the 2 January JJ and Sahara 
Computers were the two entities via a bank in Dubai and the 
amount is then given as 2 146 700.00 US Dollars which is 
slightly more than the transaction amount indicating here.  I 
think the difference is most likely a transaction fee that has 
been applied by the bank. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Next entry. 
MR HOLDEN:  On the 9 January 2012 we have an entry in 
10 
the – in Annexure RR for – let me just mark the decimal 
points quickly so I do not get this wrong – for a – for a 
$100 000.00 is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is 100 000.00. 
MR HOLDEN:  Yes $100 000.00 and then if we go to the 9 
January it probably appears the 8 January we see at row 145 
of the Hawala ledger we see an entry for the 8 January again 
involving JJ and Global Corporation.  The mode of payment 
is bank.  The country is Dubai and the amount here is 
$100 000.00.   
20 
So we have effectively the same transaction with a 
slight difference of date one indicated the date of – probably 
the date of payment and the second is the value date – the 
amount that – the date it actually arrives in the beneficiary 
account. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 155 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if you go up one entry you will 
get another match? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  One entry below the entry we just 
described in the Annexure RR we have a transaction validate 
of the 9 January 2012 an amount of $650 000.00 from JJ 
Trading to Global Corporation LLC and that then appears at 
row 144 of the Hawala ledger sheet account 1[2] and again 
we have 8 January as the date the two parties are JJ Trading 
and Global Corporation.   A transfer in a bank in Dubai and 
the amount is indicated to the far right as $650 000.00. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Holden we have done a lot of 
these exercises over the last few days can I just ask you are 
there any of these RR entries between JJ and Global that do 
not appear in the Hawala ledger? 
MR HOLDEN:  I will have to double check because there was 
a tracing exercise that I did at Annexure SS.  There may be 
certain payments here that do not reflect in the Annexure 
SS.  I need to double check that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Maybe let us go to Annexure SS 
and you can explain to the Chair what Annexure SS is?  It is 
20 
at page 996 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if you take the Chair through 
Annexure SS. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  So Annexure SS is a 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 156 of 187 
 
corroboration exercise that I undertook using some of the 
records that were provided to me by the commission and 
what I attempted to do in Annexure SS was confirm as many 
of the transactions and the various internal Gupta Enterprise 
accounting records against bank records.   
So at SS page 1 that is my attempt to verify 
transactions that appeared originally as Annexure O to my 
Estina – apologies it is Annexure O to the Transnet bundle 
which is within Bundle 6 and then I indicate where I found a 
confirmatory bank statement.  Annexure SS – page 2 of 
10 
Annexure SS is the same exercise that I performed in  
relation to what I called the UAE ledgers that we dealt with 
extensively in relation to Estina.  And Annexure – page 4 of 
SS – of Annexure SS which appears at 999 of bundle 6A is 
then the Hawala ledger where I have extracted all the 
payments in the Hawala ledger where I could find a 
confirmatory banking record of some description. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And on Annexure SS 4 how many 
Hawala ledger entries were you unable to confirm? 
MR HOLDEN:  Chair in the Hawala ledger there are a total of 
20 
262 
transactions 
that 
are 
indicated. 
 
Of 
those 
195 
transactions 
were 
bank 
transactions 
rather 
than 
cash 
transactions.   
The total bank – the total number of transfers that 
occurred in India were 31 and the reason I indicate that is 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 157 of 187 
 
because we do not have documentation that will allow us to 
verify those source of payments.   
So for those transfers where we had a reasonable 
chance of success in terms of tracing payments the total 
bank transfers in the Hawala ledger made either in Dubai or 
South Africa was 164.   
There are 67 cash transactions that we cannot trace.  
So of the 164 potentially traceable bank transfers we can 
find 86 corroboratory or confirmatory banking records.  
Partially that is because I believe that JJT and CJT at the 
10 
time were operating accounts outside of the HSB network 
where we have bank statements.   
Where we have more reliable indication of the 
accuracy of the Hawala ledger is in relation to transfers that 
happened within South African where the banking records 
are far more complete.  There I identified 62 different 
transactions.   
Of those 62 transactions I made clarificatory notes in 
relation to 8 where I indicated perhaps the date might be 
slightly wrong or the amount is slightly mismatched but only 
20 
one transaction for which I could find no records.  So of 
these 62 South African transfers we have the most complete 
bank records who – I was able to identify a confirmed 61 out 
of 62 transactions. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You say that you believe that JJT 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 158 of 187 
 
had a bank statement – was operating bank accounts other 
than the HSBC account.  Can I take you to the HSBC records 
for JJT. I just want to get the correct reference.  It will be 
Bundle 6B 995. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 6B? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  6B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 99? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  995 bear with me for one moment 
Chair.  It is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  995.19.  And Chair the records that 
HSBC were able to provide us included any records with a 
counter party to which JJT – involving a transaction to which 
JJT was a counter party.  So it was not just records where 
JJT had an HSBC – records of the HSBC bank accounts of 
JJT it also included records where other parties with HSBC 
bank accounts transacted with JJT at non-HSBC banks but of 
course where – what HSBC could not give us was records of 
where a non-HSBC party transacted with JJT at an account 
other than the HSBC account.  But for present purposes Mr 
20 
Holden can you identify on the JJT records from 995.19 any 
JJT accounts that are not HSBC accounts? 
MR HOLDEN:  This is slightly difficult to read Chair.  I am 
afraid I do not know offhand but I can do a quick 
investigation. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 159 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let me give you a – let me give 
you an example for instance.  If you look at places where – 
well maybe we should not do this on the fly but actually 
come back with a list of the JJT – with the known JJT 
accounts that are evidenced in this set of transaction 
records from HSBC where JJT holds banks other than at 
HSBC.  We have a – we have a collection of bank accounts 
of that nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  I have actually now identified a couple of 
10 
them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Maybe if you can do so now can 
you alert us to one or two? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  If we refer to the – the 
spread sheet in relation to the transactions I have quickly 
just done a filtering of those transactions on the screen here 
and I have indicated the way I filtered it is so that I am only 
selecting payments to JJ Trading and then it indicates the 
beneficiary account numbers here and then the beneficiary 
banks over here.   
20 
And as we can see there is quite a large number of 
banks outside of the HSBC network that includes Habib bank 
in Zurich, the Bank of Baroda which is in the UAE.  An 
Emirates bank account which is also located in the UAE that 
is Emirates MBD Bank.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 160 of 187 
 
We also have a National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah 
also registered in the UAE and I think that is the last of the 
banks.  So we see at least I think it is by my calculations 
here it is four separate accounts that do not fall within the 
HSBC network. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And of course there may well be 
transactions into those accounts – if transactions into those 
accounts are not made by HSBC parties we will have no 
records of them? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we now go back to the Hawala 
ledger and look at kickback payments that are reflected in 
the Hawala ledger?  And can we stop… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is in Bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 6A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  From page 4 – 629 – 629.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is – that is where we had opened 
before we went to Bundle 6B? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct Chair.  And can I 
20 
ask you first Mr Holden to go to a transaction that appears 
on page 629 in the written bundle and is dated 22 December 
2011?  Can you find that transaction? 
MR HOLDEN:  Yes I can I have identified here on screen 
Chair. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 161 of 187 
 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 And 
can 
you 
explain 
that 
transaction to the Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  What we have here is a – the date 
is given as the 22 December 2011 and the two parties are 
given as JJ Trading and Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries 
also referred to as ZPMC and as we discussed earlier JJ 
Trading and this company had entered into a kickback 
arrangement in relation to the provision of cranes.  It 
indicates a payment was made via a bank transfer via a bank 
account in Dubai and the amount is listed as $969 086.00. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then can I ask you to go over the 
page onto 630 and the transaction on the 31 March 2012 and 
tell the Chair what you see there? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  Chair at row 178 of the sheet titled 
Account 1[2] we have a transaction that is dated the 31 
March 2012.  The two parties are indicated as JJ for JJ 
Trading and Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries.  The mode 
of payment is given as bank.  The location of the bank 
transfer 
is 
Dubai 
and 
the 
amount 
indicated 
here 
is 
$969 086.00. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then if you go down to page 633, 
and I think this is duplicate of the 22 December payment but 
can you just check that? 
MR HOLDEN:   I am afraid.  I am slightly lost.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So this is a payment also on 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 162 of 187 
 
22 December 2011.  It is reflected at page 633. 
MR HOLDEN:   633? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja, that is correct.   
MR HOLDEN:   And the date?  I am afraid I have lost you 
here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   22 December 2011.   
MR HOLDEN:   At row 134? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct.  The amount...  As 
I read it, that is a duplicate of an earlier transaction.  It is on 
a separate ledger.  But I may – I mean, I am not sure if you 
10 
can comment on that? 
MR HOLDEN:   No.  If you...  I will just double check that 
quickly.  I am afraid I do not see that duplication.  The 
confusion 
may 
arise 
Chair 
because 
there 
are 
three 
worksheets in this particular – say three spreadsheets to this 
particular workbook.   
 
And the – one of it is indicated as account 1 which is the 
third one.  Over is exactly the same as account 1(2).  So it is 
not actually duplication.   
 
I just think it is in the printing.  It was effectively printed 
20 
two copies of the same ledge sheet. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh.  But can I ask you to go to 
another transaction on page 626, the latest – to the last of 
the ZPMC transactions, 28 January 2013, page 626. 
MR HOLDEN:   28 January, is that correct? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 163 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   28 January 2013. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  Here at row 38 of the sheet 
entitled account 2 in the workbook. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Did you 626? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   626 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   626.  Okay I am there.  The date is 28 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   28 January 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Ja, I can see it.  Okay you may 
continue. 
10 
MR 
HOLDEN: 
 
 
We 
have 
an 
amount 
of 
– 
on 
the 
20t h of January, the two parties again are JJ Trading and 
Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries.  The motor payment 
was via bank in Dubai and the payment amount is reflected 
as 1 245 974 Dollars.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now these items when they 
appear on the Hawala Ledger, appears negative numbers.  
Can you explain to the Chair why that is the case? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  My understanding is that 
because the Hawala Ledger is a recordal of the running 
20 
balance between the Gupta enterprise and the World 
Windows Group.  This was effectively accounted as a 
payment that was originally tendered for the benefit of the 
Gupta enterprise rather than the Worlds Window Groups. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And why would that translate into 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 164 of 187 
 
a negative number in the ledger? 
MR HOLDEN:   Because that would require...  I always 
misdirect myself here.  The negative amount is an indication 
of a deduction from the running total and the running total is 
the amount that is owed by the Worlds Window Group to the 
Gupta enterprise where ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [laughs]  [Speaker unclear.]  The 
running total is the amount standing to the credit of the 
Worlds Window Group. 
MR HOLDEN:   Correct. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if they get paid an amount – if 
they receive an amount that is due to the Gupta enterprise 
...[intervenes]  
MR HOLDEN:   That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...then the amount standing to be 
a credit drops. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   While we are on these ledgers, 
can we look at two more payments, still on the same page, 
626. 
 
A 
payment 
made 
by 
CSR 
Locomotive 
on 
20 
29 December 2012. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  This appears at row 23 of 
the sheet account 2, and again, the date is indicated as the 
29t h of December 2012 and the two parties are indicated as 
Century, which I take to mean Central General Trading, and 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 165 of 187 
 
the counter party is CSR Locomotive.  Slightly miss-spelt.  
The mode of payment is banked or it does not actually give 
the rejection.  And then the amount is indicated as a 
negative of 5 932 934 Dollars. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And lower down the page, 
9 February 2013. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  At row 45, we have an entry 
again reflected as the 9 of February 2013 and the two 
parties are Century, which I take to mean Central General 
Trading and CSR Locomotive.  The mode of payment is bank.   
10 
 
And the figure that is given is a negative ledger of 
351 941 Dollars to which I take to mean that this is an 
amount that would eventually being accruing to the benefit of 
the Gupta enterprise. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Holden.  Now you 
have done an exercise of adding these two amounts together 
and reconciling them with the amounts projected as being 
due on the AmaBhungane spreadsheet.  Can you tell the 
Chair about that exercise? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  My calculations indicate that 
20 
those two payments together provided a total of 6 287 757 
Dollars.  Apology Chair.  I am actually reading from the 
wrong part of my notes here.  The actual total according to 
that Hawala Ledger is 6 284 876. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go to the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 166 of 187 
 
AmaBhungane spreadsheet where they project what the 
kickback should be and that is in Bundle 6B at 885.1 Chair. 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, also indicating on the screen here.  
We have a transaction which is indicated under the 95 Loco 
spreadsheet.  That is 95 Locomotive Project.  The date is 
given as the 21s t of December 2012.   
 
It is a payment from Transnet to CSR in relation to the 
95 
deal. 
 
A 
rand 
amount 
that 
is 
transferred 
is 
R 268 679 00,00.  A 20% kickback.  That is an estimated 
Rand value of R 53 735 800,00.   
10 
 
And then at the prevailing exchange rate at the time, 
that would be for the payment of 6 287 757 Dollars which is 
almost exactly the same as the total amounts that I have 
added on the Hawala Ledger occurring roughly the same 
dates as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just refresh the Chair’s 
memory as to the dates of those payments that we have just 
looked at on the Hawala Ledger? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  So the payment from 
Transnet 
to 
CSR, 
it 
takes 
place 
on 
the 
20 
21s t  of December 2012.  And then...  Okay let me look here.  
The first payment is made on the 29 t h of December 2012.  So 
it is eight days after they make payment from Transnet and 
then 
the 
second 
payment 
is 
made 
on 
the 
9t h of February 2013.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 167 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We now looked at the payments to 
the Gupta...  Sorry.  We have identified payments to the 
Worlds Window entities on the Dubai Ledgers.  Sorry, on the 
Hawala Ledgers.   
 
Can we now look at payments from the Worlds Window 
Group to the Gupta enterprise on a different set of ledges 
which you have assembled on Annexure O?   
 
We have discussed Annexure O before.  That starts at 
page 439.  And maybe, let us first go to Annexure O at page 
439.   
10 
 
And you can just refresh the Chair’s memory as to what 
Annexure O is. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  Annexure O which is an 
annexure we addressed in relation to the payments that were 
made by Liebherr.  At a certain date in December 2014, 
Sanjay Grover was directed to report the transactions in the 
four offshore entities, that is Global Corporation, Fidelity, 
Accurate and Gateway in a slightly different format.   
 
According to the bank account each sheet according to a 
particular company and indicated the transactions appearing 
20 
in 
different 
banks 
and 
bank 
accounts 
filed 
by 
those 
companies.   
 
I took all of those reports that were made by Sanjay 
Grover over a period of time and took all of those entries 
and put them into a single Excel spreadsheet so we can read 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 168 of 187 
 
all the transaction simultaneously. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And in your report, do you have 
extracted from Annexure O four payments that are made into 
Global Bank of Baroda Dirham account from an entry called 
JJT Century.  Can I ask you to go to page 256 to which and 
tell the Chair what that table is depicting? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  What I have indicated here 
is when I assessed Annexure O, I identified that there were 
four payments into Gupta enterprise companies in here, in 
particular, Global Corporation’s accounts.   
10 
 
I 
identified 
four 
separate 
payments 
which 
I 
have 
indicated in the table here.  The first taking place on the 
13t h of May 2014.  Second on the 14t h of May.  The third also 
on the 14t h of May and a fourth also on the 15 t h of May.   
 
All of them are made to Global Corporation.  Although it 
is worth noting that the first payment of two million Dirham 
was made to Global Corporations Bank of Baroda Dirham 
fixed account.   
 
And the remainder of the payments – remaining three 
payments went to Global Corporations Mashreq Bank Dirham 
20 
account.  The total value of those four payments, I indicated 
at the bottom of that table as 8 795 400 Dirham.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we can go to page 
258?  You have a similar analyses in relation to payments 
from JJT and related companies into Gupta accounts. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 169 of 187 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  This where m long list of 
company payments come into relevance.  What we have 
here, is a vast number of payments that are made from 
entries described as JJ and then another descriptor which I 
took to mean either one of these subsidiary companies as 
identified by name into various Gupta enterprise companies.   
 
So my analyses noted that there were 55 payments 
made into Global Corporations Dirham denominated Bank of 
Baroda account which were described as JJT Mangalam, JJT 
BRI, JJT Force Exum, JJT El-sa-bat(?), JJT Mahere(?) 
10 
General Trading, JJT World Vision, JJT Double X, JJT 
Carlton Coast and JJT Cash Ex-dif.   
 
The payments were all made between the 23rd of April 
and the 12t h of July 2014 and totalled 73 457 494 Dirham.   
 
As you will notice Chair, certain of those JJ entries refer 
to companies that I can identity.   
 
So one example is JJT Force Exum.  Another is JJT 
Carlton Coast which is a Dubai registered company.   
 
Some of the other entries I cannot identify but which I 
would probably – which I assume would mean that there are 
20 
certain other JJT related companies that we are not aware of 
according to company filings.   
 
Moving on to 248.b at paragraph B.  I noticed that 18 
payments were made into Global Corporation’s US Dollar 
denominated account at the Bank of Baroda between the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 170 of 187 
 
22n d of May 2014 and the 29 t h of October 2014.   
 
These payments were described either as JJT World 
Vision or JJT Golden Coast.  And the payments totalled 
11 118 926 Dollars.   
 
Chair, you will note at footnote 10 it falls within that – 
falls under those paragraphs.  I do indicate why I have come 
to believe that Golden Coast is a company that is linked to 
the World Windows network.   
 
For example, on the Golden Coast’s website that there is 
a sister company to Risk Metal FC which is a Worlds Window 
10 
Group company.   
 
At paragraph C I notice that two payments into Fidelity’s 
US Dollar denominated account at the Bank of Baroda worth 
2.48 million Dollars and described as JJT Golden Coast.   
 
These two payments are made on the 19t h of July and 
the 29t h of October 2014.   
 
It is worth noting that prior to these two payments, 
Fidelity transferred 1.8 million to JJT Golden Coast which 
was the precise value of the first deposit on the 12t h of July.  
This shows that money flowed both ways between the Gupta 
20 
enterprise and the Worlds Window JJT companies.   
 
I point to Annexure O.  At paragraph D, I noticed that 
five 
payments 
were 
made 
into 
a 
Reliable 
US 
Dollar 
denominated 
accounts 
and 
Reliable 
is 
another 
Gupta 
enterprise company at Mashreq Bank.  They were all made 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 171 of 187 
 
on the 1s t of May 2014.   
 
The payments were described either as JJT Force Exum 
or JJT Double X.  A total of 4 499 836, 44 Dollars.   
 
And under paragraph E, I identified 18 cash payments 
made by JJT between the 21s t of April 2014, on the 16t h of 
July 2014.  Total value of the cash transactions was 77 223 
769 Dirham.   
 
And then at paragraph 249, calculating of the prevailing 
exchange rate at the time between the Dirham and the 
Dollar, the total Dollars value for the above transfers and the 
10 
cash deposits made into the Gupta Enterprise accounts by 
JJT and its various subsidiaries was 62 832 549, 25 Dollars. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And these, of course, only the 
transactions that we can tract from the record that we see 
and those records are by no means exhausted. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We have...  There is one last JJT 
payment that we picked up through the HSBC records 
because it comes after the closure of the Dubai – Gupta 
leaks records.  Can I ask you to go to your Annexure RR at 
20 
page 991, Volume 6B, page 991? 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
MR HOLDEN:   999? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   991. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 172 of 187 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Apologies Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you describe to the Chair 
what you see there? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  This is an extract again 
from the HSBC transaction records where it says JJT.  And 
what 
we 
have 
indicated 
here 
is 
a 
single 
US 
Dollar 
denominated payment made on the 16t h of May 2014 for an 
amount of 10.5 million Dollars from CSR Zhuzhou Electrical 
Locomotive company to JJT Trading FCE.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Is there any significance to the 
10 
date and the amounts that you can infer? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  There are two significant things to 
notice here.  The first is the date which is only a few days 
prior to CSR and Regiment Asia and Tequesta entering into 
various Asian agreements and effectively displacing JJT 
Trading.  The ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just stop you there?  Chair, 
your reference for that would be the agreement Annexure B 
at Bundle 6A, page 304 which is the CNR Tequesta 
Agreement of 20 May 2014.  And Annexure C, at Bundle 6A, 
20 
page 316 which is the CNR Regiments Asia Agreement of the 
same date, 20 May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will you just repeat just please the page 
numbers?  I looked at the wrong bundle in here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is 304. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 173 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   304? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And 316 of the two cover pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, okay I have got that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair if you go, the first line 
of the following page, after each cover page says this 
agency agreement is dated 20 May 2014.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So those are concluded on 
20 May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And the other one is 316.  Ja. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the date that you have 
spoken to the amounts. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  The amounts are unusual in 
relation to the payments that were made by various 
manufacturers to either JJT/CJT or Regiments Asia or to 
Tequesta Group, in that, is a round figure and it is an amount 
that is not repeated anywhere else on the bank statements.   
 
I take that to understand, in fact, what I infer from that 
20 
payment and the context of the contracts that are then 
entered into thereafter, is that this must have been a 
payment 
that 
is 
made 
for 
a 
final 
settlement 
of 
the 
relationship between JJT and CSR or as an inducement from 
CSR to JJT to rolling the ships.  It is claims against the 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 174 of 187 
 
company as a final payment.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We talked on and off about how 
the relationship between the Worlds Window Group and the 
Gupta enterprise soured in the course of or had soured by, in 
the first quarter of 2015.   
 
Can I ask you just briefly in amplification of what you 
have already said in that regard, to go to Bundle 6B, page 
869.67 and describe to the Chair what you see there from 
869.67. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Thank you Chair.  At that page, we see an 
email that was sent from Griffin Dranath who is a Gupta 
enterprise employee and employed by Oakbay to Tony 
Gupta.   
 
And the subject is Arch House Agreement and attaches a 
number of Word documents.  And then the message reads: 
“Dear Tony for your interest.  The bank has asked 
Jaftha...” 
 
And I should clarify Jaftha here.  He is an accountant 
employed by the Gupta enterprise. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If I might correct you there?  I 
think you are talking about Jaftha, an attorney.  A W Jaftha 
and Associates.   
“...although he has confirmed that wants the loan to 
be paid to security shall be released and no need 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 175 of 187 
 
for any letter from the borrower. 
He is confirming it in writing.  I am waiting for the 
email.  Marthinus is also preparing the power of 
attorney.  Ronica is in a review meeting.  Once she 
is free, I will discuss the Mccorbit story also.  
Regards Ravinja(?).” 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct.  My apologies.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then over the page 869.68.  It 
is Volume B6.  Is this one of the attachments? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what is that document? 
MR HOLDEN:   This is a draft of a cancellation of a mining 
contract ship agreement between Arch House Trading which 
was the Worlds Window entity and it Idwala Coal (Pty) Ltd 
which was the Gupta enterprise entity. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go to down to 869.71, 
still in Bundle 6B. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is a cancellation of a mining contract to 
ship agreement between Arch House Trading and Idwala 
Coal (Pty) Ltd. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And down to page 869.74. 
MR HOLDEN:   This again is a draft cancellation document 
which cancels the mining contract ship agreement between 
Arch House Trading (Pty) Ltd and Tegeta Exploration and 
Resources (Pty) Ltd.   
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 176 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And maybe if we can also address 
the document at page 869.77 over the page from that, still 
Bundle 6B. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  What we have here is an 
email 
from 
V 
Singala 
@Gmail.com 
sent 
on 
the 
4t h of May 2015 to Tony Gupta with the subject Book 2 and 
an attachment which is styled as Book2.xlfx. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And over the page, is that the 
spreadsheet that was the attachment? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you briefly tell the Chair 
what that spreadsheet is describing? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  As far as I understand the 
sheet, it is a reconciliation of a contestation about who owes 
what to whom in relation to Arch House.  It is a loss and 
profit account.   
 
And we see at the second column, it says as per PGD(?) 
which is understand to mean Priyesh Goyal and as per us 
which I understand to mean the Gupta enterprise.   
 
And 
if 
you 
work 
through 
the 
sheet, 
there 
are 
20 
discrepancies in the amounts.  And I believe this to be an 
attempt to try and reconcile the amount outstanding relation 
to Arch House so that this relationship can be completed.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now Mr Holden, we have come 
very close to the end but I think it may be worth stepping 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 177 of 187 
 
back and taking stock of the full amount of the kickbacks 
that the various Transnet cranes...   
 
Sorry, various Transnet contracts provided for the Gupta 
enterprise, whether directly or through the Worlds Window 
Group.   
 
Let us look first at the amounts that went through the 
Worlds Window Group that we know of.  We know from – we 
are talking Dollars at this stage.   
 
Maybe the starting point is the workings document which 
we have come to and from several times but just to refresh 
10 
our memories on that document.   
 
And it is at...  Sorry.  It is at page 420 in Bundle 6A.  
Four, two, zero.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I found it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it has a set of calculations 
which we have been through several times.  For present 
purposes, let us just look at the number of total receivables 
which would be the total amount due on the kickback 
contracts in respect of the 359 and the 100 and 95 Projects.   
 
And we can maybe write that down on – as the first entry 
20 
on our table.  Can you tell the Chair what that amount is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair. That is R5 267 007 200,00. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So R5 267 007 200,00 [Five 
Billion Two Hundred and Sixty Six Million and Seven 
Thousand Two Hundred Rands]? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 178 of 187 
 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am at 420, is that where you are?  
Page?  Or did I...? 
MR HOLDEN:   It is 420. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   420, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   It is the column to the far right under total 
and it is the fourth entry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 5 267 007 200, is that the number? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, how much is that? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is indicated in million there but we 
have rendered it as five billion, two hundred and sixty 
seven million, seven thousand two hundred rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is the total in respect of what 
is in that column, the horizontal column. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, so that is the total in respect of the – 
the total kickbacks that were to be paid in relation to 
359 195 projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Ja. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now that, of course, was not the 
sum total of the Transnet contracts in which the Gupta 
enterprise had an interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Chaskalson, you say, Mr 
Holden, that is the total kickbacks but is there something 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 179 of 187 
 
that when I see on this document will tell me that is the 
total of kickbacks? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, the final column under 
total – if you go from the top line where it reads total, it is 
the – you have total with a blank cell and then you have a 
cell that reads ZAR 221 522.32 and in the cell underneath 
that reads 5 267.007.2 and if you read across to the left, 
Chair, that is described as total receivables for B from CSR 
for the whole projects, 20% for 95 and 21% for 259 and 
100. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is receivables the correct word for 
kickbacks? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think we need to qualify that.  
There could be receivables for things other than kickbacks 
but on this spreadsheet, Chair, what it refers to is the total 
amount that will ultimately be due in terms of the 
arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we know that this is a 
20 
spreadsheet of kickbacks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, Mr Holden, we have looked 
at a whole series of contracts.  This table just deals with 
the 100 locos – sorry, 359 locos and 95 locos.  Can you 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 180 of 187 
 
identify the other contracts that it does not cover? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, there are four other contracts of 
note.  The first was the contract in relation to the supplier 
by CNR of 232 diesel locomotives to Transnet and the 
amount of the receivables in that case were R2.088 billion. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just repeat that figure? 
MR HOLDEN:   I will actually give the full figure rather 
than a rounding, it is R2 088 870 974. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   2 088 870…? 
MR HOLDEN:   974. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   974.  How do you derive that 
figure?   
MR HOLDEN:   That is a calculation of 21% of the total 
contract value and that arrangement is stipulated in the 
contract. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And just to get the reference 
again?  Is that contract annexure B? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Annexure B on the 232 
locomotives and the relevant clause is at page 309 of 
20 
bundle 6A, clause 7. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what else is missing from 
that contract – our table? 
MR HOLDEN:   There was the kickbacks in relation to a 12 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 181 of 187 
 
year maintenance plan entered into between CSR and 
Transnet which is governed by the contract at annexure H.  
The 
total 
value 
of 
the 
kickback 
is 
indicated 
as 
R1 298 137 567.23. 
 
I 
will 
read 
it 
out 
again.  
1 298 137 567.23. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That was annexure H.  Chair, the 
reference for that payment – sorry, how do you derive that 
figure? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  That is a 21% commission on 
the contract value between Transnet and CSR. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that arrangement is 
stipulated in annexure H at clause 6.1.1 on page 398 of 
bundle 6A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then the next missing contract? 
MR HOLDEN:   We have the contract in relation to BEX, 
which was the relocation contract for relocation of certain 
production facilities.  The total amount that we are aware 
of that the Commission had alerted me to that that was 
paid under this contract was R67.2 million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, Chair, that is exclusive of VAT.  The 
actual amount was just in excess of 76 million but it 
included VAT.  That was a payment that was made onshore 
and it will be addressed when we bring evidence of the 
onshore kickbacks and money laundering. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 182 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that payment would flow 
from annexure E at page 346, which is the business 
development agreement of 25 April 2015 between CNR and 
Business Expansion Structure Products and Chair, you will 
recall that the payment terms of that contract gave BEX an 
interest in any amounts that Transnet could be persuaded 
to pay over a baseline price. 
 
Mr Holden, you mentioned four additional contracts 
beyond those reflecting on the workings document.  What 
10 
is the fourth? 
MR HOLDEN:   The fourth was for the spare parts for 
diesel locomotives and that indicated a flat payment would 
be made of 18.12 million dollars. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that contract would be 
annexure C and the relevant payment arrangement is at 
page 324, clause 7.2.   
Can I suggest that there is a fifth contract that we 
have not included, which is the ZPMC cranes contract 
because we have just been looking at the locomotives in 
20 
this table but of course the cranes were also providing 
kickbacks into the Gupta enterprise. What is the – we know 
the terms of that arrangement but we cannot translate them 
into rands and cents because we do not know what the 
benchmark of ZPMC was but what is the total amount of 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 183 of 187 
 
kickbacks that we have been to trace there? 
MR HOLDEN:   In relation to ZPMC using the various 
internal Gupta accounting ledgers I tracked a total of 4.25 
million dollars paid in relation to that contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   4.25? 
MR HOLDEN:   Million dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh, this is dollars.  The other 
amounts you gave were also dollars?  I wrote them in 
rands. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There is only one other dollar 
10 
amount, 
Chair, 
that 
is 
the 
18.12 
million 
on 
the 
maintenance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
The 
diesel 
maintenance 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if you add up your rands – let 
is add up our rands and our dollars separately.  What is the 
total amount of rands?  Can you give us that number? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  The total amount of rand 
20 
kickbacks that were due to be paid was eight billion, seven 
hundred and twenty one million, two hundred and fifteen 
thousand, seven hundred and forty one rand and sixty 
three cents.  For the record that is 8 721 215 741.63.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the two dollar amounts? 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 184 of 187 
 
MR HOLDEN:   The two dollar amounts are for 18.12 
million US dollars and for the second amount it is 4.25 
million dollars, although I will hesitate to add here, Chair, 
that under the 4.25 billion dollars that is only the number 
of transactions that we can trace.  I do not know for certain 
whether that was the total amount of transactions.  Adding 
those two together gives us a dollar amount of twenty two 
million, three hundred and seventy five thousand dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please just repeat that number, 22 
million…? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   22 750 000 dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we were to convert that 
figure into rands – let us find out what today’s rate is.  
15.01, call it 15.  I get R335 500 000. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat it, please? 
MR HOLDEN:   335 500 000.  Of course the prevailing rand 
exchange rate when those kickbacks were paid would have 
been different.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But it would be fair to say that 
the total amount of kickbacks provided for in the various 
Transnet contracts in relation to trains and locomotives, 
that we know about, would almost certainly have exceeded 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 185 of 187 
 
R9 billion? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair.  There is a very 
quick calculation I have done at the R15 exchange rate, 
the figure I get is nine billion, fifty six million, eight 
hundred and forty thousand, seven hundred and forty one 
rand 
and 
sixty 
three. 
 
For 
the 
record 
that 
is 
9 056 840 741.63. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And just to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, it 9 058 404 01…? 
MR HOLDEN:   I think we are missing a digit there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR HOLDEN:   It is 9 056. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   840 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   401. 
MR HOLDEN:   741.63. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 7 just before the last 4? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And jut to emphasise, we are 
20 
talking not about the value of the contracts, we are talking 
about the value of the kickbacks that were paid in respect 
of those contracts. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a lot of money. 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 186 of 187 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I think that concludes Mr 
Holden’s evidence for now.  We may concede that we will 
be able to call him back to deal with domestic money 
laundering as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we run into problems with some of the 
figures we will call you back. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   He has got a lot of homework, 
he has got to conclude his evidence, conclude his tables 
that he has to prepare for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay.  No, thank you very much, 
10 
Mr Holden, thank you very much.  So that will be that for 
today, 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and tomorrow evening do you have 
someone?  You do not have anything.  Okay, then Thursday 
during the day you have witnesses. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do, Chair, Thursday witnesses 
will be coming from McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and we will start normal time, ten 
o’clock? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, I understand that there is a 
Transnet witness who is – who will have to very briefly be 
led before the McKinsey witnesses come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I expect the McKinsey witnesses 
08 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 320 
 
Page 187 of 187 
 
to start from 11.30 after the tea break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, are you talking about Eskom? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, Eskom, I am sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  No, that is fine.  Okay, 
we will adjourn then for today.  Once again, thank you, Mr 
Holden. 
MR HOLDEN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 9 DECEMBER 2020
