PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 23 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Good

ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes we are.  The next witness if Mr 
Siyabonga Mahlangu.  Mr Mahlangu is represented by

Page 4 of 134 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR MAHLANGU:  So help me God. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mr Mahlangu good morning. 
MR MAHLANGU:  Morning Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Could I ask you please to turn to Bundle 
1 and if you could turn up page 169.   
MR MAHLANGU:  I am there. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  That on the face of it appears to be an 
affidavit of yours.  If I could ask you please to turn to 174 
would you confirm that this is your affidavit and that you 
signed it under oath on the 25 August 2020? 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then immediately following that at 
page 175 there is a so called supplementary affidavit of 
yours and that affidavit is signed at page 177 would you 
confirm that you signed the supplementary affidavit under 
oath on the 28 August 2020? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:  I confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And attached to that supplementary 
affidavit there are two annexures; Annexure SM A1 and SM 
A2.  That you find running from pages 178 through to page 
182 would you confirm those were the two annexures? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 5 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:  I confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mr Chairman may I ask that the affidavit 
appearing at Bundle 1 page – commencing at 169 be 
entered as Exhibit BB15.2.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Siyabonga Mahlangu 
starting at page 169 is admitted as Exhibit BB15.2.5. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mr Chairperson might I then ask that the 
affidavit – the supplementary affidavit of Mr Mahlangu 
commencing at Bundle 1 page 175 be entered as Exhibit 
BB15.2.6. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
supplementary 
affidavit 
of 
Mr 
Siyabonga Mahlangu starting at page 175 is admitted as 
Exhibit BB15.2.6. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mahlangu as 
I have explained to you I intend to lead you through these 
two affidavits and neither of which are particularly lengthy 
and go through the contents and once I have done that 
then I will have a series of questions for you.   
 
If we can start with your first affidavit you say that 
you are an adult male, non-practicing attorney and the 
20 
former special advisor to the then Minister of Public 
Enterprises Mr Gigaba, is that correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And for what period of time did you hold 
that position? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 6 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:  That would be 1 December 2011 until the 
end of last administration which – that administration I 
think ended somewhere in May 2014. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You go on to explain that you were 
invited 
by 
the 
commission 
to submit 
an 
affidavit 
in 
response to certain allegations that have been levelled 
against you Mr Mapoma. 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  That you deal with at paragraph 3. 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  And as you say the essence of those 
allegations are and I quote: 
“Mr Mahlangu called and put pressure on 
me to finalise the reinstatement of Mr Gama 
accusing me of causing the delay; telling 
me Number 1 wanted to get it done quickly. 
You furthermore alleged that he scolded me 
and told me never to call him again.” 
 
So you were asked to deal with that.  Correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  And furthermore:  
“The chairperson requested you to give a 
full account of what you know about how the 
settlement between Mr Gama and Transnet 
came about including indicating any person 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 7 of 134 
 
in government at the time or outside of 
government who to your knowledge played a 
role either directly or indirectly in the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama at Transnet or in 
the conclusion of the settlement agreement 
on the terms on which it was concluded.  In 
particular you were requested to indicate 
whether your knowledge anybody in Cabinet 
in 2011 played a role directly or indirectly in 
the reinstatement of Mr Gama or in the 
10 
conclusion of the settlement agreement on 
the terms on which it was concluded.” 
 
Correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Then what you do is you have three 
headings before you deal with Mr Mapoma.  The first 
heading is No Knowledge of the Contents and Details of 
the Settlement Negotiations and Consequent Agreement. 
 
Then 
you 
deal 
with 
persons 
involved 
in 
the 
settlement discussion. 
20 
 
Then you deal with the heading Nature of our 
Relationship with Gama at the time. 
 
And then at page 172 and further you deal with the 
allegations made against you by Mr Mapoma. 
 
You confirm that? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 8 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh you know how I was feeling 
when 
I 
could 
not 
pronounce 
your 
junior ’s 
surname 
correctly. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mapoma is Mapoma. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Ma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mapoma Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja M-a – Mapoma and I think with 
10 
Mkwanazi you tended to say Mkwanazi it is Mkwanazi 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mkwanazi without the a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mkwanazi yes.  I feel bad when anybody 
mispronounces my name and I feel bad when I pronounce 
other people’s names but I know that sometimes I struggle 
myself.  So – but I think we all just keep on trying. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So could I then ask you please to – to 
deal with the text under the heading No knowledge of the 
20 
contents and details of the settlement negotiations and 
consequent agreement. 
MR MAHLANGU:  Should I start at paragraph 6? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:  
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 9 of 134 
 
“I was not involved directly or indirectly in 
the settlement discussions leading to the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama.  The only insight 
I have on the discussions was when I was 
informed 
by 
Mr 
Mkwanazi 
the 
then 
Chairperson of Transnet and acting Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
at 
the 
time 
that 
the 
company intended to reinstate Mr Gama.  
Due to the passage of time I cannot recall 
the exact reasons for or context of my 
10 
discussions 
with 
Mr 
Mkwanazi. 
 
He 
conferred with me on a variety of matters in 
my capacity as a special advisor to the 
Minister 
and 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
the 
Chairman of Transnet on things that he 
needed 
me 
to 
convey 
to 
the 
Minister 
informally or prior to any formal process.  I 
recall that during my conversation with Mr 
Mkwanazi I advised that it was prudent for 
Transnet 
to 
seek 
legal 
advice 
on 
the 
20 
company’s proposed cause of action.  We 
discussed 
a 
few 
options 
on 
imminent 
lawyers – on imminent labour lawyers that 
he could consult.  One of the names that 
came up is that of Mr Sbu Gule who at the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 10 of 134 
 
time was a partner or director at Deneys 
Reitz 
now 
Norton 
Rose. 
 
I 
offered 
suggestions because of my familiarity with 
the legal profession.  At – it all remained 
with the Chairman on how he intended to 
proceed.  I did not recall whether Mr – 
whether the Minister was officially briefed 
by the Transnet Board of Directors on its 
intention or decision to reinstate Mr Gama.  
If this happened ordinarily there would be 
10 
correspondence to this effect addressed to 
the Minister.  This correspondence would be 
considered 
by 
the 
Department’s 
unit 
responsible for Transport Enterprises and 
one for Legal and Governance.  The Deputy 
Directors’ General who headed these units 
would make suitable recommendations to 
the 
Minister 
through 
a 
decision 
memorandum.  This memorandum would get 
to the Minister via the office of the Director 
20 
General. 
 
This 
type 
of 
internal 
correspondence 
is 
officially 
kept 
and 
registered by the Department’s Registry.” 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright and then you go on to deal with 
the persons involved in the settlement discussions and you 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 11 of 134 
 
record that save as I state in earlier paragraphs of this 
affidavit: 
“I 
have 
no 
personal 
knowledge 
of 
the 
settlement discussions between Mr Gama 
and Transnet and the persons who were 
involved in such discussions.” 
And you say that you only saw the settlement 
agreement 
when 
it 
was 
provided 
to 
you 
by 
the 
commission’s acting secretary.  Is that correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:  I confirm. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then at paragraph 10 you state that: 
“Save as stated in this affidavit I do not 
know any person in government at the time 
or outside government who played a role 
either 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
in 
the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama at Transnet or in 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
settlement 
agreement.” 
 
You say: 
“In particular I do not know of anybody in 
20 
Cabinet in 2011 who played a role directly 
or indirectly in the reinstatement of Mr 
Gama or in the conclusion of the settlement 
agreement on the terms on which it was 
concluded.” 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 12 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:  I confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then you go on to deal with the 
nature of your relationship with Mr Gama at the time and 
you state that you commenced work as a special advisor in 
December 2010.  The settlement agreement with Mr Gama 
you say was concluded on the 22 February 2011 and you 
state that by this time I was familiarising myself with my 
work environment.  You had not met Mr Gama or engaged 
with issues pertaining to hi employment or dismissal.  Is 
that right? 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And you say: 
“Prior to joining government I had – I had 
not had any dealings with Mr Gama whether 
professionally or socially.” 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then for the balance of the affidavit 
you deal in the main with the allegations made against you 
by Mr Mapoma.  Do you want to deal with those paragraphs 
please? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:  Thank you Mr Myburgh I will do so.   
“Mapoma’s allegations are contained in 
paragraphs 
26 
to 
27 
of 
his 
affidavit.  
Principally he alleges that 
1. I pressured him to expedite Mr Gama’s 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 13 of 134 
 
reinstatement. 
2. He scolded for doing so and advised me 
never to call him again. 
3. He only knew me professionally. 
Given that at the time I was still new in 
my job I could not have pressured Mapoma.  I 
had no reason or motive to pressure Mapoma 
or anyone.  In any event my role or function 
did 
not 
involve 
pressuring 
officials.  
Furthermore my disposition towards Mapoma 
10 
and his complementary social network would 
not permit me to act rudely towards him or 
pressure him in the manner that he alleges.  I 
was taken by surprise to learn of these 
allegations.   
 
First Mapoma’s recount of the nature of the 
relationship that existed between us is not 
entirely correct. During my time as partner at 
Mahlangu 
Nkomo 
Mabandla 
Ratshimbilani 
Attorneys MNMR I interacted with Mapoma 
20 
frequently 
and 
developed 
a 
professional 
relationship 
that 
was 
based 
on 
mutual 
respect.  I would seek his counsel on how our 
firm could increase its flow of work from 
Transnet.  He gave me good advice and whilst 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 14 of 134 
 
favourably disposed towards me.  This type of 
professional proximity continued even after 
our 
firm 
merged 
into 
Edward 
Nathan 
Sonnenbergs.   
 
Secondly we had a common social circle.  In 
his affidavit Mapoma underplays his social 
circle and its effect on how I would view him.  
This circle consisted of friends predominantly 
from Umtata and surrounding areas.  Some of 
these friends were attorneys.  I developed a 
10 
strong bond with them. Some of them I know 
from as early as 1999.  Mapoma’s socialised 
with this circle – social circle.  I may not 
remember the specific events but I do recall 
meeting him at some of the social gatherings 
where I was invited. 
 
In this social circle Mapoma was regarded 
as 
one 
of 
the 
elder 
brothers 
and 
was 
accorded 
commensurate 
respect. 
 
I 
also 
treated him with the respect I reserved for my 
20 
older siblings.   
 
I was introduced to this social circle by a 
friend who then worked as a legal advisor for 
a client of Webber Wentzel where I did my 
articles. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 15 of 134 
 
 
Our friendship grew and persists to this day.  
Mapona errs in his affidavit that I went to 
university with any of the friends in the social 
circle.   
 
I submit that the support Mapoma gave to 
MNMR the intersection between one of our 
social circles and the nature of my social 
interaction with him forbade me from being 
rude to him or putting him – or putting any 
pressure on him. 
10 
 
This would have resulted in backlash in an 
important friendship circle and would have 
adversely affected my standing as an attorney 
amongst the community of lawyers in that 
social circle. 
 
I care about my reputation and standing 
amongst my friends and peers. 
 
Thirdly 
I 
had 
no 
motive 
or 
reason 
to 
pressure or call Mapoma about the pace or 
details of the settlement between Mr Gama 
20 
and Transnet. 
 
Lastly if I had any questions which I did not 
I would have raised these with Mr Mkwanazi – 
with Mkwanazi.  To the best of recollection 
Mapoma 
was 
a 
few 
levels 
down 
in 
the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 16 of 134 
 
Transnet 
Executive 
Management 
Hierarchy 
which meant that I would not encounter him in 
the normal course of my duties as special 
advisor to the Minister. 
 
I have never said Mapoma as he alleges 
Number 1 wanted to get it done quickly.  In 
the South African political lexicon the term 
Number 1 is usually used to refer to a sitting 
President of the Republic. 
 
I assume that in his allegation Mapoma 
10 
ascribes the same meaning to this term.  If 
that is so Mapoma’s allegation is without 
basis.  In my normal use of language I do not 
refer to a sitting President as Number 1.  In 
particular 
I 
have 
not 
referred 
to 
former 
President Zuma as Number 1. 
 
In my ordinary use of language – or I have 
not referred to former President Zuma as 
Number 1 in my ordinary use of language.” 
 
Pardon me for the typo. 
20 
“What comes naturally to me in my 
conversations is to refer to President Zuma 
using his initials, surname or turn names.   
For avoidance of doubt I wish to 
state 
that 
I 
have 
never 
used 
former 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 17 of 134 
 
President 
Zuma’s 
name 
as 
alleged 
by 
Mapoma. 
 
I 
have 
never 
met 
or 
had 
conversations 
of 
any 
substance 
with 
President 
Zuma 
other 
than 
in 
large 
government gatherings. 
He has never instructed or requested 
me to put pressure on anyone to finalise the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama. 
Furthermore my erstwhile principle 
has never instructed me to put pressure of 
10 
follow 
up 
with 
anyone 
regarding 
the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama. 
At no point did the Minister advise 
me that the President wished to have Mr 
Gama reinstated expeditiously or that the 
dispute with him be resolved expeditiously. 
All I recall is that after the board had 
decided to reinstate Mr Gama but prior to 
him resuming his duties at Transnet the 
Minister requested a meeting with him.  I 
20 
was not part of this meeting." 
Thank you Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright.  Could we then please go to your 
supplementary affidavit?  Your supplementary affidavit we 
see was signed three days after your initial affidavit, 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 18 of 134 
 
correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And in your supplementary affidavit you 
effectively repeat the first four paragraphs of your first 
affidavit.  We need not go through that.  Perhaps I can ask 
you please to pick up at paragraph 5 and deal with the – 
the next one and third or one a half pages. 
MR MAHLANGU:  Thank you.   
“After I submitted the affidavit to the 
commission I discovered two emails in my 
10 
personal email.  One dated 18 January 2011 
Annexure SMA1 hereto and the other 4 
February 2011 Annexure SMA2 which are 
relevant to what I was required to answer in 
my main affidavit. 
These emails refer albeit briefly to 
the 
settlement 
negotiations 
between 
Mr 
Gama and Transnet.  I came upon the two 
emails in my personal email box in the 
course of my preparation of a separate 
20 
affidavit that I have been invited by the 
commission to submit and which relates to 
my employment at the Department of Public 
Enterprises 
in 
my 
role 
in 
the 
events 
identified by the commission. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 19 of 134 
 
Their omission in my affidavit of 25 
August 2020 was not deliberate.  The two 
emails are from me to then Minister of 
Public Enterprises Mr Malusi Gigaba.  I did 
not remember the communication to Minister 
Gigaba as recorded in – I did not remember 
the communication to Minister Gigaba as 
record in the email.  I still do not have an 
independent recollection of it.   
Although 
is 
Annexure 
SMA1 
I 
10 
promised the Minister that I would obtain 
the settlement agreement for him and to 
brief him on it.  I did not do so and in fact 
saw the settlement agreement for the first 
time when it was provided to me by the 
commission. 
In SMA1 I also advised the Minister 
to brief the President about Transnet’s 
intended settlement with Mr Gama.  I do not 
remember the reasons why I advised the 
20 
Minister to do so but in hindsight I think that 
it 
was 
probably 
because 
of 
the 
public 
interest that the matter had invoked at the 
time.” 
I think the word was supposed to be evoked. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 20 of 134 
 
“I can think of no reason I have no 
knowledge 
whether 
Minister 
Gigaba 
discussed the matter with the President – 
with President Zuma. 
In SMA2 I set out my advice to the 
Minister 
on 
matters 
that 
Mr 
Mafika 
Mkwanazi the then Chairperson of Transnet 
wished to convey to him through me.  I do 
not recall me and Mr Mkwanazi discussing 
the terms of the settlement with Gama in 
10 
any detail and in fact have no independent 
recollection of the discussions with him that 
preceded my email to the Minister. 
In my main affidavit I state that in 
January 
2011 
I 
would 
not 
have 
been 
involved with the settlement discussions 
because at the time I was newly employed 
as the Minister special advisor. 
SMA1 as SMA2 show that I had had 
no 
dealings 
or 
discussions 
with 
Mr 
20 
Mkwanazi 
around 
the 
18 
– 
around 
18 
January 2011 about two weeks after the 
Christmas break and around 4 February 
2020. 
These emails are the only reminder 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 21 of 134 
 
to me that I had 
discussions with Mr 
Mkwanazi 
and 
the 
Minister 
separately 
before the settlement was concluded. 
I had no recollection of any other 
discussion 
with 
Mr 
Mkwanazi 
or 
the 
Minister.  I reiterate that I was new in my 
job and could not have been involved in the 
settlement discussions in any substantive 
way.  Any discussion with Mr Mkwanazi on 
the dispute between Mr Gama and Transnet 
10 
was intended for me to convey to the 
Minister Transnet’s position on the matter. 
Should 
I 
come 
across 
any 
documentation or correspondence that may 
be of assistance to the commission I will 
submit it at the earliest opportunity.” 
ADV MAROLEN:  I beg your pardon Chair I am so sorry for 
interrupting.  I see the date 4 February 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV MAROLEN:  I see the date 4 February 2020 that is 
20 
paragraph 9 of Mr Mahlangu’s affidavit.  I – I – could you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja that must be 2011. 
ADV MAROLEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAROLEN:  2012. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 22 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:  2011 
CHAIRPERSON:  2011 ja. 
ADV MAROLEN:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then Mr Mahlangu do you want to 
deal at all with these two annexures?  If you go to page 
178 Annexure SMA1.  The only part of that annexure or 
email that deals with Mr Gama is the second bullet point.  
Is that correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And it reads: 
10 
“I understand that Transnet may be 
nearing a settlement with Mr Gama.  I will 
obtain the details of the settlement and 
brief you accordingly.  I suggest that you 
socialise the President and his key aides 
[formal 
and 
informal] 
on 
the 
proposed 
settlement. 
 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
the 
forthcoming 
board 
should 
consider 
and 
authorise it.” 
 
Is that correct? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:  That is correct. 
ADV 
MYBURGH: 
 And 
then Annexure 
SMA2 
– 
first 
Annexure – there was an email sent on the 18 January.  
The second one SMA2 is an email sent on the 4 February.  
Now I would just ask you to confirm.  This – this email is 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 23 of 134 
 
lengthier document certainly in relation to Mr Gama but it 
deals with two things.  That is the settlement with Mr Gama 
and also the issue that arose about Mr Gama wanting to 
apply for the then vacant position of Group Chief Executive 
of Transnet.  Is that correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.  I considered the two 
matters intertwined and interlinked. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And you, as you say, you 
considered them intertwined.  You deal with them on that 
basis in the email and you presented the minister with the, 
10 
what you considered to be various options.  Is that correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You wish to highlight any particular 
aspect of the advice that you gave the minister? 
MR MHLANGU:   I would love to, Mr Myburgh.  Should I just 
read it into the record? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  You can, if you wish.  
Otherwise, you could just summarise what you considered to 
be important. 
MR MHLANGU:   I think the... Chairperson, with your leave.  
20 
I would like to read it all into the record because it discloses 
my state of mind and what I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...though of at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can read it. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 24 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
“Dear Minister.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 You 
are 
starting 
with 
the 
one 
of 
18t h January? 
MR MHLANGU:   No, the 4t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the 4 t h.   
MR MHLANGU:   The first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
“Dear Minister.  At my meeting with chair, he 
acknowledged that by advertising the GCE position 
was a mistake.   
In light of Gama’s response to the advert, the board 
seeks guidance on the way forward. 
Despite the ongoing without prejudice discussions, 
G insist on staying on the list.   
He was informed through his lawyer of an offer to 
reinstate him with no loss of benefits and a 
20 
contribution towards his legal costs. 
It is my recommendation that the issue regarding his 
discipline and the appointment of the DEC be dealt 
with separately.   
His challenge to his dismissal should not belay the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 25 of 134 
 
appointment of the new GCE. 
In light of the current impasse on the case regarding 
his dismissal, the board should go ahead and deal 
with the appointment of the GCE. 
The following options seems to present themselves. 
1. The board should not interview G but proceed to 
make 
a 
recommendation 
on 
the 
available 
candidates.  The board may base its view on the 
quality of service that it received.   
G may challenge the appointment of the new GCE 
10 
as flawed, arguing that he is entitled to be heard 
by the committee because he was previously 
shortlisted. 
I am persuaded that the aforegoing argument is not 
like to sway a court to come to G’s aid but it is likely 
to require political management. 
2. The board should interview him and not shortlist 
him for consideration by the minister. 
The risk highlighted in one above, equally apply.   
3. The board should interview him and shortlist him 
20 
for consideration by the minister.  The minister 
may proceed and appoint his choice.  It is still 
likely that G will challenge the process and allege 
that the appointed candidate was a ...[indistinct]  
This may attract unnecessary attention to the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 26 of 134 
 
minister.  The minister should avoid being a 
bearer of bad news.   
In my view, there is a need to contain the drama 
at Transnet level.  In either scenario, it is likely 
that G will sue.  He has no right to be appointed 
GCE and therefore any likelihood of an urgent 
interdict succeeding, is very minimal. 
I 
further 
recommend 
that 
G 
should 
not 
be 
interviewed 
or 
shortlisted 
and 
that 
way 
the 
minister does not have to deal with him. 
10 
A Transnet act in this regard will constitute a valid 
act in law upon which the minister may base his 
action. 
If he wish to interdict the minister, he will have to 
show that the minister will infringe one of his 
legally recognised rights. 
In order to succeed in that argument, he will have 
to show that he has prospects of success in 
overturning the recommendation to the minister. 
In light of the fact and circumstances surrounding 
20 
G’s case, it is not likely that a court will approve 
such a proposition. 
Further, there is a great likelihood that the leaks 
of the case between him and Transnet emanate 
from his side. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 27 of 134 
 
If such speculation holds, his interviews and short 
listing will arise publicity that is unnecessary and 
may result in unintended political status. 
The matters surrounding his dismissal may be 
dealt with by the GCE and the board going 
forward.  It seems unavoidable that he may sue 
but it is a loss hood I think we should be prepared 
for and we should defend.   
I await your guidance.” 
 
Thank you, Mr Myburgh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Mr Mhlango.  Perhaps it 
completes your two affidavits.  Perhaps I could ask... start 
my 
questioning 
by 
dealing 
with 
the 
need 
for 
the 
supplementary affidavit that arose.   
 
You confirmed that you were asked to give a full account 
of what you know about how the settlement agreement came 
about, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we know that that request was 
separate from the request for you to deal with Mr Mapoma’s 
20 
allegations.   
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you look at your first affidavit.  If I 
could invite you pleas to go to page 169? 
MR MHLANGU:   Page? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 28 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One, six, nine. 
MR MHLANGU:   One, six...? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One, six, nine. 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you turn to page 170.  Now what we 
know is that you deal with Mr Mapoma from page 172 
onwards.  I just want to point out to you that in your first 
affidavit, the only thing that you say that you knew about 
potential 
settlement 
is 
your 
initial 
discussion 
with 
Mr Mkwanazi, correct? 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean, as for the rest of your affidavit 
it just says that you were placed under no pressure.  You do 
not know of the involvement of anyone else.  So your 
knowledge in this affidavit is limited to the initial discussion 
with Mr Mkwanazi, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Your recollection of that discussion, 
though, appears quite detailed.  If we go to the text of 
paragraph 6, you say that you were informed by Mr Mkwanazi 
20 
that the company intended to reinstate Mr Gama.  You 
remember that? 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes, sir.  I remember the text.  Like I said, I 
am dependent on the text. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And then what you do is, you go 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 29 of 134 
 
on to explain what happened after he told you that.  You say: 
“I cannot recall the exact reason or the context of 
my discussion...” 
 
And you go on to say: 
“I recall that during my discussion... 
 
Presumable, that is your discussion referred to in 
paragraph 6, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mhlango? 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes, I am trying to follow paragraph 6.  Yes, 
10 
sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“I 
recall 
that 
during 
my 
conversation 
with 
Mr Mkwanazi, I advised that it was prudent for 
Transnet to seek legal advice.” 
 
And you discussed a few options of eminent labour 
lawyers, the proposal of Mr Gule came up.  So you remember 
that initial discussion and the advice that you gave about Mr 
Gule? 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes, sir. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what you fail to mention in your 
first affidavit.  You do not mention that you had other 
discussions with Mr Mkwanazi about Mr Gama, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   I failed, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Now what do you mention that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 30 of 134 
 
based on those other discussions, you then interacted with 
and advised the minister about the Gama issue.  You did not 
mention that either. 
MR MHLANGU:   That... at the time when I drafted the 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...that I do not recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but your answer to my question 
is, you accept that you did not mention it.  You limited your 
knowledge to paragraphs 6 and 7. 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you accept that in relation to the 
first and initial discussion, you have a relatively detailed 
recall of it? 
MR MHLANGU:   Mr Myburgh, I think what needs to be clear.  
I do not know if it was one discussion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   It was a long time ago.  But there are 
features that I recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
20 
MR MHLANGU:   So I would not us to, to stick to a meeting.  
It could have been one, two or three.  I spoke to 
Mr Mkwanazi often.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
MR MHLANGU:   But that... what I mentioned about that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 31 of 134 
 
discussion is what I could recall as I was answering this 
article. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you read your affidavit, you will 
see that you are referring to one discussion.   
MR MHLANGU:   Yes, it is probably... yes, I probably 
referred to one discussion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   But as I said to you, I recall... as I actually 
preface in my affidavit ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   ...that some of these things, I want to... the 
sequence may be a bit tricky. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   But I recall the essence Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I understand that.  You recall the 
essence, 
it 
seems, 
of 
your 
initial 
discussion 
with 
Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MHLANGU:   Of the discussions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So let us go back to the fact that 
you also do not mention then in the first affidavit that based 
20 
on those discussion with Mr Mkwanazi, you then interacted 
with the minister and advised the minister in relation to them.  
You did not mention that. 
MR MHLANGU:   I did not. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Then 
what 
we 
see 
in 
your 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 32 of 134 
 
supplementary affidavit is that you put up two emails which 
show that you had further interaction with Mr Mkwanazi and 
that you advised the minister accordingly.   
 
But what is important is that in your supplementary 
affidavit, you seem to state that you have no independent 
recollection of the events in those emails, all of the emails.  
Is that correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.  Insofar as you look there, 
the two affidavits together Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us go to... so just let me, so that 
10 
everyone is clear.  When the situation like this arises, I 
suppose there is one of two things that a person can do.   
 
The one is you can say:  I have come across these 
emails.  I did not attached them to my first affidavit.  I am 
sorry.  They have now triggered my memory.  They have 
refreshed my memory and now I remembered what happened 
and this is what happened.   
 
Or you could adopt the position, which you seemed to, 
and that is:  Well, I came across these emails.  I do not have 
any independent recollection of these emails or of the events 
20 
that are dealt with them in them.   
 
But I accept that they are my emails and I accept that if 
that is what is recorded I must have had the discussion.  Is 
that right? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is... the second option is what I... that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 33 of 134 
 
is my situation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but you confirm that... so, your 
evidence - because this is important – your evidence now 
before the Commission is:  Yes, here are the two emails.  But 
I have no independent recollection of writing those emails of 
sending those emails or of the content of the emails. 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And perhaps I can just show 
you where you say that because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are sure that is the position 
10 
Mr Mhlangu? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct, Chair.  And when I 
discovered 
the 
emails, 
I 
immediately 
contacted 
the 
Commission and I also contacted my senior counsel to say... 
because I was preparing for a different affidavit and then I 
came across this.  And I do not know if that is all of that but 
that is what... this is as far as I can recall.  I would not have 
omitted them had I seen them in the first email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MHLANGU:   And the memory they jog is consistent with 
20 
what I have said in the main affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, we will come to the 
significance of that in a moment.  So I need not take you to 
the various passages where you say that you accept that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 34 of 134 
 
your version is:  I have no independent recollection of writing 
the email, sending the email or of the contents of the email. 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And then, I suppose what you 
must accept, if we go to page 171, paragraph 11 is where 
you say in the third line: 
“By this time... 
 
And 
now 
you 
are 
talking 
about 
the 
time 
of 
the 
settlement. 
“...I was still familiarising myself with my new work 
10 
environment.  I had not met Mr Gama or engaged 
with 
issue 
pertaining 
to 
his 
employment 
or 
dismissal.” 
 
Well, you must accept then, albeit it that you have no 
independent recollection, but on the face of the two emails 
that you have put up, that statement is false, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact, what the email shows, albeit 
that you have no independent recollection is, that you have 
had a series of discussions with Mr Mkwanazi.  You had 
20 
reported on those discussions to your boss.  And in fact, you 
had given your boss advice in relation to them.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in fact, you had... you say you 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 35 of 134 
 
remember none of this.  But in relation to the Gama 
settlement, you had actually advised Minister Gigaba that he 
should socialise the president, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   Not on the details but on the... on chance 
that is proposed cause of action. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So just so that I understand.  Are 
you now remembering this or are you just saying what you 
...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   Based on the document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  You told the president – and we 
10 
are going to come to the detail – but you advised the 
minister.  You said... your advice was:  I suggest you 
socialise the president.  Correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have no recollection of that? 
MR MHLANGU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then what you did just now 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe...  I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  Before 
we get further.  What did it mean to say the minister should 
20 
socialise the president. 
MR MHLANGU:   To make him ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got an idea but ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   To make him...  To make him aware 
...[intervenes]  
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 36 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I want to hear it from you. 
MR MHLANGU:   To make him aware of what Transnet is 
about to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is reinstate Mr Gama? 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come back to the 
advice that you gave but I am just testing this.  You have no 
independent recollection.   
 
And then in relation, as you say, the second email 
10 
reflects there were two things.  There was the Gama 
settlement and there was the issue of him of wanting to be a 
candidate for a promotion.   
 
And you then advised the minister and you have read 
that email in some detail about the various options, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have no independent 
recollection of that? 
MR MHLANGU:   No. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
But 
you 
have 
a 
recollection 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   I have got some triggers. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, that is what you say in your 
affidavit. 
MR MHLANGU:   No, when I... I think you are interpreting it 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 37 of 134 
 
very narrowly. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   To the extent that is there in that thing, I 
remember. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, fair enough. 
MR MHLANGU:   That is what I am saying. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
MR MHLANGU:   But I do not have other things that... I have 
been thinking long and hard about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes.  I have been trying to remember it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Mhlangu, I am just going to put 
to you what you have now agreed to twice before.  You have 
no independent recollection of writing the email or sending 
the email or of the contents of it but you accept that if that is 
what you wrote, well then it happened. 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is essentially what you say. 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you have no independent 
20 
recollection of any of that happening. 
MR MHLANGU:   I think that appears too strong.  I think, 
when I say I have no independent, I am saying, I do not have 
command of the full facts. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, in your affidavit, you say you 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 38 of 134 
 
have no independent recollection. 
MR MHLANGU:   Mister... there is no inconsistency with 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Fair enough.  But you 
somehow have a very clear recollection of your first 
discussion with Mr Mkwanazi, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   Like I said.  I do not know if it is the first 
Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
MR MHLANGU:   There was a discussion where he told me 
10 
something and I said:  Go and get legal advice.  There is a 
discussion like that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes and we are going to come to that 
because we know that that must have been at the outset.  So 
in fairness to you, we will come to the date line and timeline.  
So that is your... but what you do have a very clear 
recollection about it, if I understand, is that you did not 
phone Mr Mapoma.   
MR MHLANGU:   I think I need to get to that before 
discussing Mapoma, my recollection here is.  I do not recall 
20 
making a phone call, a physical phone call, right?  I knew 
Mr Mapoma and he knew me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   Right.  So what I deny is that I made a 
phone call to pressure Mr Mapoma. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 39 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you somehow have a very clear 
recollection of that? 
MR MHLANGU:   I have a very clear recollection because 
that is something... it is a life event.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   Because  Mr Mapoma ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...he was very important to me at the time 
in my circle, in my being. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   So if I have any tension with him, I would 
remember it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And I presume that when you 
were carrying out your duties as a special advisor to 
Mr Gigaba, you would also remember them. 
MR MHLANGU:   I am talking about ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   Not all of them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  And these ones, you simply 
cannot remember? 
20 
MR MHLANGU:   Mr Mapoma – it is a specific instance. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   Like I am saying.  Until to this day 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 40 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   ...I battle to understand why Mr Mapoma 
would say that about me.  And like is say to you, I had no, no 
motive ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   No intention.  And that they... I could not 
have picked up the call for the intention of pressuring 
Mr Mapoma. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Mr 
Mhlangu, 
you, 
I 
think 
misunderstand what I am driving at.  We are going to come 
to your version about Mr Mapoma but essentially what you 
10 
have said is you have a very clear recollection of not having 
called him.  Is that right?  And pressurised him. 
MR MHLANGU:   I recall that I did not pressurise him 
...[indistinct]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that you understand.  To this 
very day, Mr Mapoma also cannot understand why you deny 
having had that discussion with him. 
MR MHLANGU:   I am telling you that it would not have 
happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, we will come 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   It is improbable. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I am going to suggest to you that 
it is highly probable but in order to get to that, we need to 
look at the chronology.  So let us start off then with the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 41 of 134 
 
dismissal of Barbara Hogan of the Minister of Public 
Enterprises.  Now as I understand it.  You have the doctorate 
in Political Science.  Is that correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is incorrect.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What doctorate do you have? 
MR MHLANGU:   Administrative Law. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  And as I understand it, you are 
someone who follows politics and in fact, decided that you 
wanted to pursue a career for a point in time in that field.  Is 
that right? 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   Vaguely, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MHLANGU:   Vaguely, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now let me just summarise for 
you the evidence of Ms Hogan.  She says that at the time 
that Mr Gama was facing disciplinary action in 2009, and we 
know that he was suspended on the 1s t of September 2009, 
she approached former President Zuma to confirm the board 
nomination of a Mr Maseka as the new Transnet Chief 
Executive.  You have heard of this testimony, presumable. 
20 
MR MHLANGU:   No, I was not following. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And he wanted Mr Gama to be 
appointed and he refused to make any board appointments, 
pending the outcome of Mr Gama’s disciplinary inquiry.  You 
have not heard of that either? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 42 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   I have no knowledge of that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I mean ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   All I know is, is that the position of GCE 
became vacant when Ms Maria Ramos left. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.   
MR MHLANGU:   Up until. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what we do know – and I am 
surprised you say you do not know anything about this 
because what we do know, roundabout this time there was 
much political support for Mr Gama that was played out in 
10 
the press.  Do you not remember that? 
MR MHLANGU:   That I do remember. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   I do not remember the detail of Ms Hogan’s 
testimony. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Good. 
MR MHLANGU:   I do not remember how she dealt with it.  
What I recall is that there was a lot of drama ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...surrounding Mr Gama. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And there was a lot of political support 
for him.  I can take you to the portions in the record if 
necessary.  But there were certain politicians that came out 
in his favour.  There were trade unions that came out in his 
favour.  I mean, Mr Malema also came out in his favour. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 43 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   I accept that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then after Mr Gama was 
dismissed at the end of June of 2010, it is a year or so later, 
Ms Hogan then approached former President Zuma about the 
appointment of a new board and she made that approach, 
according to her evidence, in August/September.   
 
Only to then be relieved of her position with the fact 
from the 31s t of October 2010.  You would have, no doubt, 
followed that in the media. 
MR MHLANGU:   I followed the race but I did not follow, 
10 
specifically, Ms Hogan. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but your boss then ended up 
replacing her the next day. 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes.  But ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But it is not something that you were 
not aware of. 
MR MHLANGU:   He was not my boss at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   Remember that time, I was practicing law. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.   
20 
MR MHLANGU:   So I did not follow specifically what was 
happening at Public Enterprises.  I would follow the news 
like everybody else. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.   
ADV MAROLEN:   I beg your pardon and I am sorry to... 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 44 of 134 
 
Mr Myburgh for interrupting.  But I think Mr Mahlangu has 
said, he has not seen the evidence of Ms Hogan and I do not 
know if the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have lowered your voice.  I 
cannot hear you. 
ADV MAROLEN:   I beg your pardon, Chair.  Chair, 
Mr Mahlangu has repeatedly said that he has not seen the 
evidence of Ms Hogan.  And questions are being put to him 
from that evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he was being asked whether he 
10 
became aware of that from the media, I think. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  Mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he said he ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he was aware but not of details because 
he was not in the Department of Public Enterprises at the 
time.  Is that correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what we know is that Mr Hogan 
was relieved of her position on the 31s t of October 2010.  
20 
You might have read it about that in the press.  I am not 
trying to pin you to the date.  But you recall having read 
about that? 
MR MHLANGU:   It was not just Ms Hogan.  There was a 
whole shopping list of ...[intervenes]  
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 45 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Absolutely. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...of reshuffle.  So I would not have 
specifically known what reasons and what is not but 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we know is that Mr Gigaba was 
then appointed as the new minister with effect from the 
1s t of November 2010.   
MR MHLANGU:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So he replaced Ms Hogan.   
MR MHLANGU:   Correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And a new board was then appointed 
by him and that board took up its duties in December of 
2010. 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.  That was the same time as 
I arrived. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  And then we know that Mr Gama 
was reinstated towards the end of February a few months 
later. 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we know that a few years later, he 
20 
was then ultimately promoted to the position of Group Chief 
Executive of Transnet. 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now do I understand you to be saying 
that... or what part of this controversy, some of it was played 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 46 of 134 
 
out in the press, were you aware of you before you took up 
your position as Special Advisor on the 1s t of December? 
MR MHLANGU:   I cannot recall specifics but I know that 
there was something about Gama being in the news.  What I 
can help you with is, why did I consider it a drama. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, why did you consider it 
a drama? 
MR MHLANGU:   At that time... this is the opinion I held, 
which is I why I am telling you that it was improbable that I 
would pressure anyone.  At that time when I got to have 
10 
some conversations with the minister and Mr Mkwanazi.  
What I remember is that there was an insistence on Mr Gama 
to be appointed GCEO, right.   
 
And that any disciplinary proceedings against him and 
the finding and all of that, were in some way orchestrated to 
stop it from being so.  And so for me, Transnet is a very big 
organisation and an important one for this country.   
 
And you would not want to have a person... because 
invariable in my view, it may have been wrong, but my view 
was that, if there is that, then there is probably divisions 
20 
Chair within Transnet.   
 
And that also, if there is a finding by an independent 
committee.  So all of those things, it was a combination of 
complexed political issues and legal issues.   
 
And therefore, in my view, the minister had to tread 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 47 of 134 
 
carefully around that.  And based on SMA2, I believed that I 
probably would have said as much to him.   
 
And I really do believe, remember that I was a bit 
cautious around the issues relating to Mr Gama because of 
that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   And I may not, at the time, have had full 
details and so on but I remember that it was a politically 
charged matter.  It was a legally complex matter.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Politically charged and legally 
10 
complex.  No doubt of that then, an important thing on the 
minister’s radar, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   I do not know if it was the only thing and I 
do not know if it was ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I never said it was the only thing.  I 
said, no doubt an important thing on the minister’s radar. 
MR MHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   Ja. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
...you 
have 
sent 
him 
emails 
20 
Mr Mhlangu that deals with this.  One of your emails is one 
and a half pages where you list us in four, five different 
options.  I mean, it was a significant event.   
MR MHLANGU:   Because ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It was something that needed to be 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 48 of 134 
 
dealt with. 
MR MHLANGU:   No, the drama, it should not attract 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, there we go. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...because it was not his place. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MHLANGU:   It was not his place because my view was, 
if he gets himself in it, he will not be able to get himself out 
of it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, let us deal with that.  So 
10 
what we are actually dealing with is what you knew before 
you took up your position.  So Mr Gigaba ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just clarify that Mr Mhlangu 
what you have explained was that something you knew 
before you took up your position as special adviser or was 
it something you knew after you had taken up your 
position? 
MR MAHLANGU:   It was after, Chair, I had no specific 
interest in public enterprises when I was an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was you had taken the position? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   It was after, Chair.  And, Chair, I think 
the timing that the Commission needs to be aware of is that 
I arrived on the 1 December.   
1 December in government then things slow down 
and at that time they were orientating the minister with 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 49 of 134 
 
some things.  There were a lot of briefings that minister 
was going through. 
 
January, 
Chair, 
what 
happens 
in 
the 
political 
calendar, is that you have what is called the January 8 in 
the ANC.  So the political leaders are consumed by the 
activities leading up to the January. 
 
Then from the January 8, Chair, you have the 
lekqotlas.  You have the ANC lekqotla where the ANC 
National 
Executive 
Committee, 
member 
of 
which 
my 
minister was, were taken.   
10 
Then you have the cabinet lekqotla.  You actually 
have access to the minister after the State of the Nation 
address which would take you to around first or second 
week of February. 
 
I am not saying the administration is at a standstill 
but I am saying that have that in mind as you assess what I 
knew. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come to that very 
chronology, Mr Mahlangu.  So Minister Gigaba is appointed 
with effect from the 1 November.  Mr Mkwanazi in his 
20 
evidence of a meeting that he had with the minister, he 
says that meeting happened in October and at the same 
time his evidence was when he met with Mr Gigaba it was 
as if he was already the minister.  So October/November.  
And I want to just take you to bundle 4A.  I just want to run 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 50 of 134 
 
through 
with 
you 
what 
was 
then 
discussed 
between 
Minister Gigaba and Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Bundle 4A? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 4A, could I ask you to turn to 
page 4? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am on page 4. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So at paragraph 4.3 Mr Mkwanazi 
says: 
“In my meeting with the minister he indicated that 
he was not happy about a few things.” 
10 
1. A lack of Transnet information as there were very 
few senior positions  held by African women. 
2. He 
was 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
procurement system of Transnet was open to 
corruption by employees and other stakeholders.  
He emphasised that as the incoming Chair of the 
board this must be an area of focus. 
3. He was somehow aware of problems in the 
procurement of suppliers and services for mega 
projects in Transnet” 
20 
And then he lists a lot of them. 
4. He 
was 
also 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
disciplinary matters at Transnet were racially 
biased and that there was a condonation process 
at Transnet that was generally used to deal with 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 51 of 134 
 
deviations within Transnet.” 
Now Mr Mkwanazi put up then – I think you mentioned this 
to me before we began, you are aware of the fact that Mr 
Mkwanazi then put up a supplementary affidavit and what 
he says is that at this meeting Minister Gigaba also 
requested …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to remind me where the 
supplementary is? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, certainly.  Could you – perhaps 
I could ask you, Mr Mahlangu, to turn now  - the easiest 
10 
way is to ask you to look at the third last tab, Chairperson 
in bundle 4A. 
MR MAHLANGU:   EB20 or something? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   E19. 
MR MAHLANGU:   19. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then to turn backwards to page 
21.415.  So 414 is the supplementary affidavit and I want 
to direct your attention please to paragraph 5.  I have 
mentioned in the initial affidavit in paragraph 43, that is the 
meeting we are dealing with, that: 
20 
“I had a meeting with the minister at which the 
minister highlighted things that he was not happy 
with at Transnet.  In this meeting Minister Gigaba 
also requested that the incoming board must also 
review the fairness of the dismissal of Mr Gama.” 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 52 of 134 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, I can. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you have told the Chairperson 
that you were appointed as special adviser with effect from 
the 1 December 2010. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you then briefed by the 
minister? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Not in the once-off briefing sessions, we 
interacted in the office.  The minister had ways to talk to 
10 
us either as advisers or as the entire political office on 
issues. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well were you informed by the 
minister about the concerns that he had at Transnet? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you told by the minister of the 
discussion that he had had with Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you told by the minister that he 
had requested that Transnet should review the fairness of 
20 
the dismissal of Mr Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact Mr Mkwanazi says that the 
Minister issued what was tantamount to a shareholder 
instruction, instructed him to review the dismissal of Gama. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 53 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:   I was not there in 20 – in October. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I am not asking you that, I am 
asking you did the minister tell you about this? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You would accept that the minister 
seemed to have very serious concerns about Transnet. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am trying to go back in time.  So I do 
not know if I learnt of the Gama issue from the office.  
What I know, because – what I know is that Mr Mkwanazi 
apprised me of it for the purposes of informing the 
10 
minister.  It would therefore be on the basis of my report to 
the minister that the issue about Mr Gama would have been 
discussed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, we are going to come to that, 
but just that I understand your evidence.  You say that the 
minister did not brief you about his concerns about 
Transnet and the minister himself never told you that he 
had issued an instruction that the fairness of Mr Gama’s 
dismissal should be reviewed. 
MR MAHLANGU:   No.  On the – no, on the issues with 
20 
Transnet 
the 
department 
has 
a 
unit 
responsible 
for 
transport enterprise and I recall at the time there were 
issues that were ongoing but there were no specific issues 
that I – had sprang to mind as – I know that the NMPP, as 
now I see it from Mr Mkwanazi’s affidavit… 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 54 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MAHLANGU:   …the department was grappling with it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes but …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLANGU:   But I do not recall specific instructions 
to me.  In fact, I do not – the minister never instructed me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, perhaps you can just say that 
and we live with it. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Ja, the minister never instructed me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, let us move on then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Mr Mkwanazi tell you that the 
10 
minister had instructed the board to review the fairness of 
Mr Gama’s dismissal? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the discussions he had with you? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, Chair, not specifically.  I think there 
I am a bit – my memory is not good.  But remember 
Mkwanazi tells me what is happening on the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   So we did not start – and I arrived on 
the 1 s t of – these discussions happened in January, so I 
20 
suppose a lot has happened between October and January 
because then when he tells me things, he is telling me 
things that are happening there that I relayed to the 
minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he could have said to you when he 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 55 of 134 
 
started interacting with you in your capacity as special 
adviser to the minister, you know, we are busy with 
reviewing the fairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal, I had a 
meeting with the minister in October and he instructed the 
board to review the fairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal, one  
would imagine that he might not have just started telling 
you what was happening at the time but he might tell you 
the background, namely if they were busy with their review 
– with a review of the fairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal and 
if that review had been instructed – they had been 
10 
instructed by the minister to conduct it, one would expect 
that that is where he would have start when talking to you 
so that as you – as he continued to interact with you 
thereafter you would have the background and the context. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair, I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember. 
MR MAHLANGU:   No but what I remember is the 
discussion specifically, where they emanated and what the 
genesis were, no.  It is possible – if it is, it is possible but I 
do not remember an instruction because, Chair, the 
20 
government 
works 
in 
a 
particular 
way, 
if 
there 
an 
instruction to the asset.  As the shareholder then there will 
be a shareholder memo to the Chairperson of the board 
and that would have been based on what the department 
would have sort of analysed and advised the minister to do.  
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 56 of 134 
 
I have not seen that.  If it exists then I am happy to have a 
look at it but I do not recall seeing that kind and I – my 
discussions with Mr Mkwanazi, my recollection of how it 
started is I do not have a very clear recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you not recall him having said to you, 
even if he did not talk about the minister having instructed 
the board, do you not recall him having said to you, for 
example, you know, the board is busy reviewing the 
fairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal, even that you do not think 
he said that? 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, that is true, that he would have said 
because otherwise there would be no context to the brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   So what I am saying is I do not recall 
how – remember the board, according to me, are separate 
from the minister and if you are briefing me that this is 
what you are doing then I must tell the shareholder that 
that is what you are busy with.  That is how I would have 
engaged with this, that is why I do not recall saying now I 
am giving you an update based on the instruction I was 
20 
given by the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the instruction by the minister part 
that you do not recall but that the board was undertaking a 
review of the fairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal, that you 
recall. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 57 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:   That was the – yes, that was the 
essence of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I think that is what we were dealing – 
the reason why he was telling me that that is what they 
were busy with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, I am going to come to that in 
10 
more detail.  So you were appointed on the 1 December, 
the 13 December we know that a new board commences its 
duties, you have accepted that that was a board appointed 
by Minister Gigaba.   
 
Now another important event in this case is a Public 
Protector complaint that was received by Transnet on the 
22 December.  Did you ever come to learn about that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I learnt of that – my memory was jogged 
by Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence, I think, about – I do not 
remember the content but I remember there was something 
20 
about the Public Protector’s report. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So just perhaps before we break for 
tea, you have mentioned to the Chairperson that this initial 
discussion that you had with Mr Mapoma where you deal 
with Mr Sbu Gule, that would have happened in January, is 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 58 of 134 
 
that right? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And are you able to assist 
us with when in January that was? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, Chair, but it should be somewhere 
around the vicinity of that email. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   When I look at the email …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That email came – was another 
meeting that you had with Mr Mkwanazi but let us leave it 
10 
at that, Mr Mahlangu, perhaps over teatime you could 
reflect on when you first held a discussion in January with 
Mr Mkwanazi.  Mr Chairperson, if this is an appropriate 
time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take the tea adjournment 
until half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.   
20 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Pardon, Chair, may I be 
excused please at 12 o’clock, Mr Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, that is fine. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 59 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mahlangu, just 
before we get to the approximate date of your first 
discussion with Mr Mkwanazi, can you remember what 
caused you to get in contact with him or him get in contact 
with you? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Perhaps, Chair, before I answer this 
question, I need to just put this forward.  The events that 
you are seized with now happened around nine years ago.  
So when I prepared the two affidavits it was on the basis of 
what I remembered then and from the day I received 
10 
Mapoma’s affidavit and the letter from the Commission I 
have been thinking about these matters.  Some things do 
not make sense, some things I – I am not maliciously not 
remembering and therefore I would like you, as you assess 
what I am with is what I could remember it is based on 
these two things – the two emails that I drafted after that, 
but the conversation in my head has not stopped.  So I 
would like you to allow me where I can remember stuff to 
indulge you but right now things are – I would like you to 
understand that I would like to be as helpful as I can, to Mr 
20 
Myburgh and to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLANGU:   And therefore I will not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The fact that these are matters that 
happened a long time ago has got to be factored into the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 60 of 134 
 
whole conversation, there is no doubt about that, with 
every witness, so – and nobody asks you to talk about 
things that you know nothing about, nobody asks you to 
remember what you cannot remember but obviously there 
has got to be an assessment of what you have placed 
before the Commission and when Mr Myburgh asks you 
questions about maybe some aspects, it is simply a way of 
him trying to understand as much as possible from you so 
that in the end he can assist me in evaluating your 
evidence as well as the evidence of other witnesses. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So perhaps we 
can then go back to my question.  Do you recall what gave 
rise to your first discussion with Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, I do not recall specifically. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLANGU:   But I will presume that Mr Mkwanazi 
would have called me because there is no – he had direct 
relationship with the minister and he also had access to all 
of the political office so it would have been – he would call 
me.  So I do not know at which point which call in fact 
20 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence, he 
said you would phone him often. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That, Chair, I think it would be on a 
specific issue if I would call. I would not deny I called Mr 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 61 of 134 
 
Mkwanazi, if I had a specific question. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would you accept that you called 
him often? 
MR MAHLANGU:   As often as the other chairpersons, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe a number of times. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair, I do not know what often means 
but it was not irregular to call Mr Mkwanazi, if I had a 
question.  But the often is not I would call him every day or 
every second day. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLANGU:   If I had a question and the question had 
to be something I needed clarity on, maybe there is a thing 
that I need to know that the minister or that administration 
is dealing with and I needed context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would you say you may have called 
him often or a number of times in accordance with the 
requirements of your job? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, in the context of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, if there was something 
20 
about your job that you needed to talk to him about you 
would phone him? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct, Chair.  And also 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that there could have been a 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 62 of 134 
 
number of those things. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLANGU:   It is the context as well on what – 
because I could have called him, he could have called me, 
I was accessible to Mr Mkwanazi.  Whenever he wanted to 
talk to me I would make myself available.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, Mr Mahlangu, given your 
imperfect received of events, understandably, let me tell 
you when it seems this discussion must have happened.  It 
10 
must have happened, it seems, before the 13 January and I 
say that because the first piece of correspondence that we 
have, and it is going to be printed now, from Deneys Reitz 
relating to Mr Gama, was an offer made by them to Langa 
Attorneys on the 13 January.  So we know that by this time 
you must have had this discussion and Mr Mkwanazi would 
then have appointed Deneys Reitz and Mr Gule.  Would you 
accept that?   
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot recall but …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   But what I see in my email is that I sent 
it in the evening at around 17 …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That was after another discussion, 
Mr Mahlangu.  That is really the point I am making.  And 
please, if you could just listen to me instead of looking at 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 63 of 134 
 
the documents.  You had a discussion where you put 
forward Mr Gule as an eminent labour lawyer.  We know 
from Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence that Transnet then appointed 
Mr Gule.   On the 13 January 2011 Mr Gule wrote to Langa 
Attorneys making a without prejudice settlement proposal 
in respect of Mr Gama.  It must follow from that that this 
discussion that you talk about here in paragraph 7 was a 
discussion that occurred before the 13 January, correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   It is possible. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   But it is not also – it is not – it is 
possible but that is not the only reasonable inference. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, Mr Mahlangu, I do not want to 
argue with you about things that you yourself say you do 
not have a recollection of.   
What we know here is a matter of fact, is that by the 
13 January Gule is on record as the attorney.  Mr Mkwanazi 
says he took your advice, that is why he went to Gule.  It 
follows from that that this discussion must have happened 
before then. 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   I accept. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, it is in fact the only reasonable 
inference. 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, I was trying to connect it to 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 64 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I do not know what you were 
trying to do. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Ja.  No, I was trying to see if we are 
talking SMA2 because if …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what we are talking about. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Okay, that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we are going to come to your 
email on the 18 t h.  Of course that followed another 
discussion that you had had with Mr Mkwanazi.  We are 
going to come to that. 
10 
 
Now let me tell you what the issue is in relation to 
this discussion.  I put to Mr Mkwanazi that based on my 
reading of your paragraph 6 and 7, it is your contention 
that Mkwanazi tells you at this first discussion that 
Transnet intended to reinstate Gama.  That is what I put to 
him.  His answer was no, that is not what he said to you.  
What he said to you is that the minister had issued an 
instruction that the board should review the fairness of 
Gama’s dismissal.  That is his version.   
 
Now you understand part of my job is to put to you 
20 
what he has to say and you must comment on it.  What do 
you say? 
MR 
MAHLANGU: 
 
 
My 
statement, 
Mr 
Myburgh 
and 
Chairperson, is that I had a number of discussions with Mr 
Mkwanazi.  In one of those I recommended …[intervenes] 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 65 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, do raise your voice. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I had a number of discussions with Mr 
Mkwanazi and I recommended that he seeks legal advice 
and I do not recall specific that there was a review that the 
minister – I think what I was nervous about at the time was 
that if the board is acting without legal advice, which 
probably is the impression I got at the time, that would 
have been dangerous.  So that is where I was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Your affidavit …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLANGU:   So I cannot comment on it. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you stand by, as I understand it, 
your version, being that Mr Mkwanazi told you that 
Transnet intended to reinstate Gama. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That was my reading. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  Now – and that is important 
because …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is very important, sir.  That is 
your recollection, is that right? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes.  I think, Chair, even where I write I 
say I understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MAHLANGU:   So it is what – it is the conclusion I 
drew from the discussion.  I heard Mr Mkwanazi saying 
maybe I was premature.  Maybe that is true, maybe that is 
not, but that is my impression of the facts and the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 66 of 134 
 
discussions as they took place at that time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see, Mr Mahlangu, you answer 
my question, you give a clear answer.  You then learn of its 
importance …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, no, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you try to take the edge off 
it.  In paragraph 6 you say that Mkwanazi informed you that 
the company intended to reinstate Mr Gama.  You did not 
say I drew a conclusion or I inferred, I was informed, 
correct? 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   Mr Myburgh, let us go to annexure 
SMA1 which is a contemporaneous record of …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, it is not.  That was on the 18 t h. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am saying of the events at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Mahlangu, look this side 
when you speak so I can hear. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Oh, sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I was saying, Chair, there are two 
20 
things.  In the email that I wrote I say I understand.  This is 
on the 18 Jan and I said the sequencing here could be 
problematic for me but there was a time I was told about 
the intended settlement and we agree that it is before the 
13 t h, there is a letter of the 13 t h.  Yes, at that time I would 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 67 of 134 
 
have said that, go and get legal advice.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, well let us just stick with 
this.  You stand by what you say in your affidavit. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, that is fine.  So why we 
pressed Mr Mkwanazi on this is we said to him in cross-
examination that how could you say to Mr Mahlangu before 
– and now we know the 13 January that you were going to 
reinstate Mr Gama, unless you had been instructed to do 
so by Mr Gigaba.  That is really the proposition and that is 
10 
why the evidence that you have given here and confirmed 
is important.  You follow that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Ja.  Let us deal with this paragraph 
again, I would like to go through it.  Paragraph 6 of page 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 170. 
MR MAHLANGU:   170. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is your first affidavit. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair, this paragraph – like there could 
be a timing around it, which is a problem, but there is a 
20 
point – and as I said to Mr Myburgh, I am prepared to take 
it that it might have been the 13 t h or before but maybe that 
is my mischaracterisation.  Whether they intended to 
review or reinstate, Chairperson, I cannot give you a firm – 
say Mr Mkwanazi is wrong but in my – my recollection 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 68 of 134 
 
seems to be the issue was the reinstatement and I am not 
– I do not want to be too firm about it because I cannot… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, Mr Mahlangu, with all respect, 
you wrote this in your affidavit.  I mean, as I understand it, 
you have said there is a lot of things you cannot remember 
but this you could remember, that is why you put it in here. 
MR MAHLANGU:   It is to the best of my recollection. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Fair enough. 
MR MAHLANGU:   And it could be that there are flaws in it 
but there were those talks.  Whether it was a review – but 
10 
there was an issue that there was something that being 
dealt with which was around those times having to do with 
Mr Gama in his discussions with Transnet and that is after 
he was dismissed.  So I am not sure, Mr Myburgh, and I 
take your point, I really take your point. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mahlangu, I am going to deal with 
this in argument and trace my way through the evidence 
that you have given.  I think it will speak for itself. 
 
Did you during this discussion come to learn of the 
involvement of the minister in any way whatsoever because 
20 
Mr Mkwanazi is clear, he says that he told you that the 
minister had issued an instruction.  
MR MAHLANGU:   That I do not recall [indistinct] 14.52 
and I – because what – you see, the difficulty there is that 
I come in in December and I deal with this matter around 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 69 of 134 
 
January, so – and certain discussions according to the 
evidence before the Commission, it had already taken 
place, so I am not sure at what point of the discussions I 
was brought in and whether I was brought up to speed 
about the genesis of them or to say there is this matter that 
is being dealt with and this is where it is at and that is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not think there would have been 
much 
that 
would 
have 
happened 
before 
mid-January 
because remember, Mr Mkwanazi and his board also – were 
10 
also appointed in December.  Actually you were appointed 
first, I think.  You said you were appointed with effect from 
1 December.  I think they were appointed with effect from 
around 10 December or 13, I am not sure, thereabout.  
And, of course, there would have been the traditional, you 
know, Christmas break and people would have come back 
to work around 10 January, 15.  So I do not think that there 
would have been much that would have happened before 
mid-January. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I was saying, Chair, I was clarifying that 
20 
there was a conversation that relates to October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes.  So what I am saying, in that 
conversation, 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
at 
what 
point 
of 
that 
conversation I was brought in. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 70 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   But I do not recall there being Siya, I 
have instructed Transnet to look at this matter, can you 
follow up for me or whether Mkwanazi said as per your 
principal’s instruction, here is the update.  I do not recall it 
being that crisp. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now just remind me, why did you 
suggest go and get legal advice?  I mean, on your version 
he says we are going to reinstate Gama.  Well, fine, why 
do you need legal advice? 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   Not we, Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, absolutely. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So why would Transnet need legal 
advice if it has decided to reinstate Mr Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I had said that I held a view that this 
matter was a little bit too complex.  Of course, I did not 
have a full appreciation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You had a view. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes.  That this matter raised very 
20 
complex matters and particularly there was a lot on the go, 
right?  And it was also, in my opinion, if I had a preference, 
it was that you needed to deal with this matter clinically 
and try and contain whatever needed to be contain, 
whether it is the legal issues, the political issues, but that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 71 of 134 
 
needed to be navigated with care and if you are going to 
navigate this with care, you needed to act with legal 
advice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you understood that this was a 
controversial issue? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  And is it then just a 
coincidence that the lawyer who you pointed Transnet in 
the direction of, he then provides an opinion creating a 
slight doubt as to Transnet’s prospects of success in a 
10 
litigation against Mr Gama which they then accept and 
used that as a basis to reinstate him?  Is that all a 
coincidence? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair, I cannot comment on that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot.  What I can say is that as I got 
to Johannesburg in 1999, as a candidate attorney, I have 
done my stint in the employment law department and of the 
eminent lawyers I recall of the time, labour lawyers, Sbu 
Gule ranked amongst them and I did not give him on Sbu 
20 
Gule, I recall that we discussed a number of names that he 
went away with.  So I do not know about the opinion, I do 
not know about anything, but insofar as Mr Gule is 
concerned, he is one of the senior attorneys in the city with 
serious respect.  I think even articled with the DCJ. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 72 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, do know – or did Mr Mkwanazi 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he came as an attorney. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But did you know that Transnet of 
course already had lawyers on this case? 
MR MAHLANGU:   At that time …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you know that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes – no, no, no, I did not know – I 
know that there were lawyers that were advising them on 
the Gama matter. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   But Mr Mkwanazi – remember, the issue 
there, it was politically charged. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   And I think the law firm concerned was 
seen as part of the people that were purging some people 
there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So you accept that it was 
contentious and politically charged? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now I think I and the DCJ 
have already asked you a series of questions about this.  
So here we have the first discussion.  I have mentioned to 
you that Mr Mkwanazi speaks of numerous or various 
discussions that you had with him but he made it clear that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 73 of 134 
 
he had a number of discussions with you after this in 
relation to Mr Gama and that those discussions were in the 
context of the minister ’s instruction.   
 
In other words, his evidence was that he was 
liaising with you in acquitting himself of the minister ’s 
instruction and he was using you as a conduit to relay 
information to the minister.  That is the extent of his 
recollection of his interaction with you.  Now do I 
understand you to be saying you cannot remember that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No, let me answer that because the 
10 
chairpersons do not have to speak to me, they speak to me 
because they want to convey something to my principal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look this side. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what he said. 
MR MAHLANGU:   The Chairpersons did not speak to me 
for me, they would speak to me because they wanted to 
convey something to my principal or to assess where my 
principal stood on particular matters.  So that would be 
correct, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, he – Mr Mkwanazi said, if I 
recall correctly, Mr Myburgh, other than the meeting that he 
had with Mr Gigaba, which he said was in October, other 
than that he did not have another meeting with him, I do 
not know whether before Mr Gama was reinstated or he 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 74 of 134 
 
never had any other meeting at all but it seems that 
certainly, on his version, between the meeting that he says 
he 
had 
with 
the 
minister 
in 
October 
2010 
and 
the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama, he says he never had any 
meeting with the minister, he was liaising with you as the 
person who would convey matters to the minister.  Yes, Mr 
Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, perhaps I could just read to 
you.  I put to Mr Mkwanazi after a lengthy cross-
examination: 
10 
“So you were keeping Mr Mahlangu appraised of 
developments in the light of the instruction that you 
got from the minister to, as you put it, review Mr 
Gama’s dismissal?” 
He says: 
“I would have.” 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair, to the extent that I can recall, he 
did brief about – he kept me abreast but not on the details.  
But the important thing that we need to recall is that the 
chairpersons had an independent relationship with the 
20 
minister and their discussions with the minister where not 
just meetings, they would call him, they would call him 
because – and the minister would call them too because I 
would have then said minister, there is this thing and 
minister would then pick that up maybe through the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 75 of 134 
 
department or directly with the chairperson.   
So I do not know, just to comment on the Chair ’s 
remarks, I do not know if Mr Mkwanazi and my minister had 
discussions following those briefing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, you see, Mr Mahlangu, you are 
defecting now to discussions with the minister, I am talking 
about the discussions he had with you. 
And no, I do not agree with you, the important thing 
is whether you came to learn through this series of 
discussions about the minister ’s instruction.  That is the 
10 
important thing. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That I have – I cannot take it further, Mr 
Myburgh, I have said …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, what is your answer, you 
cannot remember? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot recall that Mr Mkwanazi said 
that to me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could he have? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not understand why  - and I do not 
understand why not but I cannot take it further than I 
20 
cannot recall it, Chairperson. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, then you cannot dispute his 
version, can you, that he told you of the minister ’s 
instruction and nor can you dispute his version that he then 
liaised with you on a number of occasions in acquitting 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 76 of 134 
 
himself of that instruction.  You cannot dispute that, can 
you? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair, I cannot dispute it because I 
cannot recall it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  Now let us then deal with 
how Mr Mapoma enters the scene.  We know that by the 11 
January 
he 
had 
engaged 
KPMG 
to 
undertake 
an 
investigation 
of 
the 
Public 
Protector 
report 
and 
his 
evidence 
and 
Mkwanazi’s 
evidence 
is 
that 
Mkwanazi 
appointed him to deal with the Public Protector.  So he is 
10 
now dealing with that at least from the 11 January and what 
is 
important 
about 
that 
and 
Mr 
Mapoma’s 
initial 
involvement, is his evidence was that from the outset of his 
interactions with Mr Mkwanazi he made it clear to him that 
he, Mkwanazi, had been instructed by Mr Gigaba – sorry, 
he had been instructed to reinstate Gama and his evidence 
was that it was by someone higher up in the ministry.   How 
can that be? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not know that.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, if Mr Mapoma is to be believed, 
20 
Mr Mkwanazi told him that. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And if Mkwanazi told him that, 
presumably that instruction must have come from Mr 
Gigaba and higher. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 77 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot comment.  I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Whilst we are on Mr Mapoma and his 
initial interaction, he also talks about a meeting that he 
attended between Mkwanazi and Gama over the weekend 
at the Inanda Estate and there was an attempt to negotiate 
a settlement – so we know this is before the settlement 
agreement – and those negotiations were unsuccessful and 
Mapoma’s evidence was that Mkwanazi tells him that they 
broke down because Gama wanted to be appointed, this is 
something that you were dealing with, as the Chief 
10 
Executive of Transnet.  Do you find that strange? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not know the facts, I …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Assuming that happened, would you 
find that strange? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, that is strange. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And would you accept that it is 
indicative of the fact that Mr Gama must then have had 
some very serious political backing, correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not know that, I cannot comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But why is that not indicative of the 
20 
fact that Mr Gama – if it happened. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am not qualified to comment on that, I 
do not know how to throw politically …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Your reaction is immediate, you do 
not even allow me to finish the proposition and it is not a 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 78 of 134 
 
matter of qualification, I am asking you what else, what 
else could have informed that stance by Mr Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not know, Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Fair enough.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that what you could say is that 
somebody who was dismissed from a certain position, who 
has got an unfair dismissal claim against the company, 
wanted to be reinstated to that position from which he was 
dismissed should in negotiations aimed at settling that 
dispute demand to be appointed to a higher position is 
10 
strange, would be strange.  I guess that you can say. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have said it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Ja. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
You 
mention 
then 
in 
your 
supplementary affidavit, just following the chronology, that 
you would have held the discussion with Mr Mkwanazi 
around the 18 January and that leads us to your 18 
January email, correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us go then to that email at 
page 178, bundle 1.  Now the first bullet point says: 
“I have been invited on a trip to India on 24 January 
to 1 February.  Although this is a private excursion, 
it promises to be of great political ...and therefore 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 79 of 134 
 
suggest that we take full advantage of it, I therefore 
request leave to undertake this sojourn.” 
Is that right? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you then undertake this trip 
to India? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I deal with this Chair in a separate 
affidavit that I filed with the Commission. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I have read that affidavit, your 
version is that you were invited by Ranej Gupta to attend a 
10 
wedding of one of his family members and that he paid for 
you. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chairperson I was asked to prepare to 
deal with the Transnet issues and I deal extensively about 
my relationship with the members of the Gupta family and I 
have not prepared today to deal with that, but to Mr 
Myburgh’s point at – there was no discussion between the 
members of the Gupta Family and me about Mr Gama, and 
neither do I think at that time they even knew each other, I 
don’t know, the impression I recall that at that time there 
20 
was no – he had not asked anything of me, they were not 
infamous but I would like Chair to deal with it appropriately 
and to be able to adequately address that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I don’t intend to pursue that any 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 80 of 134 
 
further, of course, I mean the point I just wanted to make 
really is that because of that this email came to light, 
because you were preparing the other affidavit. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That’s correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The other affidavit asked you to 
answer to this trip to India and you then produced, I think it 
was Annexure 17, and it was in the context of preparing 
that affidavit that you the realised you should put this up in 
this – these proceedings. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct, yes Mr Myburgh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and you are right, you will in 
time you may be called as a witness to answer those 
allegations.   Let’s get then to the second bullet point.   
“I understand that Transnet may be nearing a 
settlement with Gama.  I will obtain the details of 
the settlement and brief you accordingly.  I suggest 
that you socialise the President and his key aides 
[formal and informal] on the proposed settlement.   
It 
is 
intended 
that 
forthcoming 
board 
should 
consider and authorise it.” 
20 
So here this is contemporaneous, you had a discussing 
with Mr Mkwanazi, you lead up to this email and that’s what 
he told you? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that we understand it, you 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 81 of 134 
 
can’t remember that, that’s your case, but you say well if I 
wrote it then it must have happened. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have tried to explain it after the break 
Mr Myburgh, at the time when I drafted the affidavit the 
only recollection of this was this email, but I have been 
continuously thinking and trying to understand and trying to 
contextualise these issues and to place them – to try to go 
back into history, so I would like you to understand it in 
that regard. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, now what’s important is when 
10 
I put this to Mr Mkwanazi he says no he didn’t say this to 
you because as of the 18 t h they weren’t nearing a 
settlement and ultimately in fact said that you made a false 
report to the Minister. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I think that Mr Myburgh I watched the 
video of Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence, I think that was – that 
concession that he made, he made it under intense 
questioning and all of that but his view was that I 
prematurely ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It wasn’t a concession, he said you 
20 
made a false statement to the Minister, you indeed don’t 
agree with him? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I don’t agree, the facts don’t agree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, well precisely and that was the 
point I was putting to him so you and I agree with one 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 82 of 134 
 
another, so he must have told you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the forced part came because it 
was said if what you were saying was premature – okay I 
think I asked pertinently, I said when he said it was 
premature is it because it was true but it should not have 
been conveyed at that time, it was not the right time to tell 
the Minister, or was the position that as at that time what 
you said had 
happened had not happened, and my 
recollection is that his response was that what you said 
had happened had not happened, that is my recollection.  
10 
Does it – is it consistent with your recollection of what you 
listened to? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair I wouldn’t want to labour on it, 
what I wrote to the Minister here as you can tell is my 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  And it probably is just 
simply a timing issue at worst, you say that I will obtain 
details of the settlement, in other words the settlement 
agreement or what did you have in mind of giving to the 
20 
Minister?  
MR MAHLANGU:   If you read the two emails I think later 
on I did talk about loss of benefit ...[indistinct – static on 
audio]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mahlangu what details did you 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 83 of 134 
 
intend to get for the Minister?  
MR MAHLANGU:   On what basis the - what is the 
settlement, what is it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In other words a settlement 
agreement?  
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes of the content. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you then do that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How do you remember that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Because that is significant, that is a 
10 
significant event. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But so is this email. 
MR MAHLANGU:   No I am saying the details of it would 
have been odd, because remember in my next email I seem 
to have – I seem to know about, if you go to my second 
email I said he was informed through his lawyer of an offer 
to reinstate him with no loss of benefits in the contribution 
towards his legal costs.   
 
That is probably what I meant, but I have no 
independent recollection. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in other words, I think you said 
earlier that you didn’t do this, but it seems that you did do 
that, you did get details then ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   Not the agreement, the agreement I saw 
it for the first time when the Commission gave it to me. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 84 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  How do you know that you 
didn’t look for the settlement agreement? 
MR MAHLANGU:   There are certain important incidents, 
like – I don’t like I was telling you about ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You would describe getting a 
settlement 
agreement 
from 
Transnet 
as 
an 
important 
...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   On the matter relating to Mr Gama.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that we understand one 
another, your evidence here is you have no independent 
10 
recollection of this. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have said this Chair that when I 
drafted the affidavits on those two days, these affidavits, 
that is all I had, but it doesn’t mean I have stopped 
enquiring about the event. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, then you suggest that you 
socialise the President, just remind me what your answer 
was to the Chairperson’s question about what does that 
mean? 
MR MAHLANGU:   By socialise Chair I meant that he must 
20 
make him aware, because of the importance of the matter, 
the matter had evoked public interest and in fact there are 
two things there.  The matter was of public interest, and 
the matter is what the public was interested in at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well I think that is important 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 85 of 134 
 
evidence that you give.  Now not only was he to socialise 
the President, was your advice, but also his key aides, who 
would that have included? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Aides in the context means the 
assistants and advisors of the President, the inner sanctum 
of the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say but it is not just 
formally those aides, it is also informal aides, what – just 
before you jump in, who would the President’s informal 
aides have included? 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   That would have been some of the 
senior political leaders that were closer to the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Like who did you have in mind? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have to think back but you know the 
ANC has got its different compartments and you have to 
make sure that at that time those that are aligned to the 
President would not – would also have to have had their 
say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They would have had to have had 
their say? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   To the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   About the reinstatement of Mr 
Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 86 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:   That’s why you would see in my SMA2 I 
think I repeat the political problems that I saw. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Doesn’t this evidence of yours make 
it all the more probable that Mr Mkwanazi was instructed by 
the former President via your Minister to reinstate Mr 
Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sir your evidence was that you felt 
that the aides the key aides, both formal and informal, 
should have their say about the reinstatement of Mr Gama. 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes Mr Myburgh, let me put this in 
context, firstly for me the public interest is that Transnet is 
one of the biggest organisations in the country and the 
biggest employer.  Secondly Transnet Freight Rail runs 
80% of Africa’s rail, so in terms of public interest to me the 
importance of Transnet Freight Rail was not lost.  The 
politicisation of this matter was also not lost to me.   If the 
President, if Mr Gigaba in my view, and now in hindsight, 
had not – if there is something as big as that, whether he 
has not been taken, or he has been taken back that I think 
20 
he should have briefed the President because somehow 
that matter would at least be in the public domain and he 
would need the President’s support. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He had the President’s support? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I don’t know, I am briefing you, and as 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 87 of 134 
 
we did some things, as we would go, and there would be 
matters that you would know to say Mr Minister we think 
that when this thing backfires you want to have the 
President’s backing, that is the background to which I 
think, and you would see in that email there is a lot of 
correspondence with the Presidency on unrelated issues 
where we’re trying to make sure that he is in a very good 
relationship with the ...[indistinct]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright,  and then you go on to say 
that it is intended that the forthcoming board should 
10 
consider and authorise it, what did you mean by that, the 
forthcoming Board meeting or ... 
MR MAHLANGU:   I would presume it is the meeting Mr 
Myburgh ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because you see that is also very 
important, because if this is what Mr Mkwanazi told you 
well then what it shows you is that his intention was to 
persuade his Board to reinstate Gama at the forthcoming 
meeting. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I can’t comment on that. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But he told you that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I stand by this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, now let us deal then with 
over the page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go over the page Mr 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 88 of 134 
 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mahlangu your statement in that first 
bullet point of 18 t h January 2011, in the second bullet 
point, your suggestion to the Minister that he socialise the 
President and his key aides on the proposed settlement 
suggests to you, and I would like to hear your comment, 
suggest to me that it is unlikely that there had not been a 
discussion involving you and the Minister in terms of which 
you had formed the impression or understanding that the 
10 
President was interested to be informed about what was 
going on with regard to the Gama dispute.  Is that a fair 
reading or analysis of the statement? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what do you say to this? 
MR MAHLANGU:   In the nature of my work Chair I would 
determine in my view whether this is a – remember Chair I 
give you that the Executive Powers in the Republic vest in 
the President and therefore every Minister is a councillor of 
the President, although they have those delegated powers 
20 
that 
they 
must 
discharge 
and 
therefore 
if 
there 
is 
something that has particular sensitivities you will do good 
in my view to appraise the President before you take that 
stand, and we have seen ministers over the years who 
have taken steps without briefing the Presidents and then 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 89 of 134 
 
you have ways in which then there’s a public, or a concern 
from the disjuncture between the Presidency and those 
Ministers about the meaning or intended action by those 
Ministers, but from my point as I said and it is not this one, 
there are many other instances where I would say talk to 
your colleagues, appraise the President so that we were 
able to make sure that when you take steps like those 
where you would need backing from the highest office in 
the land that that backing was available, particularly if 
there is a  ...[indistinct] that you really need to be 
10 
understood here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that thinking comes from this 
that I would expect that a special advisor to the Minister 
would leave it to the Minister ’s judgment what he tells the 
President and what he doesn’t tell him and when he tells 
him and that the special advisor would simply advise the 
Minister and the Minister as a certain relationship with the 
President and how they interact but that might – you might 
not share that, but that is what I am thinking. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is a mistaken view Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is not practically how it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would advise the Minister. 
MR MAHLANGU:   You would overrule him if he doesn’t 
believe it is important.   There are instances where we 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 90 of 134 
 
overrule. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your advice to him would include 
what to bring to the attention of the President as well? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but I see also that in terms of that 
statement it seems that you considered that it was 
important not just that the President should be informed 
about 
Mr 
Gama’s 
possible 
reinstatement 
or 
intended 
reinstatement but that he should be informed of the 
settlement and I take it you mean the terms of the 
10 
settlement, is it fair to read it like that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I think Chair that is correct and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, let me leave it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes thank you.  So did Mr Gigaba 
socialise the President, Gigaba socialise the President and 
his key aides? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I don’t know Chair. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you not follow up with him? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I may have like I said there’s memory 
lapses there, I don’t know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There’s memory lapses? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am saying I cannot recall, maybe that 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 91 of 134 
 
is an inelegant use of language, but I cannot recall Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because let’s go to page 180, you 
say we shall take discussions on some of these letters 
eyeball to eyeball.   Does that not help jog your memory? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am not sure if we had – I used – some 
of these things I would use them to – these emails I would 
send them to the Minister so that in case we don’t, 
sometimes the Minister is in Cape Town, sometimes I am in 
Pretoria, sometimes we are both at the same geography, 
10 
but the important thing is that I do not recall him going to 
the President, if he did, I mean the Minister is around, he 
can testify to that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes well it seems the Minister have 
to update his affidavit or supplement it like you did after 
your testimony. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because the Minister he puts up a 
one paragraph affidavit where he says he knows nothing 
about this at all, which your evidence shows cannot be 
20 
true. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well as you said that as special advisor 
to the Minister you would advise and it would be up to the 
Minister to take your advice or not to take it, and I think 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 92 of 134 
 
there are a number of examples that you have made in one 
of your affidavits where you say he did not take your 
advice, he took the advice of other colleagues of yours or 
other people in the department.  I would have thought that 
whether he socialised the – whether he went along with 
your advice that he should socialise the President, whether 
he went along with that advice or not would have been 
quite important for you to know, for further advice because 
maybe if the President wasn’t happy or was happy might 
influence how you advise him going forward. 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:    Chair in an ideal circumstance yes, but 
in the political and administrative centres things happen 
vertically and you have advised and you then saw that the 
Minister then is aware of your advice, that is your primary 
issue, so in this instance Chair consistent with the work 
that we are doing there I would have to take something 
else to confirm whether he did or didn’t, and whether we 
had a further discussion after that I do not have any 
specific recollection.  I do not dispute that it would have 
been important to follow up, but right now I do not have 
20 
enough facts to assist you with that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What would you need to c heck Mr 
Mahlangu? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am saying I would have to look at the 
correspondence between me and the DG or the – internal 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 93 of 134 
 
correspondence within the department at that time, whether 
there was any formal letter written to the President or 
whether there was any diary entry, requested meeting with 
the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, please speak to the 
Chairperson. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Oh sorry.  I would have had to verify 
from objective evidence within the Department whether the 
Minister did or reported back to us. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So as things stand now you don’t 
10 
know whether Minister Gigaba did that but your advice was 
that he certainly should. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so that is the 18 t h of 
January.  We know then from the 24 t h of January to the 1 s t 
of February you go to India, so that ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   I am not sure if the dates are correct 
but yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what you asked, you asked 
for leave, if you go to your bullet point one. 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, I am saying I am not sure if those 
eventually that was the date but somewhere around those 
times. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so on those dates that you 
gave the Minister your trip was planned from 24 January to 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 94 of 134 
 
1 February.  Now just to follow the chronology, on the 21 s t 
of January, that was the first board meeting Transnet where 
Mr Gama was discussed.  I am trying to trace the steps to 
your next email of the 4 t h of February. 
 
So we know you are back on about the 1 s t or 2 n d of 
February, the board meeting on the 21 s t of January and 
now I want to get to a meeting that was held the day before 
your 4 February email, and that was a meeting of the 
Corporate Governance Nominations Committee.  Perhaps I 
could ask you please to go to file one, Bundle 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one that has got your emails. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one that has got your emails, 
SMA1 and SMA2. 
MR MANHLANGU:   Oh, thank you Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And – yes I beg your pardon, it is the 
same file, can you turn all the way to page 855. 
MR MAHLANGU:   855. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now this is a meeting that precedes 
your discussion and email of the next day.  Perhaps in 
20 
fairness let me take you to page 827 first.   
MR MAHLANGU:   827? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   827.  So you see there minutes of a 
meeting, Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee 
on 3 February 2011, present Mr Mkwanazi etcetera, do you 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 95 of 134 
 
see that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at 1.4 also Mr Mapoma. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the business of this committee 
Mr Mahlangu on this day was by and large to debate 
whether or not Mr Gama, his application for the position of 
Group Chief Executive should be allowed, and whether 
there should be a deviation from what is known as Clause 
4.8.4 which says as a general rule if you are dismissed you 
10 
cannot be re-employed. 
 
So that was the debate and we know that you deal 
with this in your email of the 4 t h of February, further to a 
discussion you had with Mr Mkwanazi. 
 
Now I am referring you now to page 855, also part 
of the transcript and at 855 at 695 on the left hand side Mr 
Mkwanazi had asked Mr Mapoma to give his view on Mr 
Gama’s dismissal, issue of settlement etcetera, and this is 
the passage where he says now advise the Chair to say: 
“If we at Transnet go to the appeal and oppose the 
20 
appeal, that is the arbitration, we stand a very good 
chance of winning that appeal, that was my view at 
the time.  Where I am saying we are not strong 
Doris, that is the director, is if we have to explain 
the rationality of why we are settling I do not think 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 96 of 134 
 
we are on very strong ground on that.  That is my 
view but on the disciplinary process itself and if we 
go and argue the matter on appeal we stand a very 
good chance of succeeding.  Siya can win, but we 
can also win as Transnet, we have a very, very good 
case against him there.” 
So it seems then that the discussion that you have with Mr 
Mkwanazi on the 4 t h of February then gives rise to your 
email, it is in this context, the debate about allowing Mr 
Gama’s application, correct? 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what is also important for the 
purposes of your evidence, and we are going to come to it 
just now, is you see how Mr Mapoma is really dead against 
settlement. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact he says it would be irrational 
to settle. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see that?  And Mr Mapona 
20 
was as forthright when it came to the issue of the payment 
of Mr Gama’s costs, you might have seen his, listened to 
his evidence. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He was utterly opposed to the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 97 of 134 
 
payment of Mr Gama’s costs, you would have heard that, 
correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I saw that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us then go to your email of the 
next day, the 4 t h of February.  We need to go back please 
to page 181 of this bundle, and here you say on the 4 t h of 
February ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   The page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   181, your second email. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say: 
“Dear Minister 
At my meeting with Chair ...” 
I assume that is Mr Mkwanazi, is that right? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And your supplementary affidavit 
says that you would have held that meeting on or about the 
same day. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Probably. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And really what you discussed with 
20 
him was this issue of Mr Gama and his application for 
Group Chief Executive, correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And along the way you also 
discussed with him the issue of a settlement with Mr 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 98 of 134 
 
Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the two things were intertwined 
weren’t they? 
MR MAHLANGU:   In my view they were. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They were or they weren’t? 
MR MAHLANGU:   They were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to put to you suggest 
10 
that we take full advantage of it, I therefore request 
leave to undertake this sojourn.” 
Is that right? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you then undertake this trip 
to India? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I deal with this Chair in a separate 
affidavit that I filed with the Commission. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I have read that affidavit, your 
version is that you were invited by Ranej Gupta to attend a 
20 
wedding of one of his family members and that he paid for 
you. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chairperson I was asked to prepare to 
deal with the Transnet issues and I deal extensively about 
my relationship with the members of the Gupta family and I 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 99 of 134 
 
have not prepared today to deal with that, but to Mr 
Myburgh’s point at – there was no discussion between the 
members of the Gupta Family and me about Mr Gama, and 
neither do I think at that time they even knew each other, I 
don’t know, the impression I recall that at that time there 
was no – he had not asked anything of me, they were not 
infamous but I would like Chair to deal with it appropriately 
and to be able to adequately address that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I don’t intend to pursue that any 
10 
further, of course, I mean the point I just wanted to make 
really is that because of that this email came to light, 
because you were preparing the other affidavit. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That’s correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The other affidavit asked you to 
answer to this trip to India and you then produced, I think it 
was Annexure 17, and it was in the context of preparing 
that affidavit that you the realised you should put this up in 
this – these proceedings. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct, yes Mr Myburgh. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and you are right, you will in 
time you may be called as a witness to answer those 
allegations.   Let’s get then to the second bullet point.   
“I understand that Transnet may be nearing a 
settlement with Gama.  I will obtain the details of 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 100 of 134 
 
the settlement and brief you accordingly.  I suggest 
that you socialise the President and his key aides 
[formal and informal] on the proposed settlement.   
It 
is 
intended 
that 
forthcoming 
board 
should 
consider and authorise it.” 
So here this is contemporaneous, you had a discussing 
with Mr Mkwanazi, you lead up to this email and that’s what 
he told you? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that we understand it, you 
10 
can’t remember that, that’s your case, but you say well if I 
wrote it then it must have happened. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have tried to explain it after the break 
Mr Myburgh, at the time when I drafted the affidavit the 
only recollection of this was this email, but I have been 
continuously thinking and trying to understand and trying to 
contextualise these issues and to place them – to try to go 
back into history, so I would like you to understand it in 
that regard. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, now what’s important is when 
20 
I put this to Mr Mkwanazi he says no he didn’t say this to 
you because as of the 18 t h they weren’t nearing a 
settlement and ultimately in fact said that you made a false 
report to the Minister. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I think that Mr Myburgh I watched the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 101 of 134 
 
video of Mr Mkwanazi’s evidence, I think that was – that 
concession that he made, he made it under intense 
questioning and all of that but his view was that I 
prematurely ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It wasn’t a concession, he said you 
made a false statement to the Minister, you indeed don’t 
agree with him? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I don’t agree, the facts don’t agree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, well precisely and that was the 
point I was putting to him so you and I agree with one 
10 
another, so he must have told you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the forced part came because it 
was said if what you were saying was premature – okay I 
think I asked pertinently, I said when he said it was 
premature is it because it was true but it should not have 
been conveyed at that time, it was not the right time to tell 
the Minister, or was the position that as at that time what 
you said had 
happened had not happened, and my 
recollection is that his response was that what you said 
had happened had not happened, that is my recollection.  
20 
Does it – is it consistent with your recollection of what you 
listened to? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Chair I wouldn’t want to labour on it, 
what I wrote to the Minister here as you can tell is my 
understanding. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 102 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  And it probably is just 
simply a timing issue at worst, you say that I will obtain 
details of the settlement, in other words the settlement 
agreement or what did you have in mind of giving to the 
Minister?  
MR MAHLANGU:   If you read the two emails I think later 
on I did talk about loss of benefit ...[indistinct – static on 
audio]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mahlangu what details did you 
10 
intend to get for the Minister?  
MR MAHLANGU:   On what basis the - what is the 
settlement, what is it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In other words a settlement 
agreement?  
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes of the content. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you then do that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How do you remember that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Because that is significant, that is a 
20 
significant event. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But so is this email. 
MR MAHLANGU:   No I am saying the details of it would 
have been odd, because remember in my next email I seem 
to have – I seem to know about, if you go to my second 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 103 of 134 
 
email I said he was informed through his lawyer of an offer 
to reinstate him with no loss of benefits in the contribution 
towards his legal costs.   
 
That is probably what I meant, but I have no 
independent recollection. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in other words, I think you said 
earlier that you didn’t do this, but it seems that you did do 
that, you did get details then ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   Not the agreement, the agreement I saw 
it for the first time when the Commission gave it to me. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  How do you know that you 
didn’t look for the settlement agreement? 
MR MAHLANGU:   There are certain important incidents, 
like – I don’t like I was telling you about ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You would describe getting a 
settlement 
agreement 
from 
Transnet 
as 
an 
important 
...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   On the matter relating to Mr Gama.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that we understand one 
another, your evidence here is you have no independent 
20 
recollection of this. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have said this Chair that when I 
drafted the affidavits on those two days, these affidavits, 
that is all I had, but it doesn’t mean I have stopped 
enquiring about the event. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 104 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, then you suggest that you 
socialise the President, just remind me what your answer 
was to the Chairperson’s question about what does that 
mean? 
MR MAHLANGU:   By socialise Chair I meant that he must 
make him aware, because of the importance of the matter, 
the matter had evoked public interest and in fact there are 
two things there.  The matter was of public interest, and 
the matter is what the public was interested in at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well I think that is important 
10 
evidence that you give.  Now not only was he to socialise 
the President, was your advice, but also his key aides, who 
would that have included? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Aides in the context means the 
assistants and advisors of the President, the inner sanctum 
of the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say but it is not just 
formally those aides, it is also informal aides, what – just 
before you jump in, who would the President’s informal 
aides have included? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   That would have been some of the 
senior political leaders that were closer to the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Like who did you have in mind? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I have to think back but you know the 
ANC has got its different compartments and you have to 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 105 of 134 
 
make sure that at that time those that are aligned to the 
President would not – would also have to have had their 
say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They would have had to have had 
their say? 
MR MAHLANGU:   To the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   About the reinstatement of Mr 
Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
10 
MR MAHLANGU:   That’s why you would see in my SMA2 I 
think I repeat the political problems that I saw. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Doesn’t this evidence of yours make 
it all the more probable that Mr Mkwanazi was instructed by 
the former President via your Minister to reinstate Mr 
Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sir your evidence was that you felt 
that the aides the key aides, both formal and informal, 
should have their say about the reinstatement of Mr Gama. 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes Mr Myburgh, let me put this in 
context, firstly for me the public interest is that Transnet is 
one of the biggest organisations in the country and the 
biggest employer.  Secondly Transnet Freight Rail runs 
80% of Africa’s rail, so in terms of public interest to me the 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 106 of 134 
 
importance of Transnet Freight Rail was not lost.  The 
politicisation of this matter was also not lost to me.   If the 
President, if Mr Gigaba in my view, and now in hindsight, 
had not – if there is something as big as that, whether he 
has not been taken, or he has been taken back that I think 
he should have briefed the President because somehow 
that matter would at least be in the public domain and he 
would need the President’s support. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He had the President’s support? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I don’t know, I am briefing you, and as 
10 
we did some things, as we would go, and there would be 
matters that you would know to say Mr Minister we think 
that when this thing backfires you want to have the 
President’s backing, that is the background to which I 
think, and you would see in that email there is a lot of 
correspondence with the Presidency on unrelated issues 
where we’re trying to make sure that he is in a very good 
relationship with the ...[indistinct]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright,  and then you go on to say 
that it is intended that the forthcoming board should 
20 
consider and authorise it, what did you mean by that, the 
forthcoming Board meeting or ... 
MR MAHLANGU:   I would presume it is the meeting Mr 
Myburgh ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because you see that is also very 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 107 of 134 
 
important, because if this is what Mr Mkwanazi told you 
well then what it shows you is that his intention was to 
persuade his Board to reinstate Gama at the forthcoming 
meeting. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I can’t comment on that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But he told you that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I stand by this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, now let us deal then with 
over the page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go over the page Mr 
10 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mahlangu your statement in that first 
bullet point of 18 t h January 2011, in the second bullet 
point, your suggestion to the Minister that he socialise the 
President and his key aides on the proposed settlement 
suggests to you, and I would like to hear your comment, 
suggest to me that it is unlikely that there had not been a 
discussion involving you and the Minister in terms of which 
you had formed the impression or understanding that the 
20 
President was interested to be informed about what was 
going on with regard to the Gama dispute.  Is that a fair 
reading or analysis of the statement? 
MR MAHLANGU:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what do you say to this? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 108 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:   In the nature of my work Chair I would 
determine in my view whether this is a – remember Chair I 
give you that the Executive Powers in the Republic vest in 
the President and therefore every Minister is a councillor of 
the President, although they have those delegated powers 
that 
they 
must 
discharge 
and 
therefore 
if 
there 
is 
something that has particular sensitivities you will do good 
in my view to appraise the President before you take that 
stand, and we have seen ministers over the years who 
have taken steps without briefing the Presidents and then 
10 
you have ways in which then there’s a public, or a concern 
from the disjuncture between the Presidency and those 
Ministers about the meaning or intended action by those 
Ministers, but from my point as I said and it is not this one, 
there are many other instances where I would say talk to 
your colleagues, appraise the President so that we were 
able to make sure that when you take steps like those 
where you would need backing from the highest office in 
the land that that backing was available, particularly if 
there is a  ...[indistinct] that you really need to be 
20 
understood here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that thinking comes from this 
that I would expect that a special advisor to the Minister 
would leave it to the Minister ’s judgment what he tells the 
President and what he doesn’t tell him and when he tells 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 109 of 134 
 
him and that the special advisor would simply advise the 
Minister and the Minister as a certain relationship with the 
President and how they interact but that might – you might 
not share that, but that is what I am thinking. 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is a mistaken view Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is not practically how it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would advise the Minister. 
MR MAHLANGU:   You would overrule him if he doesn’t 
believe it is important.   There are instances where we 
10 
overrule. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your advice to him would include 
what to bring to the attention of the President as well? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but I see also that in terms of that 
statement it seems that you considered that it was 
important not just that the President should be informed 
about 
Mr 
Gama’s 
possible 
reinstatement 
or 
intended 
reinstatement but that he should be informed of the 
settlement and I take it you mean the terms of the 
20 
settlement, is it fair to read it like that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I think Chair that is correct and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, let me leave it at that. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 110 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes thank you.  So did Mr Gigaba 
socialise the President, Gigaba socialise the President and 
his key aides? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I don’t know Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you not follow up with him? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I may have like I said there’s memory 
lapses there, I don’t know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There’s memory lapses? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am saying I cannot recall, maybe that 
10 
is an inelegant use of language, but I cannot recall Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because let’s go to page 180, you 
say we shall take discussions on some of these letters 
eyeball to eyeball.   Does that not help jog your memory? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am not sure if we had – I used – some 
of these things I would use them to – these emails I would 
send them to the Minister so that in case we don’t, 
sometimes the Minister is in Cape Town, sometimes I am in 
Pretoria, sometimes we are both at the same geography, 
20 
but the important thing is that I do not recall him going to 
the President, if he did, I mean the Minister is around, he 
can testify to that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes well it seems the Minister have 
to update his affidavit or supplement it like you did after 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 111 of 134 
 
your testimony. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I do not recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because the Minister he puts up a 
one paragraph affidavit where he says he knows nothing 
about this at all, which your evidence shows cannot be 
true. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I cannot comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well as you said that as special advisor 
to the Minister you would advise and it would be up to the 
Minister to take your advice or not to take it, and I think 
10 
there are a number of examples that you have made in one 
of your affidavits where you say he did not take your 
advice, he took the advice of other colleagues of yours or 
other people in the department.  I would have thought that 
whether he socialised the – whether he went along with 
your advice that he should socialise the President, whether 
he went along with that advice or not would have been 
quite important for you to know, for further advice because 
maybe if the President wasn’t happy or was happy might 
influence how you advise him going forward. 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:    Chair in an ideal circumstance yes, but 
in the political and administrative centres things happen 
vertically and you have advised and you then saw that the 
Minister then is aware of your advice, that is your primary 
issue, so in this instance Chair consistent with the work 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 112 of 134 
 
that we are doing there I would have to take something 
else to confirm whether he did or didn’t, and whether we 
had a further discussion after that I do not have any 
specific recollection.  I do not dispute that it would have 
been important to follow up, but right now I do not have 
enough facts to assist you with that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What would you need to c heck Mr 
Mahlangu? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I am saying I would have to look at the 
correspondence between me and the DG or the – internal 
10 
correspondence within the department at that time, whether 
there was any formal letter written to the President or 
whether there was any diary entry, requested meeting with 
the President. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, please speak to the 
Chairperson. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Oh sorry.  I would have had to verify 
from objective evidence within the Department whether the 
Minister did or reported back to us. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So as things stand now you don’t 
20 
know whether Minister Gigaba did that but your advice was 
that he certainly should. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so that is the 18 t h of 
January.  We know then from the 24 t h of January to the 1 s t 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 113 of 134 
 
of February you go to India, so that ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   I am not sure if the dates are correct 
but yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what you asked, you asked 
for leave, if you go to your bullet point one. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes, I am saying I am not sure if those 
eventually that was the date but somewhere around those 
times. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so on those dates that you 
gave the Minister your trip was planned from 24 January to 
10 
1 February.  Now just to follow the chronology, on the 21 s t 
of January, that was the first board meeting Transnet where 
Mr Gama was discussed.  I am trying to trace the steps to 
your next email of the 4 t h of February. 
 
So we know you are back on about the 1 s t or 2 n d of 
February, the board meeting on the 21 s t of January and 
now I want to get to a meeting that was held the day before 
your 4 February email, and that was a meeting of the 
Corporate Governance Nominations Committee.  Perhaps I 
could ask you please to go to file one, Bundle 1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one that has got your emails. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one that has got your emails, 
SMA1 and SMA2. 
MR MANHLANGU:   Oh, thank you Chair. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 114 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And – yes I beg your pardon, it is the 
same file, can you turn all the way to page 855. 
MR MAHLANGU:   855. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now this is a meeting that precedes 
your discussion and email of the next day.  Perhaps in 
fairness let me take you to page 827 first.   
MR MAHLANGU:   827? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   827.  So you see there minutes of a 
meeting, Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee 
on 3 February 2011, present Mr Mkwanazi etcetera, do you 
10 
see that? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at 1.4 also Mr Mapoma. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the business of this committee 
Mr Mahlangu on this day was by and large to debate 
whether or not Mr Gama, his application for the position of 
Group Chief Executive should be allowed, and whether 
there should be a deviation from what is known as Clause 
4.8.4 which says as a general rule if you are dismissed you 
20 
cannot be re-employed. 
 
So that was the debate and we know that you deal 
with this in your email of the 4 t h of February, further to a 
discussion you had with Mr Mkwanazi. 
 
Now I am referring you now to page 855, also part 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 115 of 134 
 
of the transcript and at 855 at 695 on the left hand side Mr 
Mkwanazi had asked Mr Mapoma to give his view on Mr 
Gama’s dismissal, issue of settlement etcetera, and this is 
the passage where he says now advise the Chair to say: 
“If we at Transnet go to the appeal and oppose the 
appeal, that is the arbitration, we stand a very good 
chance of winning that appeal, that was my view at 
the time.  Where I am saying we are not strong 
Doris, that is the director, is if we have to explain 
the rationality of why we are settling I do not think 
10 
we are on very strong ground on that.  That is my 
view but on the disciplinary process itself and if we 
go and argue the matter on appeal we stand a very 
good chance of succeeding.  Siya can win, but we 
can also win as Transnet, we have a very, very good 
case against him there.” 
So it seems then that the discussion that you have with Mr 
Mkwanazi on the 4 t h of February then gives rise to your 
email, it is in this context, the debate about allowing Mr 
Gama’s application, correct? 
20 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what is also important for the 
purposes of your evidence, and we are going to come to it 
just now, is you see how Mr Mapoma is really dead against 
settlement. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 116 of 134 
 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact he says it would be irrational 
to settle. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see that?  And Mr Mapona 
was as forthright when it came to the issue of the payment 
of Mr Gama’s costs, you might have seen his, listened to 
his evidence. 
MR MAHLANGU:   I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He was utterly opposed to the 
10 
payment of Mr Gama’s costs, you would have heard that, 
correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   I saw that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us then go to your email of the 
next day, the 4 t h of February.  We need to go back please 
to page 181 of this bundle, and here you say on the 4 t h of 
February ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLANGU:   The page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   181, your second email. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say: 
“Dear Minister 
At my meeting with Chair ...” 
I assume that is Mr Mkwanazi, is that right? 
MR MAHLANGU:   Yes. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 117 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And your supplementary affidavit 
says that you would have held that meeting on or about the 
same day. 
MR MAHLANGU:   Probably. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And really what you discussed with 
him was this issue of Mr Gama and his application for 
Group Chief Executive, correct? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And along the way you also 
discussed with him the issue of a settlement with Mr 
10 
Gama? 
MR MAHLANGU:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the two things were intertwined 
weren’t they? 
MR MAHLANGU:   In my view they were. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They were or they weren’t? 
MR MAHLANGU:   They were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to put to you ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR MHLANGU:   You cannot. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You cannot? 
MR MHLANGU:   It is not something we do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, can you not pressure your elder 
respectfully? 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 118 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   But you persuade, chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   And if not, you do not.  So I... what I am 
trying to say Chair.  I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
MR MHLANGU:   I did not.  And the way... Chair, I wish I 
could play out how we used to live between 1999 and 2019-
ish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   Thereabout and that.  This was a... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   And why he denies that he was at those 
braais with us, I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Mhlangu, then I must also put to 
you.  We have dealt with the motive and reason.  Then you 
say: 
“Well, 
I 
would 
have 
raised 
these 
issues 
with 
Mr Mkwanazi.” 
 
But that is the point.  You see, what I want to put to you.  
20 
An analyses of the evidence may very well reflect in this 
case.  But Mr Mkwanazi was only too keen to do this deal 
and give Mr Gama whatever he wanted.   
 
The person that was opposed to this, certainly in relation 
to costs, was Mr Mapoma.  So it did not... it would not help 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 119 of 134 
 
you to phone Mr Mkwanazi.  Mr Mkwanazi was not the 
problem.   
MR MHLANGU:   Chair, I think what I am saying is that 
Mr Mkwanazi did not tell me that Mr Mapoma had certain 
concerns about.  That I do not know.  I have left, like I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, your reason ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   My view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mkwanazi did not say he called you 
about that.  He also said he did not recall whether 
Mr Mapoma had told him that you had called him and 
10 
pressurising him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then this paragraph where he say: 
Well, I do not refer to a sitting president who is 
Number 1.” 
 
I mean, you cannot suggest that is persuasive. 
MR MHLANGU:   With respect.  It depends from which 
political tradition you emerge from. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   Some called them chief in a particular area, 
during the Mbeki area.  With me, it has always been JZ or 
20 
TM or those... it is in your daily grind. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you phone this man or not? 
MR MHLANGU:   I do not know if I phoned the man as in and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 120 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   ...and as a matter of a physical phone call 
Chair.  Because I knew the gentleman well.  I cannot deny 
that I placed a physical call but that call had been predicated 
on my social relations with him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   I did not call him Chair to pressure him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is a very important evidence that 
you give now.  I mean, do I understand you know to be 
saying that you accept that you phoned him roundabout this 
time? 
10 
MR MHLANGU:   I do not accept that.  I am saying 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What were you saying? 
MR MHLANGU:   I am saying.  I cannot recall that I called 
him.  I do not deny that I may have placed a physical 
call...[intervenes]  
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
And 
why 
would 
you 
have 
...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   ...in the engineering ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why would you have done that around 
20 
this time? 
MR MHLANGU:   Because I know him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, yes that is the point. 
MR MHLANGU:   Because I know him.  Not because I 
intended to pressure him, Mr Myburgh. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 121 of 134 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mhlangu, let us just deal with this 
because of course this is not something you deal with in your 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  So your point is.  Is your point 
you may have called him but the purpose would have been 
different? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you called him, you would have wanted 
to talk about something else? 
MR MHLANGU:   We were going... we either spoke... that is 
10 
why I am saying.  Because I knew him, it is difficult for me to 
deny that there could have been a phone call during that 
period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   Particularly, Chair.  He was in the space 
that I knew... that he knew better than I was and I was new 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   It... but I would not pick up the call for the 
purposes of pressurising him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could you have picked up a call to 
persuade him? 
MR MHLANGU:   No, I was not.  Like I said, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MHLANGU:   My view of the matter was clinical.  This 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 122 of 134 
 
thing could have been dealt with.  There was no urgency for 
me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you accept then that you may, 
during the course of February, have placed a telephonic call 
to Mr Mapoma.   
MR MHLANGU: That is correct.     
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you not say that in your 
10 
affidavit? 
MR MHLANGU:   The critical thing I dealt with in my affidavit 
was I understood, and this is my understanding, was that I 
pressured him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So can we then deal with, assuming 
you had made this call because Mr Mapoma says there was 
one roundabout this time in February.  What is it that you 
would have discussed with him? 
MR MHLANGU:   I do not know Mr Myburgh.  I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do not know? 
20 
MR MHLANGU:   What...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you not even think what you might 
have discussed with him? 
MR MHLANGU:   Mr Myburgh, I do not know.  What I am 
saying to you is that I knew the man.  There could have been 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 123 of 134 
 
many things we could have spoken about.  I could have 
sought advice about things happening at Transnet.   
 
I could have sought things.  But I did not call him to 
pressurise him because pressurising him is a specific event.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what typically... because I did not 
know these facts before that you seemingly would regularly 
speak to Mr Mapoma on the phone.  What typically then 
would you discuss with him? 
MR MHLANGU:   Mr Myburgh, I am unable to recall the 
issues but like I said to you.  We are in the same social 
10 
circle.  He was at Transnet.  I am new in the SOE 
environment.  I could have asked for advice.   
 
I could have been discussing the happenings at the time, 
right.  But I would not have pressured him.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   That is my evidence, is that I did not 
pressure Mr Mapoma. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see Mr Mhlangu, you really now 
add something to my list on the probabilities because you did 
phone him.  You do not deny that there could have been a 
20 
discussion. 
MR MHLANGU:   I did not say I phoned him.  I said because 
of the nature of my relation with Mr Mapoma ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...it is possible that I may have phoned him, 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 124 of 134 
 
Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but what you are saying is, that 
insofar as Mr Mapoma says, one, there was a telephone call.  
I will not... I cannot dispute that.  Because I might ordinarily 
phone him.   
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  And it is really important what you 
say because you were new on the block, right?  Here was 
someone inside Transnet that you knew well, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, I think I have already made 
my points to you.  I just want to ask you one more.  What is 
it that you would typically speak to Mr Mapoma about when 
you placed these calls to him? 
MR MHLANGU:   Chair, I have answered this question. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What is the answer? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Maybe, let me put it this way.  You 
did say you had regular interactions with Mr Mkwanazi.  Is 
that right? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 Yes. 
 
Did 
you 
also 
have 
regular 
interactions with Mr Mapoma? 
MR MHLANGU:   Not to my recollection Chair.  It is not 
regular but it is not unusual for a call to have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 125 of 134 
 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, whenever you had interactions with 
him by way of phone calls, what type of issues would you 
have 
discussed 
with 
him 
during 
that 
time, 
generally 
speaking? 
MR MHLANGU:   Chair, and I am just saying this, trying to 
reconstruct.  I think that I would have sought certain insights 
on things that would have either been happening at Transnet 
or in the SOE environment in general.   
 
And that probably would then dovetailed to whatever 
10 
other social discussions there could have been at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, I mean, then you... you 
make really the very point I am driving at.  It would have 
been insights.  Here the common issue between you and 
Mr Mapoma was Mr Gama.  Both of you were dealing with 
that, correct? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  All the more reason then why 
you would have had the discussion that he describes. 
20 
MR MHLANGU:   That is impossible.  It is impossible, Chair.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then I ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLANGU:   I stand here today pained to try to 
remember.  To try to say why.  I have spoken to some of the 
people I knew who also know him who was senior and I was 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 126 of 134 
 
like, this for me is bizarre.  And Mr Myburgh, it really pains 
me.  So I do not know.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
We 
are 
at 
eight 
minutes 
past 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have got only one more question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, if I may.  I mean, it might 
lead to one or two others but it will not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  I just wanted 
10 
to have an idea that... I wanted us to have... to go on the 
same page. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, we... for purposes of finishing.  I 
do not mind if we go up to half-past one if everybody is fine 
with that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rather than adjourn for lunch and come 
back.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, look but ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be fine with you? 
MR MHLANGU:   That is fine with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what I then want to ask you and I 
mean I suppose there is a shortcut way of dealing with it.  
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 127 of 134 
 
Did you listen to the evidence of Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MHLANGU:   I listened to the evidence of Mr Mkwanazi.  
Yes, on Monday.  Is that right? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I am not... I am just going to ask 
you this and you can comment if you want to comment.  But 
certainly on an analyses of the evidence that was led by 
Mr Mkwanazi.   
 
It is certainly arguable that the only rational basis for the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama on the terms that he was 
reinstated is that there must have been an instruction, a 
10 
political instruction because otherwise, it makes absolutely 
no sense.   
MR MHLANGU:   Chair, I cannot comment on that.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe one can ask this.  And maybe 
your answer that you cannot comment includes this but I just 
want to make sure.  You have had a chance to look at that 
settlement, the terms of that settlement agreement, have you 
not? 
MR MHLANGU:   I have Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I asked Mr Mkwanazi when he gave 
evidence here what he would say if somebody said it was 
indefensible. 
 
The 
reinstatement 
of 
Mr 
Gama 
was 
indefensible in the light of everything that he said and if he 
considered that it was indefensible.   
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 128 of 134 
 
 
Would you share that or is that something you prefer not 
to comment on? 
MR MHLANGU:   I will leave that to the Board of Transnet, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  You see... okay, 
maybe let me allow Mr Myburgh to finish his questions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is really the only question that I 
had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Look, you see Mr Mhlangu, when one 
looks at that settlement agreement and I would have 
10 
expected you as an experienced lawyer to have a view about 
whether this is, on the face of it.   
 
I mean, you might not know all the facts but on the face 
of it, whether it seems... it does not seem very strange.   
 
But when you look at it, you say to yourself but why 
would 
the 
Board 
of 
Transnet 
conclude 
a 
settlement 
agreement on these terms?   
 
Particularly when you have read the judgment and court 
of ruling of the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry.  And of 
course, there is also a report or opinion by Mr Todd from 
20 
Bowman Gilfillan who was Transnet’s attorney in regard to 
the Gama matter until his mandate was terminated sometime, 
I think, in January.   
 
And he and Transnet... the board took the matter to 
Deneys Reitz.  One of the things they do is, they undertake 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 129 of 134 
 
to pay Mr Gama’s 75% of Mr Gama’s costs in relation to a 
high court application that he had brought before his 
disciplinary 
inquiry 
where 
he 
sought 
to 
interdict 
the 
disciplinary inquiry and he lost.   
 
And the high court ordered him to pay Transnet’s costs.  
Now that was a matter that had been finalised.  He applied 
for leave to appeal.  That was refused.  That matter was 
finalised.   
 
The high court had ordered costs in favour of Transnet.  
When they settle the dismissal matter, they say instead of 
10 
enforcing the high court costs order in their favour against 
Mr Gama, they instruct Mr Todd who had gone a long way to 
try and recover those costs.  That is about R 426 000,00.  
They instruct him to stop that.   
 
And instead, they say:  Mr Gama, we will pay 75% of 
your costs.  Now I do not know about you but throughout my 
experience [laughing] in law, I have never heard of anything 
like that Of a party who has been ordered by a court to pay 
my costs.   
 
I say:  No, do not worry.  I will pay 75% of your costs.  It 
20 
is something that is unthinkable.  And then they say he 
must... they give him a final written warning.  But they say 
the final written warning will begin to have started running 
from the day he was dismissed for six months and six months 
ended in December 2010.   
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 130 of 134 
 
 
They are signing the settlement agreement in February 
2011.  So it is ineffective.  You say: What were they thinking?  
How can you give a written warning that will not be 
applicable when the person comes back?   
 
Then they say:  Okay in relation to the unfair dismissal 
claim, we will also pay 75% of Mr Gama’s costs.   
 
Now, I do not know how much labour matters you know 
but Mr Myburgh here and Mr Todd, you know, deal a lot with 
labour matters.   
 
And labour matters, you know, in the Bargaining Council, 
10 
CCMA and Labour Court, it is not easy for the losing party to 
be ordered to pay costs for the winning party.   
 
It is something very rare.  And here, this is what the 
Transnet Board undertook to do in circumstances where 
Mr Gama had been given a very fair disciplinary process.   
 
In circumstances where he had been found guilty of 
three very serious acts of misconduct.   
 
In circumstances where, at that time, the board knew 
that he accepted that he had been properly found guilty of 
those.  He was no longer disputing that.   
20 
 
Then you ask yourself the question:  Under what 
circumstances would a board have ever thought they were at 
risk of being ordered by the Bargaining Council to pay 100% 
of his costs because that is the only thinking one can think 
of.   
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 131 of 134 
 
 
To say:  Well, maybe they thought well let us offer to pay 
75% so that... because we are at risk of being ordered to pay 
100%.  You do not understand all of those things.   
 
That is apart from other things.  Those are just some of 
the things.  But you might still... you might not be able to say 
anything. 
MR MHLANGU:   Look Chair, I would only express a view like 
yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   Because I do not know ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MHLANGU:   ...what the board ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, so... but the point I 
wanted to make is, that when you have a settlement 
agreement like that, you look for a reason why the employer 
would settle on those terms which are very much in favour of 
the employee and against the employer.   
 
And you look at the merits of the case, you will find that 
20 
the employer had a very strong case.  So it cannot be... so 
you say it does not look like it can be the merits of the case 
that drove them to agree to these terms.  So what is it?  You 
start looking, okay?   
 
And then of course, Mr Mkwanazi says at the first 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 132 of 134 
 
meeting I had with Minister Gigaba where he offered me the 
position of Chair of the board which I subsequently accepted.   
 
One of the issues he raised upfront was the issue of Mr 
Gama’s dismissal and Mr Mkwanazi said Minister Gigaba 
expressed the view that Mr Gigaba’s(sic) dismissal had been 
unfair.  And he instructed him and the board to review the 
matter.  That is what happened.   
 
And then of course, Mr Mapoma.  Here is the evidence 
that he gave including that you called him and pressured and 
pressured him.   
10 
 
And then in the contexts of all of this, one has to go 
back to the evidence of Ms Barbara Hogan which Mr Myburgh 
applied earlier on.  Ms Barbara Hogan said the then 
President, Mr Zuma when she recommended...  
 
She told him that the board had recommended Mr Sipho 
Maseko for the position of Group CEO for Transnet, 
responded by saying:  He had only one choice and his choice 
for that position was Mr Gama.   
 
Mr Zuma has denied having said that.  But in the end, if 
the finding were to be that Ms Hogan’s evidence is true then 
20 
one would then look at what happened after.  And one looks 
at this kind of mysterious reinstatement of Mr Gama.   
 
And actually, about, within three years after that, after 
he has been reinstated to this position, he actually becomes 
Group CEO of Transnet.   
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 133 of 134 
 
 
So one cannot divorce a consideration of the issues form 
all of this.  So I thought I would just mention that to you.  To 
say, you know, there are all these aspects that have to be 
looked into.   
MR MHLANGU:   I agree, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   Chair, I think that... you have asked that 
question about. For me, as you were going through it, my 
question was.   
 
In a settlement you want to know what the other party 
10 
gave and what you are buying.  And those are determinations 
which I think were made by the board.   
 
So I am unable... I am also reading it clinically.  From a 
lawyers’ perspective, it is a bit curious.  But I do not know if 
there were commercial considerations which must be brought 
before you by the board.   
 
 
And I want... and the reason I do not want to comment 
deeply on it is because the board at the time had eminent 
persons in it with very serious experience and running big 
corporates including listed companies.   
20 
 
So that I why I would.. I want to defer that to there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MHLANGU:   But insofar as my part is concerned Chair.  
I have said what I have said and I think Chair, I cannot take 
it further. 
23 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 290 
 
Page 134 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MHLANGU:   Other than the fact that I was in no... I was 
not in an auto modem(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MHLANGU:   I exercised my judgment as I saw it.  I gave 
advice and when necessary, I would just let the system work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  No, thank you.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We have no further questions.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Thank you.   
10 
MR MHLANGU:   Thank you, Mr Myburgh.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you very much Mr Mhlangu for 
coming to assist the Commission.  I think probably you would 
still come back because of the other matters but thank you 
very much for coming to assist the Commission. 
MR MHLANGU:   Thank you Chair and thanks Mr Myburgh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused.  So we will adjourn for 
the day. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And just for the public, next week the 
20 
Commission will hear evidence relating to Denel.  We 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 26 OCTOBER 2020
