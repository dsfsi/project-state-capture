PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 27 JANUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.  Chair in 
relation to the next witness there is first an application to 
be brought and in relation to the next witness certain 
logistical arrangements need to be made about the venue 
from which she will testify which is a secret location or an 
undisclosed location rather.  So until those arrangements 
have been finalised which should be very shortly may we 
10 
take a short adjournment?   
 
We also have Advocate Moerane who is on line who 
wishes to just make a brief statement in relation to 
yesterday’s evidence and his client Mr Jafta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Good morning Mr Moerane. 
ADV MOERANE:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You wish to say something about 
the proceedings yesterday? 
ADV MOERANE:  Yes Chair.  Chair will recall that at the 
end of Mr Jafta’s evidence you called upon me to indicate 
20 
whether or not I had any re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOERANE:  I responded to that but apparently 
nobody could hear me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we certainly did not hear you. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 4 of 159 
 
ADV MOERANE:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we assume you … 
ADV MOERANE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – I assumed you might have left. 
ADV MOERANE:  But – no, no, no I was not going to leave 
until and unless I was excused.  Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOERANE:  But the long and the short of it is that I – 
I did not have any re-examination for Mr Jafta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no thank you very much.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV MOERANE:  And secondly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOERANE:  If any such technical glitch occurs in the 
future Mr Ndebele is there ably to represent him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no, no that is fine.  Well I am – 
although I said you might have left it was not – I did not 
think that you would leave without permission.  I actually 
thought there might have been… 
ADV MOERANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just technical. 
20 
ADV MOERANE:  No thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So – but thank you for making 
yourself available just to set the record straight and of 
course you have confirmed that you did not intend to re-
examine Mr Jafta.   
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 5 of 159 
 
ADV MOERANE:  That is correct Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  And for 
purposes of today do you wish to be excused or are you 
going to be with us? 
ADV MOERANE:  No, no, no I will be here.  I am actually 
briefed to represent the State Security Agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MOERANE:  Not the particular witness but the 
Agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
ADV MOERANE:  Itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no.  So you are with us for the 
whole week? 
ADV MOERANE:  For the whole week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MOERANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay no that is alright.  Okay we are 
going to adjourn and then for a brief period and then 
resume but I see Counsel there is Counsel who wants to 
say something. 
20 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And this is in relation to what was 
presented yesterday Chair yesterday’s evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 6 of 159 
 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   It is in relation to yesterday’s 
evidence that is why I felt perhaps it is appropriate for me 
to with your permission to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   To place the following on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
UNKNOWN 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
Chair 
we 
– 
yesterday 
we 
instructed our clients to place the following on record.  In 
the morning we are short by the Chairperson and the 
evidence leader Pretorius but none of our clients would be 
10 
implicated by Mr Jafta’s evidence.  
 
With that in mind and the need to mitigate the costs 
to our client we are inclined and we had indicated to the 
Chairperson that we are inclined to leave the hearing but 
thankfully our client’s instructed us to stay for the duration 
of Mr Jafta’s evidence. 
 
Regard being had to Mr Jafta’s written statement we 
understood why the Chairperson believed that none of our 
clients would be implicated by – in his testimony. 
 
The assurance notwithstanding Mr Jafta testified 
20 
that a sum of R125 million and assets to the value of R9 
billion 
were 
unaccounted 
for 
in 
the 
financial 
year 
2017/2018 and he attributed this to projects allegedly 
carried out of the office of the Accounting General – sorry 
Accounting Officer. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 7 of 159 
 
 
It is common cause that SSA’s budget per annum is 
nothing close to R9 billion for them to lose that much in a 
year.  This obvious and we submit deliberate falsehoods 
will be rebutted in due course. 
 
Understandably 
the 
Chairperson 
was 
shocked 
saying and I quote: 
“How could a government department not be 
able to account for R9 billion?” 
 
And remarked that: 
“I have a suspicion that no heads rolled” 
10 
 
And that this money may have gone to people’s 
pockets implying possible theft.  Mr Jafta agreed thereto. 
 
Naturally 
we 
expect 
the 
Chairperson 
at 
the 
conclusion of the evidence related to SSA to conclude 
where wrongs have been identified but heads must roll.  
And we have no objection thereto. 
 
The Chairperson even concluded that this money 
had disappeared and asked if any action was taken against 
the 
Accounting 
Officer. 
This 
implies 
that 
even 
the 
Chairperson it was clear that the Accounting Officer was at 
20 
that stage implicated in wrongdoing and requiring that 
action be taken against him. 
 
It is his 00:06:36 Chairman who is the Accounting 
Officer during the financial 2017/2018 was and to that 
extent a certain publication yesterday already wrote that 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 8 of 159 
 
SSA lost R125 million without trace during Arthur Frasers’ 
watch 00:06:51 to State Capture Inquiry. 
 
This reckless falsehood that our client pocketed R9 
billion out of taxpayers’ money renders him and his family 
vulnerable and makes him an enemy of the people of South 
Africa and therefore initially target in the eyes of many. 
 
Even if it was to be accepted that was – it was not 
anticipated that by the commission or Advocate Pretorius 
that 
our 
client 
would 
be 
implicated 
by 
Mr 
Jafta.   
 
It is our submission that Advocate Pretorius could 
10 
have 
advised 
the 
witness 
against 
un-procedurally 
implicating our client.   And this being almost three years 
since our client had left SSA.  This was the first time that 
he heard that about such a huge amount of money being 
accounted for under his watch.  Yet Mr Jafta who as a 
diligent Accounting Officer had a duty to raise this – these 
worrying findings with Mr Fraser; knew where Mr Fraser 
was and did nothing about it. 
 
For the record we have since established that SSA 
is aware that no assets to the value of R9 billion are 
20 
unaccounted for. 
 
Similarly we have been advised that R125 million 
was unaccounted for during 2017/2018 financial year owing 
to SSA under Mr Jafta’s leadership not providing the 
Auditor General with the supporting documents they had 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 9 of 159 
 
and continued to have in their possession while they SSA 
conducted what is now clearly a malicious investigation 
against Mr Fraser. 
 
Evidence in this regard will be led in due course.  It 
would have been prudent we submit Chairperson upon the 
evidence leader being a neutral person interested in 
uncovering the truth to have at least asked Mr Jafta if his 
predecessor was informed thereof. 
 
This was certainly not done.  The blatant omission 
00:09:00 
perceptions 
of 
biased 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
10 
commission or its evidence leaders.  Especially in the view 
of the fact that the right to cross-examination of witnesses 
is not automatic.  The [?] notwithstanding the commission 
without fail failed to save – to serve a Rule 3.3 Notice on 
our client.  Taking into account that yesterday we were only 
provided with a copy of Mr Jafta’s statement which was 
obviously silent on the offending allegations. 
 
We request that in addition to the statement being 
provided we have been provided with that we request that 
we be provided with copies of all documents forming the 
20 
basis of this serious allegation against our client. 
 
And we place on record that our client remains 
committed to the principles of accountability, transparency, 
good corporate governance and in view of the above he 
recommits himself as he has always done to assist in the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 10 of 159 
 
commission uncover the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you Counsel.  It is a legitimate 
for you and your client to raise the matter.  Mr Pretorius do 
you want to say something now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or later? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we had been afforded the 
courtesy in advance of what my learned friend was going to 
say including the serious accusations he makes one would 
have thought that it is proper that we be given notice of 
10 
what he has to say. We will look at it and we will respond 
in due course. 
 
But Mr Fraser ’s rights are protected by the fact that 
he can make any application he wishes to you in a formal 
sense and should he be in a position where he needs more 
time or more consideration before he brings an application 
to cross-examine which he may do to give his own 
evidence which he may do he can rectify the situation.  
Insofar and I do not make no concessions at this stage 
insofar as there is a legitimate complaint.  He has his 
20 
remedies. 
 
But only in fairness as Mr Fraser ’s representative 
seems to insist on yes we should be given notice of these 
matters so we can deal with them properly.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright we will take an adjournment 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 11 of 159 
 
it is twenty five past. It may well be that the logistical 
arrangements are about to be ready maybe it will be ten 
minutes adjournment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it should… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It should not be longer than that I 
will check now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will adjourn for ten minutes.  We 
10 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius.  I see my registrar has 
not put any file here. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the first 
matter before you is an application made on behalf of Ms K 
20 
and indeed by Ms K to give her evidence from a protected 
location and in such a manner as her identity will be 
revealed.  So it is not evidence in-camera.  It is just 
evidence under conditions in which her identity will be 
protected.   
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 12 of 159 
 
 
Ms K, as you will see from the affidavit before you, is 
employed the State Security Agency.  She is the part of the 
Veza Investigation Team.  She is involved in ongoing 
investigations of a sensitive nature.   And as such, for those 
two reasons, her identity should be kept confidential.   
 
There is president for this because Mr Y who will 
become relevant later, when we introduce Ms K, had a 
similar order given in respect of his evidence previously.  
And should he return to give evidence, we will ask for a 
similar order to be given once more.   
10 
 
The nature of the evidence that she will give, which is 
highlighted in the affidavit before you, and the nature of her 
duties, which are highlighted in paragraph 12 and following 
of the application, make it clear that her evidence should 
and in fact must be given under protected identity.   
 
The affidavit also talks of threats and intimidation that 
have been undergone by the members of the Investigation 
Team.  It also talks of attempts to interfere with and 
sabotage the Veza Investigation.  Those are dealt with in 
paragraph 15.   
20 
 
And finally, the regulatory framework demands and 
regulates the protection of identify of SSA members and we 
asked that those be applied, there be no exceptions made.  
The order that we seek – if I can just quickly give you a copy 
Chair? 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 13 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the fact of the matter is that – or the 
grounds for the order are, one, because of her status as 
employed by SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two, that there have been acts of 
intimidation relating to people working with her or something 
like that? 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes, and the investigation in which 
she is involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The investigation in which she is involved.  
10 
Okay alright.  I see there is counsel who wants to say 
something. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Our instructions are to oppose this 
application.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it all of your clients who are opposing 
it? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   All of our clients Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Oppose it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   It is common cause Chairperson 
that we were never informed or rather provided a copy of this 
witness with a 3.3. Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And the rules of 3.3. provides that if 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 14 of 159 
 
the Commission’s Legal Team intends to present to the 
Commission a witness whose witness – whose evidence 
implicates or may implicate another person, it must through 
the secretary of the Commission notify that person that is 
the indicated person in writing with a reasonable time before 
the witness’ evidence: 
1. 3.3.1 that he or she may be implicated by the 
witness’s evidence;   
2. 3.3.2 in which way he or she may be implicated 
and furnish him or her with the witness statement 
10 
or portions of the statement.   
 
As we stand, we do not have a copy of – and we do not 
have a notice for this witness and we do not have a copy or 
portion of her statement.   
 
All that we have Chairperson is an email that we 
received on Saturday afternoon which said – or let us talk 
about the notice about the witness called Mr Y.  And the 
letter said:   
“Due to unforeseen circumstances Mr Y will not be 
able to testify during the furnishing(?) period and it 
20 
has become necessary for Ms K, the Project 
Manager of Project Veza, to testify in his place.  The 
substance 
and 
import 
of 
the 
averments 
that 
implicate or may implicate you was letters that were 
written to our clients, is the same.” 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 15 of 159 
 
 
It is common cause Chairman that the duty to provide 
our clients with a notice and a statement is not optional.  It 
is legislative requirement.   
 
The evidence leaders are obliged to provide our clients 
with the statement.  We cannot unwish(?) in this manner.  To 
understand that we are told that Ms K will be testifying in the 
place of Mr Y.   
 
You know, almost, you know, it amounts, you know, to – 
when you bring up watch amateur soccer.  You know, 
whether substitute a player and the player goes out, he 
10 
takes his jersey and the ones that is coming in.  You know, 
that 
cannot 
be. 
 
That 
cannot 
be 
allowed 
in 
these 
proceedings.  Rule 3.5 provides that: 
“If an implicated person believes that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you complain as a soccer fan that 
the substitute should be wearing his own jersey, not the 
other player’s jersey? 
UNKNOWN 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
Well, 
they 
have 
rules 
for 
substitution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
20 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Basically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   But that as well.  We have – we 
have – especially – ja, they are not that yellow team.  But at 
any rate.  It is common cause or rather Rule 3.5 provides 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 16 of 159 
 
that: 
“An 
implicated 
person 
believes 
that 
the 
Commission’s Legal Team did not give him or her 
the 
notice 
referred 
to 
in 
Rule 
3.3. 
within 
a 
reasonable time before the witness could or was to 
give evidence and that this may be prejudicial to him 
or her, her or she may apply to the Commission for 
such an order as it will ensure that he or she is not 
seriously prejudiced.” 
 
This application thus supports that notice has been 
10 
given.  In this case, none has been given.  So we are left 
with no recourse, really, in terms of the rules. 
 
The Legal Team has no discretion, discretion right or 
duty to ignore the rules.  And they cannot use time 
constraints as justification to undermine the rules and our 
client’s rights.   
 
With regards to evidence – we are told it is not evidence 
in-camera but – well, we are told what the distinction is 
between what they want the evidence leaders want to do now 
in evidence-in-chief... in-camera. 
20 
 
We have been advised that – or we believe that this is 
evidence in-camera.  Rule 4(1) provides that: 
“Subject 
to 
Rule 
4(2), 
the 
hearings 
of 
the 
Commission will be held in public.” 
 
Rule 4(2) says: 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 17 of 159 
 
“In an appropriate case, the Chairperson may make 
an order that a hearing be held in-camera. 
In such a case, the Chairperson shall specify in the 
order those person who will be berated to attend the 
hearing in-camera.” 
 
The import of the rule Chairperson, we submit that, as a 
general rule, hearings must be in public.  And this is the 
argument that was basically advanced by the evidence 
leaders yesterday when – during the application by the 
Minister for the matter to stand down. 
10 
 
And similarly Chairperson.  On Monday, when we applied 
for these hearing to be held in-camera, we are told that we 
have got to bring a substantial application. 
 
As we stand, we have not received any application.  We 
are the interested party.  We should have been served with 
an application if there is any. 
 
To depart from the general rule we submit Chairperson 
that an appropriate case has to be made.  Well, we are left 
to speculate what these intimidations are, by whom.   
 
It is as if she is not even saying she was pestering 
20 
intimidated.  Those members of the team received or were 
intimidated but at any rate to the extent that we did not have 
the application we could not even entertain the contents 
thereof.  Rule 9(2) clearly states that: 
“A witness may apply to the Chairperson at least two 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 18 of 159 
 
weeks before he or she is scheduled to appear at 
the hearing to have his or her evidence taken in-
camera.” 
 
Well, the impression we have is that this application, if 
anything, must have been submitted to the Chairperson the 
earlier on Saturday when we were told that we are 
substituting. 
 
So 
in 
the 
circumstances 
Chairperson, 
are 
our 
instructions are to oppose, one, the admission of Ms K to the 
extent that we have not been provided with the notice and to 
10 
the extent... 
 
And considering Chairperson that this would be- well, 
concerning yesterday’s witness, the fifth witness, at least in 
respect of one of my clients, that is testifying without notice. 
 
This cannot and should not – this injustice cannot and 
should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
persist. 
 
It 
is 
time 
that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the first order that is asked for in the 
order that has been applied for, asks me to condone the fact 
that no notice is given to implicated parties.  So in other 
20 
words, there is a clear understanding that, on the part of the 
Legal team, that the norm is to give notice to implicated 
parties but in this particular case, it is submitted that the 
circumstances justify not given notice to implicated persons 
and that would be dealt with – that would have been dealt 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 19 of 159 
 
with in the affidavit. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, you know that there cases 
even in court where a party who brings an application may 
be justified in not giving notice and has to ask the court to 
condone that failure.  And if the court does not condone that 
failure, obviously, the court insists that notice be given. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Well, Chairperson you know, a few 
minutes ago Advocate Pretorius was complaining about me 
not having spoken to, at least, you know, the courtesy of 
10 
letting him know that we are going to read our letter into 
record but it is not understanding the same case that he 
expects from us to ask.   
 
I hear from you for the time now Chairperson that the 
first prayer that is being asked for is condonation, you know, 
not complying with the rules in terms of at least informing us. 
 
We do not know – we are at a terrible disadvantage 
Chairperson.  We find ourselves having to respond to serious 
implications that impact on our clients’ rights without 
knowing what the real application is about and what the 
20 
reason therefore is. 
 
It is my submission Chairperson that this is an injustice 
that cannot be allowed to persist in these hearings.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Chair, once again, we would have 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 20 of 159 
 
appreciated notice of the content of the application being 
made now which the rules require but be that as it may.  I 
will deal with it. 
 
The first issue is whether Ms K should be afforded the 
opportunity to give evidence under a protected identity.  A 
full case has been made out for that. 
 
Those applications may be brought in a manner that it is 
brought for the very nature, for the very reason that is 
contained in the affidavit.  That is the one issue. 
 
But I think my learned friend goes further.  He is now 
10 
saying that Ms K should not give evidence at all because 
they have received no 3.3. Notice.  That is correct.  I would 
have explained that at the commencement of the evidence 
but that is a different issue. 
 
So perhaps we should deal first with the issue of the 
protected identity process and then we can deal with whether 
she should give evidence at all which is another application 
of which we had no notice. 
 
So Chair in relation to the latter I will deal with it after 
the first matter has been disposed of unless you wish me to 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think let us deal with both now. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Since he has...  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Chair, the investigators and the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 21 of 159 
 
Legal Team have been interacting with employees of SSA, 
particularly 
employees 
who 
are 
conducting 
ongoing 
investigations of a sensitive nature. 
 
Mr Y is a member of that team and he was the person 
who provide an affidavit to the Commission after many 
months of hard work.  He has just emerged from a coma and 
is quite indisposed, cannot give evidence. 
 
Ms K can also give her own evidence but she is not here 
to give her own evidence.  She is here to confirm what she 
knows about the statement of Mr Y. 
10 
 
Implicated parties who are implicated by the evidence of 
Mr Y have full knowledge of, a) whether they have been 
implicated and b) the basis upon which they had been 
implicated. 
 
The evidence will not go further than that.  So 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They were served with Mr Y’s affidavit? 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   So Mr Y’s affidavit will be 
20 
presented to you and the evidence will be restricted to the 
contents of Mr Y’s affidavit.  That knowledge is shared by Ms 
Y(sic).  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So effectively, Ms Y ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Ms K. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 22 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Now 
Ms Y(sic) 
is 
coming 
to 
say 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Ms K.  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms K. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   My mistake, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms K is coming to say:  I have read Mr Y’s 
affidavit that has been submitted to the Commission which is 
the evidence he intended to give in this Commission.  I know 
about a lot of matters that he deals with.  I have personal 
knowledge of a lot of matters that he deals with in his 
10 
affidavit. And I am coming to confirm what he would have 
said because I also know it. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the basis on which she is coming. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   To the extent that she has 
additional knowledge.  She will not give that evidence if that 
evidence should implicate any party, who may have slain but 
not to the extent of implicating any other parties. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   And to the extent that she cannot 
confirm what Mr Y has said on his affidavit, she will say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   So the bottom line is.  There can 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 23 of 159 
 
be no prejudice because every piece of evidence to be given 
which might implicate a person, 3.3 Notices have been 
given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   It is just we are substituting one 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   ...concealed identity for another 
concealed identity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It is a matter of ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a matter of, if two people have 
personal knowledge of the same events ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and once becomes unavailable to 
testify, another one comes in to testify in regard to the same 
events. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she too has personal knowledge 
20 
of those events. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she would go along the lines of the 
affidavit that was served on the implicated parties. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes, Chair. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 24 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   So there is simply no prejudice to 
anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   And the reason why it has been 
done this way is that if Ms K was to come and give her own 
evidence, it would involve a delay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   You know that this Commission just 
cannot afford. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m.  Then you wanted to say 
something about not giving notice and... 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes, Chair.  That is the practise 
that these applications are brought in-camera without notice.  
There is simply no way that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   ...we can have an exchange of 
affidavits 
which 
would 
inevitable 
involve 
disclosure 
of 
identity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Counsel for various parties, 
20 
what do you say in response? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And I assume my colleagues as well 
would also want to respond.  And briefly Chairperson.  If 
what was told – we are told is correct that Ms K is here to 
confirm the contents of Mr Y’s affidavit. And we were told 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 25 of 159 
 
that that’s basically what was going to happen.   
 
We submit Chairperson that this is unbecoming.  You 
cannot contain(?) what is not before the hearing.  But again, 
we – let me be allowed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr K’s(sic) affidavit has been submitted to 
the Commission. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Well, but it no status, at least at the 
moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well...  Ja ...[intervenes]  
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   So technically it is not before the 
10 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And if the purpose is ready to 
confirm that affidavit.  I know we have a problem of time.  
The Chairperson has a problem with time.  A confirmatory 
affidavit should suffice.  With regards to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there is a confirmatory affidavit. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   No, all I am saying is.  Submit a 
confirmatory affidavit.  You do not – let them testify.  You see 
Chairperson we cannot ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see ...[intervenes]  
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   So I beg ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, this is a matter where the 
implicated parties, notice is not given to implicated parties 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 26 of 159 
 
because of the nature of the application but what has 
happened, as Mr Pretorius indicates, you have been given 
Mr K’s(sic) affidavit. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Y’s affidavit.  You know these 
alphabets, one is going to end up getting confused.  So 
basically, Ms Y(sic) is in substance going to say, I am 
making an example, when that car accident happened which 
Mr Y watched or saw.  I also was an eye-witness to it.  
 
 And I have read his affidavit and I am going to confirm 
10 
what 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
my 
recollection 
of 
what 
happened.  And it is in line to a very large extent with Mr Y’s 
evidence.  But where I differ or where my recollection is not 
the same as his, I will specify.   
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Well, Chairperson our submission is 
that.  If they saw, experienced the same things then there is 
no need for Ms K to confirm that Mr Y saw and experienced.  
She can submit her own affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   ...that deal with ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see ...[intervenes]  
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   ...those things that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe confirm is not necessarily – maybe 
it might be a term that might be confusing to some people.  
Effectively, she can – she does not need to say:  I confirm 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 27 of 159 
 
what is said.  She can be asked questions based on Mr K’s – 
Mr Y’s affidavit and she can say:  Yes, this is what 
happened, this is what happened, this is what happened.  
But I do not think that, you know, saying she should not say 
– confirm ready – she confirms really adds much in terms of 
substance. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She claims to have personal knowledge of 
the same matters that Mr Y deals within his affidavit and 
therefore she would not be giving hearsay evidence.   
10 
UNKNOWN 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
Well, 
Chairperson 
the 
word 
confirmed is introduced by the evidence leader.  So 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am not ...[intervenes]  
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   So we then follow what you are 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   But the reality Chairperson is.  We 
submit that Mr Y’s evidence cannot be introduced by a 
backdoor.  There is always a possibility that Mr Y can decide 
20 
that no, no, no.  I am not proceeding with this affidavit.  He 
may, for whatever reason, want to distance himself from the 
contents of that affidavit. 
 
Hence I say, if they saw and experienced the same 
things, then there is no reason why we do not – why first 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 28 of 159 
 
Ms K’s affidavit has to be aligned to Mr Y. 
 
And two, why she is not submitting her own affidavit, 
explaining all the things that she recollects.  There is no 
reason.   
 
The reality is that.  We are trying here to justify failure 
to comply with the rules.  And that Chairperson should not be 
allowed to happen.  People’s lives are being affected here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I will give you – are you done or do you 
need more – you are done? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I am done Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are done.  Thank you.  I heard that 
there might be somebody else.   
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chairperson, we just want to place 
it on record ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Chair, if my learned friend want to 
place it on record ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Perhaps he should speak into 
microphone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chairperson, we just want to place 
it on record, just like what my learned colleague has done.  
And to notify Chairperson that on the 24t h of January, we 
wrote to the Commission’s Legal Team objecting to the 
evidence of Ms K or Ms K coming to give or to confirm, as 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 29 of 159 
 
the Chair was saying, the affidavit of Mr Y.  Chairperson 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was clarifying that maybe confirm 
is not the right word because she has personal knowledge, 
as I understand it, of the same events. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Ja.  Chairperson, just like what we 
do.  We extent courtesy everyday to the Legal Commission, 
to the Legal Team of the Commission with my learned 
colleagues.   
 
Yesterday, we extended the courtesy of trying to engage 
10 
with the Legal Team in terms of what is it that Ms K is 
coming to do today.  And then we were told by members of 
the Legal Team that she is coming to confirm.   
 
So we want to place it on record to say, just like what we 
did yesterday when we started, that should it happen, as we 
are seeing now my learned colleague has raised, that the 
client – his client was implicated.   
 
Now should it happen that another client – our client or 
my learned colleague’s client is implicated.  Then how do we 
move forward in terms of that issue?   
20 
 
Are we going to say – are we going to accept what the 
witness has said?  Or are we going to now be placed in a 
position wherein we need to review? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will be given an opportunity after to 
respond to her affidavit or to apply for leave to cross-
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 30 of 159 
 
examine her.  That is what has happened in matters such as 
this where this kind of application is done and a number of 
them have been brought and granted on that basis.   
 
The – you would – you may have noticed from the media 
sometime back that there were witnesses who gave – there 
were witnesses connected with Transnet who gave evidence 
from secret location dealing with evidence about certain 
people that they said had – were collecting bags of money 
from the Gupta residence.  The same thing was done.   
 
The same thing has been done with other witnesses 
10 
who have given evidence from a secret location.  You get – 
the implicated persons get the ...[indistinct] after to refute 
the evidence.  The norm is you get the evidence before but 
there are exceptions.  It is just like in court, as I indicated 
to your colleague. 
The norm is if you are going to bring an application 
for an order against somebody, you serve the application 
on that person so that when you move that application in 
court that person is represented and is able to oppose but 
there are circumstances where the court departs from that, 
20 
the implicated person does not get given notice and the 
person who brings the application asks the court to 
condone that for reasons that are given and, if the court is 
satisfied, then it gives the implicated party and opportunity  
afterwards to deal with the allegations.  That is the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 31 of 159 
 
principle. 
ADV 
MVUMBI: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
hear, 
Chairperson. 
 
But, 
Chairperson, can Chairperson agree or – I do not know, is 
it too much for us to say it is common cause that Ms K 
cannot come to the Commission and give evidence to the 
Commissioner on an affidavit that is disposed (sic) by Mr 
Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, you are all getting confused 
with something that really is either here not there.  You 
know, I am saying, as I understood the position, Ms K is 
10 
saying in effect to a very large extent, take this affidavit by 
Mr Y as if it was my affidavit because I have personal 
knowledge of the contents of that affidavit.  I am going to 
come and testify about exactly those things but where my 
recollection or my knowledge differs from that of Mr Y, I am 
going to say so that, no, my recollection is different and 
but a lot of things that are there in that affidavit reflect my 
own knowledge. 
ADV MVUMBI:   No, Chairperson, I think the confusion 
would have not even been there if the legal team of the 
20 
Commission is willing to engage.  Like I pointed out 
yesterday, the team – the legal team of the implicated 
people and it is a matter of time, it is a matter of us 
agreeing that after this presentation of the Commission of 
whoever witness is there for today, just like what Chair 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 32 of 159 
 
suggested yesterday, that maybe we stay for an hour, 
address the issues of the witness that is coming tomorrow. 
 
When 
Chair 
goes 
home 
later 
on 
after 
the 
Commission, is at a position of knowing all these issues 
that we will be raising here today and then that will make 
this Commission like very, I mean, easy.  But now we are 
faced with a situation where every morning we must do 
ground check, we must do housekeeping, which is not 
acceptable and at some point we even withdraw ourselves 
to certain issues because we are learned colleagues here 
10 
and we must treat each other with respect.  And indeed we 
try to do that and we cannot go to the public and behave 
like people who do not have ethics.  Cannot do it.  That is 
my submission, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, thank you very much. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, can I just respond please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correspondence that has been 
addressed to the Commission has been responded to, there 
have been engagements but the evidence of a witness, the 
20 
circumstances under which a witness gives evidence is not 
a matter of negotiation between that witness, that witness 
of representatives and the legal team, these matters are 
for you to decide, evidence will be properly be placed 
before you and they can respond.   
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 33 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Quite frankly, the notion that we 
must negotiate, whether a witness gives evidence and the 
conditions under which a witness gives evidence and what 
the witness can and cannot say is just nonsense, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  It think there is another council who 
wants to say something? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Yes, Chair, my learned colleague 
has me to stand down for him to [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, alright. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you, Chair, mine is rather 
make comment rather to oppose the application as brought 
by Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Because we understand that – and 
the extent upon which our client has been implicated.  We 
find comfort as well to say Ms K will only be confined to 
what she understands based on the fact that she has been 
involved in the investigation as she will then lead and be 
20 
led. 
 
However, the discomfort that we have, as much as 
some undertakings were made in previous witnesses to say 
you are not implicated, therefore you did not receive the 
Rule 3.3 notice but when the evidence leader, in the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 34 of 159 
 
course of leading the witness, then certain people are 
implicated and it was brought to your attention.   
I would only on the instructions of my client find 
comfort if I could hear that Ms K’s evidence is only going 
to be confined insofar as it relates to her involvement with 
Mr Y’s evidence, which is under oath.  Those are my 
submissions, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what Mr Pretorius has said is that 
she will not go outside the affidavit of Mr Y and she will not 
give evidence, her own evidence insofar as it relates to 
10 
matters that are not dealt with in Mr Y’s affidavit.  
 
So in other words, when you look at Mr Y’s affidavit, 
that is what she will confine herself to. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Let us assume, let us assume 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand the position. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Without debating, Mr Chair, it is 
just for clarity.  Let us assume there are certain aspects Mr 
Y would – rather, Ms K would rather not go to because it 
would not be competent to give such evidence, can we 
20 
have an indication from the legal team whether Mr Y at 
some point, having been indisposed at the moment, will 
come and testify to some of the aspects of his statement 
so that we get an opportunity to respond to some of the 
issues we respond meaningfully rather in a piecemeal 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 35 of 159 
 
fashion.  Those are my submissions, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As soon as Mr Y recovers, I do not 
know if my learned friend heard, Mr Y has recently 
emerged from a coma, he is seriously indisposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is nothing that I can give any 
guarantee about.  And my empathy goes towards Mr Y.  He 
will come, if there is space on the calendar, and he will 
come if you decide, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the matter in your hands.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I might just add it might help my 
learned friends that indeed Ms K has prepared an affidavit, 
which will be put before you, annexing Mr K’s (sic) 
affidavit.  To the extent that she cannot confirm what Mr Y 
says, she will say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, there is another – counsel? 
ADV MVUMBI:   I have just received from my clients, the 
20 
information that we had is that the evidence team has 
known for probably a while that Mr Y has been ill, has been 
in hospital, so it is not something that is new that came to 
their attention now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there might have …[intervenes] 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 36 of 159 
 
ADV MVUMBI:   So they could have [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They might have thought he would 
recover in time for the hearing. 
ADV MVUMBI:   But they have had enough time to at the 
very least submit or give to us a Rule 3.3 notice that talks 
to Ms K and they elected not to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the substance of what Ms K is going 
to talk about, testify about, is in Mr Y’s affidavit.  You know 
it.   
10 
ADV MVUMBI:   But Mr K – or Ms K is not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   All you have been told is …[intervenes] 
ADV MVUMBI:   …Mr Y’s alter ego. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All you have been told is instead of Mr Y 
saying these things in this affidavit, Mr Y, it will be Mr K.  
The substance of what will be said about your client or 
whoever is there, it has been given to you, you know it.   
ADV MVUMBI:   But Chair, that is ignoring the rule.  The 
rule says give us a statement or a extract of the statement, 
it does not say give us someone else’s statement upon 
20 
which you rely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, Mr Pretorius, I think if he has 
not dealt with that, he will deal with that.  I think let me 
hear, I think there was another counsel who wanted to say 
something. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 37 of 159 
 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you.  Good morning, once 
again, Chair.  Mine is more on what the Chair has been 
referring to and referencing at least to the practice in the 
courts and to the extent that I understood what the Chair 
has said that it is a norm and possibly I understand the 
Chair saying it is a norm in this Commission. 
 
May I refer the Chair to what is commonly – the 
rules applicable here and my learned colleague, I did not 
hear 
because 
my 
colleague 
from 
the 
State, 
or 
the 
Commission rather, has requested that we deal with his 
10 
application in separate by the fact that you then directed, 
Chair. 
 
That is, I would want to confine myself to what is 
the application brought to you today and to what extent 
that application should be opposed and how it should be 
brought.  My learned colleague has pointed out that two 
weeks’ notice, which is in turns of Rule 9.2, should give 
and reasons should be provided to you, Chair.  And the 
rules, therefore, enjoins the Chair to then exercise his 
discretion.  But it does not do so as a wide discretion 
20 
because the rules at Rule 11 then provides for general 
applications that will apply, vice versa, to the Commission 
and to the participants in the Commission. 
 
May I then direct, with permission before the Chair 
to Rule 11?  I will probably want to read selected 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 38 of 159 
 
provisions.  Rule 11.1 says: 
“Any party wishing to make any application to the 
Commission which is not otherwise provided for in 
the rules must do so on at least seven calendar 
days notice in writing to the Commission but the 
Chairperson may condone noncompliance with this 
notice on good cause shown.” 
That I accept, Chair, is what we are guided by the rules 
even in court. 
 
Now I have heard the Chair saying that there is a 
10 
norm or at least a practice in law that such application may 
not 
be 
served. 
 
However, 
Chair, 
the 
rule 
of 
this 
Commission directs at 11.3 and 4 and 5.  It says: 
“Whenever these rules make provision for any 
person 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
Commission 
or 
the 
Chairperson, the application must be substantive 
application on affidavit with a notice of motion.  The 
affidavit must, among things, reflect the relevant 
facts and the order sought and the grounds.” 
And this is what we understand has been provided to you 
20 
today.  However, then it goes on to say at 11.4: 
“The application must be lodged with the Secretary 
of the Commission who will ensure that the original 
is delivered to the Chairperson and a copy to the 
legal team.” 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 39 of 159 
 
This will also apply in reverse, I would want to think. 
“The applicant in that application might cite every 
person whose rights…” 
Emphasis, every person whose rights. 
“…may be adversely affected by the order sought 
and serve…” 
Emphasis. 
 
“…a copy on him or her.” 
And that is where I take issue, Chair, because my learned 
colleague’s argument on particular at this point is that we 
10 
have not – and to an extent my learned colleague has 
accepted that they have not complied with the rules insofar 
as 3.3 notice of Y is concerned.   
 
Not only that, now, there is a transgression further 
that we are not even given a notice at least seven days 
from them knowing of this.  What we have been given was 
an email that was given to us and I would, to the extent 
that my memory serves me well, it says please note that 
we 
will 
be 
substituting. 
 
Reference 
to 
my 
learned 
colleague.  And this individual will just confirm what Y 
20 
says. 
 
I have tried to look at Y’s statement as the 
deliberations were going, that nowhere in Y where he then, 
as my learned colleague has professed, that Y would 
almost be to the similar status as – or K, rather, will be in 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 40 of 159 
 
the similar status of Y where Y then deposed to say I will 
want the protection and I want my testimony to be in 
camera.  
 
So until today there was no such intention or at 
least given to us that we will be applying – at least know 
that we will be applying to have this testimony of a 
substitute player in camera.   
 
Now having taken what the Chair has said, that this 
the norm, but my submission will be that we are guided by 
the rules and the rules, therefore, provided inasmuch as 
10 
there could be these challenges and these applications, a 
party that is interested and which we seem to be all in 
agreement that we are indeed implicated, directly so, if we 
are now to live to the premise that K is going to substitute 
and to an extent confirm the affidavit of Y, which we then 
received the notice and spells out that we are indeed 
implicated. 
 
So now will that, therefore, justify not being given 
the application in advance or at least being served 
because rule 11.4 provides for same and that we then 
20 
apply ourselves because it says specifically that it must be 
a notice of motion, affidavit accompanies.  So the notice 
must be served on any interested party so that they can 
therefore be able to exercise. 
 
My gripe, therefore, Chair, is on noncompliance on 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 41 of 159 
 
the very same application now that you are now faced with 
because 
then 
the 
rules 
otherwise 
says 
on 
practice 
direction that the Chair will give direction in exercising his 
discretion.  That is my submission, unless there is 
anything, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, thank you very much.  
Registrar?  Mr Pretorius, what do you say to that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Chair, in the first place, it 
seems that the intention to preclude Ms K from giving 
evidence in camera should not be confused with the 
10 
intention to prevent her evidence at all.  Quite simply, the 
Commission must hear the evidence, in our submission, it 
is important evidence.  But in relation to the application for 
protected identity, the rules make it clear and , as all rules, 
they are there for the convenience of the court, or the 
Commission, not in order to obstruct due process and to 
prohibit the Commission from doing its work. 
 
I make no sense for my learned friends to insist that 
an application to give evidence in camera or an application 
to give evidence under conditions of protected identity 
20 
should not itself be brought under the same terms.   
 
What my learned friends are asking for is an 
application in the name of the witness concerned giving full 
details of the witness concerned so that they contest it.  
One cannot conceal the name, so you have given an order 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 42 of 159 
 
that that is so and that is what we have asked you to do.  It 
is perfectly logical, it is within this practice and it is 
perfectly within ordinary practice to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms K has brought an application. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And she brought the application 
long ago, Chair, before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As did Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes.  I am – I have heard what the 
various who have spoken have said, I am going to grant 
10 
the application and if they wish me to furnish reasons for 
the decision, they may request reasons and I will provide 
them. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   As it pleases the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  I am satisfied that the 
application should be granted and insofar as any rule may 
not have been fully complied with, I am satisfied that in all 
of 
the 
circumstances 
CONDONATION 
SHOULD 
BE 
GRANTED. 
 
Now in terms of the actual order, I shall make the 
20 
following order. 
ORDER 
1.  
It is recorded that this application was heard 
without prior notice to affected parties and 
failure to give notice is here condoned. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 43 of 159 
 
2.  
Having heard argument presented by Mr 
Pretorius, 
from 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Commission’s legal team and having also 
heard counsel representing some of the 
parties I make the following order. 
2.1 
The witness is to be referred to during her 
evidence before the Commission and after 
her evidence insofar as the Commission is 
concerned as Ms K. 
2.2 
The witness’ identity shall not be disclosed 
10 
or published in any manner. 
 
2.3 
The names and initials of the witness shall 
 
 
 
be redacted from all affidavits and  
 
 
 
documentation 
presented 
in 
evidence.

2.5 
No person may photograph or publish any 
photograph or other image of any person 
20 
engaged 
in 
and/or 
responsible 
for 
the 
protection of the witness when she gives 
evidence. 
2.6 
The witness need not be present at the 
Commission’s hearing venue when giving 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 44 of 159 
 
evidence but she may instead give her 
evidence from a separate and undisclosed 
location (the protected witness location.) 
2.7 
No camera will be permitted in the protected 
witness location. 
2.8 
No 
person 
other 
than 
the 
Chairperson, 
members of the Commission’s legal team, 
the 
Commission’s 
safety 
and 
security 
advisor, those necessary to assist or protect 
the witness when she give evidence or 
10 
another person specifically designated by 
the Chairperson will be permitted to enter or 
are permitted to enter the protected witness 
location 
unless 
they 
have 
prior 
written 
permission, the prior written permission of 
the Chairperson of the Commission. 
2.9 
It 
is 
recorded 
that 
the 
oath 
has 
been 
administered to the witness in front of the 
Chairperson. 
2.10 
And audio link from the protected witness 
20 
location will be provided so that the witness’ 
evidence can be heard in the Commission’s 
hearing venue when such evidence is given. 
2.11 
Subject to the usual rules applicable to the 
conduct of the Commission’s proceedings, 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 45 of 159 
 
2.11.1 members of the public, including the media, 
may be present in the hearing venue in such 
numbers 
as 
may 
be 
directed 
by 
the 
Chairperson. 
2.11.2 Sound reaching the hearing venue via the 
audio link in the protected witness location 
may be broadcast and the proceedings in the 
hearing 
venue 
may 
be 
relevant 
and 
broadcast. 
2.12 
This order may be amended or supplemented 
10 
by the Chairperson at any time if, in his 
opinion, that is necessary to protect the 
applicant or the witness or any person in 
connection with the applicant or the witness’ 
evidence 
or 
to 
ensure 
fairness 
to 
any 
implicated person. 
2.13 
In order to protect the identity of Ms K, the 
secretary of the Commission was authorised 
to sign the notice of application on her 
behalf. 
20 
2.14 
This 
order 
shall 
also 
apply 
with 
the 
necessary changes required by the contents 
should 
the 
witness 
be 
directed 
to 
give 
evidence.” 
No, 2.14, Mr Pretorius, does not seem to be necessary. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 46 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it does not apply, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it should not have been there, so the 
order goes up to 2.13.  That is the order I made. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 2.14 was only there should 
the Commission revert to virtual hearings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not sure what the Chair wants 
to do about the short adjournment or should we just 
10 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I guess maybe we should have a 
short adjournment so that when we start we go up to 
lunchtime. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
let 
us 
have 
a 
15 
minutes 
adjournment.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue or let us start. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms K can you 
hear us? 
MS K:   Yes Advocate Pretorius I can. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.   Ms K would you look 
at the bundle before you ...[intervenes]  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 47 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the way I just want to repeat the oath 
has been administered to the witness. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you confirm that Ms K that 
you have taken the oath? 
MS K:   Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.   Ms K would you 
please look at the bundle before you marked SSA Bundle 
02? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And go to the divider YY9. 
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you go to page 340 and we are 
referring to the black numbers in the top left hand corner 
you will see an affidavit. 
MS K:   Sorry Advocate Pretorius is that – you said YY? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So YY9. 
MS K:   9? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The last divider in that file. 
MS K:   Okay, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you have it? 
20 
MS K:   Yes thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, please go to page 340.   
MS K:   Yes I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You see there the affidavit of Ms K?  
MS K:   Yes. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 48 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if you go to page 341 the 
signature has been removed but this oath was taken or not 
the oath rather the affidavit was attested to on the 26 t h of 
January 2021.  Is that right? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is your affidavit? 
MS K:   Yes sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And annexed to your affidavit as 
Annexure K1 is the affidavit of Mr Y, do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes I do. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if you go to page 418  you will 
see that that affidavit was attested to on the 30 t h of 
November 2020. 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.   Just by way of 
background Ms K you and Mr Y, amongst others, are 
employed by the SSA and are involved in the conduct of 
investigations or an investigation? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, do you want to admit 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no hang on, is page 418 the last 
page of Mr Y’s affidavit?   I am not asking the witness, I 
am just asking Mr Pretorius.   It appears to be.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 49 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You notice what I have noticed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am getting advice.  I am receiving 
advice from several quarters, I am distracted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is page 418 the last page of Mr Y’s 
affidavit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   419 is the last page which is the 
signature of the Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no you are right.   It looks like 
to me it may be that there is something at page 418 that 
shouldn’t be there, or am I mistaken? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is a pseudonym. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is a pseudonym that has been 
placed across all affidavit by the investigator, it is a 
pseudonym in addition to Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, well that confuses. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it does and we will correct 
that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because we should either have a 
pseudonym that is written there at page 418 or Mr Y and 
20 
not both. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.   You are absolutely 
correct, we will correct that Chair but if one goes to page 
343 you will see that the pseudonym says “also known as 
Mr Y”, so pseudonym A also known as pseudonym B, it is 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 50 of 159 
 
very complicated but it is there and we can tidy it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I may have missed that, it is just 
that also I think it is better to have one, whether it is Mr Y 
or ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No you are quite correct Chair, we 
will stick to Mr Y. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To avoid confusion yes, okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, this world is confusing enough 
as it is.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you may proceed. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Ms K are you there? 
MS K:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Both you and Mr Y have been 
involved in Project Veza, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you have worked together for 
a period of time in the course of that investigation? 
MS K:   Yes Chair, I don’t know if I should clarify the 
working together part. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please do. 
20 
MS K:   I cannot say that we work together because Mr Y is 
not a member of the team, he is rather a co-sponsor of the 
project so he was getting high level sort of reports, just 
like the sponsor of the project, so he was not a member of 
the team and I needed to clarify that because the work that 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 51 of 159 
 
we did he did not really know the day to day running of the 
project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, you worked together with 
him on the project, in other words he was the sponsor of 
the project on which you worked? 
MS K:   Co-sponsor yes, but there was another co-sponsor 
and a sponsor, I am the project manager. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, you need not refer to your 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius, well yes Ms K 
10 
as you give evidence just always be alive to not saying 
anything that could make you identifiable, you understand. 
MS K:   Okay, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, that is why Mr Pretorius says 
you need not mention your position. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But am I correct in understanding that 
the distinction you seek to make between yourself and Mr 
Y is that you were involved in the actual operations but he 
was receiving reports about those operations? 
20 
MS K:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Ms K I am trying to put the 
propositions to you in general terms so that the precise 
nature of your position is not disclosed, which would make 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 52 of 159 
 
it easier to identify you so if you would just bear with me. 
MS K:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s put it this way, both you and 
Mr Y have had continuous interactions in relation to the 
work of Project Veza? 
MS K:   Yes we have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you have shared knowledge.    
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have shared knowledge 
concerning the activities of the project, correct? 
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
save 
for 
exceptional 
circumstances which we will refer to where relevant 
whatever he knows about the workings of the project you 
know, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And as we go through his affidavit, 
which is annexed to your affidavit where you don’t know or 
have no knowledge of what he says you will tell the Chair, 
is that correct? 
20 
MS K:   Yes I will indicate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So when you deal with or attest to 
what Mr K or Mr Y rather says in his affidavit you will have 
your own personal knowledge of that fact, correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 53 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And given the proceedings of the 
last three days and the nature of the evidence you were 
giving, a sensitive nature, may I ask you please to be very 
cautious not to implicate any person other than those who 
are mentioned in the affidavit of Mr Y.  There will be times 
when you will give your own comments, but provided you 
do not implicate any person other than those implicated in 
the affidavit of Mr Y that would be in order. 
MS K:   Yes I understand that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. Chair may we admit 
10 
Exhibit YY8, sorry YY9 into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is Ms K’s affidavit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And annexed to Ms K’s affidavit is 
Mr Y’s affidavit and it forms part of that affidavit for that 
reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and her affidavit will be Exhibit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   YY9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms K which starts at 
page 340 together with its annexure which is the affidavit 
of Mr Y is admitted as Exhibit YY9. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then Ms K you have before you 
another bundle of documents.  It is called SSA Bundle 01, 
do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes I do Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will testify in due course as I 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 54 of 159 
 
understand it that the Commission issued a request for 
information to the State Security Agency for certain 
information and documentation, three lever arch files were 
provided to the Commission pursuant to that RFI, the 
request for information, that – those three bundles, rather 
contained documents and information which had been 
declassified by the Director General, the Acting Director 
General, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For convenience sake we’ve 
10 
compiled a single bundle comprising those three lever arch 
files and that’s marked Bundle 01 Exhibit YY1. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   These are documents which are 
relevant to the investigatory work that project Veza have 
done, am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes, they are. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
They 
contain 
documentary 
evidence which confirm much of the evidence that you and 
Mr Y will give and that has already, indeed, been given. 
20 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should I have Bundle 01, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the document comprises – if 
you will bear with me one moment, some 886 pages, Chair, 
I ask that, that be admitted. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 55 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As Exhibit YY1, it’s the reference 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m trying to make sure that we are not 
going to do something that will be confusing. For quite 
some time, what we have been doing is to refer, effectively, 
to the file as Bundle and the documents inside as Exhibits.  
Of course we have got SSA Bundle 01 on the outside on 
the spine which is fine but I think you have in mind that, I 
think it refers to Exhibit YY1. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, otherwise we would 
have 886 separate…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I realise, of course, what can be done is 
– ja it’s …[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If it assists, Chair, we can refer to 
it as Bundle 01. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe we should – maybe we should 
just refer to it as Bundle 01, SSA Bundle 01 and 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Also known as Exhibit YY1? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughter].  So, what is quite clear is 
that, in Bundle 01 – SSA Bundle 01 there are various 
documents that have evidential value that are going to be 
used. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 56 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exhibit YY1, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, if one looks inside the 
Bundle 01, you’ll see an index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, the documents or groups of 
documents to which we will refer each has its own marking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is that the Q and A and B and C, is 
that what you’re referring to? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It’s on page 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I’m looking at page 2. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It’s marked, Index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The various documents under – are 
grouped under heading 1 and then from heading 2, 3, 4 
and 5, documents relating to particular projects are listed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    We won’t be referring to all of 
them but some of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well I think, let us say, each 
document, I guess, has got some kind of heading that I can 
20 
find it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, we will guide you 
through as we go through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I wonder whether – at least those 
that will refer to, we can’t, as we come to them use the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 57 of 159 
 
heading, say Exhibit YY01, that or something like that or 
would that still be quite cumbersome? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, for record keeping purposes, 
it’s probably better that the documentation be collated 
under one heading and then we refer to page numbers, for 
reference purposes that will be much easier than going 
through the Bundle looking for a particular heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the sequence of pages is 
important. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so could we say that, effectively, 
the Exhibits – documents are all Exhibit YY01. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they- there are different documents 
under YY01 and you have to identify the page where 
the…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the page and a description of 
the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay alright.  This file then, 
we’ll refer to it as SSA Bundle 1 of 01 and then the 
20 
documents will, for convenience, be Exhibit YY01 and each 
document 
will 
be 
referred 
to 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
pagination and the heading of the document, is that fine? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright thank you. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 58 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms K, can I take you to the 
affidavit of Mr Y and just for clarity sake you will tell the 
Chair what you, of your own personal knowledge can testify 
to in relation to what Mr Y has said in his affidavit, 
correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And where you cannot, from your 
own personal knowledge testify to what Mr Y has said in 
his affidavit you will alert the Chair to that fact, correct? 
MS K:   I will. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You do have added information 
which may implicate other people but that information you 
won’t present today or tomorrow, that information will be 
presented in due course in a separate affidavit, correct? 
MS K:   Yes, I understand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  If you would then, go 
please, to paragraph 2.1 under the heading, “Co-operation 
with the Commission”. 
MS K:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you have knowledge of the fact 
20 
that the SSA and in particular the Director General 
received a request for information from the Commission? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and can you confirm that in 
that request for information the SSA was asked to provide 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 59 of 159 
 
information with regard to the SSA’s investigation into 
irregularities 
within 
the 
Chief 
Directorate 
Special 
Operations? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And do you know, to your own 
knowledge, 
that 
a 
number 
of 
reports, 
presentations, 
assessments, in fact a number of documents were handed 
over to the Commission in response to this request for 
information? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you also have knowledge of a 
summons being issued by the Commission dated the 26 t h of 
August 
2020, 
requesting 
certain 
materials 
from 
the 
Commission? 
MS K:   Yes, I am aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the SSA? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   From the SSA by the Commission, 
correct Chair, thank you and do you know that further 
materials were produced in response to that summons? 
MS K:   Yes, I do know that. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And subsequently, further request 
for information – request for information were issued by the 
Commission to the SSA and they were responded to? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 2.4 there’s an 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 60 of 159 
 
assertion by Mr Y about where these documents, relevant 
to your investigation were found, do you know that they 
were found during an inspection in a walk-in safe at the 
SSA? 
MS K:   Yes, I do know, I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This doesn’t implicate anyone so I 
want to ask you.  Were those documents lodged there, in 
the normal course of administration? 
MS K:   I’m not certain. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, you needn’t go further. 
10 
MS K:   Pardon, sorry? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You needn’t go any further in 
regard to that, there will be further evidence if it’s 
necessary 
but 
what 
I 
do 
want 
to 
ask 
you 
is, 
the 
documentation provided to the Commission in response to 
the requests for information and summons were handed 
over and then during a long process were declassified for 
the purposes of making them public, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And those are the documents 
20 
contained in the bundle that the Chair and I have just been 
discussing, Exhibit YY01, Bundle 01, is that correct, that 
Bundle before you? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 2.6, Mr Y says that the

documentation 
provided 
to 
the 
Commission 
was 
also 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
Directorate 
of 
Priority 
Crime 
Investigation on 10 June 2019, do you have knowledge of 
that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was also handed over to the 
Investigating Directorate ID on the 15 t h of October 2020, 
correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this was done pursuant to two 
10 
inquiries opened by the SSA on 10 April 2019 in terms of 
the Prevention and Combating Corrupt Activities Act, is 
that correct, do you have knowledge of that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do have knowledge of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, now in paragraph 2.7 the 
origins of Project Veza are described. In paragraph 2.7 
reference is made to an internal investigation of the SSA, I 
presume, called Project Momentum, do you know of that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do know of it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That project was initiated as an 
20 
investigation, 
an 
internal 
investigation 
to 
address 
allegations of corruption within the SSA, is that correct, do 
you know that? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and we are told that limited 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 62 of 159 
 
progress was made in that investigation because of 
challenges 
experienced 
in 
relation 
to 
access 
to 
information, is that also, within your knowledge? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The investigation, the affidavit 
continues, was therefore re-enforced and re-launched by 
the Acting DG, Loyiso Jafta on 5 December 2018 under the 
name Project Veza. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You confirm that, do you? 
10 
MS K:   Yes, I confirm that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and the mandate of Project 
Veza is described in paragraph 2.8, the investigation team 
was tasked with investigating irregularities and criminality 
arising from the contravention of the SSA’s governance, 
operational and financial prescripts during the period 2012 
to 2018, do you know that? 
MS K:   Yes, yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, the affidavit continues to 
say that the investigation has focused on various units with 
20 
the SSA, chiefly the projects carried out by the CDSO, 
that’s the Chief Directorate Special Operations which is 
defined earlier, as the covert operational structure within 
the SSA but also the cover support unit and operations run 
from the office of the DG.  Do you know that and can you… 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 63 of 159 
 
MS K:  Yes thank you for that Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Explain 
that 
from 
your 
own 
knowledge.  Sorry I interrupted you. 
MS K:  Yes I do know that yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The method or methodology 
adopted by Project Veza is described in paragraph 2.9 as 
multiphased, multidisciplinary.  I presume that means in 
other 
words 
an 
all-encompassing 
approach 
to 
the 
investigation, is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes that is correct Sir. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And its vision is to assist or to attain 
a sustained institutionalised keen governance culture within 
the SSA, do you know that? 
MS K:  Yes that is the vision. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. Mr Y deals with his own 
experience there but I presume you know him to be a person 
of experience within SSA? 
MS K:  Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He says in paragraph 2.10 that he – 
that is Mr Y is giving the evidence contained in this affidavit 
20 
on behalf of the Project Veza investigation team.  You were 
aware of that I presume? 
MS K:  Yes I am aware. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It continues to say: 
“Threats have been made against individual 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 64 of 159 
 
members of the investigation team by certain 
implicated parties.” 
 
Do you have knowledge of that? 
MS K:  Yes I do although not direct but I do know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MS K:  That. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We need not mention any names at 
this stage.   
“It should further be noted that several 
individuals including implicated persons who 
10 
have been assisting our investigation team 
have also been intimidated.” 
 
You have knowledge of that whether direct or 
indirect? 
MS K:  Not direct but there has been reports to us. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Made 
to 
the 
team? 
 
The 
investigations. 
MS K:  Yes by some of the people that have cooperated with 
us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And finally, the statement is 
20 
made in paragraph 2.10 to the effect that there have been 
attempts to interfere with and even sabotage the Project 
Veza investigation.  
Do 
you 
have 
knowledge 
of that 
allegation? 
MS K:  Yes I do I do have knowledge of that and experienced 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 65 of 159 
 
it myself directly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Really.  Alright.  Perhaps we can put 
the detail of that in a supplementary affidavit and deal with 
persons involved in that regard.  If we can move onto 
paragraph 2.11 please. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The statement is made that this 
affidavit that is the affidavit of Mr Y deals with the creation 
and unlawful operations of a parallel intelligence structure 
within 
the 
SSA 
and 
the 
financial 
irregularities 
that 
10 
accompanied it during the period 2012 to 2018.  Do you 
know that? 
MS K:  Yes I do know Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“However some of the activities the affidavit 
continues 
reflect 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
irregularities 
that 
accompanied 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
principle 
agent 
network Pan Program during the period 2007 
to 2010.  Both the Pan and Project Veza 
20 
investigations uncovered the unlawful use of 
parallel intelligence structures to bypass 
internal controls and avoid accountability for 
gross financial irregularities and abuses of 
SSA resources for improper purposes.” 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 66 of 159 
 
 
You will testify to those issues in detail but at a 
general level are you comfortable to assert that as being 
within your own knowledge? 
MS K:  I would accept that with a 00:04:24 that I do not have 
detailed information on the Pan however based on reports 
that I read I could indeed see the similarities in terms of 
modus operandi in certain instances. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Paragraph 2.12 deals 
with the structure of the affidavit and that is a convenient 
summary of the contents for the reader of the affidavit.  We 
10 
will be covering all those topics so we can go through to the 
introduction over the page paragraph 3. 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For the sake of completeness and to 
place the evidence that is given in this affidavit and that will 
be given by yourself into its proper context you have set out 
and Mr Y has set out in this affidavit certain constitutional 
principles.   
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And I would just like to highlight them 
20 
in summary for the sake of context and completeness.  
Paragraph 3.1.1 refers to Section 198(C) of the Constitution 
which stipulates that National Security must be pursued in 
compliance with the law including international law.  I will go 
on because no one can contest that this is what the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 67 of 159 
 
constitution says: 
“Section 199(5) reinforces this imperative.  
The Security Services must act and must 
teach and require their members to act in 
accordance with the constitution and the law 
including customary international law and 
international 
agreements 
binding 
on 
the 
Republic.” 
Paragraph 3.1.3 says: 
“No member of any security service may 
10 
obey a manifestly unlawful order.” 
3.1.4 reads: 
“National 
Legislation 
must 
regulate 
the 
objects, 
powers 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
Intelligence Service.” 
You are obviously aware of those provisions, is that correct? 
MS K:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 3.2 sets out: 
“That 
the 
constitutional 
principles 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
White 
Paper 
on 
20 
Intelligence of 1994.” 
Evidence in that regard has been given by several 
witnesses and we do not need to deal with that in any detail. 
Paragraph 3.3 refers to two statutes.  The first is the 
Intelligence Services Act 65 of 2002 which has been 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 68 of 159 
 
amended several times as you will know particularly in 2013 
and the National Strategic Intelligence Act those are two 
pieces of legislation governing the South African Intelligence 
Services, is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes that is correct Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then reference is made in 
paragraph 3.4 to the Counter Intelligence Mandate but we 
need not go there that is part of legislation which no one can 
dispute.  The – well provided it is constitutional of course I 
must correct myself.  If we can go to the following page? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are right in because what you saying 
is no one can dispute that – that is what it says. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it says whether it is 
constitutional is another thing but you are talking about what 
it says. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you are right. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I interrupted you. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Whether it binds the SSA of 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Might have – but perhaps we need 
not deal with those subtleties at least at this stage. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 69 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But we have to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Given the events of the past week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And in fact Chair to be serious there 
is a contention which may be raised in submissions that 
there may be some contradictions or conflicts between the 
2013 amendments to the Intelligence Services Act and the 
Constitution. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that is a matter for later 
consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we can go over the page please Ms 
K to paragraph 3.5 which deals with the which deals with 
the… 
MS K:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The organisational and governance 
structure of the SSA and the point is made that political 
20 
responsibility for the SSA lies with the duly designated 
Minister of State Security and the governance structure of 
the SSA falls under the leadership of the Director General in 
this case the acting Director General.  Correct? 
MS K:  Yes. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 70 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then certain comments are made in 
paragraph 3.6 and I do not think we need to deal with it 
today in relation to the role of the Minister of State Security 
but they are there for the record and I do not wish to ask you 
to comment on that.  In paragraph 3.7 there are some 
internal documents some of which remain classified some of 
which we have.  There are the MPD’s that is the Ministerial 
Delegations of Powers and Direction of Payment.  Is that 
correct? 
MS K:  Yes that is correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And several operational deceptives 
referred to in paragraph 3.7.2.   
MS K:  Yes the operational directives. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So… 
MS K:  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So do I understand correctly that the 
activities of the SSA are governed in detail by various 
regulatory 
instruments 
which 
may 
be 
termed 
internal 
instruments, is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes that is correct Sir. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us go on to make some 
high level observations if we may in relation to the evidence 
that has been collected by the Project Veza investigation 
team.  Now as I understand the position from what you have 
told us Ms K that you in particular have working knowledge 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 71 of 159 
 
and direct knowledge of the evidence documentary and 
otherwise gathered by the investigation team.  Is that 
correct? 
MS K:  Could you please repeat that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That you as a member of the 
investigation 
team; 
the 
Veza 
investigation 
team 
have 
knowledge of the evidence collected by the investigation 
team; the documentary evidence and other evidence that the 
team has collected.  Is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes I have knowledge of that. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And the conclusion is drawn 
by Mr Y in paragraph 3.8 that the team has established or it 
has been revealed to the team that the operations run by the 
Chief Directorate Special Operations fell outside the lawful 
mandate of the SSA.  Did not follow prescribed procedures 
and totally ignored the applicable governance, financial and 
operational directives of the SSA.  That is a comment at a 
high level – it is generalised and perhaps it is absolute but 
can you attest to that yourself or do you wish to qualify it in 
any way?  And by qualify I mean… 
20 
MS K:  Yes I would like to just indicate that for me I do not 
think this means that it is all the projects because we do not 
know the entirety of the picture but most of the projects that 
we analysed and the documentation that we analysed 
showed exactly what Mr Y indicated in 3.8. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 72 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And then in 3.9 it is stated… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Ms K  
MS K:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you have just said does it mean that 
you are saying you are not in a position to say the entire 
CDSO fell outside the lawful mandate of SSA but you are 
saying you are confining yourself to those operations of 
CDSO that Project Veza has been investigating. 
MS K:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Then paragraph 3.9 
continues it says there: 
“That the unlawful intelligence operations” 
  
Well let me repeat that it says: 
“Unlawful intelligence operations and front 
companies were used to siphon funds from 
the SSA and create a parallel intelligence 
capacities which if not abated would have 
continued to pose a risk to National Security 
and the constitutionally established state.” 
20 
 
That general comment do you associate yourself with 
it? 
MS K:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it continues to say: 
“These unaccountable intelligence structures extended to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 73 of 159 
 
parallel procurement services vetting counter intelligence, 
VIP Protection and Domestic Operations.” 
 
Is that statement correct? 
MS K:  Yes it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It continues to say: 
“The implicated members or former members 
used their positions of authority to ensure 
that they or their family members or close 
associates 
directly 
benefitted 
from 
unauthorised contracts with front companies 
10 
and or illegal operations.” 
 
As a general statement without implicating any 
particular person is that an accurate statement? 
MS K:  Yes it is accurate Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 3.11 makes a further 
general conclusion:  
“That the structures of the CDSO presumably 
subject to what you said that you were 
investigating were used to further political 
ends by drawing political heads into the 
20 
security space.”   
I am not sure precisely what Mr Y means there but we 
could ask him in due course to explain if he comes.  And by 
undue inference in the political process.  Can you say 
whether you agree with the statement at least insofar as it 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 74 of 159 
 
says: 
“Structures were used to further political 
ends by undue interference in the political 
process.” 
MS K:  I cannot wholly confirm the cessation save for one 
instance which I do not know whether it is political 
interference but what I could gather from one of the 
implicated 
individuals 
during 
an 
interview 
was 
them 
admitting to taking money to fund the – protect Luthili House 
campaign.  That she indicated that the money was used to 
10 
bus in people from KZN who were purported to be MKVA 
members and the SSA paid for their accommodation, food 
and transportation.  So as for the rest I can – I do not have 
the evidence because the investigation itself was – and the 
conclusions thereof are based on evidence – things that I 
could analyse and actually gather and as well as the team in 
you know in terms of analysis sent evidence that we can – 
we could actually analyse ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  You speaking to evidence which 
has been before in documentary or by way of in documentary 
20 
form or by way of oral evidence of which you have into that 
degree direct knowledge, am I correct? 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Insofar as the matters you have just 
spoken now form part of a project which we will deal with 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 75 of 159 
 
later.  We will deal with it later will we? 
MS K:  Yes I think we will and maybe I will comment further 
when we get there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  3. – the remainder of 
3.11 and 3.12 are matters that we can deal with from a legal 
point of view but 3.11 does say: 
“This political interference and certain the 
political interference you know 
of is in 
contravention of the SSA’s mandate and the 
constitutional prescripts relating to Civilian 
10 
Intelligence Structures.” 
 
Do you associate yourself with that statement? 
Obviously you cannot talk of political interference of which 
you have no knowledge but the political interference of which 
you… 
MS K:  In general. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MS K:  Yes in general yes I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then paragraph 3.12 talks 
of three categories of person covered by your projects 
20 
investigation or the Project Veza investigation that is the 
initiators, persons who conceive and direct illicit or illegal 
operations and we will deal with those in the documentation 
in due course.  Facilitators’ persons who execute those 
operations under the direction of superiors and primary and 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 76 of 159 
 
secondary beneficiaries that may fall into various categories.  
That is an analytical statement I am not sure that it requires 
any comment but if you have any comment or wish to confirm 
it you may. 
MS K:  My only comment is that this illicit value chain is very 
important in the sense that it shows how organised and 
orchestrated some of these activities seem to have been 
based on the evidence that we have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And we will deal with that in 
detail when we deal with the evidence regarding the various 
10 
projects.  Do I understand you correctly? 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  If you would look at 
paragraph 3.13 and you would bear with me a moment 
please.  If you would look at the names in that paragraph 
and before we put that paragraph on record just say whether 
you know. 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That the allegation regarding that 
individual is a fair allegation or correct allegation from the 
20 
knowledge that you have not what Mr Y has in the course of 
your – obtained in the course of your investigations.  Just 
have a look there and then just read out the contents of 
paragraph 3.13 if you would to the extent that you can 
confirm it? 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 77 of 159 
 
MS K:  Chair a large extent I do agree and confirm what is 
reflected 
there 
on 
3.13 
although 
I 
think 
– 
want 
to 
acknowledge that some of the individuals mentioned here 
actually their involvement was at varying levels and also 
there are other individuals that are not implicated – actually 
listed here who obviously I believe played a very critical 
role. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright well just name those that 
played a critical role in the matters that you investigated and 
not others that you do not feel sure about. 
10 
MS K:  Could you please repeat that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius make it clear your question 
may be in understood as if you are inviting her to – to 
include those who might not be mentioned in the paragraph 
that she knows to have played a critical role.  I do not think 
that is what you intend. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is not what I intend at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And perhaps I should clarify and 
repeat as Ms K wants me to do.  Do you see there in 
20 
paragraph 3.13 a number of names are recorded?  Please 
just mention the names that you from your own knowledge 
are satisfied played a critical or important role in the matters 
investigated by Project Veza? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words Ms K as I understand it 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 78 of 159 
 
what Mr Pretorius is saying is that he notes that you have 
already said that you are in – you are largely in agreement 
with what Mr Y says in paragraph 3.13 and he notes that you 
have said there are other names that are not mentioned. 
1.  He wants you to confine you to the names that are 
mentioned but I think he wants you to mention only the 
names 
in 
respect 
of 
whom 
you 
have 
personal 
knowledge of their involvement.  But only the names – 
only names that are in the paragraph.  He does not 
want you to introduce names that are not in the 
10 
paragraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you mention those in respect of whom 
you have personal knowledge of their involvement by virtue 
of the information you obtained through the investigations 
that you are busy with it.  Mr Pretorius did I capture 
correctly? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so Ms K do you follow what I 
have tried to convey and what the Chair has conveyed? 
MS K:  The Chairman was a bit inaudible in some parts so I 
20 
did not catch most of what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay let me repeat.  
MS K:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand it Mr Pretorius notes that 
you say there are certain names which are not included in 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 79 of 159 
 
paragraph 3.13 that you think may be… 
MS K:  Cannot hear the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  I think I will have to bring my 
microphone closer.  Can you hear me well now? 
MS K:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
1.  I think he does not want you to mention any names 
that are not in paragraph 3.13.  You understand that? 
MS K:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though you may think that those 
10 
other names. 
MS K:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which are not here also played a role.  
Okay.  That will be dealt with some other time. 
MS K:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confine yourself when you mention the 
names in paragraph 3.13 you confined yourself to those 
names that you have personal knowledge of as people who 
were involved. 
MS K:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In these things based on your involvement 
in the Veza investigation.  You understand ? 
MS K:  Yes I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You can then continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes could you mention those names 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 80 of 159 
 
please that you are satisfied played a role or were involved 
in matters investigated by Project Veza? 
MS K:  Okay the first – the first one – maybe I should just 
read the paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – yes – yes read the paragraph 
insofar as what you are able to confirm.  Okay. 
MS K:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Read it ja. 
MS K:   
“An executive level the abuse of SSA’s mandate occurred 
10 
primarily under the political leadership of Minister Siyabonga 
Cwele, David Mahlobo and Advocate Bongani Bongo and was 
executed or implemented primarily although not exclusively 
by Mr Moruti Noosi, Ambassador Thulani Dlomo, Ambassador 
Sondocugo and Mr Fraser – Arthur Fraser. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right thank you.  Chair it is one 
minute to one about to start a new topic would this be a 
convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will take the lunch adjournment and 
we will resume at two o’clock.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

Page 81 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you.  Ms K, can you hear 
us? 
MS K:   Yes, I can Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you.  We are at paragraph 
4.1 of Mr Y’s affidavit. 
MS K:   Okay.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   He talks there in paragraph 4.1 of: 
“...a deliberate and planned system of parturition 
corruption 
which 
entrenched 
and 
sustained 
10 
executive 
and 
mandate 
overreach, 
political 
interference and abusive power in the SSA....” 
 
As a general statement, do you agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do Mr Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Paragraph 4.2. reads: 
“In 2008 and 2009, a group of approximately 48 non-
SSA 
members 
were 
recruited 
and 
trained 
in 
preparation for their deployment after the May 2009 
Elections into various roles with responsibilities that 
included VIP Protection and Intelligence Collection.” 
20 
 
Do you agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Can I just ask?  Is this established 
by evidence given to the Investigation Team? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 82 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   The paragraph continues: 
“Their recruitment and training was directed by 
Ambassador 
Thulani 
Dlomo, 
then 
a 
Security 
Manager at the Kwazulu-Natal Department of Social 
Development, DSD. 
Ambassador Thulani Dlomo had been a member of 
President Jacob Zuma’s Protection Team.” 
 
Do I understand the position correctly?  From your 
knowledge that the 48 non-SSA members were recruited and 
trained in preparation for their deployment but that was 
10 
directed by Ambassador Thulani Dlomo and that at that time, 
Ambassador Thulani Dlomo was a Security Manager at the 
Kwazulu-Natal, Department of Social Development? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you.  Paragraph 4.3 follows.  
It says: 
“The new recruits were mostly drawn from Kwazulu-
Natal ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Sorry, apologies Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes? 
20 
MS K:   I just want to indicate that the latter part of that 
paragraph 
which 
talks 
about 
previously 
members 
of 
President Jacob Zuma’s Protection Team.  That I am not 
certain of. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Alright.  So from your evidence and 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 83 of 159 
 
from your knowledge, we can exclude that sentence? 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you.  If we go on to 
paragraph 4.3.  It reads: 
“The new recruits were mostly drawn from KwaZulu-
Natal 
and 
received 
training 
on 
inter 
alia 
counterintelligence, 
weapons 
training, 
counterterrorism and VIP protection.” 
MS K:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Is that within in your knowledge 
from your investigations? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   This training, the paragraph 
continues: 
“...was undertaken both elsewhere on the continent 
and locally at the South African National Academy of 
Intelligence in May 2009...” 
 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   You know, as we know, that the 
location on the continent where the training took place is a 
known fact.  It is not an unknown fact.  But it has been 
removed from the statement in the interest of National 
Security. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 84 of 159 
 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Is that correct. 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Paragraph 4.4 reads: 
“According to one of the SANAI trainers, that is 
South African National Academy of Intelligence, who 
reported to the Investigation Team the rationale 
proffered by Ambassador Dlomo for the training was 
to build a Presidential Protection Unit that is like the 
United States Secret Service which would collect 
10 
intelligence affecting the President. 
These 
recruited 
personnel 
would 
subsequently 
deployed to SANDF, SAPS and SSA bypassing 
official recruitment and vetting processes when 
President 
Zuma 
assumed 
leadership 
after 
the 
elections in 2009.” 
 
Is that a correct reflection of the facts learnt by the 
Investigation Team to your knowledge? 
MS K:   I can say largely yes because I had the interview 
myself with the individual that provided that and there is a 
20 
statement to that effect.  And we even have – what the report 
and you know for all of those personnel.  What I cannot 
confirm is the bypassing of official recruitment and vetting 
processes at SAPS and SANDF.  But in – with regards to 
SSA, I can confirm that.   
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 85 of 159 
 
 
The only thing I know for sure which I heard from one of 
the implicated individuals when I interviewed them was that 
they had, before they were brought over to SSA, they were 
at SANDF.   
 
So I am not sure whether they were there having 
followed official recruitment and vetting processes.  But I 
can with authority indicate that on the SSA’s side there was 
bypassing of that.   
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Of both the official recruitment and 
vetting processes? 
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you.  We go over the page 
to paragraph 4.5.   
“By the end of 2009, (the affidavit continues) only 
about 27 of the original 48 recruits remained as 
others had left the programme. 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
direct 
involvement 
in 
the 
recruitment and training of these non-SSA members 
is noteworthy as he was still employed by the 
KwaZulu-Natal DSD, that is the Department of 
20 
Social Development, and had no official position at 
the SSA during this period.” 
 
Is that within your knowledge of the Investigation Team 
including yourself? 
MS K:   Yes, it is Chair. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 86 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Continues paragraph 4.6 to say: 
“Ambassador Dlomo’s involvement in the training of 
these new recruits was facilitated by the then 
Principal of SANAI, the South African National 
Academy 
of 
Intelligence, 
who 
sent 
letters 
to 
Ambassador Dlomo’s employers, confirming that he 
was 
assisting 
the 
SSA 
with 
training 
for 
the 
Presidential Protection Unit. 
Sample letters that we have in our possession are 
dated 10 June 2009 and 30 October 2011 and thus 
10 
clearly predate the establishment of a directorate for 
presidential security support within the SSA on 
27 December 2011 
and 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
appointment to the SSA on 18 January 2012 as 
General Manager, Special Operations.” 
 
Are you aware of that evidence and do you know of the 
allegations in this paragraph? 
MS K:   Yes, I agree with the paragraph in its entirety.   
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Right.  And you have seen those 
letters, have you? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I have. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
(SC): 
 
 
Paragraph... 
 
Thank 
you.  
Paragraph 4.7 goes on to say: 
“The 
evidence 
available 
to 
the 
Project 
Veza 
Investigation Team indicates that the groundwork 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 87 of 159 
 
was being laid during this period for a Private 
Protection Unit dedicated to President Zuma. 
As detailed below, the restructuring of the SSA 
would 
coincide 
with 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
appointment saw these non-SSA members at thought 
within the Chief Directorate Special Operations and 
deployed to various structures within the Justice 
Crime Prevention and Security Cluster.” 
 
Is that information known to you and do you confirm it? 
MS K:   I cannot confirm that they were absorbed within the 
10 
JSPS Cluster in its entirety.  So maybe...  Ja, I cannot 
confirm that it is – I do not – Ja, I cannot confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Is that you cannot confirm that 
...[intervenes] at all? 
MS K:   [Indistinct] 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   The question...  Well, you finish 
your answer first and then I will ask a question. 
MS K:   I can confirm that where it pertains to CDSO or that 
20 
there was this appointment and they were absorbing things 
CDSO or his co-workers.  But I cannot confirm that they were 
also deployed to various structures in the JCPS Cluster. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  You are at 4.7?  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 88 of 159 
 
Is that where you are? 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, just to make sure which – what Ms K 
confirms and what she does not confirm.  Let me do this.  
You see the first sentence in paragraph 4.7 Ms K?  Do you 
see the first ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says: 
“The 
evidence 
available 
to 
the 
Project 
Veza 
Investigation Team indicates that the groundwork 
10 
was being laid during this period for a Private 
Protection Unit dedicated to President Zuma.” 
 
Are you able to associate yourself with that? 
MS K:   Yes, I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And then there is: 
“...as detailed below the restructuring of the SSA 
which 
coincided 
with 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
appointment saw these non-SSA members absorbed 
within the CDSO and deployed to various structures 
within the Justice Crime Prevention and Security 
20 
Cluster.” 
 
Is there any part of that sentence that you do not – you 
are not in a position to confirm as true?  
MS K:   The part that I cannot confirm Chair is the part 
where it refers to the deployment to various structures within 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 89 of 159 
 
JCPS Cluster. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise, you can confirm the rest of 
that sentence. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius, do you want to 
proceed from there? 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Thank you.  The paragraph 
continues Ms K to say: 
“These non-SSA members were not subject to the 
former recruitment and vetting processes of the 
10 
SSA.” 
 
You have confirmed that already as I understand it. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   The sentence continues: 
“...but were rather co-workers not formally employed 
by the SSA...” 
 
How would you and the rest of the team and including 
the sponsor or co-sponsor, Mr Y, have understood the term 
co-workers?  What does that term mean? 
MS K:   I am not sure what it means because it is not 
20 
contained in our operational directives that govern the covert 
operations.  It is just a term that was coined, as far as we 
know, only in the MPD, you know, when it comes to the 
operational side.   
 
But I am not sure what it means because even when you 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 90 of 159 
 
read various documents and submissions that were compiled 
by CDSO members, they use co-workers and sources or 
engines interchangeable.  So I am not sure what it means. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Right.  Can you comment as to 
whether they were formally employed by the SSA, directly 
employed by the SSA? 
MS K:   The evidence that I have looked at that is at our 
disposal was that the – I think we will address it later in this 
affidavit – is that these people were given contracts but 
when I – when we analysed those contracts, nobody signed 
10 
on behalf of the SSA but these people were made to sign 
and made to believe that after five years they will be 
absorbed into the organisation.   
 
So I am not sure if that is legal as there is no one 
representing the SSA in that particular contract.  So I do not 
– based on that, I do not think they were formally employed 
by the SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Right.  The sentence or the 
paragraph continues: 
“They 
were 
given 
access 
to 
SSA 
funds 
and 
20 
resources and provided with firearms from the SSA 
Armoury.” 
 
Do you have knowledge of that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   And is it correct. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 91 of 159 
 
MS K:   Yes, it is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   The paragraph continues: 
“Through the CDSO, that is the Chief Directorate 
Special Operations, the SSA assumed responsibility 
for President Zuma’s food and toxin security, his 
physical security and the static protection of the 
President’s aircraft.” 
 
Did that knowledge come to your attention?  Do you 
share that knowledge? 
MS K:   Yes, I do.  I do know – I am aware of this. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   It continues: 
“In doing so, funds and resources which should have 
been utilised by legitimate intelligent structures 
were challenged through this parallel structure 
serving the interest of President Zuma rather than 
the national interest.” 
 
Do you agree with that conclusion? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Paragraph 4.8 is a summary but it 
is useful and it is worth placing on record.  And if you 
20 
disagree with any part of this summary, will you please tell 
the Chair?  It says: 
“1. 
Recruitment and selection of this private force 
took place outside formal structures. 
“2. 
At least part of the training was done beyond 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 92 of 159 
 
the borders of South Africa and not by formal 
training structures within South Africa. 
3. 
Persons within this force were armed and 
financed by SSA. 
4. 
At least some were deployed to various 
security structures within to South Africa.” 
 
And I will come back to that one in a moment. 
“5. 
It is apparent that they were accountable to 
Ambassador Dlomo and served the interest of 
President Zuma. 
10 
6. 
They performed their duties outside formal 
SSA structures at least initially.” 
 
Apart from paragraph 4 or apart from the sentence which 
reads: 
“At least some were deployed to various security 
structures within South Africa.” 
 
Do you agree with that summary? 
MS K:   I am not sure about 4.8.6.  So I have no comment on 
that one.  But I am not going to say, I agree with it.  I am not 
sure what it means.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Right.  And 4.8.4.  I take it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  It seems to 
me that whatever their duties were, they did not perform 
them within SSA’s structures, at least initially.  They seemed 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 93 of 159 
 
to have performed their duties, whatever their duties were, 
outside of SSA.  If...  Does that help you understand what it 
means? 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms K? 
MS K:   Chairperson, what I can say is that.  Some of the 
duties – SSA would be deployed to, whether it is the 
provinces or whatever the officials and co-workers as well.   
 
But you would find that the provinces are actually not 
fed with whatever they are collecting in that area.   
10 
 
And apart from that, whatever they were doing, the 
information was not channelled through the formal channels 
of information management and intelligence management 
within the SSA.   
 
So in that respect I would say that.  But I am not sure 
about this “at least initially” part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is the position that, as far as you 
know, the manner in which they performed their duties, 
whatever their duties were, was the same throughout the 
period you are aware of them performing duties?  There 
20 
would be initially and then maybe later it is different? 
MS K:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You know them to have been doing 
whatever their duties were ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   I ...[intervenes]  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 94 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the same way throughout that you 
were aware of, of them? 
MS K:   Chair, could you please repeat that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Do you – are you aware of only 
way in which they were performing their duties, whatever 
their duties were?  In other words, you are not in a position 
to say initially this is how they performed their duties and 
later they performed them differently? 
MS K:   Yes, I am not aware Chair because as – even as we 
engaged with the people involved, they do not actually 
10 
divulge fully what their duties were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   And I do not – so I do not know how their duties 
evolved at the beginning or whenever.  So that is why I 
would rather not comment on 4.8.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  Insofar as there is a 
reference in 4.8.6 to them performing duties outside formal 
SSA structures.  You have said that they would go to 
provinces and I am just trying to understand that because 
you did say something even though you say you would rather 
20 
not comment.   
 
Would the position be that, as far as you understand the 
position, they would use the infrastructure of SSA for 
performing their duties for whenever they needed to but they 
themselves were not part of any formal structure at SSA?  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 95 of 159 
 
Are you able ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Chair, maybe I should explain my understanding in 
terms of how they operated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS K:   By way of an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   There is a period, a six months’ period where about 
25, 22 to 25 members of SO travelled across the country.  
They would spend a month in a province.  Another month in 
another province.  Six consecutive months.  And that would 
10 
include admin, HR, everybody even general workers.  And 
they would just say it is for operational purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS K:   So.  But it is my understanding that most of the 
provinces did not understand what they were doing there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   But ultimately, it was costing the organisation a lot 
of money for all the people to spend a month, six months, six 
consecutive months in various places.  So I am not sure if 
that helps in terms of my understanding. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but do you know whether whenever, 
for example, they were in a particular province they would go 
to the SSA offices in that province and make use of the 
facilities there? 
MS K:   No, I do not know that. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 96 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know? 
MS K:   I do not know any of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But other than 4.8.6.  Are you in 
agreement with the rest of that summary, starting from 4.8.1 
to 4.8.6 that Mr Pretorius gave earlier? 
MS K:   My agreement is 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3, 4.8.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  4.8.4 you are not in agreement with 
or you are not sure about it or you are sure? 
10 
MS K:   It is – as I indicated earlier.  I am not sure about the 
deployment in the security cluster. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay.  So you are in 
agreement with 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3 and 4.8.5. 
MS K:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not sure about 4.8.6 and 4.8.4. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   As I understand it Ms K. 
MS K:   Yes? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   You are not saying that 4.8.6 and 
4.8.4 are to your knowledge incorrect.  You are saying you 
do not know.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Then if we go on then to paragraph 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 97 of 159 
 
4.9.  You talk or Mr Y talks of a restructuring of the SSA.  I 
take it you will agree that this restructuring must be 
distinguished from the amalgamation restructuring that has 
been spoken about by other witnesses?  This is another form 
of restructuring.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   It is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Alright.  Paragraph 4.10 goes into 
detail and it says: 
“On 27 December 2011, a proposal compiled by 
Mr Noosi, the then acting Director, Domestic Branch 
10 
was recommended by Mr Dennis Dlomo, the then 
acting DG for Minister Cwele’s approval. 
This proposal is included in File 1 of SSA Bundle 
and is marked Annexure A. 
This 
recommendation 
sought 
Minister 
Cwele’s 
authorisation for the following structural changes 
within the SSA.” 
 
Before we go to the doc – before we go to the following 
allegations in the paragraph.  If you can just identify the 
document for reference purposes, please? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that Mr Pretorius.  To the 
extent that Mr Y’s affidavit may have references to File 1, 
File 2, File 3.  Because I think you said that you put those 
into one file.  It might be a good idea that in the one file that 
you put all of that in, there should be sections which can 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 98 of 159 
 
represent what is – what was in File 1 as he knew it and 
what was in File 2.   
 
So that one can then say into the record when he refers 
to File 1 that will be section so and so in this bundle and so 
on. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Yes, that will make research and 
review easier Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   And we will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   We will divide the single file into 
three dividers.  File 1, there is a reference to the file given 
by the SSA to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   File 1 of 3.  If you go to SSA 
Bundle 1 of Exhibit YY1, Annexure A is marked with a 
divider, a green divider A.  It is at page 6 of SSA-1.  Do you 
see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Is this the document ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  What page on...? 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, page 6. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Black numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you.  Ja, I have got it. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 99 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Is this the document that is being 
referred to in paragraph 4.10? 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Its contents are referred to in the 
following paragraphs.  So we can put that aside for one 
moment and go over the page.  There are three paragraphs 
which deal with the structural changes recommended in that 
document.   
 
The first in paragraph 4.10.1 is the relocation of the 
Chief Directorate Special Operations from the line function 
10 
authority of the Deputy-Director, Domestic Intelligence to the 
Deputy-Director, Counterintelligence.   
 
Is that fact within your knowledge that this was the 
recommendation? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Secondly in 4.10.2 the relocation of 
the Cover Support Unit from the office of the Director SSA, 
Domestic Branch to the office of the Deputy-Director, 
Counterintelligence.  Is that within your knowledge? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
20 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
(SC): 
 
 And 
thirdly 
in 
4.10.3 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Directorate 
Presidential 
Security 
Support, DSS, within the existing Chief Directorate Special 
Operations.  Is that also part of the recommendation to your 
knowledge?  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 100 of 159 
 
MS K:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Right.  The import of the structural 
changes appears later in the affidavit but to foreshadow it, it 
is a centralisation of Counterintelligence Special Operations 
or an amalgamation really of Special Operations and Cover 
Support within a single or within the authority of the Deputy-
Director, Counterintelligence a single division.  Is that 
correct? 
MS K:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Right.  Paragraph 4.11 says: 
10 
“These three structural changes were approved by 
Minister Cwele on the same day that they were 
recommended to him namely 27 December 2011. 
This 
was 
shortly 
before 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
appointment on 18 January 2012 which would see 
him stepping to the much expanded role of General 
Manager, Special Operations and a year later to the 
position of Deputy-Director, Counterintelligence.” 
 
In short, Ambassador Dlomo, it appears, would become 
the 
head 
of 
this 
amalgamated 
organisation 
or 
sub-
20 
organisation.  Do I understand the position correctly and do 
you agree with it? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS (SC):   Paragraph 4.12 reads: 
“The 
nature 
of 
the 
restructuring 
sought 
and 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 101 of 159 
 
recommended and the manner in which it was 
addressed there was a perceived need to expedite a 
process of “realigning and refocusing the available 
operational resources within the realm of counter 
intelligence.”  In short, the CDSO. 
Chief Directorate Special Operations. 
“...and the cover support unit were relocated to 
counterintelligence and the presidential security 
support service was established under the Chief 
Directorate 
Special 
Operations. 
 
The 
propose 
10 
restructuring 
thus 
entailed 
a 
significant 
concentration of power in the office of the Deputy 
Director 
Counterintelligence 
and 
envisaged 
a 
leading strategic role for the Chief Directorate 
Special Operations.” 
Those observations, are they firstly within your knowledge 
and do you agree with them? 
MS K:   Yes, they are within my knowledge. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And do you agree with them insofar 
as they are conclusions drawn? 
20 
MS K:   The conclusion that it was – it is more significant 
concentration of power? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   I am not sure but the rest of that I agree with. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 102 of 159 
 
MS K:   Because that is factual. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed, Mr Pretorius, just 
for the transcribers, in reading paragraph 4.12 Mr Pretorius 
indicated that before the word realigning you opened 
quotes but you forgot to mention where you closed quotes, 
the quotes would be closed after the two words counter 
intelligence. 
 
Ja, 
that 
is 
fine, 
that 
is 
just 
for 
the 
transcribers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So one could draw one’s own 
conclusions from the facts there.  You do not take any 
issue with the facts continued in paragraph 4.12 as 
opposed to the conclusion …[intervenes] 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, save to – save for that, that last 
sentence that refers to the significant concentration of 
power.  So I would – I agree with the – with 4.12 just up to 
CSO. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words …[intervenes] 
MS K:   The second last sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, it is the last sentence of 
paragraph 4.1 to that you are not able to associate 
yourself with. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 103 of 159 
 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let me understand what you are 
saying.  Are you saying that there was no significant 
concentration of power as far as you are concerned or that 
you are not sure that you could agree with the way it is 
described here? 
MS K:   I am not sure if I can agree with the way it is 
described. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, thank you.  4.13 reads: 
10 
“The general motivation for centralising these key 
assets within counter intelligence was explained 
with 
reference 
to 
immediate 
identified 
security 
deficiency that had left the President vulnerable to 
all sorts of threats.” 
Now I am not going to ask you to agree or not to agree 
with what the motivation said but if you look at paragraph 
4.13, 4.14 and 4.15 it refers to the motivation for the 
centralisation of these entities, it refers to the reason 
advanced for the relocation of the Chief Directorate 
20 
Special Operations and the explanation given for the 
relocation for the cover support unit, we have described 
the facts above but what happens in paragraph 4.13, 4.14 
and 4.15 at the hand of Mr Y is he questions the 
motivation, 
reasons 
and 
explanation 
given 
for 
this 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 104 of 159 
 
restructuring.  If you could take a moment to look at it and 
tell us whether you share his views or not.  These are 
really views …[intervenes] 
MS K:   I have read that, Chair, and where it says on 4.13, 
where it says: 
“Was 
explained 
with 
reference 
to 
“immediate 
identified security deficiencies.” 
And also: 
“That had left the President “vulnerable to all sorts 
of threats.” 
10 
My – I agree that I have a problem with these motivations 
because there was no threat assessment attached to this 
very document, it is just stating that it was immediate 
identified security deficiencies and what are vulnerable – 
President vulnerable to all sorts of threats. 
 
So, having read that, I agree with what Mr Y 
indicated in his affidavit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To be complete, he did say or does 
say in the last three lines of 4.13: 
“Vague references were made in the proposal to the 
20 
role of the media in undermining of the office of the 
presidency 
but 
not 
intelligence 
assessment 
or 
evidence was provided in support of this.” 
Is…? 
MS K:   Yes. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 105 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make sure I understand what you 
agree with and what you do not agree with on 4.13, Ms K.  
As I understand it, the first sentence which is three lines, 
simply says what was in the motivation.  It says the 
general motivation that was given for the centralising of 
these key assets within counter intelligence was explained 
with reference to – and he quotes: 
“Immediate identified security deficiencies.” 
10 
In other words, he is saying this what you would find, this 
is what they said and he says it was said that those 
immediate identified security deficiencies had left the 
President, and he quotes again: 
“…vulnerable to all sorts of threats.” 
In other words, as I understand it, he is not – he is simply 
saying this is what the motivation that was provided said.  
Do you know this to be correct, namely this is the 
motivation that was given as he describes in that first 
sentence or are you not sure about that? 
20 
MS K:   I align myself with the view that he expresses in 
that same paragraph where he says: 
“Vague references were made in the proposal to the 
role of the media in undermining the office of the 
presidency 
but 
no 
intelligence 
assessments 
or 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 106 of 159 
 
evidence was provided in support of this.” 
So I do agree that stating it in the way it was in that 
motivation was actually very vague. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that seems – what you have just 
said seems to suggest that you might not be sure with 
regard to the first sentence but you are quite comfortable 
that the second sentence is true, is correct. 
MS K:   No, Chair, I am comfortable with the first sentence 
because what is in the quotes is taken directly from the 
document that is in evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS K:   That is in evidence that we had analysed.  So I am 
comfortable with it because it is factual, it is stated there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  No, that is fine then.  Yes, 
Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If we go then to 
4.14 
where 
the 
reason 
advanced 
is 
quoted 
in 
that 
paragraph. 
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at paragraph 14, 
20 
4.1.14? 
MS K:  Yes, I see that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  There the deponent, Mr Y, 
talks about the reason advanced for the relocation of the 
CDSO.  Do you see that? 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 107 of 159 
 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it merely quotes the motivating 
document.  Are you happy with that? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You agree with that. 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   They merely quote it from the 
document.  And then paragraph 4.15 deals with the 
proposed relocation of the cover support unit and its 
explanation 
on 
the 
basis 
set 
out 
there 
to 
provide 
10 
backstopping.  What is backstopping? 
MS K:   It is arrangements that are meant to support cover 
structures, operations, identities, so in that in that covert 
environment, even just in terms of operations, it is actually 
a [indistinct 10.26] that is there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The affidavit continues. 
“Although in theory the CDSO, as a legitimate deep 
cover operational arm of the agency, would benefit 
from a close working relationship with the cover 
support unit, the deployment of close protection 
20 
officers does not require backstopping.” 
Do you agree with that observation? 
MS K:   I partly agree because if it is close protection 
officers they are right there, they are being seen, so I do 
not know what backstopping would be required in terms of 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 108 of 159 
 
that.  So I guess I do agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Continue: 
“Hence 
the 
rationale 
does 
not 
extend 
to 
the 
presidential security support service.” 
Do you agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It follows or rather, what follows is 
the statement that: 
“It should also be noted that backstopping and 
proper cover support are not limited to counter 
10 
intelligence operations.  On the contrary, most 
operational activity with the SSA would require 
basic backpacking for the purposes of cover.  The 
placement of the cover support unit in the counter 
intelligence subdivision is therefore questionable as 
it renders the 
unit remote to other 
areas of 
operation that would benefit from its support.” 
That is an observation.  Do you agree with it? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  4.16 continues to make 
20 
certain observations in relation to the recommendation that 
we are dealing with and refers to the justification given for 
the establishment of the presidential security support.  
That is a matter of fact, those quote are there in the 
motivation or the recommendation document but halfway 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 109 of 159 
 
down the comment is made as follows: 
“Significantly 
no 
reference 
was 
made 
in 
the 
proposal to existing state structures tasked with 
providing VIP and TSCM services nor was there any 
indication that the shift in SSA’s mandate had been 
canvassed with other stakeholders or was even 
necessary.” 
Firstly, what does TSCM stand for? 
MS K:   Technical Surveillance Counter Measures. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right, what are those?    
10 
MS K:   I think it entails issues of like sweeping for bugs. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   It is a – ja, I am not going to expand further on 
that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In any event, the comments made 
after word “significantly” to the end of the paragraph are 
largely factual, do you agree with them? 
MS K:   I do agree with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The last sentence reads: 
“Instead, the submission creates the impression 
20 
that VIP protection was the responsibility of SSA 
with outlining the origin of this doctrinal shift or its 
approval by the South African Police Service and 
the South African National Defence Force.” 
Did you agree with that observation?  It is largely factual. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 110 of 159 
 
MS K:   Yes, this is factual, there was no mention of the 
roles that the others – the other departments had to play in 
that space.  So, in essence, it has created an impression 
that there was sort of like a vacuum in that space without 
actually providing an in-depth threat assessment in that 
regard. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Then 4.17 describes how the 
document 
that 
we 
are 
considering, 
described 
the 
recruitment and appointment of 20 officers.  The last 
sentence says: 
10 
“The impression created and the recommendation is 
that these “officers were legitimately recruited and 
employed by the SSA.” 
Do you agree with that?  We will go …[intervenes] 
MS K:   I do agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  The next comment is relevant 
to that: 
“4.18  However, the headhunted officers listed in 
attachment A of the recommendation are in fact the 
same individuals who were recruited and trained 
20 
under 
the 
direction 
Ambassador 
Dlomo 
in 
2008/2009.  They had not been subject to the 
official recruitment and vetting processes of the 
SSA yet two years later they were absorbed into a 
newly 
established 
presidential 
security 
support 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 111 of 159 
 
service 
coinciding 
with 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
appointment as general manager of the CDSA.” 
Again that is factual.  Do you agree with it? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The 4.19: 
“Dorothy played a…” 
And that word should read Dorothy, if you could note that 
please, Ms K. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
10 
 “Dorothy played a key role in the implementation of 
the structural changes.  In February 2012 she was 
seconded 
from 
Mr 
Noosi’s 
office 
to 
assist 
Ambassador Dlomo as the acting…: 
Well, I am not going to mention the post because that 
might also reveal her identify but do you agree with that 
factual observation? 
MS K:   Yes, I do.  Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius will you remember to 
20 
arrange for Mr Y to do a supplementary to just correct 
that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should be read to say Dorothy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  The word Dorothy should be 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 112 of 159 
 
inserted where appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will not mention the name it 
should replace. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Anyway, that person, and I am not 
going to mention, Ms K, the appointment in 2013 referred 
to in this paragraph, I will go on, but: 
“Dorothy facilitated the compilation of contracts 
with so-called co-workers, their placement within 
10 
the CDSO as well as the preparation of submissions 
relating to their registration and payment.” 
Do you agree with that factual observation?   
MS K:   Yes, I agree with it.  In fact this is what we heard 
directly from her during an interview as well as another HR 
person that was assisting her. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  4.20: 
“Shortly after Ambassador Dlomo’s appointment on 
18 January 2012 the scope of his authority as 
general manager of special operations was further 
20 
expanded. 
 
Whole 
the 
27 
December 
2011 
restructuring brought the cover support unit within 
the counter intelligence subdivision, I am aware 
that urgent approval was sought in February 2012 
for a further structural realignment to bring the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 113 of 159 
 
cover support unit under special operations.” 
Is that a correct recordal of the facts? 
MS K:   I believe so although this document was never – 
the copy of this document that I saw was not signed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
“The effect of this proposal, which was compiled by 
Dorothy 
was 
that 
all 
three 
units, 
the 
Chief 
Directorate Special Operations, the Presidential 
Security Support Service and the Cover Support 
Unit 
were 
brought 
under 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
10 
control as General Manager Special Operations.” 
Is that a correct recordal of the facts? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Now there is an 
observation made in paragraph 4.2.1 and I will invite your 
comment on that as to whether you agree with it or not. 
“The timeline set out above demonstrates that the 
restructuring within the SSA, decentralised control 
of 
counter 
intelligence 
operations 
under 
Ambassador Dlomo was a plan in the making long 
20 
before he was officially appointed in January 2012.  
The 
groundwork 
for 
this 
restructured 
and 
repurposed CDSO was laid by Ambassador Dlomo in 
2008/2009 with his recruitment and training of   the 
co-workers who would subsequently be deployed for 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 114 of 159 
 
the President’s projects at the SSA.” 
Those two sentences, do you have any comment, do you 
agree with them, are they reasonable?  Are you in 
agreement? 
MS K:   I agree with them, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  It continues, the 
paragraph, that is, continues: 
“The structural changes approved by Mr Cele in 
December 
2011 
meant 
that 
when 
Ambassador 
Dlomo was officially appointed in January 2012 the 
10 
SSA’s counter intelligence architecture had already 
been transformed in order to provide him with the 
power and resources to directly serve the political 
interests of President Zuma through intelligence 
operations that were clearly unconstitutional and 
illegal.” 
What do you say about that conclusion? 
MS K:   I agree with the conclusion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  It continues: 
“Under Ambassador ’s watch the CDSO engaged in 
20 
exponential overspending and flouted the SSA’s 
financial operational and HR directives through 
covert mechanisms and illegal contracts.” 
What do you say about that largely factual observation? 
MS K:   That is factual. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 115 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 4.22 – oh and you agree with 
it, do you?  
MS K:   Yes, I agree with it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  4.22: 
“The impact…” 
And this again is a summary so you can comment freely: 
“The impact of the centralisation of power within 
counter intelligence is borne out by the activities 
subsequently 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
CDSO, 
the 
presidential security support service and cover 
10 
support unit as detailed below.  In summary, the 
consequences of structural changes were: 
4.22.1 The infiltration into the SSA by co-workers 
who bypassed official recruitment, training 
and vetting processes. 
4.22.2 The 
overreach 
of 
the 
duly 
authorised 
mandate of the SSA. 
4.22.3 Illegal activities carried out by a parallel 
counter 
intelligence 
structure 
under 
the 
guise of covert operations. 
20 
4.22.4 Executive 
interference 
and 
operational 
activities. 
4.22.5 The rampant looting of SSA funds, and 
4.22.6 The illegal use of SSA firearms.” 
Would you comment on some or all and inform the Chair to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 116 of 159 
 
what extent you agree or disagree with those conclusions? 
MS K: I agree with all of them, all of these conclusions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
MS K:   Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Ms K.  In paragraph 5 
you deal in some detail …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Y deals in some detail. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 5, the Directorate for 
10 
Presidential Security Support is dealt with in some detail 
by Mr Y. and let us go through it paragraph by paragraph. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   5.1, the first sentence says that: 
“The extent to which the activities conducted by the 
SSA’s CDSO…” 
And CDSO for reference is the Chief Directorate Special 
Operations. 
“…exceeded the duly authorised mandate of the 
Agency.” 
20 
Is that is a correct statement of fact? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It continues, the paragraph 
continues: 
“The establishment and operation of the Directorate 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 117 of 159 
 
for Presidential Security Support represents the 
clearest example of mandate overreach by the 
CDSO under Ambassador Dlomo’s leadership.” 
Do you agree with that statement? 
MS K:   Yes provided that everybody understands that we 
are referring here to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Thank you for reminding us. 
““More generally it reflects the shift…” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Well, 
maybe let us take this opportunity for me to get clarity 
10 
because there are two Dlomos here.  I have seen a 
reference to Ambassador Dlomo and then there is – I think 
there is Thulani Dlomo and Dennis Dlomo.   
Now, Ms K you say provided the understanding is 
that this reference to Ambassador Dlomo is a reference to 
Ambassador Thulani Dlomo.  I am wondering whether they 
were 
both 
referred 
to 
as 
ambassadors 
or 
were 
ambassadors both of them at some stage.  Is there only 
one of them who was an Ambassador? 
MS K:   They  are both… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were both Ambassadors at some 
stage? 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, which means, therefore, in the 
affidavit wherever there is Ambassador Dlomo without a 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 118 of 159 
 
reference to the name it might create difficulties unless the 
context 
indicates 
which 
one, 
such 
as 
if 
one 
was 
…[intervenes] 
MS K:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If only a particular one was associated 
with DSO, CDSO, then if that is the context then we would 
know that is the one who was associated with that 
operation. 
MS K:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand it, Ms K, when you 
refer to Ambassador Dlomo in this affidavit of Mr Y you are 
referring to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so for purposes of Mr Y’s 
affidavit, where there is refer to Ambassador Dlomo you 
are referring to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo.  Ms K? 
MS K:   Yes, I would say so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay, it is just that it is 
20 
important because serious allegations are made so one 
does not want to understand certain allegations to be 
attached to somebody that was not intended.  So it is 
important to understand who is being referred to in regard 
to what allegations.  Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 119 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The remaining sentence in 
paragraph 5.1 is the last sentence.  Do you have any 
comment in regard to the sentence which refers to the: 
“…shift in intelligence philosophy represented by 
this restructuring.” 
It has been given by other witnesses. 
MS K:   Yes, I agree with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then 5.2 repeats evidence that 
is contained earlier.  We can go to 5.3 which refers to the 
Presidential Handbook as does 5.4.  Do you take any issue 
10 
with the fact that the Presidential Handbook sets out the 
extent of administrative, logistical and security in general 
support services to be rendered to the President, the 
Deputy President, their spouses and children? 
MS K:   Where are we now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 5.3. 
MS K:   Sorry, I am lost in terms of the document. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, sorry.  5.3 on page 361 of 
bundle SSA02. 
MS K:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Quotes from the Presidential 
Handbook and provides, in summary, that Presidential 
Handbook deals in detail with the various services to be 
rendered to the President including security services. 
MS K:   Yes, I agree. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 120 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And paragraph 5.4 also point out 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, we have 
got to always make sure we know what she agrees to.  You 
have read paragraph 5.4 Ms K, have you not? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Coming to 5.4, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was that not the one you were 
talking about? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, I was talking about 5.3 but your 
comments are valid in relation to those. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay.  You see, I thought we 
were already at 5.4  Okay, alright.  I think that the way that 
you have been doing it, Mr Pretorius is good to actually 
read so that she is able to say that is what I am not 
agreeing to, that is what …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And given the circumstances of the 
nature of this evidence and its format, it is perhaps wise to 
go slower rather than… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms K, I hope you will bear with us, 
then.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph 5.3 reads: 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 121 of 159 
 
“The Presidential Handbook to the extent of the 
administrative, 
logistical 
security 
and 
general 
support services to be rendered to the President, 
Deputy President and their spouses and children.” 
Do you accept the correctness of that statement? 
MS K:   I have to accept the correctness of that statement 
because if something – if that is the objective of the 
document I cannot dispute it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you can only agree with the 
10 
statement if you have seen the presidential handbook and 
you have seen that that is what it does. 
MS K:   Yes, we did have a copy of the presidential 
handbook. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS K:   And this part was actually drawn from there and we 
the only thing that we were certain of is the year because 
sometimes the handbooks revised but the one that we 
could get our hands on stipulated the rules as reflected 
here.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine, that is good 
enough.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the one you did get your hands 
on 
and 
assume 
provided 
to 
the 
investigators, 
the 
Commission is in fact in the bundle.  It is in the legislation 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 122 of 159 
 
bundle, which you do have Chair.  So we can cross check 
that if necessary.  In any event, the stated objective, the 
paragraph records of the presidential handbook is: 
“To provide, quote a concise operational guide to 
relevant government departmental staff, with clearly 
indicated 
responsibilities 
and 
duties 
and 
by 
implication, lines of accountability.” 
Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And again - whilst you may not 
10 
remember the exact words I take it; you do not take issue 
with that we can check it. 
MS K:   No, I do not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, 5.4 goes further to say that 
the 
presidential 
handbook 
outlines 
that 
firstly, 
the 
responsibility for the President's medical and health care 
resides with the Surgeon General and the South African 
military and health service unit of the SANDF.  
Secondly, 
the 
South African 
Police 
Service 
is 
obliged to take, and I quote 
20 
“Full responsibility for the protection and security of 
the 
President 
and 
Deputy 
President, 
with 
the 
intelligence 
services 
providing 
regular 
and 
comprehensive security assessments.” 
Do you agree with those observations, are those facts 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 123 of 159 
 
real?  
MS K:   Yes, I do.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   According to the handbook: 
“Protection and security measures of the President 
and Deputy President include, but are not limited to 
the following 5.4.1, regular security assessments in 
conjunction with the Intelligence Agencies.   
5.4.2 
static protection at all official and private 
residences and office accommodation used from 
time to time during the term of office. 
10 
5.4.3 
in transit protection during all domestic and 
international movements. 
5.4.4 
regular 
vetting 
of 
protectors, 
medical 
personnel and other staff. 
5.4.5 
screening of service providers. 
5.4.6 
static protection of aircraft’; and 
5.4.7 
regular revision of ICT security systems.” 
Is that your understanding of the handbooks provisions in 
regard to protection and security measures relating to the 
President and Deputy President? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   5.5.  I am sorry did you want to 
add something? 
MS K:   No nothing. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 124 of 159 
 
“5.5 
notwithstanding 
this 
clear 
assignment 
of 
responsibility and the existing structures rendering 
medical 
and 
security 
support 
services 
to 
the 
President, the SSA established the Directorate for 
Presidential Security support to perform exactly the 
same functions.  In terms of formal documentation, 
outlining the mandate of the Presidential Security 
support 
service 
the 
Directorate 
comprised 
the 
following functions. 
5.5.1 
VIP protection. 
10 
5.5.2 
cyber security. 
5.5.3 
technical surveillance countermeasures and 
5.5.4 
toxicology. 
Is that what was contained in the formal documentation 
outlining the mandate of the Presidential Security support 
service? 
MS K:   I just want to refer to the document so that I do not 
miss quotes and confirm without - yes, this is accurate.  
This is accurate, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you if you go to paragraph 
5.6, Ms K.  The first sentence reads: 
“This not only broaden the mandate of the SSA 
without 
following 
legislative 
processes 
that 
effectively 
usurped 
functions 
that 
were 
duly 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 125 of 159 
 
assigned 
to 
the 
South 
African 
Police 
Service 
Presidential Protection Unit, and the South African 
Military and Health Services Unit of the SANDF.” 
We will come to what witnesses said in a moment.  The 
first sentence is an observation of the implications of what 
you have spoken about and what Mr Y has spoken about 
above. Do you agree with the observation and 5.6 per 
sentence? 
MS K:   I do on the basis that among the documents that 
we have, and also in our engagements with the relevant 
10 
people who were responsible for these responsibilities 
within SSA, we could not trace whether there were MOU’s 
or with these departments which were coordinating the 
work, you know that would indicate that this service was 
requested from SSA.  
So in that regard, I do agree that they did usurp the 
functions but if there is a document out there that can 
support that there was an agreement, then my view would 
be different. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, well the next sentence deals 
20 
with that it says: 
“According to witness reports received during our 
investigations, the Presidential Security Support 
Service functioned without any memorandum of 
understanding with the SAPS or SANDF regarding 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 126 of 159 
 
the 
provision 
of 
protection 
services, 
to 
the 
President and Deputy President of the country.” 
That sentence says not only that you did not find one, but 
that you were told that there was not one do.  Is that what 
you were told? 
MS K:   Yes, when we spoke to Ms Dorothy that is what we 
were told. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, the paragraph continues: 
“Whilst the legitimate SSA channels would receive 
requests for support, such as the provision of threat 
10 
and risk assessments, secure communication and 
TSCM.  These were used as the justification for the 
deployment of the Presidential Security Support 
Service.  As a result of these unclear lines of 
communication 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
agreement 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
relevant 
stakeholders, 
tensions were reported between members of the 
CDSO’s Presidential Security Support Unit and 
members of the SAPS Presidential Protection Unit 
to the detriment of the effective working of the 
20 
protective services of SAPS.” 
Is that a fair observation in your view, do you agree with 
it? 
MS K:   The first one where we talk about legitimate SSA 
channels would receive the requests, I agree with that 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 127 of 159 
 
because it meant that PSS would still under SO’s still 
deploy their own people and do whatever outside of these 
formal channels. 
And 
also 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
unclear 
lines 
of 
communication, there were reports of tensions from the 
people who worked in this PSS from the SSA side when 
some of the implicated individuals did indicate that there 
was that tension that existed because of this arrangement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the only part that you have 
not commented on is whether this series of arrangements 
10 
was to the detriment of the effective working of the 
protected services of the South African Police Services.  
Can you comment on that? 
MS K:   I cannot confirm that it was to the detriment of the 
effective working of the protective because I have not 
engaged with - and the team has not engaged with SAPS 
and we have not gotten a view from that side, so I cannot 
confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, it appears Miss K that you 
have been very cautious and careful to restrict your 
20 
confirmation of the correctness of the affidavit of Mr Y to 
matters that you are reasonably certain of, is that a correct 
observation? 
MS K:   I am not being overly cautious but I have to be 
conscious of the terminology that is used and what it 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 128 of 159 
 
means, what its implications are.  So if I am not sure and I 
do not have direct evidence of the detriment that was 
caused, I cannot support and say, and come in and act and 
speak authoritatively on that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I understand. 
MS K:   I did not, for instance I did not see any 
documentation that showed any complaints from SAPS in 
this regard.  All I saw we request and itineraries sent from 
SAPS PPU to SSA but they would say for TSCM, that is all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms K, please do not misunderstand 
10 
me I am not being critical at all, in fact quite the opposite. 
It does appear and it is a good thing for the evidence that 
has been led that you are exercising the caution that you 
are.  So I am not being critical at all and I trust that you 
will continue giving evidence in this way.  
MS K:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us not misunderstand one 
another.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I also wanted to say exactly the 
same thing, Ms K that Mr Pretorius was not criticising you 
20 
he was actually meaning to say, you are being cautious 
and that is a good thing.  So that that which you confirm, 
everyone will know you confirmed because you believe you 
have knowledge of that and there are proper grounds and 
when you are not sure you make it clear that you are not 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 129 of 159 
 
sure and therefore you are not going to confirm something 
that you are not sure about.  
That might not mean you saying it is not true.  It 
might simply mean that you are not in a position to say 
whether it is true or not and obviously when you say it, it is 
where your understanding is that it is not true, you must 
feel free to say this part is not true or as far as I know the 
position is different and as far as I know, this is the 
position. So that is good it is not a bad thing. 
MS K:   Thank you Chair.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and Ms K as the day goes on 
or as the day's drag on please continue along the same 
lines.  Paragraph 5.7 reads: 
“According 
to 
members 
within 
the 
Presidential 
Security Support Service, they were responsible for 
security around accommodation venues, routes and 
crowds in relation to the president and Deputy 
President.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is what was indicated to us. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
“Members 
of 
the 
unit 
would 
be 
deployed 
as 
advanced teams to detect any potential risk or 
threat to the President or Deputy President when 
travelling.” 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 130 of 159 
 
Is that correct, is that what you were told? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“The information if any that was generated from 
these trips would be channelled only to Ambassador 
Dlomo and not formal information management 
structures or structure within the SSA.” 
Is that a correct statement or is that what you were told? 
MS K:   Yes, it is a correct statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
10 
“There 
is 
no 
indication 
that 
threat 
and 
risk 
assessments which according to the presidential 
handbook 
should 
have 
been 
provided 
by 
intelligence were made available to the South 
African Police Service or the SANDF regularly or at 
all.” 
Do you have a comment on that, is it correct? 
MS K:   I think there is no indication that is true but I – no 
I think I have no comment on this one because it is very 
ambiguous for me because I see it as if it says there is no 
20 
indication that certain risk assessments which according to 
the President should have been provided by intelligence or 
made available to SAPS and SANDF regularly or at all. 
I do not have a proof of that, I do not know.  All I 
know, I can say is that we have not seen any intelligence 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 131 of 159 
 
or intelligence products that came from this unit or SO in 
general.  So that is why I am not sure whether to agree 
with the statement or not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, we can leave it there, 
thank you and go to paragraph 5.8: 
“In summary, a separate and discrete - which I 
suppose should be spelt in this context, d-i-s-c-r-e-
t-e force, although it was also discreet - was 
established 
within 
the 
SSA 
reporting 
to 
and 
accountable to in the main Ambassador Dlomo.  The 
10 
lawful structure for the personal protection of the 
President, namely SAPS was entirely side-lined.”  
Thus far, can you comment on those two sentences or the 
content of those two sentences? 
MS K:   I do not have any issues with the first sentence. 
However, the second one that says the lawful structure for 
the personal protection of the President namely SAPS was 
entirely side-lined.   
I do not totally agree with that, mainly because 
there was - if I have seen documents that are bearing the 
20 
emblem of SAPS and assigned by a senior member of 
SAPS that are being sent to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo 
then I cannot say they were entirely side-lined and 
because I was not on the ground I cannot, so it may have 
caused tension but I am not sure about the word entirely.  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 132 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, would you partially agree to 
the extent that there was a degree of side-lining? 
MS K:   Yes, I would partially agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, if we can go on the next 
sentence 
says 
that 
- 
and 
obviously 
refers 
to 
the 
information available to Mr Y.  He says: 
“My information is that Ambassador Dlomo reported 
directly to President Zuma.” 
Do you have any knowledge of that statement or the report 
of that statement? 
10 
MS K:   I think it is something that we did use, not that 
there is any proof that I have seen that he was doing 
exactly that. The only information that I can confirm is that 
some of the people that were involved in some of these 
projects carried out by CDSO did indicate that they were 
reporting directly to President Zuma.  
In fact, some of the people that we interviewed in 
fact one did indicate that they were reporting directly to 
the President.  So I do not know whether that would be 
supporting 
that 
Ambassador 
Thulani 
Dlomo 
reported 
20 
directly. I do not know because all of those people were 
reporting to him, so maybe it follows that he reported to 
the President. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So what you are saying in relation 
to that sentence as I understand it that people in the unit 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 133 of 159 
 
subordinate to Ambassador Dlomo told you that they 
reported directly to President Zuma, am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes, they said - one of them even said they felt 
very powerful because they were reporting directly to the 
President. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and then the last sentence 
reads: 
“In the result, President Zuma benefited from an 
SSA 
based 
protection 
service 
financed 
and 
controlled by the SSA.” 
10 
Let us go as far as that for the moment.  Do you agree with 
that part of the last sentence in paragraph 5.8? 
MS K:   Seen that they were deployed SSA there was an 
entire unit just focusing on that within CDSO I would say 
that, that sentence is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The protection service is 
said in this sentence to be possibly performing intelligence 
functions, do you have to comment on that? 
MS K:   We assume that all SSA members because as 
much as CDSO had the core workers were non-SSA 
20 
members, there were also members of SSA who were 
involved there, a handful of them.  So I should assume that 
they were performing intelligence functions.  So ja, I do not 
know what…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have already confirmed, I am 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 134 of 159 
 
sorry, I interrupted you.  Do you have anything to add? 
MS K:   No, I think they were performing those intelligence 
functions, but whether these were in line with our mandate 
or you know whether it also followed our information 
management 
system 
whatever, 
whether 
- 
how 
that 
information was channelled, I cannot comment on that but I 
am 
assuming 
that 
they 
were 
performing 
intelligence 
functions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you and the last part of that 
sentence as it had been trained to do, I think you have 
10 
confirmed earlier that the training involved intelligence 
training.  Am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on then if we may to 
the Toxicology Unit, described in paragraph 5.9.  The first 
sentence reads: 
“In 2012, a Toxicology Unit was established within 
the 
CDSO 
under 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
management.” 
Is that correct statement? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, it is correct.  I am just not sure about the 
date, the year but it is correct the rest of the sentence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Paragraph continues: 
“There were no indications that this unit was 
established legitimately or with even an attempt to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 135 of 159 
 
comply with the threshold governance prescripts of 
the SSA.” 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
“Ambassador 
Dlomo 
- 
the 
paragraph continues: 
“in conjunction with a non-SSA member, Dr Mandisa 
Mokwena were involved in the recruitment and 
training of individuals in the toxicology environment 
to capacitate this new unit.” 
10 
Is that the correct statement? 
MS K:   Yes, according to the witness statement that we 
have, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“This was done in conjunction with an organisation 
referred to as a Foreign International Development 
Agency for Food Safety and Security.” 
Now, we have taken out the name of the country where this 
food and safety security Agency existed but apart from 
that, are you comfortable with the contents 
of that 
20 
sentence? 
MS K:   Yes, I am. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“Based 
on 
our 
investigations 
- 
the 
affidavit 
continues, this organisation does not appear to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 136 of 159 
 
exist in any official records.”  
Can you confirm that? 
MS K:   Yes, when we did the search, we could not find 
that organisation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, paragraph 5.10: 
“The recruitment and training agreement was signed 
by Ambassador Dlomo on behalf of the Republic of 
South Africa and by an unidentified representative 
on behalf of the foreign organisation.” 
And again, where you read the word foreign, the name of 
10 
the country has been taken out and replaced by the word 
foreign.  But this sentence is that the correct reflection of 
the facts? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“In terms of the agreement the foreign side would 
provide course curriculum, training equipment and 
installation with an overall implementation date of 
20 January 2013.” 
Is that a correct statement? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“During 2012 - the affidavit continues, individuals 
were identified through referrals and invited to 
submit their curriculum vitae.  Four individuals were 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 137 of 159 
 
selected, two toxicologists and two lab assistants. 
The individuals were not interviewed, but were 
allegedly 
vetted 
and 
sent 
for 
polygraph 
examinations conducted by the foreign country 
before attending a three week course in their 
country, in other words the foreign country, in 
December 2012.” 
Is that in accordance with the knowledge that you have of 
this project? 
MS K:   That is what we were told by one of the 
10 
toxicologists. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, 5.11 says: 
“The 
Toxicology 
Unit 
was 
located 
within 
the 
Directorate for Presidential Security Support in 
terms of the organisational design.  However, it also 
fell within a CDSO project called Project Khusela 
previously called Project Accurate of which Dr 
Mokwena was the project manager.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct but I have to also mention that 
20 
while Project Khusela was purported to have replaced 
Project Accurate, Project Accurate still continued while 
Khusela was in existence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you and we deal with 
Project Khusela in more detail below, but let us continue. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 138 of 159 
 
The affidavit reads: 
“The 
Toxicology 
Units 
laboratory, 
including 
a 
vivarium - and I will come back to that in a moment, 
was 
established 
in 
an 
SSA 
safe 
house 
in 
Waterkloof.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is what we were told, I do not know if it is 
correct, but that is what we were told. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, a vivarium, I suppose is to 
test poisons.  I do not know let me not speculate, it is a 
10 
container that contains live animals.  Do you know that? 
MS K:   I do not know what it is either. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“There 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
- 
the 
affidavit 
continues, a double dipping of funds, as members 
of the Toxicology Unit reported to the Directorate 
for Presidential Security Support for their travelling 
funds, 
subsistence 
and 
travel 
allowance 
and 
accommodation costs, while funds were also paid to 
Project Khusela as part of the CDSO operational 
20 
expenditure.” 
Is that a correct statement of facts? 
MS K:   That is how it appears based on the information 
that we gathered. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Does 
that 
include 
written 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 139 of 159 
 
information or documentary information? 
MS K:   The documentary information shows that people 
were taking TA’s directly for Project Khusela but at the 
same time, the people that are working under toxicology, 
saying they were working, they were reporting to the PSS.  
However, whoever was leading PSS says that unit never 
reported to them.  
So that is why we asked, there was - we were faced 
with this I think we had to analyse whether were they 
travelling under PSS or were they – and getting money in 
10 
that regard.  But or what we are sure of is that there were 
times that were taken directly for Project Khusela and 
when the settlements were done for those TA’s they 
attached receipts you know for travel and whatever by the 
Toxicology Unit, so that is why we – it is not actually clear. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do I understand you correctly that 
operatives within that unit drew money both under the head 
Project Khusela and under the head Toxicology Unit? 
MS K:   That is the suspicion, that is why we are saying it 
appears. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, thank you for that. 
MS K:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“The leader of the Toxicology Unit who was one of 
the 
trained 
toxicologists 
indicated 
to 
the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 140 of 159 
 
investigation team that she had used her own 
business entity Remix which is a pseudonym which 
had been established in 2007 as a special purpose 
vehicle for receiving and dispersing operational funds 
from the SSA for this project.” 
Is that a correct statement of fact that you were told that? 
MS K:  It is not entirely accurate.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Could you just... 
MS K:  My understanding is that – my understanding is that 
Remix had been established in 2007 independent of the 
10 
SSA.  So the person indicated that their company was an 
environmental kind of company and later on when they – 
because they were get – they were receiving the R1.8 million 
a month cash from SO Operatives they felt that it was too 
much to handle that money in cash so the owner of the 
company offered Ambassador Thulane Dlomo that they can 
use her company so – to disperse these funds – these funds.  
So that is the situation so I think it is not completely 
accurate the way it is put there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Paragraph 5.12 reads: 
20 
“Members 
of 
the 
Toxicology 
Unit 
were 
deployed in line with the other Presidential 
Security Support Services such as technical, 
surveillance counter-measures, PSCM to all 
areas that the President would be exposed to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 141 of 159 
 
both internationally and domestically.  They 
were 
responsible 
for 
checking 
rooms, 
kitchens and dining spaces that would be 
occupied 
by 
the 
President 
but 
not 
the 
Presidential 
aircraft. 
 
In 
one 
document 
Ambassador Dlomo is cited as a donor to the 
establishment of the Toxicology Units and 
referred to as Chief.” 
 
Is that a correct record of what you were told or what 
the investigation established? 
10 
MS K:  The investigation was – the investigation team was 
informed by one of the Toxicologists that they never checked 
the Presidential aircraft.  So that one – that part is correct.   
 
The second part which refers to in one document 
Ambassador Dlomo is cited as a donor to the establishment 
of the Toxicology Unit and referred to as Chief that is not 
completely accurate. 
 
He was – they – he was referred to as Chief Thulane 
Dlomo in documents where there was sort like an agreement 
with that foreign international development agency that we 
20 
spoke about earlier.  So he appeared there as a co-sponsor 
for the project.  Not necessarily for a donor for the 
establishment of the Toxicology Unit.   
 
I hope I am making sense. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes thank you.  If we can go then to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 142 of 159 
 
paragraph 5.13 the allegations or the statements set out in 
this paragraph are important so I will deal with them 
sentence by sentence.  The first sentence reads: 
“However 
the 
actual 
purpose 
of 
the 
Toxicology 
Unit 
is 
questionable 
and 
it 
appears to have had little impact since its 
establishment in 2012.” 
 
Let 
me 
continue 
because 
that 
sentence 
really 
foreshadows what is to come.   
“Notwithstanding the specialised training and 
10 
considerable resources at its disposal the 
Toxicology Unit failed to detect or prevent 
the alleged poisoning of the former President 
in 2014.” 
 
Thus far what do you say about the contents of that 
paragraph please? 
MS K:  I would be more comfortable with the paragraph if the 
– the first sentence – the first sentence is talking about 
having little impact since its establishment in 2012. I think 
there needs to be a qualifier there because we should say 
20 
the Toxicology Unit under the – the umbrella of CDSO 
because ultimately there is still a Toxicology Unit within SSA 
but it is not necessarily linked to these activities. 
 
So in my view if we saying it appears to have had 
little impact since its establishment in 2012 it would then be 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 143 of 159 
 
misinterpreted to mean that we are saying the legitimate unit 
now that is under Counter Intelligence has not been 
affective.  So I am not in a position to say that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So do I understand you correctly Ms 
K to say that there is what you termed a legitimate 
Toxicology Unit within the SSA and the Toxicology Unit we 
referring here was another unit under the CDSO.   Is that 
correct? 
MS K:  Yes that is the one that we are talking about under – 
under CDSO.  However some of the members including the 
10 
person 
that 
we 
interviewed 
who 
was 
recruited 
and 
polygraphed by these foreign people from a foreign country 
was ultimately absorbed into the Toxicology Unit that exists 
now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  But if one qualifies the first 
sentence by referring to the Toxicology Unit established 
under the CDSO are you comfortable with the correctness of 
that statement? 
MS K:  Yes I will be comfortable with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and the second sentence? 
20 
MS K:  I agree with that – that you would have expected that 
they would have detected – especially because there was no 
many – so much resources that were dedicated to protecting 
the President this would include the VIP Protection, the 
Toxicology Unit, the guarding of the plane, all of it by SSA.  
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 144 of 159 
 
So you would expect that at least you could detect that – the 
poison so I do agree with that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And although on the face of it it 
may seem to be a light hearted statement.  It is actually on 
careful examination quite serious.  The next sentence reads: 
“Indeed during an interview with the person 
employed by the Toxicology Unit it was 
indicated that in all the years that they had 
serviced the former President the only threat 
that had been detected was expired cold 
10 
drinks.” 
MS K:  Yes she did indicate that to us and ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You deal anywhere with the budget 
that was allocated to this Toxicology Unit.  If not it is extra 
evidence and we should perhaps deal with it elsewhere. 
MS K:  Kindly repeat that Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The budget that was allocated. 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To the Toxicology Unit I do not think 
we deal with it in – or sorry I do not think Mr Y deals with it 
20 
in this affidavit.  Am I correct and it would not necessarily… 
MS K:  I think it is – I think it is dealt with under the – the 
item where we talk about contracts.  The contract with 
Remix. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so it is relevant to this point 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 145 of 159 
 
that a significant amount of money appears to have been 
spent on this unit.  What amount was spent? 
MS K:  It was R1.8 million cash per month. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The affidavit continues: 
“The failure to detect the poisoning of a 
sitting 
President 
was 
either 
a 
major 
intelligence failure by a specialised unit that 
had been trained and resourced for the sole 
purpose or exposes the Toxicology Unit as a 
structure used to siphon funds out of the SSA 
10 
and 
or 
use 
such 
funds 
for 
other 
non-
disclosed purposes.” 
 
That comment at least as far as its content is 
concerned is very fairly clear, do you have any comment? 
MS K:  No except that I agree with the statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us go on then to the 
protection of the Presidential aircraft.  Paragraph 5.14 reads: 
“In November 2014 Ambassador Dlomo by 
then 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
Counter 
Intelligence 
instituted 
a 
project 
for 
the 
20 
protection of the Presidential aircraft.  The 
rationale for the project according to witness 
accounts was that Ambassador Dlomo was 
made aware that pilots and crew members 
were bringing in unauthorised individuals to 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 146 of 159 
 
sleep in the aircraft.” 
 
One would have thought that there were other ways 
to deal with it but let me not go there.  What do you say 
about those first two sentences? 
MS K:  I think this is a correct reflection because we 
gathered this from – from an interview we had with a person 
who was very key in this project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The affidavit – the affidavit in 
paragraph 5.1.4 continues to read: 
“No formal threat and risk assessment on the 
10 
alleged concerns form the basis of the 
project.” 
 
Is that a correct statement as far as you are 
concerned? 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Continues to read: 
“Individuals selected for the project had no 
training or knowledge of aviation matters yet 
they accepted and carried duties to guard the 
Presidential 
plane 
and 
helicopter. 
 This 
20 
mandate was based on a verbal briefing from 
Ambassador Dlomo on a purported threat.” 
 
You agree with those statements? 
MS K:  I do because this is their – an account from a person 
that was involved in that space. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 147 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MS K:  And they did say they were – they never got any 
training. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  5.15 I will read the whole paragraph 
because it can be read as a single concept. 
“Although Ambassador.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Pretorius.  I think Counsel 
for SSA has something to say. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  I am sorry Chair to take my learned 
friend a bit back on the paragraphs 5.9 that deals with the 
10 
Toxicology Unit.  It was put to the witness Chair whether… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL: I think she -  it is under the heading 
5.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  5.9? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Up to 5.13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Towards the end of 5.13 my learned 
20 
friend asked the witness whether or rather how much was 
spent on the Toxicology Unit?  Her response was R1.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is CDSO. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  No, no specifically how much was 
spent on that unit – Toxicology Unit. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 148 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Toxicology. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Not CDSO and her response was 
R1.8 million.  Now given the fact that the Toxicology Unit 
was part as alleged to say the least for now was part of the 
CDSO is that R1.8 a collective amount of is it specific for the 
Toxicology Unit?  That is the clarity that we seek Chair.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you ask whether it relates to the 
Toxicology Unit only? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought it would have been clear that it is 
the unit but I may have misunderstood.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well so may have I misunderstood.  I 
thought the question was clear that the expenditure in 
relation to the Toxicology Unit firstly is dealt with elsewhere 
in this series of documents.  But secondly was R1.8 million 
per month for the Toxicology Unit.  Do I understand the 
position correctly Ms K? 
MS K:  I think I understand where the question comes from 
because it is – the R1.8 million that was taken per month 
20 
was for Project Kusile which was focussing on the Toxicology 
segment of the work of the CDSO.  So as a project so I am 
not sure whether the entire unit utilised only that amount. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So it could have been more do I 
understand you to say? 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 149 of 159 
 
MS K:  Yes it could have been more.  Because the R1.8 
million per month that I am talking about only refers to Kusile 
which is purported to be dealing with this area exactly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we may proceed then to paragraph 
5.15.  You have dealt with 5.14 I understand is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  5.15 reads: 
“Although Ambassador Dlomo selected the 
10 
SSA 
members 
that 
were 
tasked 
with 
protecting 
the 
Presidential 
aircraft 
the 
project was formerly allocated to the Chief 
Directorate Internal Security.” 
And involved in that Chief Directorate was a person with a 
pseudonym ‘Johan’ and I am not going to mention his 
position either.  But the affidavit continues at paragraph 5.15 
to read? 
“It is unclear why this project which like the 
Presidential 
Security 
Support 
Service 
20 
encroached 
upon 
the 
SAPS 
mandate 
to 
render Presidential protection of this kind 
was set up within CDIS.  It is reasonable to 
infer that this was done to deliberately 
remove all things related to the protection of 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 150 of 159 
 
the former President out of the realm of the 
SAPS and to instead place them under the 
control of Ambassador Dlomo.” 
 
Is 
that 
a 
fair 
representation 
and 
a 
correct 
representation of the facts in the first part of the affidavit 
and secondly the inference that is drawn.  Do you agree with 
that inference? 
MS K:  In my – in my understanding is that the guarding of 
the Presidential aircraft falls within the mandate of SANDF.  
So as much as – so I am not sure if this is completely 
10 
correct.  Maybe it is just a typo or maybe I do not understand 
this completely.  But otherwise the essence of what is 
indicated in this paragraph I agree with. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right I think the paragraph is – it 
tends to convey that the Presidential Security Support 
Service encroached upon the SAPS mandate to protect the 
President and the project in relation to Presidential aircraft 
also encroached on the SAPS mandate to protect the 
President.  Do you read it in the same way and so is it 
correct? 
20 
MS K:  No, no that is inaccurate Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think what – I think what Ms K – Ms K. 
MS K:  The – this is under – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms K.  Ms K.  I think what Ms K was saying 
previously Mr Pretorius she seemed to be saying as far as 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 151 of 159 
 
the guarding of the Presidential aircraft is concerned one 
cannot say that this unit was removing or interfering with the 
mandate of the SAPS because that is as far as she knows 
supposed to be within the mandate of SANDF.  I think that is 
the only qualification she sought to make.  So if I am correct 
in understanding her in that way she sought to say insofar as 
this unit sought to guard the Presidential aircraft they may 
have been or they were encroaching of SANDF’s mandate 
but in terms of the rest they were encroaching on SAPS 
mandate. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I – I understood that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms K is that correct? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms K is my understanding correct of your 
evidence? 
MS K:  I think so.  I think so Chair.  But I want to also clarify 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay clarify further. 
MS K:  That the intrusion of Presidential Security Support 
Services there it is more like we say similarly but it is 
20 
actually not PSS that provided that service of guarding the 
Presidential aircraft.  It is actually another Chief Directorate 
– Chief Directorate Internal Security.  I just need that to be 
understood. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 152 of 159 
 
MS K:  So it is not PSS. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So for that reason Chair I was going 
a little slower because there are a number of concepts now 
that are being… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Included in a single sentence so let 
us just try and clarify that.  I think it is clear but just for the 
sake the record let us just clear it up.   
 
The aircraft protection project resided under CDIS, 
am I correct? 
10 
MS K:  Yes you are correct Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
It 
would 
have 
duplicated 
or 
encroached upon the mandate of the SANDF, is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes in my understanding. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The Presidential Security 
Support Service resided elsewhere Chief Directorate Special 
Operations, is that correct? 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it would have encroached on the 
SAPS mandate to render Presidential protection, is that 
20 
correct? 
MS K:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so all those propositions are 
wrapped up in that sentence but I think we have clarified 
with the assistance of Chair. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 153 of 159 
 
MS K:  But I – sorry Chair.  I think it is important to note that 
both CDIS and CDSO fall under Counter Intelligence which 
would have made both units report to Ambassador Thulani 
Dlomo as the DDG Counter Intelligence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright that is useful to understand 
thank you.  So the next sentence it is reasonable to infer 
that this was done to deliberately remove all things related 
to the protection of the former President out of the realm of 
SAPS, SAPS and to instead place them under the control of 
Ambassador Dlomo in the various units under his control.  Is 
10 
that a fair representation of an inference that can be drawn? 
MS K:  I partially agree mainly because one of the people 
that we interviewed did indicate that they think that was the 
aim to take over everything you know around the President.  
Particularly the protection everything that had to do with the 
protection. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so we have the facts on the one 
hand.  We have what you were told in the course of your 
investigation on the other and we have the conclusion drawn 
by Mr Y and your comments.  Is that a fair summary? 
20 
MS K:  Yes. Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us go to 5.16 if we may?   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius I just want to clear 
this.  Is it correct Ms K that all your knowledge in regard to 
these – these matters that you are sharing with the 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 154 of 159 
 
commission 
is 
based 
on 
what 
you 
found 
during 
the 
investigations either by way of documentation or what you 
were told by people that you interviewed in the course of 
conducting the Project Veza investigation? 
MS K:  That is hundred percent correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that the – the – there would not – 
you would not have personal knowledge – you would not 
have personally witnessed the events as they occurred as 
such that your investigations – your investigation that is 
Project Veza investigation re – may have revealed evidence 
10 
that certain events or certain things did happen. 
MS K:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps one should add to that your 
personal knowledge of the structures and personnel within 
SSA. 
MS K:  Pardon please repeat that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You also have personal knowledge of 
the SSA organisation it structures and the persons of the 
persons within the SSA, is that correct? 
20 
MS K:  I did not get the first part of that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think what Mr Pretorius is saying is 
you do personally know certain people within the SSA that 
we are talking about here. 
MS K:  Personally. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 155 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will know that. 
MS K:  It is people that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes people that you know as having been 
at SSA at a particular time. 
MS K:  Not everybody most of the people that we – are 
implicated and we are in – we are investigating I actually 
met as we were scheduling interviews.  So at the beginning I 
was just dealing with names of people.  So I can say that 99. 
Maybe 9% of the people that are implicated in this project 
were not known to me.  So as – except maybe people that 
10 
would be in senior positions where you know that who is the 
DG, who is the you know those prominent positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS K:  However the other people I basically met them during 
this investigation for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right yes that was the point I was 
making. 
 
Perhaps 
should 
have 
been 
qualified 
more 
accurately Ms K that there are people who occupy positions 
within the SSA and you would have direct knowledge of who 
20 
they were and the positions they occupied, am I correct?  
Certain people. 
MS K:  Yes.  And to also establish what positions people 
held most of our interviews started with just the beginning 
when a person joined the SSA what positions they held 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 156 of 159 
 
throughout.  So that also gave the team some kind of 
background in terms of where the person been, who they 
may have been exposed to and the kind of experience they 
may have had. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right it may help us to understand 
the scope of the investigation more accurately if we asked 
you over what period of time did the investigation last or for 
what period of time has it already been in existence I should 
say? 
MS K:  The investigation? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Veza. 
MS K:  As indicated in the introduction there was Project 
Momentum which started in June 2018 so in December that 
is when Veza was established to reinforce what Momentum 
had already begun.  So that was December 2018 that I was – 
we were all – we were appointed but some of the members 
that were in Momentum continued in this. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right but Veza at least has been 
going on-going for two years? 
MS K:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  More than two years, right.   
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And during that time if you could give 
the 
Chair 
an 
indication 
of 
the 
number 
of 
people 
approximately not precisely you would have interviewed? 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 157 of 159 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on let us take an adjournment. I see 
it is four o’clock and let us talk about how far we will go.  I 
am prepared to sit longer.  What is your – how does the plan 
look like in terms of tomorrow and …; 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we are not going to finish 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we should do as much as we can I 
would imagine. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We should do as much as we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I must confess my stamina does not 
match yours so I would like to minute it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you are standing and I am seated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is true there is a mitigating 
circumstance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so in terms of Ms K giving 
evidence – her evidence spilling over to tomorrow in terms of 
the legal team did that fit within the plan or? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it does fit within the plan Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she is not pushing out a witness. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I would prefer if we could – well it all 
depends on Ms K of course.  Perhaps we should consult her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 158 of 159 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I would not – because I have still 
got to prepare. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I would prefer if we could stop 
sometime around five o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine particularly if the plan 
for tomorrow was – it is not like there is a witness who will 
be pushed out. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, no there is no witness to be 
pushed out. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no that is fine.  Well I think then I 
would be guided by your assessment even whether we 
should go up to five. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I think Chair it would if I may ask 
that we adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then ja and then continue 
tomorrow. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continues – start at ten tomorrow? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At ten. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We start at ten.  Okay no that is fine.  
Maybe we should do that then – what I am – what I am not 
sure about and do you think we would finish tomorrow 
because I am looking at how much we have covered in terms 
of Mr Y’s affidavit. We have done 25 of 80 pages.  Unless 
27 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 332 
 
Page 159 of 159 
 
that suggests we might not reach. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well barring any intervention from my 
right Chair we should get much further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In fact virtually finish tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But it is not certain we may have to 
go to Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  No that is fine.  So Ms K you 
are following the discussion? 
10 
MS K:  Yes I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you have no problem? 
MS K:  No I do not have any problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think we will then adjourn now and 
then we resume tomorrow at ten o’clock. 
MS K:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you - you will come back to your place 
from where you are giving evidence tomorrow at ten Ms K. 
MS K:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We – we are going to adjourn then 
20 
until tomorrow at ten.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 28 JANUARY 2021
