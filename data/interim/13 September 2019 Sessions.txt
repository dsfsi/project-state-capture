PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 13 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good morning Chair. Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I beg leave to hand up the properly 
paginated bundle for this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  That will – may it be 
10 
entered into the record as Exhibit CC36? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file containing the statement of Mr Garth 
Strachan will be marked Exhibit CC36. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Before we deal with the 
witness Chair just if I may just hand up a letter that has been received 
from the office of the State Attorney in relation to the witness Minister 
Ndlodlo that was going to come this morning.  Minister Ndlodlo is 
represented Chair.  I would like Ms Gcilishe to put herself on record.  
Thank you. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:   Good morning Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  I am Advocate Unathi Gcilishe I appear with 
Advocate Terry Motau SC.  Advocate Motau is unfortunately not able to 
come this morning; he does send his apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 3 of 33 
 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Chair we were brought on brief yesterday in 
this matter and we seek time to consult with our client for the purposes 
of assisting with the representations that will be made.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  It has been agreed with the evidence leaders 
that we be granted a two week extension for the making of the 
necessary submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well from what I have been told what the 
Minister is supposed to canvass something that appears to be quit 
narrow.  I am wondering why two weeks is necessary when from what I 
10 
have been told she would have been ready today except maybe some 
commitments and so on.  Do you really need two weeks? 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Chair we have not yet consulted with the 
Minister that is being arranged for the upcoming week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Therefore I cannot really state… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot say? 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you cannot say whether you need two weeks or 
one week? 
20 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  No we – we … we think two weeks is 
reasonable in the circumstances Chair but I cannot say anything less 
than that would be sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long has the Minister known about it?  She has 
known for some time. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 4 of 33 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair there was a point when the Minister 
was indisposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think that – that period then we felt that 
we needed to give her enough time to recuperate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  After that yes.  And – but he – she has 
been very cooperative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And we – in fact she has 
10 
actually sent the commission her draft. Every time she worked on a 
draft she sent those to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she has been working on certain files? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She has yes, yes Chair.  We have those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which means it should be easier to finalise an 
existing draft. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Unless she wants to extend her 
scope Chair and deal with other matters.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am inclined to rather give you a week and if you 
really get into difficulties in complying then you approach and then I 
can consider giving you more, is that fine? 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  That will be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so… 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 5 of 33 
 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us say you will try and – or you file or finish her 
statement or affidavit on or before Friday next week. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  That will be Friday the 20 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you really run into difficulties then you approach 
the commission. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Okay we will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV UNATHI GCILISHE:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Chair the 
10 
witness this morning is Mr Strachan the evidence of this witness… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am sorry this letter from the State Attorney. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it anything that I need to know about now or I can 
read later? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair no you may read it later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair this witness’ evidence is 
20 
relevant in the sense that SABS Chair would recall has been mentioned 
as being one of the stakeholders by Mr Jansen Van Vuuren and also 
yesterday’s witness Mr Roy Kruger that SABS South African Bureau of 
Standards was – is part of the stakeholders that had to work on the set-
top boxes.  His evidence also becomes relevant because the next 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 6 of 33 
 
witness that we are going to call when the Chair allocates us additional 
time Doctor Boloka actually deals with local content and those are 
matters that SABS deals with.  For that reason therefore Chair I would 
like you to receive his evidence before that of Doctor Boloka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He be – that the oath be administered or affirmation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes may he be sworn in?  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your name and full names for the record? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Garth [indistinct] Strachan. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
today will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so 
please say, I truly affirm? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
Mr Strachan you have a document that is placed in a presentation file 
20 
in front of you and it is marked Exhibit CC36, do you have that? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I do [indistinct]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes if you page through there you will – on 
page 1 of that their names Garth Strachan is that your statement? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 7 of 33 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry your microphone is off.  I beg 
your pardon. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Counsellor. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No you answer to the Chairperson. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I beg your pardon.  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then if you could please 
turn to page 5 of that statement.  Is that your signature that appears on 
that page? 
10 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  It is Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Did you make this – are the contents 
of this statement first true and correct? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you made this statement at the 
request of the investigators of the commission? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Could you just for the 
record place your qualifications please? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I hold a Master’s Degree in Science and 
20 
Public Policy from London University. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If you could just try and speak up a 
little.  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Sure. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or maybe just – ja – that should work 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 8 of 33 
 
thank you.  You are currently occupying a position as acting Chief 
Executive Officer of the South African Bureau of Standards, is that 
correct? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that is normally referred to as SABS? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  When were you appointed to this 
position? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  In June 2018. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 2018? 
10 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just tell the Chairperson 
what was SABS role – you do make that point in your statement that 
you are appointed after the active role of SABS had taken place.  So 
your evidence is based on the documentation and the evidence that you 
have received from those who are responsible for that role, is that 
correct? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Now could you just tell the 
Chairperson what is the role of SABS generally?  What does SABS do? 
20 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson the South African Bureau of 
Standards is the only national standard body in South Africa mandated 
in terms of legislation the standards acts which are set out in my 
statement in order to undertake broadly speaking full functions.  That is 
the setting of South African National Standards which are either 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 9 of 33 
 
standards which are home grown or which amended from the 
international standards organisation which we are a member of.  SABS 
also undertakes certification to a standard which is a process at the 
end of which any company which requires certification is issued with a 
certificate and then the company being in possession of a certificate is 
able to place what is called a SABS mark on its product which ensures 
that that company – that product purchased by any member of public 
has been certified to a national standard which can be a product or a 
systems certification. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  And then SABS operates testing laboratories 
which test in a variety of ways but in this context they test to a 
certification.  So if a product requires testing for any characteristic 
then that product is tested by our laboratories.  And the fourth element 
of the SABS legislative mandate is to undertake local content 
verification on behalf of the government of South Africa for which SABS 
has established the requisite capacity and accreditation to undertake 
local content verification to a standard.  In this case the standard is 
SANS, SANS 1286. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ma’am that would be a summary of the 
legislative mandate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Just to remind you that you answer 
to the Chairperson. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I beg your pardon. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 10 of 33 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Yes.  Could you just – let 
us just deal with the local content aspect?  So what is it that SABS 
usually looks for when it says that I am going to test for local content, 
what is it looking for? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  So if I may Chairperson go back slightly.  The 
Department of Trade and Industry under the Preferential Public 
Procurement Finance Act and its regulations designates products for 
local content to a threshold depending upon the capabilities of South 
African industry to produce any product.  In some cases it might be 100 
in other cases it might be 30%.  And the National Treasury issues an 
10 
instruction note to all South African entities when they are undertaking 
tender and procurement processes to ensure that those designated 
products are procured in keeping with the National Treasury Instruction 
Note, the DTI designation and the SANS 1286.  SABS is then requested 
to undertake local content verification of the companies which would be 
providing goods to the state and that local content verification is 
undertaken to SANS 1286. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  In some instances a standard can be 
referenced in a piece of regulation and in that case the state is – must 
20 
ensure that where a standard is referenced in the regulation any 
product provided to the state has – carries a SABS mark.  In other 
words it has been audited and certified to a local content threshold. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And insofar as the set-top 
boxes is it correct that even with those SABS was tasked with the 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 11 of 33 
 
responsibility to certify those set-up boxes that are going to be 
supplied to the various households? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ma’am if I may SABS in an MOU with the 
Department of Communications and the Department of Trade and 
Industry was mandated as I set out in my statement to undertake 
amongst others to undertake conformity assessment of set-top boxes.  
And it established a laboratory and the capabilities to do that.  We do 
not as a 3B Public entity carry a compliance mandate.  In other words 
we cannot say to Department X you have to come and test or the 
companies that are supplying you have to come and test.  We carry out 
10 
the mandate of conformity assessment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  And my understanding is that the policy as 
originally conceived referenced the SANS 862. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And I am aware of the 
fact that today you are not going to be talking to the specifics because 
a technocrat from your department will come and deal with matters that 
relate to which companies were tested for this and which companies 
were compliant and all of those.  That type of details is going to come 
later.  Am I right? 
20 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ye Ma’am I can speak to some of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  But a detailed technical evidence would need 
to be advanced by an expert in the field. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 12 of 33 
 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Which might be an auditor for certification or 
a laboratory engineer Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Then you deal with the 
monies and the setting up of the laboratory in paragraph 4 of you state 
– in paragraph 4 of your statement and you say you were allocated by 
the Department of Communications an amount of R26.3 million. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson the original memorandum of 
understanding between the Department of Trade and Industry which is 
the SABS shareholder, the Department of Communications and the 
SABS agreed upon a sum of R30 million to be transferred to the SABS 
10 
by the Department of Communication.  In order to establish the 
capacity in other words the equipment and the capability in other words 
the requisite technical staff to be able to test to the requirements of the 
SANS 862 and SABS did that.  SABS never spent – never received R30 
million it received R26 million.  Nevertheless the requisite capacity and 
capability was establish in order to test set-top boxes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  To the SANS 862. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And just as a – just to clarity on 
what – if one says this – one sees a particular set-top box which is 
20 
something that we are going to deal with later and that person sees it 
and that person wants to see whether that is SABS approved you – the 
team has just put up some pictures to show what your SANS approval 
would look like.  Could you just put up that demonstration please?  
Thank you.  Is that – sorry Chair could you – that – is that a – sorry. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 13 of 33 
 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ma’am – Chairperson that is not a SABS 
mark. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just that one.  Would that be a SABS one? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  That is unequivocally not a SABS mark, a 
SABS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I know how… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes how it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why this is a SABS mark look like – looks like. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure that is not one – the one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  Oh yes Chair but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean one sees it in all – in many products. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes it does. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just have a look at the one that 
will have your mark please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair it is going to be… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is going to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not know if we need to see it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is going to take a second Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because… 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 14 of 33 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh but if you do not need to see it then 
there is no need. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes unless we anticipate that there will be some 
disputes about whether certain boxes were SABS approved. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the point.  That is the point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they will be some dispute? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  There is that – that is the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there will be some dispute about whether … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They were approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A particular mark is a SABS mark. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then that is fine let us see it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  The second one?  Is it not coming 
through?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair if it is a problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give them a chance to get it while you – we 
continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Well – we continue okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they must look for it and so when you go back to 
them they must have it ready. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 15 of 33 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Okay.  So then you – in 
paragraph 4 you also deal with the fact that the laboratory itself it is 
now losing staff and it is underutilised and could you just tell the 
Chairperson what could be the reasons for this lack of enthusiasm to 
actually utilise and use the laboratory and what would the result would 
be in terms of products maybe that do not go through the laboratory 
process. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson a laboratory housed at the SABS 
tests to certification in other words if it is – if there is a product which 
is being certified in an audit process that certification can include 
10 
testing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there has got to be testing in order to have 
certification? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Not in every instance but certainly in many 
products. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  If I may give an example Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  A bottle of water – the company would seek a 
certification for the bottle of water and the durability of the glass or the 
20 
characteristics of the bottle or the chemical composition of the water 
could be tested to the certificate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  But there is another form of testing which is 
customer specific requirement testing Chairperson where a customer 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 16 of 33 
 
may bring testing – bring a product for testing including for example to 
be able to meet the conformity requirements for the exporting of a 
product into another jurisdiction.  So the laboratories do not only test 
to certification they would test for other reasons.  But to specifically 
answer the question a laboratory which in this case costs R26 million to 
set up and which incurs recurring operational costs in the form of 
maintenance the payment of the staff and so on and so forth depends 
upon the volume of testing which passes through and I can say that 
there has been a very low volume of testing in the laboratory 
specifically set up for set-top boxes and in fact we have incurred 
10 
significant losses which we estimate in the time available to be R1.8 
million and the viability of the laboratory is in serious question and the 
administrators are contemplating closing the laboratory since it is not 
viable and in the total revenue of the institution only a small fraction is 
from the public fiscus the bulk of the revenue arises from a commercial 
payments for standards certification, laboratory services and local 
content verification and consignment inspection. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If a product carries the – made in 
South Africa stamp or manufactured in South Africa stamp is that an 
equivalent of what you would expect to be – to have at least gone 
20 
through the SABS standards testing? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Oh no Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Made in South Africa is unequivocally not a 
SABS mark.  Remember that a SABS mark is a certification to a 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 17 of 33 
 
particular standard whether it is a standard in this case 862. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Or a local content standard which is 1286. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Just what I had said I – 
relating to the question that I – if that product has got Made In South 
Africa and you do not see it – or do you see a SABS mark there? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson there is definitely no SABS mark 
on that display. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then lastly could you 
just… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In fact there is not even an imitation of a SABS mark, 
is that right? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then in the next one 
we just showed that where it is – it has the SABS approval would it 
come up in that way? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson the middle stamp is the SABS 
mark and it is the customer view on whether or not that product has 
been certified by SABS.  The manufacturer is in possession of the 
20 
certificate which enables the manufacturer to stamp the mark on the 
product for sale. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Or distribution. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 18 of 33 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that sounds strange to me.  I hope I 
understand it correctly.  The South African Bureau of Standards is the 
authority that by law has been given power to certify goods and 
products to meet certain standards – to be meeting certain standards.  
It sets the standard as well is it not?  Set the standards and then 
certifies that those goods or products – whether those goods or 
products meet that standard.  Is that right? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So when I see South African Bureau of 
Standards mark on any product then I have the comfort that because I 
10 
have high regard for the South African Bureau of Standards and 
knowing that it is an authority that performs this certification job in 
terms of the law I have the comfort that then the product must be fine. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson that is absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Please bear in mind that certification or 
certificates expire. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  After three years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  And therefore companies are required to 
renew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  The permit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 19 of 33 
 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  The certification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  And then auditors or re-audit the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Where there is testing required there might 
be testing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  And they are re-issued a permit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Which allows that company to stamp the 
10 
product with the SABS mark which is a mark obviously of high quality to 
the requisite standard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  A standard would differ in by product and 
sector of the economy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But my understanding was that only the South 
African Bureau of Standards can put that stamp on a product and that 
when I see that mark I say it is the South African Bureau of Standards 
20 
who have satisfied themselves that this product has got all the 
[indistinct] and the fissures that are required or this product when it 
meets the required standard.  Now from what you say – you have said I 
am getting the impression that somebody else – a company, an entity 
can put the stamp, the SABS mark on its product on the basis that in 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 20 of 33 
 
their view that product meets the SABS standard.  Did I misunderstand 
something? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chair if I failed to communicate that 
adequately I apologise.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I have misunderstood? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  No company can voluntarily use a SABS mark 
unless they have been through a certification process and being issued 
with a certification which allows them to use the SABS mark.  We must 
of course be mindful that there might be certain you know cases where 
companies may use the SABS mark illegally because they have not 
10 
renewed the permit in which case SABS conducts market surveillance 
and if there is a company that is using the SABS mark illegally we 
would approach the company and the courts to ensure that the illegal 
use of a SABS mark is - is stopped immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us - let us go back to the example of that bottle in 
front of you.  If I am - if I manufacture a bottle and I bring it to SABS 
and ask SABS to certify it and put its mark on it.  I do not know whether 
they put its mark or they authorise me to put their mark on it but 
basically I go through that process and everything goes well. 
Is the position that the way this works is that once you have 
20 
so to speak certified a sample then you give me authority or permission 
to go and manufacture other - other bottles of the same type and I 
undertake to manufacture them in the same way as the one that you 
have seen and make sure that it has got same things that it - the one I 
gave to you had and then if I am satisfied that I have made it in that 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 21 of 33 
 
way then I do not take it back to you.  I put your mark on it.  Is that 
how it works? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson broadly speaking correctly but if 
I may add in order to secure certification of the bottle in our example 
you would have to purchase the required standard.  In other words and 
developed in a process involving industry, industry experts, academic, 
scientists in what is called technical committees which either develop 
according to South African conditions a home grown standard or they 
adapt 
an 
international 
standard 
belonging 
to 
the 
International 
Standards Organisation but a manufacturing company would purchase a 
10 
standard. 
The test - the certification process is carried out by SABS 
which is suitably qualified and accredited auditors going to the plant or 
factory which produces the bottle of water to ensure that the production 
accords with the requirements set out in the standard.  If the product in 
this case the bottle of water in the standard also has to have certain of 
its characteristics tested then the SABS laboratories would test to the 
requirements of the certification. 
At the end of the auditing process the compliance report 
would go to an authority within the SABS which ensures that due and 
20 
process has been followed and the company is issued with a certificate 
which enables it to stamp its products for the duration of that permit 
that certificate which is three years with a SABS mark. 
At the end of the three years in order to ensure that there is 
conformity assessment is robust that the company in this case would 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 22 of 33 
 
not have to repurchase the standard but they have to renew the permit 
and undertake for the next phase of the ownership of the SABS mark 
another certification which may involve auditing and testifying. 
So this is not a situation where you get a certificate and for 
the rest of time you can use the SABS mark.  It is a very specific set 
down internationally process that you have to follow.  SABS is then 
accredited by the South African National Accreditation System an 
agency of Government and in many cases international accreditation 
authorities that come to SABS and check that our systems our auditing 
our testing and the enter process meets rigorous requirements of the 
10 
certification process.  I hope Chairperson that answers the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe let us take it further.  I am trying to 
understand to what extent the system is open to abuse. From what - I 
think for some reason I took it that each bottle or product that has got a 
SABS mark has gone through a SABS certification or testing process 
but on - on reflection probably that is impossible to - to happen. 
I mean millions of bottles could not have all gone through 
SABS process.  So - so - but if once I give you that bottle and I say I 
intend manufacturing bottles exactly like this and when I sell them I 
want them to carry a SABS mark.  It seems to me from what you are 
20 
telling me that certain things must be in place. 
Laboratory and you talk about academics and the industry 
blah, blah, blah.  You - you would then after testing provide the 
certification but the certification gives the manufacturer in this case of 
the bottle the right to put the SABS mark on all its bottles.  I assume 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 23 of 33 
 
that are made like that one and then when - when they are sold they 
are sold with - with that mark. 
Now I am wondering whether if as the business person I am 
supposed to do that.  Obviously one should assume that I will have an 
interest to make sure that my business has a good name in the market.  
That these bottles which carry the SABS mark are really of quality and - 
and I do not have a situation where maybe some are not really up to 
that standard - the SABS standard but I am wondering whether if I am 
established. 
Everybody knows that my bottles have got the SABS mark but 
10 
I run out of ingredients that must be used in order to be - manufacture 
this bottle.  Instead of using five that are required.  I use three but I do 
not want to send out to the market bottles from my company that do not 
have the SABS mark because my company is known to only sell bottles 
with the SABS mark and then I - whether I - I can put the SABS mark. 
I can cheat in other words cheat the - the public.  Put the 
SAPS mark.  Even though this batch of bottles maybe do not actually 
meet that standard.  Whether the - the system allows that to happen or 
not. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Chairperson if I may answer in this particular 
20 
manner.  Remember that a SABS mark is a voluntary process.  It is a 
mark of conformances to a particular standard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  If a standard is referenced in a piece of 
legislation because there are health safety and other concerns then 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 24 of 33 
 
another institution of the state the National Regulator for Compulsory 
Specifications comes into play.  They may use the testing capabilities 
at SABS or other test houses to ensure that that company and 
agricultural - agroprocessing products can apply or health and safety 
products of one kind and another and NICS is not the only regulator. 
Remember there are many other regulators.  If a standard is 
referenced in a regulation then it is absolutely critical that the National 
Regulator for Compulsory Specifications comes in - into paly and they 
have the responsibility to ensure that it is not just a question of a - a 
golden sample but that there are regular checks on the conformity of 
10 
that compulsory specification. 
If I may give you an example.  The Department of Health and 
the National Treasury purchase condoms.  The legislation and the 
tender documentation references the standard in the - in - in law and 
therefore in those instances the - the SABS mark is a mark also of 
quality which can be tested against from time to time and is tested from 
time to time but the SABS mark in itself is a - is a voluntary mark. 
Unless a procuring department or a regulatory authority says 
we are procuring from the private sector and the condition of that 
procurement is that the product must carry a SABS mark. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would not be SABS role to from time to time during 
the term of licence that it has given to a manufacturer to use a SABS 
mark.  It would not be its role to from time to time pay surprise visits to 
the manufacturer’s laboratory for example.  Just take samples.  Check 
whether there is no cheating in the sense in which I have made to say 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 25 of 33 
 
okay bottles are made in the same way that they are supposed to in 
terms of what was tested. 
So that that is the threat that a manufacturer has of being 
caught if he sends out bottles with a SABS mark which do not deserve 
to have a SABS mark. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  To the best of my knowledge Chairperson no 
but it is an area where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That somebody else might be able to talk about? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  We - we could provide further technical … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Clarity to that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  But to the best of my knowledge no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you and then in - 
as you have already testified to the obligations but maybe just to - to 
emphasise one obligation in terms of the MOU that you referred to at 
page 13 that deals with the obligations of SABS insofar as the set-top 
boxes are concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 13? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 1-3 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I beg your pardon.  Which page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  1-3 - page 1-3 on the right hand corner.  
Okay.  13, okay.  Are you there? 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 26 of 33 
 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I am not.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the red numbers on the right hand corner … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the pages. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Oh, oh okay.  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  After the yellow … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Divider. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  I beg your pardon. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then there is Clause 9 
which those obligations of the parties and then it deals with: 
“SABS shall provide the following services and then 
the feasibility study to determine full cost of setting 
up a fully accredited laboratory.  The feasibility 
study must be concluded within two months of this 
agreement’s signature.” 
That was done.  Is that correct? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you have attached that feasibility 
study as Annexure B.  It appears Chair at page - from pages 32 
onwards and then 9.1.2: 
“Testing of set-top boxes to the applicable South 
African National Standard or other specification and 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 27 of 33 
 
provide applicable test reports.” 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then: 
“Provision 
of 
discounted 
rates 
for 
local 
manufacturers wishing to be certified by SABS 
which includes product certification, SABS factory 
audits, consignment inspections and other relevant 
certification schemes as agreed by both parties.” 
And then … 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chair … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe … 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  “Audit reports and certificates 
which will be provided by SABS for applicable 
audits.” 
And then maybe those are the most relevant ones to the - to 
the discussion that you are having this morning.  Am I right? 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Yes Chairperson to the very best of my 
knowledge SABS has honoured all the obligations to the MOU signed 
between the Department of Communication, the DTI and the SABS. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The witness before you yesterday 
Mr Roy Kruger linked the manufacturing or these set-top boxes within 
the country to job creation.  Now can I ask whether the fact that now 
the factory itself is becoming - where you have to test these products is 
becoming redundant and do you have any idea of how - where the 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 28 of 33 
 
manufacturing of the set-top boxes is happening but if you do not then 
you can just tell the Chairperson. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  We do not because it is not our mandate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  It is a Department of Trade and Industry 
mandate.  I can say without fear of contradiction that local 
manufacturing is as set out in numerous Government documents 
unequivocally a generator of not only employment but it has multiple 
other economic spill overs, skills creation, supply development and so 
on and so forth. 
10 
Please bear in mind of course that a SABS mandate is to 
certify and test to a standard and we are not in a position to force a 
Government department to insist that public sector procurement is 
conformed to the standard.  That is a policy matter of Government.  We 
provide the certification and the laboratory testing capabilities which 
we did to the terms and conditions of the MOI. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  The fact that there has been so little 
certification and testing to the capacity that we established is beyond 
our remit.  I can say that three companies went for local content 
20 
verification.  Remember there is a separate standard and both - all 
three of the certificates have expired and since 2015 11 companies 
have had tests undertaken on their equipment but that is not the 
certification. 
They can come for other forms of testing.  We can provide 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 29 of 33 
 
you with detail of what they came to test for.  It maybe for example that 
they were testing for an export destination to a different standard but in 
the time available we do not have that information other than 11 
companies came and in four years that is simply not capable or that 
kind of revenue and passing through the laboratories is completely 
unsustainable for the existence of a testing facility and as I said we 
have incurred costs of 1.8 million. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have 1.6 at paragraph … 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  1.6 I beg your pardon. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 4.1.4. 
10 
MR GARTH STRACHAN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  That - 
that is the evidence from this witness.  Thank you. 
CAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much for coming to give 
evidence and to share with the Commission your knowledge of how 
SABS - of SABS role in this project.  Thank you very much.  If a need 
arises for us to ask you to come back we will ask you but thank you 
very much and you are excused.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I beg leave to hand up EXHIBIT 
CC35 which I meant to hand up.  It is - it is the SABC Policy bundle.  It 
20 
deals with the DTT Policy, the changes to the policy - the various 
policies from 2008.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want this to be admitted or not yet? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  May it be admitted so that the 
next time when we come we know it is already part of the exhibits? 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 30 of 33 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We - we have marked it policy bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing or marked SABC Policy 
bundle will be marked EXHIBIT CC35. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Chairman that with your 
leave would then bring us to the end of today’s proceedings because 
we were thinking of having two witnesses which is the one witness that 
could not attend today and we will approach Chair for another 
10 
allocation because Chair you would recall that on the very first day 
when we started we had placed various boxes of material before you. 
We have not dealt with that material.  For instance the 
evidence of Dr Boloka who is going to deal with specific contracts and 
point out the irregularities and unlawful awards of those tenders.  That 
evidence will have to come in the next session.  The evidence of 
Mr Zikode who is the Forensic Auditor for the SABC who has covered 
over a hundred investigations. 
We have - he has placed most of those before you.  those are 
the ones that were - were placed on - on the first day when we started 
20 
but we are - now he is doing a second exercise of simply selecting the 
ones that are really crucial for placing before you.  Instead of dealing 
with the hundred and - over 160 investigations and then thirdly Chair 
you would recall that the evidence of Professor Mutuvhi who came 
before you last week … 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 31 of 33 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is supposed to come back and also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dr Mutuvhi? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Fhatuwani Mutuvhi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She is supposed - he - I beg your pardon.  
He is supposed to came back and deal with the actual Auditor-
General’s findings in - relating to some of the tenders. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That evidence as well Chair we would 
request that it be allocated in the second session … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of the proceedings.  Then we have other 
witnesses that are lined up but we will provide you with a memorandum 
latest by Monday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of who those witnesses are, what are they 
going to be talking about … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But of course there is just two witnesses 
that - who are going to come and - and discuss - who have not yet 
given us statements but have being promising to give statements … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 32 of 33 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But now have changed tact.  One of them 
now seeks legal representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then we would just ask that Chair that 
those be directed to - to submit their statements by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  A certain date, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that - that is fine and to the extent that 
10 
Ms Swanepoel … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May have to be called. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There might be no need to delay too long … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Calling her … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because her evidence would cover a very narrow … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Issue, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Issue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it may well be that within the next two weeks or so 
we might consider finding a space for her … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For her. 
13 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 163 
 
Page 33 of 33 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the morning maybe from nine to 10. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  We will - we will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will need to look at that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  We are therefore going to 
adjourn the proceedings for the day but we will continue on Monday.  I 
think at Monday it is - we have one or more witnesses - to two 
witnesses for Estina if I am not mistaken. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair but I think the evidence leader 
for Estina was here this morning.  I think there might be just some … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Some changes in that line up but I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She is going to come as soon as we 
adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  We will adjourn then and resume on 
20 
Monday. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise
