Page 4 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see where you were supposed to say – to ask him 
whether he affirms you asked him whether he swears and that was the 
problem.  Okay thank you Mr Pretorius you may proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nxasana your statement in 
the bundle before you would you please go to page 14?    
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair I have got it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There you deal with the terms of 
reference which were published in the Government Gazette referred to 
in paragraph 60 of the Cassim Inquiry which was established to 
10 
investigate and report on your fitness to hold office as National Director 
of Public Prosecutions.  You recall that evidence 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I do recall Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The terms of reference are dealt 
with in paragraph 61.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you must place those on 
record please? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you.  Yes Chair in 
the terms of reference directed to the Chairperson Advocate Cassim. 
20 
“The Chairperson had to inquire into whether it was fit and 
proper of me to hold the office of the NDPP in the light of 
the following: 
1. My two previous separate convictions on charges of 
assault.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 5 of 216 
 
2. The complaints of professional misconduct laid 
against me with the Kwazulu Natal Law Society.   
3. My having faced criminal charges for acts of 
violence.   
4. My arrest and detention on criminal charges.  
5. Media statements issued – either issued by me or 
any instruction that undermined or brought the office 
of the NDPP or the NPA into disrepute and lastly any 
other 
matter 
as 
might 
be 
relevant 
to 
the 
abovementioned issues and my fitness and propriety 
10 
to hold the office of the NDPP as contemplated in 
Section 9[1b] of the NDPP Act.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 63. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You raise the issue in your 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry. Mr 
Nxasana the term of reference before the last one that you mentioned I 
think you did not read correctly.  It says:   
“Media statements either issued by you or on your 
20 
instructions.  I understood you to say or any 
instruction.”   
Do you want to confirm the correct position? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I said Media 
statements either issued by me or on my instruction. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 6 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That undermined or 
brought the office of the NDPP or the NPA into disrepute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  The President 
then proceeded to file submissions in relation to the inquiry. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say in paragraph 63. 
“The complaints and the submissions were different 
to the complaints in the terms of reference.” 
10 
And you deal with that in paragraph 64 as well.  But let us just deal 
with the complaints and the submissions.  You deal with those in 
paragraph 63.1.1 before we go to paragraph 64.  What were the 
complaints and the submissions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The complaints Chair and 
the submissions were that before my appointment I had failed to 
disclose to the President or his advisors that I had two previous 
convictions for assault.  The second one was that I had failed to take 
steps to expedite the finalisation of a complaint to the Law Society by 
Mr Jabulani Mjala [?] against me in 2008.  The third was that in my 
20 
security clearance application questionnaire in answer to the question 
“Have you ever been convicted or are there any pending cases for a 
criminal or departmental offence?”  The complaint is that I failed to 
disclose that during 1985 I had been acquitted on a charge of murder 
and that during October 2012 I had been arrested but not charged for 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 7 of 216 
 
inconsiderate driving.  The other complaint was that I had failed to 
disclose whether I had taken any steps to resolve my complaint against 
the two officers – police officers who arrested me unlawfully during 
October 2012 for inconsiderate driving.  And the last complaint was that 
I had made statements to the Media that were in the public interest.  
Statements which fuelled media speculation negatively affected the 
public’s confidence in the NPA and breeched the code of conduct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so you conclude given the 
difference between the terms of reference on the one hand and the 
complaints and the submissions on the other that certain complaints in 
10 
your view did not fall within the terms of reference.  You deal with that 
in paragraph 64. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you deal with those 
briefly please? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  The – Chair 
you will note then from what I have read that the following complaints 
do not fall within the terms of reference.  The complaint identified in 
paragraph 63.1 that I have read earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it 63.1.1? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  63.1.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  The complaint in the 
first terms of reference was that my two previous convictions of assault 
meant that I was not fit and proper to hold the office of the NDPP.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 8 of 216 
 
Then the complaint identified in paragraph 63.1.2 above that complaint 
in – the complaint in the second terms of reference is that I am not fit 
and proper because of complaints of professional misconduct made 
against me with the Kwazulu Natal Law Society.  The complaint 
identified in paragraph 63.1.3 the complaint in the third terms of 
reference is that I am not fit and proper because I faced criminal 
charges for acts of violence.  The complaints identified in paragraph 
63.1.3 bullet 2 the complaint in the fourth terms of reference was that I 
was not fit and proper because of my arrest and detention on criminal 
charges.  The complaint identified in paragraph 63.1.4 Chair you will 
10 
notice that none of the terms of reference referred to a failure to 
disclose what steps I took to finalise my complaint against the South 
African Police Services.  I further submitted that the only complaint 
contained in this submissions that should be adjudicated at the inquiry 
was the complaint identified in paragraph 63.1.5 but despite this I 
responded to all the allegations – all of the allegations contained in the 
President’s submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us just go back if we may to the terms of 
reference of the inquiry.  I just want some clarification.  We will go back 
to paragraph 61.  61.1.1 was the question of your two previous 
20 
separate convictions on charges of assault. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to confirm.  I do have a clear recollection 
of a conviction regard to one assault.  I am not sure that there were 
two.  Were there two convictions that you had? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 9 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of assault. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair in my previous 
evidence I said that when I completed the security clearance form I did 
not know of the other – of the other assault charge but it came from my 
– my criminal that I had another assault charge and I disclosed that in 
the form as well.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I just want to – to understand as a matter of fact 
whether as we speak now the position is that you did have at the time 
two previous convictions of assault? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I know the one you had said related to 
somebody was your girlfriend in the ‘80’s. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other one related to what if you may remind me? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is what I said Chair.  
I said I cannot recall it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And it was with the help of 
the lady who was – who – who assisted me because I would not have 
disclosed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because I – I have 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 10 of 216 
 
forgotten about it.  I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you did get whatever documentation that 
referred to it were there enough particulars to remind you what it was 
about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So even as you speak you do not know what it was 
about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I cannot remember.  I 
think the only detail was that it was a 1985 assault common. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assault conviction. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Assault common – assault 
common conviction where I was cautioned and discharged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had no recollection when you got this and 
you have no recollection up to now? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is – that is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All you can say is the records do show that there is a 
conviction for assault but you do not know what it is about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is – that is so Chair.  
And that is what I said also when I completed the security clearance 
form. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and which may well – which I assume might 
well leave room for the possibility that maybe that information is not 
correct on the records? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 11 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is possibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know – you just cannot remember. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is a possibility because I 
cannot recall.  I tried to recall it I cannot recall it because for all 
intents and purposes I only knew about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About one conviction of assault? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay I just wanted that clarification.  So – so to 
the extent that you may have accepted that there were two you were 
doing so simply on the assumption that the system of these records is 
10 
correct but you have no recollection whatsoever about the second one? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And 61.1.3 my having faced criminal charges for 
acts of violence was that separate from the as you understood it from 
the two convictions and I think maybe it also referred to – it may have 
referred to the murder charge where you were acquitted I do not know.  
What was your understanding of what this about – this complaint that 
you had faced criminal charges of acts of assault? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair that was the whole 
point of my confusion because I did not understand what the complaint 
20 
is about which then culminated in me asking the President to give me 
the particularities of what he means about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you never received? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Which I never received 
Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 12 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – up to the time of the settlement? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even in discussions you were never told? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Never – I was never told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because in the terms of 
reference as you have correctly pointed out he made mentions of the 
previous – of the separate previous … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Convictions. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Convictions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He also made mention of 
the murder charge that I faced – the murder charge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But then he went on to talk 
about the previous… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Charges of criminal… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Charges of violence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of violence – conduct then 
20 
I wanted to know what he meant about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But then I tried 
notwithstanding to deal with what I had to speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But the only criminal charges that you ever 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 13 of 216 
 
faced involving violence if one may call it that would be that you know 
of would be the murder charge of which you were acquitted. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the one common assault conviction that you 
disclosed? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to the extent that there may be another common 
assault conviction that you know nothing about may be that is that but 
you do not know anything about it? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And 61.1.4 my arrest and detention on criminal 
charges.  What did you understand that – did you understand that to be 
separate from the – the arrest and detention if any that may have been 
connected with the assault conviction and the murder charge? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Again Chair it was 
confusing because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was confusing. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I speculated and 
understood it to mean my arrest for inconsiderate driving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Where I was released on a 
R1 000,00 bail and the matter was not even placed on the roll the – 
because of insufficient evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But again it was a matter 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 14 of 216 
 
of having to speculate on my side because it was not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay thank you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event your explanation in 
respect of these allegations is concluded in – or is included in the draft 
submissions to the Cassim Inquiry at page 51 and following. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can you just confirm it?  Is that 
correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair but 
10 
that was the draft which I ended up not presenting at the Cassim 
Inquiry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This was never handed to the 
Cassim Inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But what we can deal with is the 
allegations largely in the submissions to the Cassim Inquiry on behalf 
of the President or by the President in relation to the failure to disclose 
various matters? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Prior to your appointment which 
you have described or the process in relation to which you described 
already to the Chair was there any formal engagement or requirement 
to provide documentation to make disclosures to provide written 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 15 of 216 
 
statements? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair there was no. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There was as you described and 
I can put it to you by leading I presume because you have given this 
evidence already.  There was merely the informal engagements 
between you and Mr Hulley? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair it was an 
informal engagement and Mr Hulley had made it very clear to me that it 
was not going to be an interview but it was going to be an interaction 
between me and President which is what happened. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  After your appointment were you 
required to undergo a security clearance process? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I was not required – I think 
at the NPA we took it upon ourselves. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and you did undergo a 
security clearance process? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When was that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think it was on the – I 
think it was in – early in March.  I think 4 t h March if I am not mistaken 
20 
2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  March 2014 or – not December 
2013. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh December. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Does that ring a bell for you? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 16 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think it was very early. It 
was very early I have – immediately after I was appointed because I 
assumed the position on the 1 s t October.  I think in December yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now in relation to that 
application for security clearance did you make certain disclosures? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I did Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair this document is 
confidential it has not been declassified but there is evidence on the 
10 
record and in the public domain concerning its contents so if I may I am 
going to lead him on that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall the questions in 
paragraph 11 of that security clearance application? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was that question? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The question was “have 
you even been convicted of a criminal offence/have you ever been 
found guilty in a departmental inquiry?”  Something like that. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And my answer to that was 
yes.  Then I disclosed the – the assault common charge.  I went on to 
disclose the other charges and I explained that I was not even aware of 
it and it was brought – it appears on the records of the SAPS.  On a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 17 of 216 
 
separate – because it provides for a separate – you can put up a 
separate explanation.  There is an explanatory note on that form. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is several pages which allow 
you to provide additional information. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you make certain additional 
disclosures to that required by paragraph 11? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What were those disclosures? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I disclosed the – the – 
10 
even – because it – the form asked me even of the – have I ever 
received summonses and the like I disclosed that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that was a reference to civil 
summonses? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Civil summonses yes.  I 
went on to – to even disclose that yes I had received like traffic fines 
and I may have received summonses and civil summonses and – and I 
– I may have received them but I have never been sequestrated.  I also 
disclosed the – the – the complaints against me that were lodged at the 
Law Society, all of them, all of that Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in relation to the issues 
raised either in the terms of reference or in relation to the submissions 
by or on behalf of the President to the Cassim Inquiry was there 
anything that you did not disclose? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 18 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fact as I understand it you 
went further in your security clearance application than the strict letter 
of the questions in paragraph 11 and following? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you wanted to add something? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I – in fact Chair the – 
the security – that paragraph required of me to disclose criminal 
convictions and pending cases but  I nevertheless even disclosed like 
the murder charge and explained how it happened even though I was 
10 
acquitted and I did not have any pending criminal charge at the time.  
In short I disclosed more than what was expected of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than what you were required to? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go then to page 18 of 
your statement where you deal with matters that confronted you when 
you took office at the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe before – before we go there Mr Pretorius 
I do want to ask a few questions in relation to the President’s 
complaints or submissions.  If I may go back to paragraph – to page 15.  
20 
At 63.1.1 you say “before my appointment I had failed to disclose to the 
President or his advisors that I had two previous convictions for 
assault.”   You – that was one of the complaints and you have said that 
complaint had no basis because you had disclosed, is that right or am I 
– am I misunderstanding that? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 19 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair he talks about 
before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Before my appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so you disclosed when you were doing the 
security clearance? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  That was after 
my appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Before appointment you had never filled in any 
application for a job? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the job of NDPP? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think Chair this whole – 
my appointment should be understood in the context of my evidence of 
the 12 t h June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Before this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That I was approached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without having asked for any job. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes happily practising in 
Durban. I never applied for the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I was approached to 
serve. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 20 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I did not make – fill 
any application form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I did not apply for the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then I – I was never asked 
to disclose anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Except for my CV that was 
10 
asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And later on after my 
appointment I was then at the NPA I then underwent the security 
clearance, the vetting system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you say you were not required to do but you 
took upon yourself to do it. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  We took it upon ourselves 
at NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you were not asked. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For this information.  You were not asked to fill any 
application form.  You were simply approached and it appeared that you 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 21 of 216 
 
were being approached after some homework had been done to indicate 
that you were the right person? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That – that is what – that 
is how I understood it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  And then 63.1.2 says that you failed to 
take steps to expedite the finalisation of a complaint to the Law Society 
by Mr Jabulani Ngala [?] against you in 2008.  In other words part of 
the submissions by the President was that you had failed to take steps 
to expedite the finalisation of a complaint against you that had been 
lodged in the Law Society in 2008.  Now this was in 2015 is it not? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was now about what seven years after that 
complaint was lodged? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  After the complaint was 
lodged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Whilst I was still 
practicing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where – did you understand what this complaint 
meant really because you did not file a complaint and you were not 
20 
supposed to decide the complaint it was the Law Society which was 
supposed to decide the complaint.  What was your understanding of 
what the real complaint of the President was on this against you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And Chair the reason – the 
reason why this found itself – why the President raised it it is because I 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 22 of 216 
 
am the one who disclosed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  This in the vetting form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I explained there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And may I repeat here that 
in practice generally as attorneys’ clients they report us to our 
respective legal bodies.  There was nothing strange about it.  If a client 
is under the impression that his – it was an estate matter and he felt 
10 
that the matter was taking too long to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And estate matters take long. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They take long … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I was ultimately 
exonerated by the - by the Law Society. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the Law Society.  Yes and you - you explained that 
in the clearance documents? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At the time I had not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The - the Law Society had 
not taken a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had not taken a decision.  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes but it was a matter 
where I even put up in the vetting form that there is no way that I will 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 23 of 216 
 
be found guilty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
I 
was 
appointed 
the 
executor in the estate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And everything was above 
board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And the complaint was 
going to be dismissed in any event. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Which ultimately - which is 
what ultimately happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I knew this based on my 
experience I served at the Law Society as a council member for more 
than 10 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
I 
also 
became 
the 
President of the Law Society of KZN … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I know the nature of 
these complaints. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So - so you say he must have got - this must 
have been taken from the information you provided yourself? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 24 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was your understanding of what his 
complaint was when he says you failed to take steps to expedite the 
finalisation?  I mean what were you supposed to do?  You - you are the 
person against whom complaints were made and the Law Society was 
the - was the body that was supposed to deal with the complaint. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To deal with the complaint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what was the complaint about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair, I … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood it. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I did not understand 
because I tried to explain.  I really do not know but my view was that 
the President was just on a fishing expedition trying to get something 
against me or to justify the reasons for him establishing the commission 
of inquiry … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Into my fitness to hold 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then 63.1.3.  It refers to the fact that in your 
20 
- in answer to a certain question or in the clearance - in your security 
clearance application there was a question.  Have you ever been 
convicted or are there any pending cases for a criminal departmental 
offence and it said you - the complaint of - the President’s complaint 
was that you had failed to disclose that during 1985 you had been 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 25 of 216 
 
acquitted on a charge of murder and that during October 2012 you had 
been arrested but not charged for inconsiderate driving. 
Let us talk about the complaint that you - you failed to 
disclose that during 1985 you had been acquitted on a charge of 
murder.  Did you understand why it would have been relevant for - why 
it would have been problematic that you did not disclose that you were 
acquitted of - of a charge of murder? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair my - my view as a 
lawyer even to date even at the - in the very first correspondence to 
the President I made it very clear that I am under no obligation to 
10 
disclose an acquittal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Because 
if 
you 
are 
acquitted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
The 
presumption 
of 
innocence it is guaranteed in the Constitution that any accused person 
is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  In this case I was charged 
and I went through the process.  I was cleared by the court and I was 
acquitted.  There - there should be no qualms about that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you ever been told either by him or his advisors 
why you - there was an obligation for you to disclose an acquittal? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair but despite that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 26 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is even incorrect to 
suggest that I did not disclose it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because it is there in the 
security clearance form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the security clearance? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
then 
he 
also 
complained 
that 
during 
October 2012 you had been arrested but not charged for inconsiderate 
driving.  What - what do you say about that?  I think you have said 
10 
something.  Just remind me what you - what your attitude was about 
this. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair again it will be a sad 
day if the ordinary citizens of a country were to be expected to disclose 
that the police had unlawfully arrested me and when there was no 
evidence and I was then subsequently not even yet discharged.  The 
matter was not even placed on the roll.  On the first day at court I do 
not even appear but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which - which suggests that the - either the police 
themselves or the prosecutor did not believe that there was a case for 
20 
you to face? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair and 
in - in the security clearance form I dealt extensively with it.  I 
explained even I think in the correspondence that how it happened and 
that these pleas - I even laid a counter charge against them and just 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 27 of 216 
 
because I was then subsequently appointed at the NPA I did not pursue 
it because I did not want to get myself as the National Director of 
Public Prosecutions involved in - in litigation because I had - I had a 
big job to - to attend to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then 63.1.4.  His other complaint was that 
you had failed to disclosure whether you had taken any steps to resolve 
your complaint against the two police officers who had arrested you 
unlawfully for inconsiderate driving.  Did you understand what the basis 
- why that could be a complaint by the President against you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair from - from the 
10 
reading of that complaint it cannot be a complaint.  It - it does not 
make sense at all.  You cannot force me to pursue civil litigation 
against anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and what is wrong with that if you decide not to 
pursue … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  If I decided … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any steps against people who have - police officers 
who arrest you unlawfully? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  There - there is nothing 
wrong Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you ever given any explanation what the basis 
was of all this? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not at all Chair; but again 
Chair to me I got the impression that the President was really on the 
back foot and he did not have the solid ground to have established that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 28 of 216 
 
Commission of Inquiry to look into my fitness to hold office.  He did not 
have reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I ask you these questions Mr Nxasana because some 
of these complaints I have difficulty in understanding them and I am 
asking because maybe you might understand them as the person who 
was involved and there is a person who did have discussions with the 
President and his advisors that maybe you might be able to tell me 
something that makes me understand them. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Unfortunately not Chair.  
Save to say that these complaints most of them Chair they had 
10 
unintended consequences because I am a family man.  I have kids and 
my kids came to know about my brushes with the law.  Things that they 
did not know.  My family, extended family it was humiliation more than 
everything for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In summary in relation to the 
complaints raised by the President or on behalf of the former President 
and the Cassim Inquiry the security clearance application did not 
require you to answer the questions dealt with in paragraph 63? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event a proper reading of 
the additional information in the security clearance form would disclose 
that you did in fact deal with all these issues? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we may go to the next section 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 29 of 216 
 
on page 18.  Chair the purpose of the evidence now would be to 
contrast the complaints relating to Mr Nxasana with the complaints that 
existed in relation to Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi and the failure 
immediately to take action in relation to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I just want to confirm with 
you that insofar as his - Mr Nxasana’s - submissions to the Cassim 
Inquiry which he says he ended up not - I think - submitting.  Insofar as 
they are concerned the questions that he has been asked have 
basically elicited the answers that are in the submissions or not really? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not in the detail contained … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you will - you will come back to that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the submissions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But because the submissions 
were never given to anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They - the - the factual 
circumstances that you speak of in the submissions are they correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there you deal in detail with 
20 
many of the allegations contained in the terms of reference and in the 
President’s complaints.  You deal with both? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With both. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Despite the difference? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 30 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So are you happy to tell the 
Chair that if he reads the facts set out there he can rely on them as 
being correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is - that is so Chair 
and those … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but is it … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Those are the submissions 
I was going - I was going to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To make - to present at the 
10 
Cassim Inquiry had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
It 
not 
been 
for 
the 
settlement that was reached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but or maybe the - the one part that you - I might 
not have asked you might be relating to the media statements that were 
alleged to have been put to you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am going to deal with those 
now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us deal with them now. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to paragraph 69. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say that in your submission 
to the Cassim Inquiry you did deal with the issue of the several media 
reports … 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 31 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Of 
which 
the 
President 
complained? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Would you tell the Chair 
in the media did you go out to the media to make any public statements 
at your own initiative? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair.  What used to 
happen is I would respond to media queries and I think that is one of 
the reasons why part of the work or part of the mandate for the fact 
10 
finding committee headed by retired Justice Yacoob which we will later 
deal with it here was to investigate the leakage of information to the 
media by senior management. 
Then I would find myself being confronted with issues and I 
would have to respond but Chair my position even in the Code of 
Conduct of NPA allows me to - to deal with the media.  There is nothing 
wrong with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But to the extent that part of the - part of what the 
former President may have complained about you was that you made 
certain media statements that may have brought the NPA into disrepute 
20 
or something like that. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did indicate last time when you were here that 
you did not know the particulars of those media statements that he was 
referring to but at some stage I think I said there is somewhere where 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 32 of 216 
 
you seem to have said certain statements that were in the media were 
actually correct and I think that was in the submissions that you made 
to the - in the representations that you made to the President as to why 
he should not suspend you.  I think that is where … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There - there was … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position there that you were simply trying to 
think of statements that you may have made but you were not sure what 
- which ones he was complaining about? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair.  I - I 
ended up - because I was pressed to respond to the President’s 
complaints and notwithstanding having requested the President to give 
me particularities of the complaint.  He failed to do so.  Then he left me 
with no choice but to speculate what he was talking about and that is 
the unfortunate part of it. 
He - he talked about media statements and - and I denied 
even when I responded to the President I still denied that there were 
media statements made by me which had the effect of bringing the NPA 
to disrepute. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And until the settlement agreement was made and 
until today you have never been given any clarity as to what media 
statements were being referred to? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 33 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to the supplementary 
bundle - Bundle EE6 - in front of you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The document at page MSON 2-
0-9 what is that document?  The first document in that bundle. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
This 
is 
the 
letter 
I 
prepared. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you look at the heading on 
page 2-0-9 you will see the … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  I - I … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Purpose of the document. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  This is the letter that I 
prepared.  I wrote to the President - President Zuma.  I want to get the 
date. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was this in - it is clear from the 
heading in relation to the Notice of Intention to Suspend. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To suspend.  Ja, in terms 
of Section 12(6)(a) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So this was the 
document prepared by yourself … 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 Addressed 
to 
the 
former 
President dealing with the submissions or representations you were 
asked to make consequent upon the issue of the notice to consider your 
suspension? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 34 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to page 2-1-3.   You 
will see there that you deal with reported comments in the media … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there you say in paragraph 
18: 
“I have requested details about what comments I 
allegedly made when I made them and in what 
media they were reported.  At the time of making 
these submissions I was not provided with this 
10 
information.” 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were you ever after that 
provided with that information? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No and then you made an 
assumption about what reports could have been referred to … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you dealt with them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I dealt with it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you give a full explanation 
in the following paragraphs? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I do not know if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 35 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I need to place that all on 
record.  It is on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is on record. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just one more thing which I think you did deal 
with last time but for the sake of completeness now.  To the extent that 
one of the President’s complaints was that the fact that you had been 
convicted of assault rendered you unfit to occupy the position of NDPP.  
What did you say in your submissions in response to that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I think if I remember 
10 
well I explained in detail - in detail how it came about that I was - how 
it came about that the offence was committed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in respect of the assault conviction … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The assault conviction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you know - you knew about? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja and I gave the account 
of the - of the offence and Chair without downplaying the seriousness 
of the offence but I said the - even though I did not say it in so many 
20 
words that any - any offence is serious.  The offence of assault 
especially against a - anyone or even worse against a - a female is - is 
serious but Chair the assault varies from - the crime of assault varies 
from common assault to assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
I was convicted of assault common and I explained that it was 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 36 of 216 
 
the slapping with an open hand and I said the - the sanction surely it 
clearly indicates that the - the court did not view it as serious to render 
me unfit to hold the office of the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions. 
I had been - I made then a distinction also with the - the 
requisite integrity and conscientiousness required by the - the Act … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The NPA Act? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The NPA Act and the 
Constitution 
and 
I 
said 
that 
the 
requisite 
integrity 
and 
conscientiousness is in no way different to the requisite integrity and 
10 
conscientiousness required of a person for admission as an attorney 
and as an advocate for which I am an attorney … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I disclosed that when I 
was admitted as an attorney … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And there should not be a 
- an impediment - that previous conviction should not be an impediment 
to my fitness to hold the office of the NDPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you said you had disclosed to the High Court in 
20 
your application for admission as an attorney … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you had previously been convicted of common 
assault … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is … 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 37 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the court had seen - had come to the conclusion 
that you were fit and proper to be admitted to as an attorney … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that there is no basis to think that the same court 
would think that you are - you are fit and proper to be admitted as an 
attorney when you have a previous conviction of common assault but 
you are not fit and proper to be - to occupy the position of NDPP 
because of the same conviction? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is part of the point that you made? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is the point that I - 
that is part - part of the point that I - I was making. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Especially Chair in KZN.  I 
do not know in other divisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That the - the admission 
applications in KZN Chair - you may know that there are - you have two 
Judges sitting for the admissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja, I think everywhere it is two Judges … 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the Eastern Cape … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am not mistaken. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the Eastern Cape it was 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 38 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well on - in Pretoria when I sat there it was always 
two but so that - that is part of the point you made? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did anybody - the President or anybody ever 
present any argument against that … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That argument to say … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The court is not - there is no chance that the court 
10 
can say this previous conviction renders me unfit to be NDPP? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think Chair if - if I recall 
the President’s submission he - he was trying to argue that the 
requisite integrity and conscientiousness required of the person holding 
the office of the NDPP is higher … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is higher. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Than the - and our 
argument was that it cannot be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In summary Mr Nxasana if you 
look at page 2-1-2 of the supplementary bundle.  The evidence that you 
have just given is it summarised on that page and the page following - 
page 212? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 39 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Paragraph? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From paragraph 12 … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  12, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Through to paragraph 17 on the 
next page. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Would you just 
place on record what you say in the second sentence of paragraph 69 
of the main statement please? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  “The President 
10 
later complained that my statements to the media 
damaged the public’s perception of the NPA.  While 
I agreed that public confidence in the NPA had been 
shaken I disputed that it was because of anything 
that I had done.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The attention of the 
media on what issues did it focus? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the time.  You deal with that 
in paragraph 70. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair at the time the 
media’s focus was on the unlawful conduct of Advocates Jiba and 
Mrwebi who were seen to be abusing their positions in the NPA and had 
acted unlawfully. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you give some examples. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 40 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  These included the - the - 
their involvement in withdrawing charges of fraud and corruption 
against 
former 
Head 
of 
Crime 
Intelligence 
Major General Richard Mdluli. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You are aware of the decisions 
of the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal in this regard? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did they decide on these 
issues? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair after Advocate Jiba 
10 
and 
Advocate Mrwebi 
had 
decided 
not 
to 
prosecute 
Major General Mdluli of fraud and corruption the High Court per 
Judge Murphy criticised them. 
In fact firstly criticised the manner in which they handled the 
- the matter or in - in which they came to the - to the decision that 
there was no - there was insufficient evidence and he set aside their 
decision not to prosecute - reviewed and set it aside and the matter 
was taken on appeal to the SCA and per Judge Brand in the SCA - 
Judge Murphy’s decision was confirmed and again it criticised the 
manner in which they handled the matter. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 70.3 you quote an 
extract from the judgment of Judge Murphy. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you read that extract onto 
the record please but before you do so the respondents referred to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 41 of 216 
 
there who were they? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair for - for the - my 
understanding here was referring to the NPA, Advocate Jiba and 
Advocate Mrwebi. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  What did Judge Murphy 
say? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The - the excerpt here 
from this judgment the Judge said: 
“Suffice 
it 
to 
say 
that 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
respondents is unbecoming of persons of such high 
10 
rank in the public service and especially worrying in 
the case of the NDPP.  A senior officer of this court 
with 
weighty 
responsibility 
in 
the 
proper 
administration of justice.  The attitude of the 
respondents signals a troubling lack of appreciation 
of 
the 
Constitutional 
ethos 
and 
principles 
underpinning the offices they hold.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 70.4 you 
record that Judge Murphy dealt with a failure to disclose but now this 
failure to disclose is particularised in paragraph 70.4.  What was that 
20 
failure to disclose? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Judge Murphy found that 
Advocate Jiba had failed to disclose Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach’s 
representations in the NPA’s record of the decision. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What representations had she 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 42 of 216 
 
made? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Advocate Jiba had made 
no mention of the representations made by Ms Glynnis Breytenbach 
urging her to review the decision to - to pursue charges against 
Major General Mdluli. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Then in paragraph … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the - I am - I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I may 
have missed - I may - I might not have heard correctly but I think 
Mr Pretorius wanted you to say what Ms Breytenbach’s representations 
said that Ms Jiba did not disclose. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is - that is what I am 
- I am saying in this next line Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Apparently 
Advocate 
Breytenbach had made representations to Advocate Jiba that it was 
wrong, there was sufficient evidence to prosecute and she was pleading 
with Advocate Jiba to review her decision to not prosecute and 
Advocate Jiba deliberately did not disclose that in the NPA’s record in 
the High Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So in other words when there was a review 
20 
application that had been lodged in the High Court against her decision 
not to prosecute Mr Mdluli, in disclosing the record that she was 
obliged in terms of Rule 53, I think of the High Court rules to file in the 
High Court.  She did not include the representations that had been 
made to her by Miss Breytenbach saying, but there is enough evidence 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 43 of 216 
 
to prosecute, please review your decision, that is what she did not 
disclose to the Court? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is what she did not 
disclose Chair and to the contrary she maintained that there was not 
sufficient evidence to prosecute Mdluli and withheld and failed to 
disclose that in fact, she had been told, she had been advised that 
there was evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You make reference in 
paragraph 70.6 to a judgement of Gorvin J- Judge Gorvin. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In the case of Major General 
Booysen versus the Acting Director of Public Prosecutions.  In essence 
– or let me ask you, did Judge Gorvin make any adverse finding against 
Advocate Jiba in that judgement? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What was that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I think Chair, basically 
Judge Gorvin again, criticised Advocate Jiba’s decision to sign, if I 
remember correctly to prosecute General Booysen because she signed 
20 
the racketeering certificate.  Judge Gorvin did not have – there was no 
evidence that was presented before him that there was evidence 
justifying the charges that were preferred against General Booysen, 
especially the racketeering charges. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Again I’m…[intervenes]. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 44 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    In other words when she 
did that Judge Gorvin found that she misled the Court. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In paragraph 71 you deal with 
issues related to Advocate Magwebu and again you refer to the 
judgement of Judge Murphy, Chair all these judgements have been 
placed in the supplementary bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What did Judge Murphy find in 
relation to Advocate Magwebe? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair Judge Murphy 
10 
found that Advocate Magwebe’s evidence lacked credibility particularly 
in relation to his contention that he consulted with Advocate Sibongile 
Mzinyathi who is the DPP in Pretoria that is in relation – that he 
consulted with him before he decided to discontinue the prosecution 
against Major General Mdluli.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Paragraph 71.2 you deal with a 
further finding? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes that Advocate 
Magwebe had failed to disclose relevant documents that formed part of 
the record of his decision to withdraw charges against Major General 
20 
Mdluli. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And in paragraph 71.3 another 
finding you refer to? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Here Judge Murphy also 
rejected Advocate Magwebe’s contention that the decision to withdraw 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 45 of 216 
 
charges against Major General Mdluli had been made in consultation 
with Advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi.  He also rejected Advocate 
Magwebe’s contention that investigations into the charges against 
Major General Mdluli were defective and that his evidence that Miss 
Breytenbach had believed that the charges were defective as 
improbable, he found his evidence unreliable. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    These findings what did the 
Supreme Court of Appeal say about them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    The Supreme Court of 
Appeal confirmed Judge Murphy’s findings. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What recommendation did you 
make to the Minister of Justice in July 2014? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I – on 18 July 2014 I 
asked Advocate Gerhard Nel to prepare a memorandum that we referred 
to previously here in the Commission.  In that memorandum, that was 
the memorandum that was signed off by Mr Hofmeyr, where I approved 
of it and we – I made recommendations to the Minister to request the 
President to consider instituting disciplinary action against Advocate 
Jiba and Magwebe and to place them on suspension pending the 
hearing, I also asked the inquiry should be – I recommended that the 
20 
inquiry should be chaired by a retired Judge. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Chair just for the record and 
assist any reader of the transcript the memorandum already referred to 
in evidence appears at page 184.24.  We’ve dealt with that 
memorandum, if we could go to …[intervenes]. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 46 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry Mr Pretorius so just to put these issues in 
their correct context and perspective the criticisms and the findings – 
adverse findings that had been made by the Court against Jiba and 
Advocate Magwebe to which you have just referred, they all happened 
before July 2014, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Would that include the Supreme Court of Appeal 
decision or that may have come later, which confirmed those findings? 
MR 
MXOLISI 
SANDILE 
OLIVER 
NXASANA: 
 
 
 
It 
also 
included…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    It was also before? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And so, I think I remember from last time when you 
gave evidence that the – you approached Advocate Els SC for an 
opinion in June is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In June of 2014. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Advocate Elles. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Elles, okay I said Els okay, alright so this is all 
before you received the letter from the President saying that he had 
20 
decided to institute an inquiry against you, is that right or did it happen 
more or less the same time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I think Chair, when you 
check the records, I think the letter advising me of the President’s 
decision was dated the 4 t h of July if I’m not mistaken. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 47 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh I think you probably are right, ja 4 t h of July but 
you had already asked for…[intervenes]. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I had already started the 
process.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You had already started and I think last time I asked 
you the question and you said there were a number of people who were 
aware that this is what you were doing. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So I understand it the 
10 
memorandum signed by Advocate Hofmeyr is dated the 18 t h of July 
2014 but that was prepared before that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
Just for the record he’s Mr Hofmeyr. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You say in paragraph 74 that at 
the time you wrote – or that memorandum was written, let’s deal with 
that first, paragraph 74 you didn’t write that memorandum if I 
understand your evidence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So that paragraph would need 
20 
to be corrected, I think you – it would be more correct to say that at the 
time that memorandum was written [indistinct] approved by you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You were considering 
appointing a fact finding inquiry is that the Justice Yacoob inquiry. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 48 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Was he indeed appointed? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    He was Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Can you recall the date of his 
appointment? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    It was on the 31 s t of July 
2014. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And for what purpose was he 
appointed to Chair an inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair amongst other 
10 
things was to investigate, establish and determine the alleged 
involvement of the NPA’s employees including senior officials and the 
leaking of information to the media and other interested parties.  The 
alleged unethical and unprofessional conduct on the part of the NPA’s 
employees, whether any member of the NPA committed an unlawful act. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And you’ve already told the 
Chair that you instructed Advocates Jiba and Magwebe to cooperate 
with that inquiry. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Did they? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    They refused Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Right did Justice Yacoob 
complete a report? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes he did Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Do you recall at least two of 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 49 of 216 
 
the recommendations he made? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair, one of the 
recommendations was that criminal charges should be instituted 
against certain members of the NPA and that the NPA should appoint a 
judicial Commission of inquiry with powers of [indistinct] to investigate 
allegations of impropriety in the NPA. 
ADV PAUL 
JOSEPH 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
 
Right, 
now 
that 
recommendation 
that 
criminal 
charges 
should 
be 
instituted 
or 
conducted did they include Advocates Jiba and Magwebe or not? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    They included them Chair 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What did you do with the 
recommendations? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I forwarded the 
recommendation to the Minister of Justice, then it was Minister Masutha 
and I gave the same recommendation to the President, President Zuma 
when I gave him the bundle of all information that I felt was necessary 
for him to know. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Right now at the time you gave 
the copy of Justice Yacoob’s recommendations to the Minister of 
Justice and the President, apart from that, did the President have – 
20 
former President have any other information emanating from you or 
anywhere else in relation to the conduct of Advocates Jiba and 
Magwebe? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair I do not recall. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    The memorandum, the Court 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 50 of 216 
 
Judgements, they would have been published. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Because I cannot recall 
in the order of sequence because we had previously prepared the 
memorandum to the Minister, there was that to and fro communication 
between the Minister and my office and Mr Hofmeyr where Minister 
Masutha was basically asking why it was Mr Hofmeyr who signed the 
memorandum and in that memorandum it contained all of this, and what 
steps did I take and we then explained that and I remember, Chair, that 
in the – I think when I subsequently handed the memorandum to the 
Minister I pointed out to him that I – my view is that he’s delaying 
10 
conveying this to the President and I have decided to do it myself, I 
remember that I did that but the order of sequence I cannot recall. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright is it correct then at some 
stage the memorandum was given to the former President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Was that by yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    By myself yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is the sequence that you can’t remember whether 
the memorandum preceded the handing the submission of the 
memorandum to the Minister and subsequent to the President preceded 
20 
the submission of the report of Justice Yacoob or it was the other, is 
that what you can’t remember which one was done first? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes that is what I can’t 
remember, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay not that’s fine. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 51 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Be that as it may you do know 
that the former President did receive a copy of Justice Yacoob’s 
recommendations? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair he 
even thanked me for bringing that to his attention. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And those recommendations 
dealt with the issues to which you’ve now testified? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Did the former President act on 
those recommendations? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Unfortunately not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did he ever tell you why he was not acting on them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No he did not Chair the 
unfortunate situation is that he acted against me instead of acting 
against them. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    And the unfortunate part 
Chair, is that Advocate Jiba and Magwebe – well I heard it from corridor 
talks they were bragging that nothing was going to happen to them and 
then when it didn’t happen – when the President didn’t take any action 
20 
against them, it came as no surprise and it just confirmed what they – 
the rumour that I was hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The bragging that you referred to was that bragging 
that they did within your presence or is it reports that you received 
from other people that they were bragging that nothing would happen to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 52 of 216 
 
them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No it was the reports I 
was receiving from other people Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That’s why I say it’s the 
rumour but ultimately it’s a fact that the President didn’t take any 
action.  I will hear the rumour Chair – one rumour was that I was told 
by someone that the President said to him, the problem with the boy, 
referring to me, is that he doesn’t see eye-to-eye with the girl, referring 
to Jiba and that’s – those are all part of the rumours…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    But that’s something that wasn’t said to you in your 
presence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Chair I’ve been given a helpful 
note if I may just place on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    This is matters emanating from 
the documentation.  The Judgement of Judge Murphy was dated the 
23 r d of September 2013. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Supreme Court of Appeal 
judgment was dated the 17 t h of April 2014 and the judgment of Judge 
Gorvin in relation to General Booysen was dated the 26 t h of February 
2014. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 53 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Justice Yacoob was appointed 
on the 31 s t of July 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s move on to another topic 
please and that is the affidavit of the former President in relation to the 
circumstances preceding the settlement agreement which he referred to 
on page 22. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Just to recap Chair, in the 
10 
bundle that should be before you of day 111 on the 12 t h of June 2019, 
the evidence before you, Chair if we can, in accordance with your 
direction refer to, not any bundle page, rather the actual page for the 
transcript for the record for the sake of consistency, do you have that in 
front of you Mr Nxasana? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Would you go to page 121 
that’s the pages are set out at the bottom of the page. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You’ll recall that on the 12 t h of 
20 
June we were dealing with the judgment of the Constitutional Court. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And that judgement is quoted 
on page 120 at line 10. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 54 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    The judgment reads, 
 
“It appears from a letter written on 10 December 2014 by 
 
attorneys acting for Mr Nxasana that former President had 
 
engaged Mr Nxasana to get him to agree to vacate office.  In 
 
the letter Mr Nxasana made it plain that he did not want to 
 
vacate office as there was no basis for him to do so.  He 
 
stated that he would, however, consider stepping down only if 
 
he was fully compensated for the remainder of the contract 
 
period”, 
 
And you confirmed in your evidence on that day, that, that was 
10 
the correct record of the facts insofar as you were concerned. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    If one goes to page 121 your 
evidence reads at line five, 
 
“Okay thank you Chair I at no stage, did I make a request to 
 
vacate the office to the former President Mr Jacob Zuma and 
 
that letter of the 10 t h that is referred to here I was also 
 
involved in drafting that letter and you say at the end of that 
 
paragraph the Court found correctly that I did not make any 
 
request I never made that request”, 
20 
 
Do you recall that evidence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You still confirm that, that 
evidence is correct do you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes I do confirm Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 55 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    And then the judgment goes 
further to say – and this is at the second part of page 121, 
 
“It must be noted right from the onset and throughout the 
 
entire negotiation process that culminated in the settlement 
 
agreement Mr Nxasana unequivocally stated that he did not 
 
wish to resign and that he considered himself to be fit for 
 
office.  Instead his preference was for former President Zuma’s 
 
allegation that he was no longer fit for office, to be tested in a 
 
formal inquiry as proposed by the former President and then 
 
over the page the judgment continues, throughout he protested 
10 
 
the existence of a factual or legal basis for him to vacate 
 
office, also he disavowed any indication by him Section 12 (8) 
 
of the Act to voluntarily vacate office.  It is so of course, that 
 
he did indicate that he would resign only if he was paid the full 
 
salary for the remainder of his term of office”, 
 
Then I asked you the question does that fairly summarise the 
position as far as you are aware and you say, 
 
“That is correct it fairly summarises the position”, 
 
So in that part of your evidence you placed on record your 
view of the facts and your recordal of the facts relating to the 
20 
settlement agreement consistent with the judgment of the Constitutional 
Court. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Then what I need to put to you 
is what the former President himself said in relation to that matter.  If 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 56 of 216 
 
you go to divider EE3, in the file in front of you, that’s Exhibit EE3 at 
pages 146 to 147 you will see there the version of the former President.  
Now this time we referring to the pages marked MSON on the top right-
hand corner. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What page? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Page 146 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    If you look at paragraph 5.5 
please Mr Nxasana. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes I see. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    You see there that the former 
President says, - perhaps I should just place on record Chair that this 
is the answering affidavit of the former President in the High Court 
Gauteng Local Division that appears as the title page of Exhibit EE3. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And I think you may also have to say that it is his 
answering affidavit…[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In the corruption watch case. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Chair that appears on page 
20 
142. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes to the affidavit of David Lewis and - Mr David 
Lewis and Miss Nicole Fritz because there is another answering 
affidavit by him in relation to, I think CASAC in this …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Yes Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 57 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    So if we may go back then to 
page 146 paragraph 5.5 there the former President says, 
 
“During the period August 2013 to 9 May 2015 Nxasana and I 
 
had various one-on-one verbal discussions regarding the 
 
discord that existed in the National Prosecuting Authority 
 
especially as between Nxasana and the senior management”, 
 
Do you have any comment on that statement? 
 MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair, Chair firstly 
this cannot be correct Chair for the simple reason that in August 2013 I 
10 
was not at the NPA, my appointed – I was only appointed at the end of 
August 2013 but with effect from 1 October 2013, then that August 2013 
is wrong…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It must be –maybe it was – maybe it’s an error in 
terms of the year maybe it should have been 2014? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Maybe it’s an error in 
terms of the year yes, but Chair we didn’t have these discussions 
regarding the discord that existed in the Natation Prosecuting Authority, 
specially between myself and the senior management.  There was no 
discord between me and the senior management, the problem that I had 
20 
was with two persons, that was Advocate Jiba and Advocate Magwebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes I - now you, are you dealing with that on the 
assumption that the former President, in that paragraph was – may 
have been referring to the period between August 2014 to May 2015, 
you are saying if that’s the period you’re referring to this is what you 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 58 of 216 
 
can say? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you saying there were no 
– you had no problems with anybody in the NPA including senior 
management other than two people only that you have mentioned? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes but to put it correctly 
they – these two had the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because they undermined 
my authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 5 – may I continue 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 5.6 reads: 
“The discord was so pronounced that the senior 
management was divided, the National Prosecuting 
Authority was destabilised and haemorrhaging.  The 
20 
illuming inquiry into the fitness to hold office of 
Nxasana also contributed to this discord.  This – the 
inquiry offered some of the senior management as 
additional platform to question the authority of Mr 
Nxasana.” 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 59 of 216 
 
Is that a fair reflection of what was occurring under your watch at the 
time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Again Chair it is not a fair 
reflection of what was occurring. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What do you say? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair everything was well 
with the senior management and I except for – except for these – for 
Advocate Jiba and Mwrebi who were pulling in the wrong direction and I 
– we did not discuss all these – what the President is saying here in 
paragraph 5.5.  Because every time I – I raised the issue that I know 
10 
that it is these two who are running the campaign of discrediting me 
and doing all of this that is all that I would – but the NPA senior 
management at no stage was under my watch was – at no stage was it 
divided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence that you never had any 
discussions with the former President relating to what he calls the 
discord that existed in the NPA especially between Nxasana and the 
senior management and what you say is that whatever discussions 
there were between the two of you that is yourself and the former 
President related to your complaints that Advocate Jiba and Advocate 
20 
Mwrebi were had a problem with you and were doing certain things? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Our discussion with the 
President was always around the issue of me having to vacate office 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 60 of 216 
 
and I would always insist that there is no reason for me to vacate office 
and I would then tell him that I mean the only people – the thing that I 
was supposed to do was to institute a – I furnished him with the 
information evidence about Jiba and Mwrebi and he has to institute 
disciplinary hearing against them.  That is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just going to ask a question that is not really 
about this but I do not want to forget it and I may have asked it 
previously.  You know the former President said you made a request to 
him that you be allowed to vacate the office and you have said you 
never made such a request. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now if you have never made such a request 
who was the first person who brought the idea that you – who 
mentioned the idea that you must vacate office as far as you recall?  
Who did that come from? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The first person Chair was 
former Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development.  It was Mr 
Radebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Mr Radebe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I have – I have been 
able to locate the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The letter that I – I wrote 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 61 of 216 
 
him.  That was on the evening on the 21 s t May 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  When I met with him at his 
offices in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And together with the then 
Director General of Justice Ms Sindane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then the next day the 22 n d 
May I then recorded the discussions that we had. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At that meeting and I 
emailed – I have proof of email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And he never responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something that you have given to Mr Pretorius 
that we will go to in due course? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I was going to deal with it Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can deal with it later. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But perhaps now is convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go to page 330. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 62 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is convenient it is okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of the supplementary bundle 
handed up this morning, Bundle EE6.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page number Mr Pretorius?  Page Number? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  330. 
CHAIRPERSON:  330. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have it? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I have got it ja. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is a covering email 
message. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is the document that 
appears on page 331? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is a – dated 22 May 
2014 on the letterhead of the office of the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions.  A letter addressed to Minister Radebe. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the letter you have just 
referred to in your evidence? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  It refers to a meeting 
between yourself and the Minister. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That reference is in paragraph 3. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 63 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And certain discussions took 
place in relation to your security clearance application? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you place certain matters on 
record in paragraph 6 relating to what you told the Minister? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then in paragraph 7 what 
did you tell the Minister there that you recorded in this letter?  
Paragraph 7 on page 332. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I say I – Chair I said here. 
“I did point out that I know the people who are 
behind this smear campaign who go about bragging 
and boasting that they will do everything in their 
power to bring me down.  I also pointed out that 
these people make sure that they drop your name 
and I am told that they have a direct access to you 
and they communicate with you behind my back.  I 
know they have been peddling lies about me which I 
mentioned to you last night.” 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that what you told the 
Minister? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you then go to paragraph 
9 please on page 333.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 64 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What occurred in the 
conversation between yourself and the Minister as recorded here? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I said here. 
“I confirm that there was some misunderstanding 
when I said I cannot resist when you suggested to 
me that I should consider stepping down from my 
position until I explained that I meant that as you 
were telling me I have nothing to say if I am fired 
since I did not apply for the job but I was approached 
10 
whilst I was practicing in Durban.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who first raised the issue as you 
put it here of stepping down? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That was Minister Radebe. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And the… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what was… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And the – and the DG. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what was your response to 
that statement by Minister Radebe that you should consider stepping 
20 
down? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I think I said I 
cannot resist and then I explained to him that when – if that is the case 
I will have to be fired because I will not step down. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And then in paragraph 10 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 65 of 216 
 
would you just tell the Chair what transpired at the meeting? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then the Minister Radebe 
then told me that he – that it going to be a process since the President 
will have to appoint a commission of inquiry and he asked me if I 
wanted to see that happening.  My response – my response to him was 
that if that is the procedure then it means it would have to be followed 
as I believe that I am a fit and proper person to hold this position.  I 
made it very clear which I reiterate – I said I reiterate then the next day 
when I wrote him the letter.  That I am not going to resign because of 
these false allegations against me.   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So both at the meeting an in this 
letter dated the 22 n d  May 2014 you stated that you would not resign 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the Minister ever respond to this letter and 
disputed your recordal of what had happened in the meeting between 
you, him and the then DG? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He did not Chair.  He did 
not respond even to this day.  But I think in the first correspondence 
from the President where he was asking me to respond to certain 
questions or allegations levelled against me I think his first – the first 
20 
paragraph of his letter where he referred to the – to – I had written a 
letter to him if I am not mistaken asking to see him and advising him 
that I had to resort to instituting to a plan – to instituting legal action 
interdicting him from suspending me.  And I pointed out to him that the 
matter was in court the next day but I am still open to discussion.  And 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 66 of 216 
 
I think in his response he made reference to the utterances that I had 
made about the Minister these are the utterances I think that he 
referred to but not the Minister.  It came – the response came from the 
President that he reserved his rights and he will deal with all of that at 
a proper stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  I know Mr Pretorius I asked a question 
that took us on a detour while you were on a certain path.  Feel free to 
go back to the path. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go back then to page 146 
paragraph 5.7 we are back at the affidavit. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of the former President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before you do so Mr Pretorius I am sorry 
again.  Mr Nxasana you have said that the first person to talk to you 
about vacating office was the former Minister, Minister Radabe. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did any – did any of the President’s advisors that you 
were dealing with in regard to this matter talk on the basis of you 
20 
vacating the office during the discussion that happened in the latter 
part of 2014 and the first half of 2015? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  If we may come back 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 67 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No, no if you can ask the 
question again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am asking you.  You have already told me who 
came up with the idea of you vacating office for the first time. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who next talked about you vacating office in – in 
regard to what culminated in the settlement?  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you said you never – you never requested to 
vacate office. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  It was the President 
because – it was the President when he sent me those – that 
correspondence Chair.  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And before him I think I 
had testified previously that I had a very short meeting with Mr Hulley 
here in Sandton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Who is the one who then 
broke the news to me that the President has taken a decision to 
20 
institute a commission of inquiry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understand the idea of you being told that the 
President had decided to institute an inquiry and I understand the letter 
from the President advising you that he had decided to institute an 
inquiry.  Of course an inquiry could – would not necessarily lead to you 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 68 of 216 
 
vacating the office as such.  You could be – he could have found that 
you were fit to hold office and it would not in that event recommend 
that you should vacate the office as I understand the position.  All I am 
looking at at this stage is whether anybody else other than Minister 
Radebe spoke about you vacating office and who really started 
speaking to you about you vacating office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No then it was – it was 
Minister Radebe who started that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and nobody else talked about that until when? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The President. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until the negotiations started? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when the negotiation started who introduced the 
idea of you vacating office or was the discussion based on the fact that 
you through your attorneys had indicated that the only time you could 
consider stepping down would be if you were to be paid for the rest of 
your period of appointment. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh now I understand you 
Chair.  No Chair it was always the President‘s insistence that I should 
step down and I had always refused to step down.  And to a point then 
20 
during those discussions – to a point that I – I then said to him the only 
time – because I have done nothing wrong if you want me to resign as 
then you must be prepared to pay me for the remainder of my contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall around about when it was that the 
President brought up the issue of you having to vacate office or is that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 69 of 216 
 
difficult to remember? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is difficult Chair but I 
think my recollection I remember that year because I had to think about 
this matter.  I think he also had a meeting with the President.  I think 
was it in – no I cannot remember – I [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Still in 2014 or only in 2015? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja 2014 I think 2014 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I do not know when.  Early 
2014 if I am not mistaken. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think that was the – I 
think that was the only time but I think what will assist me is the time 
when I brought an application because I only – I was only – I only 
managed to – to meet with the President after I had brought the 
application to interdict him from [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because I think you did testify that before that 
you had tried for a number of … 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a number of occasions to seek an appointment 
with him but you – you were not getting an appointment. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you brought an application for an order in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 70 of 216 
 
the high court for an order compelling him to give you further 
particulars in relation to the complaints and – then there was a meeting 
– then a meeting took place after that.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two of youl. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you cannot remember whether it was at that 
first meeting after you brought that application or subsequently that he 
brought up the issue of you vacating office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  I cannot 
10 
remember but Chair I – what I could recall – I can recall is after I had 
finally got the chance to meet with him I explained to him my views 
about all of the allegations and all what – all of what was happening.  I 
explained to him that this was just a smear campaign against me and I 
brought it to his attention that I had information about what Jiba had 
instructed people – Jiba and Mwrebi had instructed people to do in my 
hometown to try and find that against me.  But what I cannot recall is 
whether the first meeting he then raised that issue.  But if the 
Chairperson recalls in my previous testimony I said that to me it 
appeared – it appeared that the President understood or was 
20 
satisfied… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your explanation. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With my explanations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I was under the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 71 of 216 
 
impression that he was going to – to announce that he is no longer 
proceeding with the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Inquiry. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With the inquiry after I had 
given him all the information and the explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But then to my surprise 
then he then insisted that no [indistinct] you have to – you have to 
leave let us talk about the settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you said that – you said something to the 
10 
effect that whenever – when you met with him I do not know whether on 
the one occasion or subsequently but when you explained everything to 
him he seemed to have no problem with the explanation you gave him. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you said that he seemed to be under some other 
pressure. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Pressure yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because then subsequently he would act in a manner 
that was not in accordance with how you understood him to receive 
your explanation before. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what – that is what you said. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you – is your evidence that it was during 
2014 that he raised the issue of you vacating the office?  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 72 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just to assist in that regard.  At 
page 218 of the supplementary bundle EE6 it appears that your 
representations in regard to the suspension issue are dated the 1 s t 
August 2014.  Page 218. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Does that help you in relation to 
the timing of the discussions?  Your application… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would have been more or less 
around this time. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Around this time yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Then if we can go back to 
page 146 please.   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 5.7.  This is once 
again the former President’s affidavit.  He says: 
“Section 12.8 of the NPA Act provides that the NDPP 
may request to vacate his or her office for any 
20 
reason which the President deems sufficient.” 
He then says in the next sentence. 
“Nxasana made the request to me to vacate his 
office.” 
Is that correct? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 73 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is not correct Chair.  I 
did not have – never made any request. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He goes on to say: 
“Nxasana made it plain that the discord in the NPA 
largely rested on the senior management not sharing 
his strategic views and the disciplinary steps or 
criminal charges which he intended taking against 
certain of the senior managers.  This posited 
intractable disputes paralysing the proper functioning 
of the NPA.” 
10 
Do you have any comment on the accuracy of those statements? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair these – these 
statements are not correct and I repeat Chair that I at no stage and the 
President his advisors, the Ministers of Justice both Radebe and 
Masutha if they still have conscience they know very well that at no 
stage did I make a request to vacate office. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The issue of taking action 
against certain senior managers and you have referred to the conduct 
of Messrs Jiba and Mwrebi how could that have been resolved other 
than through your resignation? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair that issue could 
have been resolved by the President himself instituting an inquiry into 
their fitness to hold office not my resignation because we know that 
even after I had left I mean there was a Mokgoro Inquiry.  I mean it did 
not resolve the issue.  I left but still there was a need to hold that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 74 of 216 
 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Which was the Mokgoro 
Commission which was appointed by President – the current President 
Ramaphosa and not the – and not President Zuma himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In paragraph 5.7 in the second sentence the former 
President said: 
“Nxasana made the request to me to vacate his 
office.” 
We have dealt with that.  You said you never made such a request but 
10 
then he says in the next sentence: 
“Nxasana made it plain that the discord in the NPA 
largely rested on the senior management not sharing 
his strategic views and the disciplinary steps or 
criminal charges which he intended taking against 
certain of the senior managers.” 
Do you want to deal specifically with the statement that you made it 
plain to him that the discord in the NPA largely rested on the senior 
management not sharing your strategic views? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I never said that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never said that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No.  I do not even know 
what strategic views the President is referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And then he says: 
“And the disciplinary steps or criminal charges which 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 75 of 216 
 
he intended taking against certain of the senior 
managers.” 
Do you want to say anything about that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair except for the fact 
that I had brought it to the attention of the President that the – the 
legal opinion that I had received from Mr Elias was that here criminal 
charges had to be instituted.  Other than that I – there is nothing that I 
said that may have been – that may have precipitated me asking him to 
vacate office.  I do not understand how that could have resolved the 
issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the last sentence of paragraph 5.7 did 
you say to the President anything along the lines that the disputes – 
that these were intractable disputes that were paralysing the proper 
functioning of the NPA? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair I did not say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have gone a little 
further to say as I understand it Mr Nxasana that the disputes about 
which the President was talking there the former President was talking 
there were they intractable?  Was there a solution?  In relation to 
20 
Messrs Jiba and Mwrebi. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  There was no solution 
Chair.  There were no solutions.  I think the only solution to the 
problems that I had brought to the attention of the President I had 
requested him to institute disciplinary actions against them.  That was 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 76 of 216 
 
going to be the solution and consider suspending them pending that.  
And Chair will recall that at the time I think there were – if my memory 
serves me well Advocate Mwrebi was facing criminal charges of 
defeating the ends of justice and intimidation. I think and there were 
going to be criminal charges added against him.  At some point 
Advocate Jiba herself was also facing criminal charges.  That is in the 
public domain.  But despite all of that they remained in the office. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  One goes to paragraph 
5.8 the former President says in that paragraph: 
“I 
therefore 
deemed 
the 
reasons 
provided 
by 
10 
Nxasana together with the possibility of a protracted 
litigation and the holding of the inquiry not to be in 
the best interests of the National Prosecuting 
Authority Nxasana and the Republic of South Africa 
to be sufficient to allow Nxasana to vacate office.” 
Do you have a comment on that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I see that when we 
finally reach settlement we were quoted part of this paragraph “the 
protracted litigation” save for that Chair I deny that the – the reasons 
that he relies on are the reasons that I furnished him that I made a 
20 
request to vacate office. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well are you implying that you 
did make such a request? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I deny that I made a 
request to vacate office. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 77 of 216 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 5.9 
the former President says: 
“It was plain to me that Nxasana was no longer 
willing to continue as the NDPP and the only 
outstanding issue remained the financial aspects 
relating to his vacating his office.” 
Now let me just ask you two questions there if I may and then you can 
make a general comment.  If you had wanted to vacate your office 
through resignation how would you have made such a request? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I would have made 
10 
the request in writing firstly and secondly I would have insisted - I 
would not have insisted in being paid the remainder of my contract bill 
because it does not make sense that I am the one who wants to resign 
and on the other hand I am making the demand to be paid.  Why should 
I be paid? 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be paid the whole amount for … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The whole amount for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The balance of your contract, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I will not do that Chair and 
I do not even think the President would have agreed to that himself.  
20 
Not even him with the - with his legal advisors I do not think they would 
have agreed to that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was your justification in 
your own mind for saying that you would vacate office only if you were 
paid for the full term of - full term of your office?  What was your 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 78 of 216 
 
reason for doing so? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  My - my reason Chair was 
that I was of the view that I was - since the President was the 
appointing authority to me it was a question of an employer who is 
breaching the contract and if he is breaching the contract and he wants 
me out of my job without me having done anything. 
Then the consequences must - that he must pay for that.  It is 
consequential.  That was my basis for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - in other words was your understanding - was that 
request based on your understanding that if you are - if an employee is 
10 
employed for a fixed term contract … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In your case it was 10 years as I understand the 
position … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the employee is asked to leave the employ of the 
employer before the end of that period - fixed term and there is no fault 
on the part of the employee.  The employee is entitled to be paid for 
the balance of the contract period. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That - that was - that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your - that was based on that understanding 
of the law on your part? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course you are an attorney? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 79 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had practiced for a long time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And just to add Chair - 
perhaps Chair just to add because I see - I have seen in the media it is 
categorised as golden handshake.  I mean there are many names given 
to it.  In the Constitutional Court Justice Madlanga referred to the fact 
that I was given a stick and a carrot - a stick and a carrot - but Chair 
for me it boils down to one thing. 
The President when we are negotiating that settlement the - I 
10 
am vindicated by the correspondence that the court used in coming to 
the conclusion that I - at no stage did I make a request.  Again I did not 
put any barrel of a gun at anyone to - to pay me that - that money.  
There was litigation going on and based on the litigation as well and 
the fact that I was literally fired before with no - no fault on my part. 
Chair I - it is my view that I - I felt that I was - I was entitled 
to defend my - my rights and my interests as well as a - as a human 
being. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I must just mention this for what it is worth.  I 
- for quite some time I did not understand the judgment of the 
20 
Constitutional Court to have decided - to have made any finding or 
reached any conclusion as to whether you made the request that the 
President said you had made to him to vacate office. 
That is the one point.  The second point is there is a - a 
passage to which Mr Pretorius did refer you to - a passage to which 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 80 of 216 
 
Mr Pretorius referred you in the judgment of the Constitutional Court 
which may be construed - and I put no higher than maybe - maybe 
construed as implying that it was saying that you may never make that 
request. 
That is the passage where the court said that you had 
throughout the negotiations made it clear that you were not prepared to 
- you were only prepared to resign if you paid the whole - for the 
balance of the - of the period of appointment.  If I recall it correctly.  
That is the passage that was referred to earlier … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But having said that I think also I have noticed that 
when you look at the judgment it does say that the matter was argued 
before the Constitutional Court on the basis of an acceptance by 
everybody concerned.  That it was - it was argued on the basis or if it 
was not argued on the basis of a request to vacate office in terms of 
Section 12.  If I recall correctly. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just mention these things because I am not 
necessarily sure that it is correct to say the Constitutional Court made 
a finding that you never made the request but the judgment is there.  
20 
One can look at it and - and so on.  I - I leave it at that but if you do 
want to say something in terms of your own understanding.  Feel free to 
do so. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you do want to say something or not really? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 81 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Oh 
Chair 
when 
my 
understanding of the judgment is that the - both the majority as well as 
well as the minority judgment found that I did not make a request.  That 
is my understanding of the judgment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Or 
reading 
of 
the 
judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The majority judgment - 
that is why Chair instead of coming to the conclusion that I - instead of 
10 
reinstating me because remember that they reviewed and set aside the 
- the decision - my - the decision of vacating office.  It was reviewed 
and set aside and the appointment of Advocate Abrahams was reviewed 
and set aside. 
The decision to pay me was also reviewed and set aside but 
then the court - the majority decision faced now with the - a - a 
decision to order my reinstatement decided to invoke the provisions of 
the Constitution the just and equitableness provisions.  Then they said 
that it is not just and equitable that I be reinstated in the position. 
That being influenced by the fact that if I remember well they 
20 
said I was not entirely wholly in the whole event because I - I was also 
part of an unlawful settlement - so to say- settlement agreement.  Then 
they criticised me for being part of that simply because I am an 
attorney of longstanding but I was represented also and the President 
was also represented. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 82 of 216 
 
There were legal advisors but I also do not want to say much 
about the - their judgment.  Save to say that I disagree with it but I - I 
respect it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I was just - as you were talking I was listening 
but I was just looking for the part where I understood the court to be 
saying that the matter was being argued - was not being argued on the 
basis of the - the section that required the request but it is fine.  One 
can always find it some other time but you - you have had a chance to 
put on record your understanding of what it says? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But Chair perhaps to say 
one thing I think it is also very important Chair to remember I heard 
Chair - the Chair saying that at the inquiry the fact that the inquiry was 
established.  If I was exonerated as I strongly believed and felt that I 
was going to be exonerated at the Commission of Inquiry that at the 
time one cannot say with all certainty that if I was exonerated at the 
inquiry then I would have been reinstated with my position. 
I 
say 
that 
because 
of 
what 
had 
happened 
to 
Advocate Vusi Pikoli. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is public knowledge.  We 
know that he was subjected to the Commission of Inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He was exonerated … 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 83 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But what happened to him? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I found myself having to 
fight that because they wanted him out and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ultimately … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He - he was out of the 
office. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I mean the powers that be 
if they wield political power … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And financial muscle … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They do everything within 
their power … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To drain you up to the last 
20 
energy then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And I expected the courts 
to take that into consideration as well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 84 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But unfortunately they did 
not.  That is my comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so - well what I said was that the fact that there 
was an inquiry instituted was not a basis for anybody to think that 
necessarily the inquiry would reach a conclusion that would require you 
to vacate office … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the point you are making is there was a precedent 
… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of which an NDPP who had been exonerated 
by an inquiry similar to yours … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was nevertheless dismissed … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Removed from office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Removed from office … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore when we look at the inquiry that you 
were facing we must remember that there was this precedent of which 
you were aware. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair which 
I also raised … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In my papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 85 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair in relation to the issue you 
have just raised may I refer you to paragraph 24 of the judgment on 
page 100 but that statement of Justice Madlanga should be read in the 
context of what is said at paragraph 12 on page 95 and paragraph 25 
on page 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry the statement is in paragraph? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  24 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  24. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On page 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think that is the statement I was looking for. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Crucially he says at paragraph 24: 
“The hearing before us - at the hearing before us it 
was no longer in dispute that Mr Nxasana had 
vacated office …” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Had not vacated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “…had not vacated office in terms of 
Section 12(8).  The contest concerned the question 
20 
whether the manner in which he vacated office was 
lawful.  The applicants argued that Mr Nxasana 
vacated office in a manner that was at odds with the 
Constitution and the law.  Advocate Abrahams and 
the NPA argued that an NDPP is not precluded from 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 86 of 216 
 
vacating office voluntarily otherwise than under 
Section 12(8).  Mr Nxasana on the other hand 
accepted that his vacation of office was not 
constitutionally compliant.” 
Ja.  I think it - it would have - whatever he says will have to 
be read in the context of the whole judgment … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think I also do recall that he specifically says - 
you see the - he specifically says that: 
“They do not decide whether an NDPP may lawfully 
10 
vacate office outside of the provisions of 12(8).” 
But I think we will look at it at the right time, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the factual finding 
as to whether … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nxasana made such a 
request.  There are factual findings in paragraphs 12 and 25 by way of 
an example and in fact throughout the judgment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
But 
I 
suppose 
had 
the 
20 
Constitutional Court been subject to a further appeal to the House of 
Lords or wherever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair then one might argue 
whether those statements were arbiter or otherwise … 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 87 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And I think that is the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were they central to the 
judgment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were they collateral to the 
judgment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is now quarter past 11.  
10 
We have exceeded the two hours.  I do have two topics still to deal with 
which should not take longer than 20 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us deal with - with them and finish … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then take the tea break after that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Just 
two 
further 
issues 
Mr Nxasana.  If we can go please to paragraph 8 of your main 
statement.  Sorry it is paragraph 81.  Just to summarise what your own 
20 
allegations are after having dealt with all the correspondence evidence, 
the statements of the former President. 
In paragraph 81 you explain - and I think you have done this 
in evidence before - why you negotiated a settlement agreement.  In 
paragraph 82.1 on page 22 of your affidavit in the first sentence you 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 88 of 216 
 
make a statement about the source of the dispute giving rise to the 
settlement.  What was that dispute as you - as you describe it in any 
event? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you Chair.  The 
source of the dispute was that the President wanted me to vacate the 
office of the NDPP and I did not want to leave. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  The - the understanding of what the 
dispute was that was being settled is quite important.  So - so that - 
that is the dispute as you understood it … 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was being settled.  Is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then in 82.6 you make a 
further statement.  What is that statement? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I - I said Chair after all the 
negotiations - the settlement negotiations - I ultimately came to resign 
to - but then say here that: 
“All of this did not change the simple fact that the 
20 
settlement agreement was not and was never 
intended to be concluded - to constitute a request 
on my part to vacate office in terms of Section 12(8) 
of the NPA Act.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright that is your conclusion? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 89 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is my conclusion 
Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we can go then to paragraph 
85 and following.  After the conclusion of the settlement agreement the 
litigation to which we have been referring throughout your testimony 
took place.  Is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in paragraph 86 you say 
that you were served with papers in the application Corruption Watch, 
Freedom Under Law vs the President and Various Other Parties. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Did you have a meeting 
with 
the 
then 
Minister 
of 
State 
Security 
Minister Mahlobo 
on 
22 October 2015? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happened at this meeting? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Let us just Chair for the 
sake of the record these papers that I was served with they are 
basically the application to review and set aside the settlement 
agreement.  Just for the purpose of the record. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then I received the papers 
and I did not do anything about them.  I think the - was it Freedom 
Under Law and Corruption Watch.  Then subsequently I received a call 
from the then Minister of State Security Minister Mahlobo who 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 90 of 216 
 
requested to see - to see me. 
He was in Durban.  I met with him in Durban at the Beverly 
Hills Hotel and I remember on the day … 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he called you did he ask to have a meeting with 
you? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did he say what it was going to be about at 
the time of the call? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No he did not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Explain.  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew each other? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Chair 
yes.  
Minister Mahlobo and I actually knew each other from our days at the 
University of Zululand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were students at the same time at the University 
… 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Zululand? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  We were students, ja 
and I went to meet him.  I remember that he even drove with me in my 
car to eBandla Hotel which is in Ballito.  I remember on that day there 
was going to be a - he was going to be a speaker in a workshop that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 91 of 216 
 
was 
organised 
by 
then 
Premier 
of 
KZN 
the 
Honourable 
Mr Senzo Mchunu. 
We discussed some issues and then he asked me to meet 
with - he arranged with his Chief of Staff who I also know him very well 
Mr Maduna - to arrange that I meet with Mr Hulley on the next day.  He 
knew that I did not want to see Mr Hulley anymore because he had let 
me down. 
Then I met with Mr Hulley and Mr Maduna at the Beverly Hills 
the next day over breakfast and at that meeting Mr Hulley then 
suggested to me that - he asked me if I was aware of the - of the 
10 
litigation by - brought by Freedom Under Law and Corruption Watch and 
what is it that I was doing about it.  Then I made it clear to him that I 
have seen the papers but you know I do not have energy anymore to 
deal with all these issues. 
I have not done anything.  I do not have money.  I do not 
have time to get involved in all of this.  Then he suggested to me that I 
should work together with the President Zuma and he even offered to 
pay my legal costs including costs of senior counsel but then - I then 
made it very clear to him that you see I do not know to what extent you 
want me to work with Mr Zuma - President Zuma - because I will just - I 
20 
will adopt a position where I will sit and wait to see what he has - he 
has to say in answering this because he is the one who must answer. 
That was my view.  He is the one who must answer this 
because he knows that I never made the request and I said to the 
extent that perhaps I will have a look.  He then assured me that there 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 92 of 216 
 
is a draft response or answering affidavit.  They have drafted it but 
they have not yet served and filed and he assured me that in that draft 
affidavit there is - there is nowhere where President Zuma alleges that 
I made a request to vacate office. 
Then I said well we concluded the meeting by agreeing that 
he was going to share the draft with me - President Zuma’s draft.  I will 
have to go to - to read it and see to what extent then I would consider 
taking that offer of working together.  So where I will be - where my 
legal costs would be contributed but Chair I pointed out to him that you 
see the problem is the way I look at the application - because I had 
10 
read it. 
I said the problem is because I gathered that he wanted me 
to - to confirm or to help President Zuma saying that I made a request 
to vacate office but then I made it clear at that meeting that that I will 
not say.  I cannot say that because I cannot mislead if I remember what 
I said.  I said I am an officer of the court and I cannot mislead the court 
and you know very well that that is not what happened and I am not 
going to put - that - that is when he then assured me that there was 
nothing in the draft affidavit.  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was nothing along those lines? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Along those lines … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the draft affidavit? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the draft affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you make any reference to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 93 of 216 
 
correspondence in that conversation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I made - I made 
reference to correspondence.  Chair remember that most of the 
correspondence from - that emanated from my attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I was also involved in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In drafting it. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In drafting those letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I knew very well … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  What was in the letters.  
Then I pointed out to him that there are - there is correspondence 
where it is clearly - it clearly proves that I did not make any request to 
the President.  It is - it is there in black and white and we - we had 
filed it. 
He assured me nevertheless but then Chair later on fast 
forward I then - I waited for that - for that draft affidavit.  I did not 
follow it up.  I mean it was up to them but then I later received a call.  I 
remember I was driving along M13 in Durban joining - about to join N3.  
20 
I think I was driving to the office in Durban. 
I received a call from a - a journalist who then asked me if I 
was aware that the President has served and filed the affidavit - his 
answering affidavit.  I said no I am not aware.  Then he said to me it is 
very interesting that in his affidavit he then says that you make a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 94 of 216 
 
request to - to vacate office. 
Chair I immediately  phoned my wife at work, I couldn’t wait to get to 
the office, I phoned my wife at work and I then told her about – this 
news, I then asked her to download that affidavit and email it to me 
immediately and she read it, she’s a lawyer herself, she’s an Attorney, I 
also read it and we were very disappointed and our disappointment, 
Chair, was purely based on the fact that – I was so disappointed and I 
was angry that despite what they had done to me and now I am back in 
my hometown and they’re still doing all these things and the one thing 
– they called me to this meeting they made this undertaking again, 
10 
they’re being dishonest.   I then decided to approach Minister Mahlobo, 
I came – I went to see him at his residence in Waterkloof then I told 
him about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You came to Pretoria? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes, I also – my family is 
here in Midrand as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What was the purpose of you 
contacting Minister Mahlobo? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I raised the issue of my 
20 
disappointment of what I had discovered that despite Mr Hulley having 
assured me that there was nothing along the lines in the draft affidavit, 
firstly that he was going to share the draft affidavit and he failed to do 
that and secondly that the averments about me in the affidavit, which 
they know very well, including him, Mahlobo that it is not correct.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 95 of 216 
 
Immediately Chair, whilst I was there he then called Minister Masutha 
and he raised the issue with him and said, hey you have – I’m with 
Nxasana here and he’s complaining about what has happened why did 
you put this in the affidavit.  I got the sense that the answer from 
Minister Masutha was that he was advised that I had accepted that 
version, which was not correct.   I said to him – you see now I have to 
put up my affidavit, I know I am late I did not file I only filed the notice 
to oppose and I did not file my answering affidavit, then I said, I have 
to consult my lawyers so that we set the record straight which then 
culminated in me filing what we termed the explanatory affidavit that we 
10 
filed in the High Court setting the record straight that I did not make 
that request. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You go first. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You might be asking what I want to ask. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    After the telephone call 
between Minister Mahlobo and the then Minister Masutha, did Minister 
Mahlobo tell you what Minister Masutha had said? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What was that? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    He said – Minister 
Mahlobo said to me that Minister Masutha that is what he was told, he 
was told that they had engaged me and I agreed to that version, I 
confirmed that this is what happened and…[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    What version? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 96 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    The version that I made a 
request to vacate office which I then denied. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And how did your meeting with Minister Mahlobo end 
in terms of this issue? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair it ended – I pointed 
out to him that I have to file my affidavit now because this has – I told 
him that this will tarnish my image because it is wrong and I am now 
going to make sure that I consult my legal representatives to assist me 
in drawing the affidavit and set the record straight, which we, ultimately 
did and unfortunately our affidavit was rejected in the High Court. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    In the High Court? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes well, you will remember that last time we did 
have a look – I hope my recollection is correct, we did have a look at 
the correspondence that was exchanged between your attorneys and 
either the President or his advisors, Miss Makhene and Mr Hulley 
between the end – towards the end of November/December 2014, 
January/February and so on in 2015 and that in your attorney’s letter of 
the 3 r d of November 2014, I think it was quite made clear that you 
thought that there was no basis for  you to vacate office and  you did 
20 
not want to do that.  That was repeated in their letter of 10 December 
2014 which they sent to, I think Miss Makhene and I think Miss 
Makhene – I don’t know whether she replied on the 12 t h of December or 
in January, I think we looked at the question whether there was any 
reference to you having made a request from Miss Makhene’s 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 97 of 216 
 
correspondence to your attorneys and from Mr Hulley’s correspondence 
to you or your attorneys and we couldn’t find anything.  So the question 
I want to ask is, when did you hear for the first time that the 
President’s version or that the President was saying that you had 
requested – you had made a request to him to vacate office, when did 
you hear that for the first time and from whom? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair I heard for the first 
time from the journalist who called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, now you said you, in your meeting I thought 
you said in your meeting with Mr Hulley there was a discussion between 
10 
the two of you about the request and Mr Hulley assured you that the 
draft affidavit of the President that he said was already there, did not 
have such an allegation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair, I was 
concerned when he made that approach to me to work with the 
President and my inclination, I mean it was clear to me, I point it out 
because I was concerned that the only thing – the only way out for the 
President in this whole thing was to say I made a request to vacate 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry, just repeat that sentence? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair after reading the 
papers, as a lawyer, for the President to defend himself, the only 
plausible explanation was to say Mr Nxasana – I spoke to Mr Nxasana 
and he made a request to vacate office in terms of Section 12 (8). That 
could have been the plausible explanation.  Then when Hulley 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 98 of 216 
 
approached me with a request to work with the President in this matter 
I had concerns that the President was stuck at the time because time to 
file, to respond had gone and passed and he was unable to file his 
answering affidavit.  Hence there was this request and I then sensed 
that this what they want from me.  I raised it with Mr Hulley that, Mr 
Hulley, know what you want from me.  You want me to say – to work 
with the President and say that I made a request because that’s the 
only way to defend – that’s the only way for the President to oppose 
this application.  Then I pointed out to him that he did not deny it 
neither did he agree to it but he did not deny he did not agree to that 
10 
either because I was telling him.  Then I said to him, I cannot say I 
made a request because there is correspondence in my attorney’s files 
which suggest that we have been on record saying that it has never 
been my intention to resign and it’s there, therefore I’m not going to 
say anything that may amount to misleading the Court as an Officer of 
the Court.  That is when he assured me that there is nothing along 
those lines in the draft affidavit which he then undertook to share it 
with me before they filed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you are saying that it was not Mr Hulley who said 
to you that the President was going to say you had made a request, he 
20 
did not say that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No Chair, he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and you say actually he did not talk about a 
request before you raised the issue of the request yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes he did not. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 99 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you say you are the one who raised the issue of 
a request and you did so because you understood that the only defence 
that the President could have was one that would be based on saying 
you had made a request? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And then he assured you, this is Mr Hulley, that the 
draft affidavit he was talking about did not make such an averment? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct which 
later on proved to be not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So – but the meeting with Mr Hulley preceded the 
10 
telephone call from the journalist? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Just briefly after the meeting 
with Mr Hulley and during that meeting you’ve told the Chair that you 
referred to correspondence.  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    In the possession of your 
attorney. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Did you take any steps to 
obtain that correspondence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair, I then, faced 
with this problem now where my name has been dragged into this where 
allegations were made by the President in an affidavit that I made a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 100 of 216 
 
request, then I contacted my attorneys Mr Mabunda requesting the – I 
told him about what had happened and I requested my file because I 
wanted to prepare the affidavit and set the record straight.  Chair to my 
surprise Mr Mabunda searched for my files everywhere, he said he 
searched for my files at his home, in his office, in the boot of his car 
and my files were not found but then Chair, as I pointed out previously, 
that would have been the first point of call – first thing to do, to go to 
my lawyers but I had made precautions, I had kept – like I don’t have 
only – yesterday I was consulting  with the evidence leader, I brought 
my own file, I do have these things, I put them at different places for 
10 
safe keeping.  Then I had to retrieve my files from where I had kept 
them, other files and I got the impression that, Chair, I can say that is 
my view, that the reason why the President felt it necessary to put this 
averment about me in the affidavit and say that I made a request and 
for him and Mr Hulley not to share the draft affidavit after having made 
an undertaking to do that, I think it cannot be a coincidence that my file 
went missing.  He was confident when he deposed to that affidavit that 
there would not be this correspondence to prove that I had not made 
the request, unfortunately I had taken precautions, I had. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Finally Mr Nxasana in 
20 
paragraphs 93 to 95 you make certain brief conclusions, is there 
anything you wish to tell the Chair about what happened under your 
watch and its effect on the NPA as a whole? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair, briefly my 
conclusions are briefly that, political and external interference in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 101 of 216 
 
decision making at the NPA undermined its integrity and effectiveness 
and served to erode public confidence in the organisation and also the 
failure to act decisively against Advocates Jiba and Magwebe in 
particular harmed the organisation and in my view the Parliamentary 
Committee on Justice did little or nothing to exercise appropriate 
oversight or intervene in the issues and Chair, I stress, in the issues 
concerning Advocates Jiba and Magwebe at least while I was in the 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you bring these issues concerning Mrs Jiba and 
Mr Magwebe to the attention of the Portfolio Committee on Justice? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair the Portfolio 
Committee on Justice were very much aware of the issues and what 
would usually happen there, when the members, especially the 
members of the Committee who happened to be members of the 
opposition parties wanted to raise these issues, then they would be 
brushed aside and they would not be entertained, that was my 
observation Chair and the issues were in the public domain. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
 
Ja know 
the 
issue 
were in 
the 
public 
domain…[intervenes]. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    The Portfolio Committee 
20 
have a – inherent powers, had inherent powers to intervene and deal 
with issues that are in the public domain which affects the operation of 
the NPA, that is their role. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So are you saying that you did not raise these 
issues with the Portfolio Committee on Justice but nevertheless you say 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 102 of 216 
 
they would have been aware of these issues because the issues were 
in the public domain and they should have dealt with them, that’s the 
one point, is that the one point you’re making and the other one being 
that you are aware that even though you didn’t refer these issues to the 
Portfolio Committee you are aware that members of opposition parties 
did raise these issues but they were brushed aside in that committee, 
are those the two points you are making? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well I…[intervenes]. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair and over and above 
10 
that Chair, and when I left Chair, I signed off the annual report and in 
the annual report that I signed off which I saw in his response to the – 
when Advocate Shaun Abrahams filed, I think he’s answering affidavit 
in the, was it the High Court either in the High Court or in the 
Constitutional Court he decided to choose to call – to refer to the 
annual report because we also made mention – referred to the annual 
report because in the annual report I dealt also with the conduct of 
Advocates Jiba and Magwebe but then I remember seeing something in 
the answering affidavit of Advocate  Shaun Abrahams referring to that 
thing as nothing more than my – something like my statement and that 
20 
it would not have been in the annual report but basically he was 
attacking me for having included my observations, my overview of what 
happened at the NPA because I felt it was necessary that it should form 
part of the report under my leadership. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well the point you have made about what the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 103 of 216 
 
Portfolio Committee on Justice may or may not have done is quite 
important because I have publically said that I believe that, if at the 
end of the work of the Commission, I come to the conclusion for 
example with regard to State Capture, your situation might or might not 
have anything to do with State Capture, to the extent that I might 
conclude that there was State Capture.  One of the issues I would have 
to look at is, what were various bodies doing which may have had an 
obligation to do certain things and that would include Parliament to the 
extent that Parliament has got a constitutional obligation of oversight, 
was it playing its oversight obligations properly.   Obviously it’s not just 
10 
a question of State Capture the levels of corruption in the country and 
how certain things were done if they have an obligation of oversight, 
when did they become aware, what did they do and whether there was a 
failure to perform their constitutional obligations properly on the part of 
members of Parliament or some members of Parliament because of 
other considerations and if so, what are those considerations and what 
should this Commission recommend should be done to fix that so that, 
should we have similar situations in the future, Parliament would be 
able to perform its duties properly.  So what you say whether the 
Justice Portfolio Committee played its role properly is quite important 
20 
from that perspective. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    That’s the evidence Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes I think I’ve got just a few questions to wrap up 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 104 of 216 
 
Mr Nxasana.  Now you have told me that you never made any request 
to the President that he should allow you to vacate office but after the 
settlement agreement had been concluded did you submit a letter of 
resignation as NDPP or anything?  I think the settlement agreement had 
a clause to the effect that you were going to relinquish the position of 
NDPP so I want to know how that – what that form that took, the 
relinquishing of that position? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That was the only 
document I signed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You did not put in any resignation letter? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No resignation letter 
where I put up my reasons for resignation as required by the NPA Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You simply vacated the office in terms of that 
settlement? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair, in fact, I 
remember even when I – on the day when I signed that settlement 
agreement Chair, there was a lot of pressure and I signed it as I 
pointed out previously, I signed that settlement agreement at Mr 
Hulley’s office at Umhlanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    And strangely at the time, 
when I signed it, Mr Hulley even suggested that, why do I not leave 
immediately and not wait until the end of May and I refused.  Chair I 
tell you why I refused that, because during the time, I got the sense 
that, I may be wrong, but I strongly believe that the reason why he 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 105 of 216 
 
raised that was because at the time I was busy with a review 
notwithstanding the fact that we had reached the settlement agreement 
in terms of which I had to leave office by the end of May 2015 but I was 
busy, I had appointed Advocate Gerrie Nel to review the matter one, Mr 
Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes and I found it very 
strange and odd that I am now being requested to leave immediately 
when I’m still busy with a matter – as sensitive as that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And the settlement agreement contemplated that you 
would leave at the end of May? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    At the end of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I then ignored it and I left 
at the end of May, unfortunately at the time when I left I had not taken 
the decision to reinstate charges against Mr Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, you said that at the time that Mr Hulley 
suggested or asked – suggested that you leave immediately after 
20 
signing the settlement agreement you were busy – you were in the 
process of reviewing the matter of Mr Panday, what had happened in 
that matter, what were you reviewing, I’m not talking about the facts 
had there been charges against him that were withdrawn or he had 
been charged and you were reviewing whether he should have been 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 106 of 216 
 
charged? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair that is the 
matter which, I think, General Booysen testified about. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    It’s a matter involving Mr 
Panday it’s fraud and corruption charges and that matter also in a way 
some connection with the former Commissioner of Police in KZN and it 
also involved her husband and that at the centre of it was this Mr Pillay 
and a decision…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Mr Panday. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Sorry Mr Panday, a 
decision was taken not to prosecute Mr Panday or to withdraw charges 
against Mr Panday and I then received a request to review the decision 
of the DPP KZN from, amongst others, I remember I received from 
General Booysen and also the then head of the Priority – the Hawks 
which was General Dramat at the time and Chair we – I then decided to 
rope in Advocate Gerhard Nel.  Our preparations were at a very 
advanced stage at the time, such that indications were that we were 
going to reinstate charges but then we had to allow the process to give 
the other side to make representations and just before I left, Mr 
20 
Panday’s advocate had [indistinct] us with voluminous representations 
that we had to go through and unfortunately my time came that I had to 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay now when you accepted the appointment as 
NDPP, were you a sole practitioner at the time, I know that you have 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 107 of 216 
 
told us that you are a sole practitioner now. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair, I 
have always been a sole practitioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now what happened to your practice when you had 
to – when you accepted the appointment? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Chair because I didn’t 
know that I was going to be appointed and it all happened very quickly I 
had to resort in abandoning my practice by abandoning in inverted 
commas because there is some processes of closing down the practice 
and I couldn’t close the practice down and I couldn’t sell it, I then 
10 
asked a – I gave it to a colleague with all my clients and everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes basically you donated? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I gave away and when I 
came back from the NPA …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes that’s what I also want to know how – when you 
came back what was the position, in other words you gave your practice 
to another attorney? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    While you – after you had accepted appointment as 
NDPP. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you no longer, as you continued at the NPA you 
no longer had a practice of your own? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 108 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    And Chair the problem 
with the clientele is once they get to know a new legal practitioner they 
stick…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They get attached to that one. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   They get attached to 
them, I lost, in the process lots of clients and I am starting afresh but 
that was not the only problem because even when, after I had left NPA 
because of the applications that were brought by Freedom under Law 
and Corruption Watch I found myself in a predicament of going back to 
practice, I couldn’t take a decision to re-open at the time because I 
10 
didn’t know my fate whether I would be reinstated, as I pointed out I’m 
still willing to go back to the NPA.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Then I had to wait until 
the whole process of this litigation had completed then it was – only 
then that I made a decision that the only way of earning a living for me 
that I know is to practice as an attorney and things are very tough in 
Durban, it’s not easy, you ask anyone who practices in Durban it’s – 
when I got back I found that things have changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now you were appointed in August 2013 as NDPP 
20 
but the appointment was to be effect from 1 September 2013, is that 
right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    1 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:    1 October? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 109 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    But the appointment was in August? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, 1 October then 2014 and you only left the 
position of NDPP in 2015. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    End of May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:    End of May 2015, so you spent about what, two and 
a half years at the NPA? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Less than two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Less than two years? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay my arithmetic is not good okay so then when 
you left you were going to be paid a certain amount of money, you were 
paid that amount of money? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    How did you earn a living after you had left the 
NPA? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I had to live on the 
money that I was paid Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You used that money to…[intervenes]. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Earn a living. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, so you did not – you had no practice to go back 
to? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Not at that sage Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    At that stage? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Ja at that stage Chair 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 110 of 216 
 
what I then ultimately did, I then went back to the colleague that I had 
given my practice to. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    And I asked to serve 
under him as a professional assistant. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    And he wold then send 
me wherever he wanted…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And he agreed? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you moved from a position where, before you 
were approached and offered the position of being NDPP, and where 
you had not applied to anybody for the position of NDPP, you were 
approached, you had a practice that you were running,  you accepted 
this appointment because you wanted to serve,  you couldn’t sell your 
practice but you effectively gave it to somebody, to another attorney so 
that the clients could be taken care for a certain period close to- or 
about one and a half years or under two years you were at the NDPP 
and then you came back, you had not practice anymore because you 
had given your practice to somebody else, and you then had to go to 
20 
him and ask him if he could employ you as a assistant? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And then he agreed. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    He agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just so that you could earn something? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 111 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes and also just to keep 
me going Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and that position continued until when? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Unfortunately Chair he 
also decided to leave Durban, I think it was August 2018 he went to 
practice in Pinetown and I decided to remain in Durban because the set 
up in Durban, I’m originally from Umlasi Township which it the biggest 
township in KZN and most of my clients is based in that area and the 
nearest city id Durban and it’s easy to get to Durban from all townships 
and areas around Durban.  It’s a big city I prefer – then I remained 
10 
there then I decided then to negotiate with another colleague who I had 
worked with at NPA as one of my advisors also, Mr Duma who also then 
subsequently resigned at NPA after I’d left and went back to private 
practice, I then approached him and asked the same favour with him 
and it continued until the Constitutional Court passed the – this 
judgment.  Thereafter I then decided to – I only opened last year I think 
it was around September. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes was this now like opening a new practice? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I’m opening a new 
practice altogether. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Altogether? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes under a different 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is there any significance to different name, not 
really? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 112 of 216 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No I’m saying – not really 
because it’s the same person who is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so how did – and then of course the 
Constitutional Court decided that you should pay back the money. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And as I recall the judgment it contemplated that 
you would pay back the whole amount that had been given to you, is 
that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But in the meantime you had used some of the 
10 
money to earn a living? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    I had used it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Have you paid back that money? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No you – why is that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Because I don’t have it 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t have the money? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay no that’s fine, I just wanted to understand 
20 
what impact this may have had on your life, thank you very much.  
Anything arising Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes thank you very much Mr Nxasana we appreciate

Commission what happened, thank you very much. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Thanks Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:    You are excused thank you.  We are going to take 
the tea adjournment now but I think we’ll take a little more than fifteen 
minutes to also allow for whatever logistical arrangements may be 
made or do you think fifteen minutes will be enough? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I can’t say Chair [indistinct mic 
switched off]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Next trance of evidence which 
10 
will be the SABC evidence.

REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Norman are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good afternoon Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes good afternoon. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Yes thank you.  I am ready 
thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairman today we continue with the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 114 of 216 
 
evidence of the SABC the Chair would recall that initially we called the 
– we led the evidence of Mr Sundaram and that of Mr Scott.  So we 
continue from that evidence.  But Chair has in front of him quite a 
number of documents which I may with your leave Chair just identify 
quickly?  Chair you – the continuation for the SABC is CC Chair had 
what had placed before Chair Chair will see that CC5 was once placed 
before Chair at the time when Mr Sundaram and Mr Scott were 
testifying but then we continue from there Chair. We have CC6 which 
continues up to 16 – Volume 16 the volumes are in the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that the Exhibits relating to SABC come 
10 
under Exhibit CC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of them yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of them? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  All of them Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we have Exhibit CC1 up to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Up to 24 as of today Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But those that have been handed in. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Already are… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Up to 5. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to Exhibit CC5? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If Chair could admit those and we will 
identify them as and when the witnesses testify and they are before the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 115 of 216 
 
Registrar most of them. Chair might I just indicate that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are they going to be out of sequence?  I see Exhibit 
CC23 here but also the files that I have got here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two of them do not indicate on the spine what exhibit 
other than they are – what exhibits they are other than that they are 
exhibits CC and then this one reflects that it is Exhibit CC20 and… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It goes up to Exhibit CC24. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  I had opened for Chair – I 
10 
asked Registrar to open for Chair CC24 is the statement of the witness 
that we are going to lead first. The Chairperson Mr Makhathini that is – 
his statement is CC24.  And the one… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we – but we have not been marking the state 
wit – witness statements as Exhibit in themselves is it not? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have been – have we not been marking the whole 
file that contains the statement and the annexures? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair the same team that bundles is the 
same that did this but what they do they would start with the first 
20 
statement.  It would be CC20 and then up to 24 as in this case there is 
a divider in between and that divider highlights that this is 20, this is 
21,  this is 22 to 24 so that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no that – that – the fact that they have done 
that on the spine is helpful. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 116 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the sense that one can see from the spine of the 
file that it contains Exhibit CC20 up to Exhibit CC24. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I was just saying that the way we have done them 
before as I recall. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is for all intents and purposes anything that is in a 
particular file would be under one exhibit number. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we can make do with this arrangement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least because it does show that even though there 
are many exhibits… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Various. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In one file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does indicate which ones they are and where 
they are to be found. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then the Chair they con – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we – but now the only thing is that you said that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 117 of 216 
 
the ones that have been admitted under Exhibit CC go up to CC5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now if we immediately move to Mr Makhathini’s 
evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will be jumping to Exhibit CC20. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will not look very good to anybody reading the 
transcript and trying to follow when you jump from Exhibit CC5 to 
Exhibit 20. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  20 yes.  Chair the – the only explanation I 
have is that the statements are packaged as they are received by the 
team that packages them.  Because you will find that for instance CC5 
Ms Van Biljon’s statement that was received a while ago and then if you 
go to CC6 and you continue with those you will find that those 
statements some of them came quite early but in terms of the 
programming of the witnesses and the way you want to present their 
evidence you find that the one that is supposed to start as all the 
entities have done the Chairperson of the board you will find then his 
statement in 20.  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not the – the fault of the team that is preparing it 
because they do not know how the evidence leaders are going to – 
what their plan is if they are not told. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 118 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say this will be the sequence of the witnesses so 
that then they make it the exhibits to follow that sequence.  We can 
deal with it in this way because trying to redo it would take too much 
time but I think it is going to be important that the evidence leaders 
give them the sequence so that we could start nicely with Exhibit 
CC6,7,8. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words if Mr Makhathini was planned to be 
the first witness today it would have been much more convenient for his 
10 
exhibit to be Exhibit CC6 then we continue rather than start with Exhibit 
20. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And go up to 24 maybe the next one would be Exhibit 
6, 7, 8 and then it becomes mixed up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is fine.  Let us do it this way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But going forward will the legal team please make 
sure that we follow the sequence that will be followed in actual hearing. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes then Chair you will have the – if I may 
just highlight to Chair the one bundle – the bundles CC24 which is a 
very large exhibit that is the statement of Mr Zikode which has ten 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 119 of 216 
 
lever arch files.  That will not be dealt with this week Chair but it is not 
in front of Chair now it is before the Registrar. These are the many files 
that are there.  And Chair will observe that the – the other bundle that 
has the legislation it is simply Exhibit CC and then it says legislation 
bundle.  And the reports and other documents also Exhibit CC and 
without the exhibit number because we reserving those numbers for the 
witnesses but now that we could perhaps give them Exhibit legislation 
bundle make it Exhibit 25 and then the Exhibit CC Reports we can make 
it Exhibit 26.  The other reports and documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are – you are requesting that the one for 
10 
legislation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be Exhibit CC? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  25 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  25. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the one for Reports and other documents to be 
Exhibit CC26. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I beg your pardon, I beg your 
pardon.  Could you make this – Exhibit CC Legislation 26.  I beg your 
20 
pardon.  There is a document I am going to hand up to you which is 
already marked 25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the one for legislation would be Exhibit 26. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  26 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CC26. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 120 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the other one 27.  Yes thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay then the one for reports and other documents 
will be Exhibit CC27. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As Chair pleases.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just arrange for these to be marked accordingly 
during the lunch break. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They be marked.  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just share the information with other members of the 
legal team.  It – so that the issue of making sure that the exhibit 
10 
numbers are in line with the sequence of witnesses called. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  I will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair the – there are just two other 
exhibits that I would like to hand up to you Chair which emanate from 
the events of this weekend.  There is for instance one of the implicated 
persons who has responded I beg leave to hand it up that is CC25.  I 
will just check yes thank you Chair.  He is responding to the evidence 
of some of the witnesses. There are about three witnesses that he 
responds to.  We decided to make his response separate bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this file will be marked Exhibit CC25.  It contains 
the statement or is it statements? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 121 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Statements of … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No it is one statement but responding to 
various 3.3 Notices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well it says statements but it is the statement of 
Mr James Bradford Matthews that file will be marked Exhibit CC25. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I am – sorry.  There are two 
statements from one person.  I think when you asked is two statements 
– there is two statements if Chair has a look at the index there is one 
where he responds to one person and the other one where he responds 
to another person.  So it is two statements. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  By the same person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  And then I 
am – I would like to hand up as well these documents Chair they have 
been – we have requested them as a result of the events of the 
weekend which the witness is going talk to.  They are Exhibit – we have 
marked them Exhibit CC23A and Exhibit CC23B and also Exhibit 
CC23C.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are they? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They are the media statements and the 
responses that the SABC has also filed and they also contain some of 
the resignation letters of some of the board members.  The witness is 
going to talk to that.  But they will be properly placed in the bundles 
once he has finished testifying. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 122 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you place the bundle for the witness 
in front the witness.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness will know which – which bundle you 
referring to when you refer to them? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When – yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.

just give the Chair your experience where – the boards that you served 
on? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that I may have missed it but maybe Mr 
Makhathini out of humility did not mention all his qualifications he has.  
I see he has got also B Paed Degree. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think I missed it. Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No he has got very good qualifications. He is a 
20 
teacher.  He has got Master’s in Commerce and he has got – but I think 
he was – he was humble. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Yes could you then 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 126 of 216 
 
just explain to Chair where – I see you have served as Executive Board 
member is various companies could you just highlight those please? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes I was an Executive 
board member for a British American Tobacco for Southern Africa.  I 
also serve as Executive board member for South African Breweries.  I 
was a board member for SAB Tri Fund.  Board member for Ekoleni 
Outreach World Outreach Centre advisory board.  I also serve in the 
Sport Trust as a board member.  I was also a board member for 
Industry for Responsible Use of Alcohol.  I also serve as the President 
for Convocation for University of Zululand and the same I was a council 
10 
member for the University of Zululand.  During my days as a student I 
was part of the student representative council for University of 
Zululand.  Those are the positions that I have served in. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And there is one position that we 
spoke about this morning where you served in one organisation that 
involved one of President Zuma’s wives.  Could you just tell the Chair 
about that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes.  I was also the 
Chairperson of the Bongi Ngema Zuma Foundation which is the 
foundation that deals with diabetes.  I serve in that foundation as an 
20 
NGO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In what capacity were you serving? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I was the Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The Chairperson.  Are you still serving? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I got appointed on the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 127 of 216 
 
17 t h October 2017 I resigned on the 18 t h October 2017. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Then in paragraphs 3 
and 4 you deal with the approach that was made to you by the members 
of the commission that is the investigators of the commission and you 
articulate in paragraph 3 the mandate of the SABC.  Could you just 
roughly tell the Chairperson what is your – the mandate of the SABC 
and what is the function of the board in making sure that that mandate 
is carried out? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The South African 
Broadcasting Corporation is one of the key critical pillars of our 
10 
democracy delivering content to millions of South Africans on a daily 
basis and they do that basically in fourteen languages and making sure 
that every South African has an opportunity to air their views and be 
covered in one way or the other.  And it is one of the treasures of this 
country that needs to be defended and protected at all costs.  So the 
role of the board really is to provide that strategic direction and 
guidance to the entity.  But also make sure that our – the independence 
of the institution and impartiality is protected at all costs.  But also 
support the executives in executing what has been approved by the 
board. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So – and in terms of accountability 
who is the board – who does the board report to? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  In terms of you would 
have seen in the pack that there was a Matugana judgment which was 
delivered in 2017.  It clearly states that the board of the SABC is in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 128 of 216 
 
charge of the affairs and the running of the business of the SABC.  So 
that is basically where it is and then the executives of course run the 
day to day operational responsibilities sits with the executive team. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But the board is 
accountable to the Minister in terms of meeting what has been agreed 
as the goals that are contained in the shareholder compact.  We then 
report and accountable to the Portfolio Committee in Parliament. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And the executives of the SABC who 
do they report to? 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The executives of the 
SABC which is the Group CEO, CFO and the COO reports into the 
board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Now then I paragraph 5 
you sketch out the circumstances under which are appointed and what 
the position was at the SABC at that time.  Could you just briefly just 
advise the Chair what reports were there when you were appointed 
which you deal with in that paragraph? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I got appointed into the 
board in October 2017 as part of the new board appointed for a period 
20 
of five years.  And the new board basically was handed over the baton 
by the interim board which had had – was running for about six months 
and the interim board came in after the Parliament had adopted the 
final report that was done by the Addo committee.  And that report 
basically looked at the fitness of the board at the time.  And out of that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 129 of 216 
 
inquiry then the interim board was put in place in February 2017.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you also allude in that paragraph to 
the Public Protector’s Report. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes.  The Addo 
Committee Inquiry came after the Public Protector’s Report of 2014 and 
basically that report indicated things that were not going well at the 
SABC so the – Parliament then sent in the Addo Committee to assist in 
doing an inquiry into the fitness of the board at the time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  On your left hand side Mr 
Makhathini there is – you will find there is a bundle which is marked 
10 
Exhibit 27 which is the – ja.  If you have a look at that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because mine are not marked yet. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman you will have to say whether it is the 
reports and other documents one is the legislation one? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  it is the – I beg your pardon Chair it is 
reports and other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  They will be marked by lunch 
time on the spine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  If you turn to 
page 1 of that you will see it is a letter dated the 24 t h June 2019 
addressed to Doctor Puwe [?] of the commission which is submitting 
these reports to the commission from Parliament, do you see that? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 130 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I see it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that letter is dated 24 June from the 
acting secretary Mr P M Chauwe [?]  Are you there? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then once you page 
through you will see there is a divider marked 2. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Has the Chair found it?  
Thank you.  On there you will see there is SABC – if you look right on 
the right hand side corner it is marked in red it is written SABC Report 
10 
other information 002, do you see that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And that document comes 
from Parliament and on the left hand corner it is dated 27 February 
2017. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Okay got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You must not nod you must say yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It must go on record.  Oh you have it 
thank you very much. 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Ja I got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you will see right at the – just at the 
bottom you will see it says National Assembly and it says Committee 
Reports National Assembly and then it is written Ad-Hoc Committee on 
the SABC board Inquiry into the fitness of the SABC board. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 131 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct?  And then – so is this 
report that you were talking to just now? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is the report I was 
referring to yes indeed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Then if you page through 
there is another divider which I am going to take you to sorry.  That 
divider will take you to the Public Protector’s Report and I am going to 
just identify it.  It will be a divider marked number 10.   
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I have got it. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And that report is the Public 
Protector’s Report entitled “When governance and ethics fail.” 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is correct got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes is that the report that you are 
referring to? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is the report I was 
referring to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you.  Could you 
please put that aside.  We are going to continue now with your 
statement and we will get back to the reports some other time.  Thank 
20 
you.  Thank you; you have also referred to the judgment of Judge 
Matojane which also dealt with the powers of the board and those of 
the Minister.   
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes I did touch on that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 132 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Which provided guidance 
in terms of who is in charge of the SABC business. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now then the board then had 
received before your time I would imagine these two documents and 
you would have decided that look you have these document what did 
you then do as a board in order to make sure that whatever remedial 
actions are proposed by the Public Protector are implemented or 
whatever recommendations are made by the Ad-Hoc Committee of 
Parliament are also dealt with. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  So when we came in in 
10 
2017 October like I indicated that the interim board was there for about 
six months so they had started some of the work.  For example the SIU 
was already brought in to do further investigation.  But the focus of the 
board was then to make sure that we implement the remedial action 
coming out of the Public Protector’s Report. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  As well as ensuring that 
what came out of the Ad-Hoc Committee Report those twenty-four 
recommendations were also implemented.  So as a board we made sure 
that those are implemented decisively. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And I am going to just 
take you roughly so that we incorporate those – in fact we – you deal 
with the recommendations at this stage we do not have to deal with 
them later because we have already opened these two exhibits.  Exhibit 
27 Chair Reports and other documents.  If I may just take you to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 133 of 216 
 
paragraph – to page 5 of that exhibit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which divider should we look at? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair it will be divider 
number 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is page 25? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is page 5 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  I am just waiting for the Chair 
10 
to – 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  On the same bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Same – yes, yes on the same bundle page 
5.  We just have to – no start from the beginning.  No, no, no from the 
beginning of the bundle.   
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then you go to the divider that is 
marked number 2. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:   I have got 20, 21. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh I am so sorry.  Oh no, no the one on 
20 
the Reports I beg your pardon I thought I had Reports and other 
documents Exhibit 27.  I beg your pardon I think you were looking at 
the – not on your sleeve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja page 5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 5 of that. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 134 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have it thank you.  Now if you turn to 
that page you will find that in part A which begins from page 4.  The 
committee reports on why that Ad-Hoc Committee was set up and then 
– but in 1.2 they – could you just read what they say in 1.2? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 5. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Page 5.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In red 005 on the right hand corner. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  105? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  005.  005 on the corner – in the – page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja when she… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red numbers on the top those are – when she 
mentions page numbers she will be mentioning those red numbers.  You 
will see that they will have 00 and something else before 00 but she 
will only say page 5.  For example so she will not say 005 she will just 
say page 5 throughout when she asks you questions, when she says 
page so and so do not bother to look at the 00’s before.  Okay. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so on this one it is page 5 have you found it? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is under bundle – 
divider 5? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No divider 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am under divider 2. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 135 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Divider 2. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But even if you disregarded any reference to the 
divider you just say page 5. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you should be able to find it starting from the 
beginning of the document – of the bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I am now on page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you are there okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you very much Chair.  
Thank you.  Could you then just read from – in paragraph 1.2 what is it 
that the committee had recorded there?  In fact you must start from 
page 4 for it to make sense. 1.1. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  1.1 page 4. 
“The 
Introduction. 
 
The 
National 
Assembly 
established the Ad-Hoc Committee on the SABC 
board Inquiry to inquire inter alia into the fitness of 
the SABC board to discharge its duties as prescribed 
in the Broadcasting Act Number 4 of 1999 and any 
20 
other applicable legislation.   
1.2 This followed after widespread concerns from the 
public about the SABC ability to exercise its mandate 
as a public broadcaster.  In addition the board could 
no longer convene correct meetings as several non-
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 136 of 216 
 
executive board members had been removed or had 
resigned.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in 1.4 just so that we can 
move to the next question.  1.4. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:   
“1.3 The SABC has consequently deviated from its 
mandate 
as 
the 
public 
broadcaster 
and 
from 
providing a platform and a voice to all South Africans 
to participate in the democratic dispensation of the 
Republic.  The SABC has also failed to provide an 
10 
important 
platform 
for 
community 
involvement, 
education and entertainment reflecting the rich and 
diverse cultural heritage of South Africa.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes 1.3 is equally important not that where 
those I do not say you must read are not important but I think because 
it will relate to most of the aspects that you are going to dealing with.  I 
am sorry I jumped could you just go back to 1.3 as well. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  1.3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
“1.3 There is prima facie evidence that the SABC 
20 
primary mandate as a National Public Broadcaster 
has been compromised by the lapse of governance 
and management within the SABC which ultimately 
contributed to the SABC – to the board’s inability to 
discharge its fiduciary responsibilities.” 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 137 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes now then you get into the SABC and 
as a new board and how did these matters that have been identified 
here by Parliament – how did they affect you as the new board if they 
did? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The reality is the 
situation the SABC finds itself today it is a result of all of these lapses 
that happened over previous years as a result of failure by previous 
boards and management to do what was responsible and what in line 
with the mandate of the SABC.  In terms of adherence to our own 
policies, in terms of making sure that there is prudence in the manner 
10 
in which resources of the SABC were used it was all compromised and 
that is why we find ourselves where we are.  But as a board what we 
had then to do was to make sure that we implement these remedial 
action and take corrective measures to address the issues. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you deliberately leave out 1.5?  It appears to be 
quite important. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is also important yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  For him to read. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  Could you please just – 
because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  1.5 at page 5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  Could you read 1.5 Chair is 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 138 of 216 
 
asking you to read 1.5. Thank you Chair. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  1.5. 
“1.5 Instead there appears to have been flouting of governance rules, 
laws, codes and conventions including disregard for decisions of the 
courts and the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa 
ICASA as well as the findings of the Public Protector of South Africa.  
This collective conduct. 
1. Rendered the SABC potentially financially unsustainable due to 
mismanagement as a result of non-compliance with the existing 
policies and irregular procurements.  Interference in as far as 
10 
editorial independence which is indirect conflict with journalistic 
ethics and saw the purging of highly qualified experienced and 
skilled senior staff members in violation of recruitment, human 
resources policies and procedures purging staff have in many 
instances been replaced – purged staff – pardon me – purged 
staff have in many instances been replaced without due 
consideration for or compliance with established recruitment 
policies.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The purging of staff one of your 
executives is going to talk to that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us decide whether lunch – we should take lunch 
now or later?  It is about five past? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh okay yes Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 139 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One so I think we should take lunch. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  After. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the afternoon – after lunch. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What time is Chair is giving us for lunch? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us take one hour as usual so we could 
resume at five past two. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At five past two thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but what we may need to talk about is how far we 
10 
may need to go this afternoon.  Maybe I should leave that idea for 
everybody concerned to think about so when we come back at five past 
two we can talk about. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How far we can go.  We will normally go up to four 
but sometimes when there is a need we go beyond four o’clock. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when I come back we can hear if it would be 
convenient for all concerned if we go beyond four o’clock. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes we will do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn and we will resume at five past two.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 140 of 216 
 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed but maybe the issue of whether we 
will - we will go beyond 4 o’ clock we could discuss around 4 o’ clock 
when we see how the situation looks like.  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could I just take you back to your 
evidence about to - I take you back to your - my mic is off.  Sorry.  
Could I just take you back to your evidence before lunch?  I got two 
messages from my senior colleagues who understood your evidence 
10 
when you said you were with Mr Zuma’s foundation to be that you were 
with the foundation for one day. 
Could you just clarify that evidence?  When did you become 
the Chairperson of the - Mr Zuma’s foundation? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
I 
- 
I 
was 
in 
the 
foundation I think for more than three years … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
But 
I 
realised 
on 
18 October 2017. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So your resignation followed a - a day 
20 
after you were appointed to the SABC Board? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Was that your evidence? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is my evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, thank you.  I think out there it 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 141 of 216 
 
looked like as you were with the foundation for one day.  Thank you.  
Thank you for correcting that.  Could you please go back to EXHIBIT - 
to - to - sorry?  I beg your pardon, to your statement.  Thank you.  
Could I direct you to page 4 of your statement? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  There you highlight some of 
the findings of both the Public Protector and the Ad Hoc Committee.  Is 
that correct? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could I just take you briefly to page 
10 
74 of EXHIBIT 27 which is written reports and other documents? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the big one.  Yes, thank you.  
Could you turn to page 74? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I am on page 74. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you or maybe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we back to the bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To - to EXHIBIT 27 Chair the reports and 
20 
other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under page - at page 74? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 74.  Yes, Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 142 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This report as you can - as you know 
Mr Makhathini deals with various matters that were investigated insofar 
as the terms of reference were concerned but if you - maybe I take you 
back to page 73.  You will see that they deal largely there with the role 
of the shareholder representative and there is political interference.  
Do you see that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I can see it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Is this the Parliamentary Ad Hoc 
10 
Committee Report? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And I have asked the witness Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is Chair at page 73? 
CHAIRPERSON:  73, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  You see that they deal 
with the role of the shareholder representative and then there is 
political interference.  Do you see that? 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes I can see that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay and then they have also identified in 
the next page the remedies and then could you just read into the record 
what remedies are they saying so far dealing with the issue of political 
interference? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 143 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Remedies - 39.2.1: 
“The shareholder representative should assume a 
more proactive role in ensuring good governance 
and compliance with all relevant policies and 
legislation specific to the SABC.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And … 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  39.2.2: 
“The shareholder representative’s involvement must 
be regulated so as to ensure that there is no undue 
encroachment in matters normally reserved for the 
10 
SABC Board.  The role of the - of the board the 
shareholder 
representative, 
the 
executive 
and 
Parliament should clearly under - should be clearly 
understood at all times.  This relationship should at 
all times be regulated in accordance with Code of 
Good Governance and Broadcasting Act and where 
applicable the Companies Act.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then in paragraph 40 they deal 
with journalistic ethics and related matters.  What do they say about 
editorial independence in 40.1? 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  40.1.1: 
“As 
the 
public 
broadcaster 
establishes 
in 
- 
established in terms of the Broadcasting Act the 
SABC must in terms of the Broadcasting Charter at 
all times adhere to the high standard of journalism 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 144 of 216 
 
with 
editorial 
independence 
being 
of 
utmost 
importance.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “…uppermost 
importance.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And if - following that at page 75 electoral 
coverage.  They deal with that at page 75.  What do they say there? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  40.1.4.1: 
“The Electoral Commission and the SABC Board 
should ensure equitable coverage during election 
10 
periods as well as compliance with Editorial Act and 
ICASA Regulations.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So your understanding of this 
equitable coverage what - what do they mean by that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
The 
equatorial 
- 
equitable coverage basically means based on the guidelines coming 
from the IEC and the representative percentage of political parties that 
is how we should cover them in an equitable manner. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Manner, yes.  If I may just take you - so 
that we finish with the bundle - to the - the Public Protector directed or 
20 
at least what - what her remedial action and findings were proposed 
remedial steps to be taken.  We will not read all of them into the record 
but I will simply read those that I believe are going to be relevant to 
most of the evidence that you are going to give and I would like to 
direct you to page - I beg your pardon. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 145 of 216 
 
Just a minute.  I think governance is what is relevant.  Is it 
not to - to the board? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Governance, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Governance matters and I would like to 
refer you to page 387.  That is the Public Protector’s Report and it 
appears under the folder number 10 - divider number 10.  Page 387. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  I would like to direct your 
attention to paragraph 10.7. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I can see it. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What does the Public Protector deal 
with there? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  10.7.1:  the heading is 
regarding: 
“The 
Alleged 
Systemic 
Corporate 
Governance 
Failures at the SABC and the Cause thereof:  I find 
that …” 
10.7.1: 
“All 
the 
above 
findings 
are 
symptomatic 
of 
pathological corporate governance deficiencies at 
20 
the SABC including failure by the SABC Board to 
provide 
strategic 
oversight 
to 
the 
National 
Broadcaster as provided for in the SABC Board 
Charter and King III Report.” 
10.7.2: 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 146 of 216 
 
“The Executive Directors principally the Group CEO, 
COO and CFO failed to provide the necessary 
support, information and governance to help the 
board 
discharge 
its 
fiduciary 
responsibility 
effectively 
and 
that 
by 
his 
own 
admission 
Mr Motsoeneng caused the board to make irregular 
and unlawful decisions.” 
10.7.3: 
“The board was dysfunctional and on its watch 
allowed Dr Ngubane to effectively perform the 
10 
functions 
of 
the 
Executive 
Chairperson 
by 
authorising 
numerous 
salary 
increments 
for 
Mr Motsoeneng.” 
10.7.4: 
“Mr Motsoeneng has been allowed to successively - 
by successive boards to operate above the law 
undermining the Group CEO amongst others and 
cause the staff particularly the Human Resources 
and financial - Financial Department to engage in 
unlawful conduct.”

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you and then the Public 
Protector in paragraph 10.8 deals with something that you have already 
- which is mentioned in the report - Parliamentary Report that I have 
referred you to about political interference.  She deals with it in 
paragraph 10.8. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 147 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  10.8.1: 
“The allegation 
of 
- 
the allegation 
that 
the 
department and Minister of Communication unduly 
interfered 
in 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
SABC 
is 
substantiated.” 
10.8.2: 
“Former Minister Pule acted improperly and in 
handling of her role as a shareholder representative 
in the SABC as an executing authority.” 
10.8.3: 
10 
“Amongst her most glaring transgressions was the 
manner in which she rejected the recommendation 
made by the board for the appointment of the CFO 
and the orchestrated inclusion of Ms Duda’s CV.  
Her withdrawal of the certain powers from the board 
was also not in line with the principles of corporate 
governance.” 
10.8.4: 
“Her conduct accordingly constituted a violation of 
Executives Ethics Code and amount to an abuse of 
20 
power.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and then at page 399 - 3-
9-0 - what is relevant for your purpose is - is what is stated in 
paragraph 11.3.  What is it that the board was supposed to do but I 
would like you too simply - because your - one of your executives is 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 148 of 216 
 
going to talk to all the other matters that follow but I would like you to 
read 11.3.1. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  11.3.1: 
“All monies are recovered which were irregularly 
spent through unlawful and improper …” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you start at the heading Mr Makhathini. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  11 - the heading - 11.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The SABC Board … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To ensure that … 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
“The 
SABC 
Board to ensure that:  all monies are recovered 
which were irregularly spent through unlawful and 
improper actions from the appropriate persons.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then lastly at page 392 
paragraph 11.3.2-7. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  392? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Paragraph 11? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  11.3.2-7, page 392. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume you are deliberately skipping the other ones 
Ms Norman? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 149 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair because the one witness is 
going to talk to them.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Still under the heading 
that says: 
“The SABC Board to ensure that:  the roles and the 
relationship of the SABC Board and the COO are 
defined particularly in relation to the role of a 
relationship with the Group CEO to avoid the 
10 
paralysis and premature exist of Group CEO while 
adhering 
to 
establish 
principles 
of 
corporate 
governance.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then she also dealt with 
monitoring at paragraph - at page 3-9-3 at 12.2 something that was 
directed at the board. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “Monitoring - 
12.2: 
 
the 
SABC 
Board 
is 
to 
submit 
an 
implementation plan indicating how the remedial 
action referred to in paragraph 11.1.3 above will be 
20 
implemented within 30 days from the date of my 
final report.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So we all know that that report was 
dated as you have already indicated 17 February 2014.  When you then 
became the Chairperson of the SABC Board did you find any plan that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 150 of 216 
 
had been prepared in compliance with that paragraph which you just 
read of the Public Protector’s remedial action? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Chairperson yes we did 
find the - the report and the handover report in terms of where they 
were, how far they had gone in, in implementing the remedial action 
which was driven by the Interim Board that was there for six months 
prior to us joining. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and then if you may now 
Mr Makhathini go back to your statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean Mr Makhathini that on your 
understanding there had been no plan put in place before the 
appointment of the Interim Board?  The previous board had not put any 
plan in place to implement? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
Chairperson 
that 
is 
correct.  There was no plan that was put before the Interim Board came 
in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank - thank you Chair.  Then because 
20 
you got there and there was a plan that the Interim Board had prepared 
is that the plan that you are continuing on as this current board or did 
you yourselves prepare another plan? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  We - in particular when - 
with regard to the Public Protector we continued with the work that was 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 151 of 216 
 
started by the Interim Board to ensure that there is similar handover 
and there is nothing drops through the cracks but of course there is 
further investigation that were done during our time as the board.  Done 
by the Internal Forensic which has produced further evidence of 
wrongdoings at the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and how - if you were to 
measure insofar as compliance or at least implementation of the Public 
Protector’s remedial action and also the Ad Hoc Committee’s 
recommendations.  How far would you say - are you now at 50 percent 
of implementation of all those recommendations or are you still sitting 
10 
at maybe 10 percent?  Well how far would you say you have gone? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I - I will put it at about 
80/90 percent.  The challenges that - the main reason why these 
needed to be done was for us to recover monies that were lost 
(indistinct).  That process is a long litigation process but everything 
that was highlighted in the Public Protector’s Report we are 
implementing and the 24 recommendation coming out of the Ad Hoc 
Committee 
we 
have 
also 
implemented 
almost 
all 
of 
those 
recommendations. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Then we go back then to 
20 
your statement.  If I may just direct you.  You have already dealt with 
no paragraphs 9 and 10.  You have taken those paragraphs.  Then 
something happened in December 2018.  What was it and how did it 
affect the functioning of the board? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  In December 2018 four 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 152 of 216 
 
board members from the previous Interim Board resigned with 
immediate effect.  Basically making the board to - not to be able to 
continue with the work that was required by the law.  So we became 
incorrect and - and these board members who resigned cited a number 
of reasons. 
Others cited personal reasons in terms of their workload.  
Others cited the - the issues around the misalignment with what the 
rest of the board members felt was the independence and what 
independence of the board meant and other board members another 
one cited the reason of lack of support - financial support -  from 
10 
Government. 
Indicating that when he took the job to be part of the board 
the expectation was that there was going to be funding that would go 
with the - the job … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Which had not come 
forth. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair at this stage I would 
like to refer the witness to EXHIBIT CC23B.  This - if you recall Chair - 
this is what I had referred to as developments over the weekend but we 
20 
had decided just to put all of this in context to put in the letters of 
resignation of the various members.  That would be in EXHIBIT CC23B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I have got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Have you found it?  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 153 of 216 
 
Thank you.  Can you just go through - we will go through all those 
letters because there is something - there are some of the matters that 
these board members are mentioning which are going to become 
relevant to your evidence and to what has happened recently.  Could 
you just deal - let us deal with the first page.  That is a letter from the 
Minister of Communications dated 2 December 2018 addressed to the 
President.  Is that correct? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then what does she deal with in that 
letter? 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Subject of the letter: 
“Resignation 
of 
SABC 
Board 
Member 
- 
Ms Khanyisile Kweyama.” 
Point 1: 
“The 
correspondence 
serves 
to 
advice 
His 
Excellence 
that 
Ms Khanyisile Tandiwe Kweyama 
has resigned as a member of the SABC Board with 
immediate effect.  Thus resulting in another 
vacancy in the SABC Board.” 
Point 2: 
20 
“The reason for resignation is the appointment of 
Ms Kweyama as PRASA Chairperson.” 
Third: 
“The 
resignation 
is 
hereto 
attached. 
 
Yours 
sincerely.” 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 154 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then - this morning then 
you have not provided us with that letter of resignation when you gave - 
when you got these from you? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes.  We have not 
supplied it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you but you will make it available? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes.  We will source it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and then in the - the 
second page deals with the resignation of another member of the board 
Mr John Mattison also addressed to the President dated December, the 
10 
3 r d 2018.  Could you just highlight what the reason were for his 
resignation there? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The reason given here: 
“The dissatisfaction with the Oversight Committee 
was apparent in the three successive hearings and 
reached across all political parties.  My endeavours 
to persuade the board to change course including 
the suspension of retrenchment have not been 
accepted.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I am sorry.  I should not have done 
20 
this.  I think I should have just directed you to start from the - from that 
paragraph - the second paragraph.  Sorry, because you have left out 
something there.  Could you just start from that paragraph? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “I apologise for 
not completing my full tenure of five years in this 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 155 of 216 
 
position.  I remain passionate about building the 
public broadcaster into an institution South Africans 
and indeed Africans across the continent can be 
proud of.  However I find I am - I find I am unable 
to agree with the current board - board’s direction 
and in particular its failure to appreciate the 
oversight role of Parliament and its committees.  
The dissatisfaction of the oversight - Oversight 
Committees was apparent in the three successive 
hearings and reached across all political parties.  
10 
My endeavour to persuade the board to change 
course including the suspension of retrenchment 
have not been accepted.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then he asked to be released from 
(intervenes). 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
“I 
humbly 
request that I be released from my fiduciary duty as 
a board member with immediate effect and that is 
the three months’ notice period required by the Act 
be waived and remain willing to serve South Africa 
20 
as ever.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  We are going to deal with 
your understanding of these reasons that are advanced but for now for 
consistency sake let us deal with the resignations and the reasons and 
then you have another letter dated 5 December 2018 and from 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 156 of 216 
 
Mr Mathatha Tsedu. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you also - he was also 
resigning and asking also for the waiver of the three month period in 
the first paragraph.  Could you just read from paragraph 2 the second 
paragraph? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “I wish to also 
express my gratitude to Parliament, the Government 
of our Republic and the people of this country for 
having giving me an opportunity to serve our nation 
10 
through the work of the SABC.  Both as Deputy 
Chairperson of the Interim Board and later as a 
member of a - of the Permanent Board.  I have tried 
at all times to live up to the highest possible ideals 
of commitment to serve our - our people in line with 
the mandate of the SABC as a Public Broadcaster.  
The work of both the Interim Board and the 
Permanent Board in rooting out corruption - corrupt 
practice and reversing fraudulent activities speaks 
for itself and I am proud that I played my little role 
20 
in 
that 
ongoing 
exercise. 
 
I 
accepted 
the 
appointment on the understanding that resources 
will be available to fulfil the responsibilities.  
However the financial crunch facing the SABC is 
getting worse by the day and all efforts by the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 157 of 216 
 
board to ensure a Government guarantee have 
yielded nothing in over 18 months of pleadings.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  So … 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “I therefore no 
longer - it is therefore no longer possible for me to 
continue in this role and beg your understanding for 
my action to terminate my membership of the 
board.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry just one error there.  The last 
sentence before it is therefore says: 
10 
“However the financial crunch facing the SABC is 
getting worse by the day an all efforts by the board 
to source a Government guarantee …” 
Yes.  So it is - it is to source a Government guarantee have 
yielded noting over the 18 months period.  Thank you and then last 
letter 
dated 
4 December 2018 
it 
is 
written 
by 
Mr Krish Naidoo 
addressed to the President of the country.  Could you then - he was 
also asking - he was tendering his resignation.  Could you start from 
paragraph 2 of his letter please? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “I apologise for 
20 
not having served my full tenure of five years.  
However the inability of some of the board members 
to understand the difference between corporate 
independence, 
accountability 
and 
political 
interference has led to a breakdown in the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 158 of 216 
 
relationship with the Minister.  The SABC has a 
pressing issue of lack of funds which requires 
immediate attention.  For that reason I do not wish 
to delay the Government - the governance process 
with appointing an interim structure to manage the 
affairs of the corporation.  As such I humbly request 
that I be released from my fiduciary duties as a 
board member with immediate effect and that the 
three months period required in the Act by - be 
waived.  The basis for my request is that my 
10 
immediate withdrawal from the affairs of the SABC 
Board will not cause any prejudice to the Board.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Let us start with that 
letter and then we will go backwards.  What - what do you understand 
to - Mr Naidoo to - to mean when he was saying that the board that is 
the members of the board were failing to understand between the 
different 
- 
the 
difference 
between 
corporate 
independence, 
accountability and political interference and that - that lack of 
understanding had then led to a breakdown in the relationship with the 
Minister?  What was your - what was happening at this point? 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  To put it into context in 
2017 there was a judgment by Judge Matojane that basically clarified 
what is the role of the board and what is the role of the Minister.  So 
the board runs the affairs of the SABC and in that instance they - the 
Minister has no right to interfere with the operations of the SABC and I 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 159 of 216 
 
think to some people it - it could a bit of time for them to - to 
understand what that meant. 
It basically meant that we cannot take directive from 
politicians.  We cannot allow any politician to interfere with the work 
that the SABC has to do and that is established in law because that 
judgment was never challenged and the issue around for an example us 
resisting oversight by Parliament.  It is not correct. 
You will recall that at that time the board had approved a 
turnaround strategy in about September and that turnaround strategy 
had been presented in - in Parliament and that turnaround strategy 
10 
covered a number of elements.  One of those was cost cutting 
initiatives and part of that was a Section 189 which made a lot of 
political parties uncomfortable with because it was an election year and 
so forth but … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  You are going too fast.  So the 
Section 189 that is Section 189 in terms of the Labour Relations Act? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So it deals with retrenchments.  Am I 
right? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
It 
deals 
with 
20 
retrenchments. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  So you went to Parliament and you 
presented that to Parliament … 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  We presented … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As part of the strategy that the board - 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 160 of 216 
 
turnaround strategy that the board had approved? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  So yes you may continue from 
there and you say most political parties then were not happy with that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Were not happy with that 
because it was an election year.  We were talking about retrenchment 
but also the country is facing high levels of unemployment but the truth 
of the matter is if you look at what is expected of board members they 
have to do what is best for the entity that they are Directors of. 
Yes issues of employment/unemployment is big for our 
10 
country but we have to make sure that the SABC is viable and that 
turnaround strategy included cost cutting and this is what caused a lot 
of tension.  If you follow through a lot of the hearings we had in 
Parliament all they were banging on was you cannot retrench, you 
cannot retrench but at the same time we were not offered any 
alternative to ask - for us to be able to turnaround the situation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How much would you say the salary - let 
us - salaries and all employee benefits - how much would you say they 
take out of the budget that the SABC has? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In terms of percentages? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is about - it is over 45 
percent of our expenses - expenditure goes to salaries. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Which is out of the norm. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 161 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  So then you presented then the 
strategy to the board and the board raised these concern - I am sorry.  
The - then Parliament.  They raised these concerns that look you 
cannot retrench.  So then what was your Plan B? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that just tell me the important features 
of your turnaround strategy that you presented to Parliament to the 
relevant portfolio committee.  I understand that you say it included cost 
cutting measures which I take could lead to retrenchment but I just 
want you to tabulate just what you consider to be the important features 
of that turnaround strategy. 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
The turnaround strategy was underpinned by three key elements.  The 
first one is what are referred to as legacy and governance element.  
That element deals with all the things that went wrong in the past and 
the work that is being done to deal with the legacy and governance 
issues is informed by the Public Protector’s Report. 
The Public Protector’s Report came up with a number of 
remedial actions that talks to what went wrong in the past.  So as a 
board we took a resolution and it was part of the - it is still part of 
strategy to deal with those decisively.  The second one is coming out of 
20 
the Parliament Ad Hoc Committee Report which also came with a 
number of recommendations and we are - as we implement those we 
are then driving the legacy and governance issues. 
The third will talk to SIU Investigations.  SIU has been with 
us now for - since the time of the Interim Board.  They have done the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 162 of 216 
 
investigation under two proclamations that they have been given.  Out 
of that work they have dealt with about 38 matters.  Out of those 38 
about 23 of those were DC matters. 
About six of them were criminal matters.  About seven were 
litigation matters and the work that is being done there as a result of 
the outcome of the SIU talks to the first element of our strategy.  The 
fourth talks to Auditor-General.  Auditor-General now and again will 
come and audit the SABC and they will come with audit issues that 
needs to be addressed. 
There is a plan to address those audit queries and the team 
10 
has done a sterling job in addressing those.  That is - that is the fourth 
one.   
 
The fifth element talks to about 180 forensic reports that have 
been done by our own internal forensic, and those 180 forensic reports 
give us an extent of the rot at the SABC and what needed to be done to 
address what may have gone wrong, so that’s the first element of our 
strategy, to say to ensure justice and to make sure that the wrongs are 
corrected and to make sure that we correct what was done wrong, but 
also create a sense that being held accountable and there’s 
consequence management at the SABC.  We are driving that under that 
20 
pillar of legacy and governance. 
 
The second element of our strategy talks to what I refer to as 
policy and regulatory issues.  There’s quite a number of regulations 
and policies that have put SABC in a financial dire situation.  One of 
those is the master care regulations, the master care regulation 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 163 of 216 
 
basically says our competitors can carry SABC 1, 2 and 3 at no cost to 
them, but at millions of costs for the SABC.  If you look at the programs 
on SABC 1, 2 and 3 they are the most popular programs, they are the 
most watched programs, so to have other players making money at the 
expense of SABC isn’t fair.  So that regulation that talks to master care 
is unfair to SABC, that’s the first one.   
 
The second one talks to the whole issue of digital migration, 
the choices that have been made by government as to which option to 
go for whether DTH or DTT you find that some of these options are very 
costly to the SABC, there may be other avenues that are cheaper, 
10 
efficient and more reasonable for the SABC, for an example if we were 
to go for DTH which in this case it’s satellite kind of a system will give 
us more challenge, efficient and more cheaper, but because of the 
government policy we have to follow a particular route which is 
financially dire for the SABC, that’s the second one. 
 
The third one talks to issues of sports rights.  The sports 
rights – sport regulations talks about all free to air players having to 
carry sports of national importance, but strangely enough other players 
don’t even bother bidding for these rights because from a price 
perspective it is too high, and it is not commercially possible to 
20 
commercialise these rights, so the sports rights put the burden on 
SABC that nobody is prepared to fund.  When you look at our losses I 
mean the CEO and CFO will talk about our losses, the unaudited 
financials for this – for last financial year is sitting at about 483million.  
About 410 of that 483million is as a result of sports rights.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 164 of 216 
 
 
So this talks to a policy and a regulation that is making it 
impossible for the SABC to be financially viable.   
 
The last component I want to touch on is TV licenses.  I mean 
for South Africans to be paying 72 cents a day for 19 radio stations, 
five TV channels it is understandable, what can you buy for 72 cents 
these days, considering that we are giving the 19 radio stations, 14 
official languages, all covered, three TV channels, five TV channels, of 
course the SABC 404 which is 24 hour news channel on DSTV as well 
as the Enca channel, so when you look at those regulations and 
policies they have contributed significantly in getting SABC in a 
10 
financially untenable situation.  That’s the second element of our 
strategy. 
 
The third element of our strategy talked to what I call 
commercial and operational elements.  This is about what are we going 
to do as the SABC to deal with revenue, so the executive have come up 
with about 15 initiatives to drive revenue growth but at the same time 
as you drive your revenue growth you have to drive down your cost, so 
in the last financial year we’ve saved almost a billion rand in cost.  This 
talks to what we’ve been able to drive under that element, and that 
element really talks about commercially what you’re going to do to 
20 
turnaround this business and I’ve said there’s 15 elements or 
initiatives, so for an example retrenchment was just one of the 
elements, it is not the only one.    
 
I mean if you look at we haven’t been able to retrench because 
we were stopped from retrenching.  Last year when the Board had 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 165 of 216 
 
resolved to retrench we were stopped from retrenching, and up until 
now we have not also received any money but we are not allowed to do 
what we thought as a board was a sound and reasonable thing to do.  
 
So in a nutshell that was our strategy, it covers those three, 
legacy and governance issues, policy and regulations, it also covers 
commercial and operational elements which really looks how do you 
make SABC efficient and able to compete in the space within which we 
operate.   
 
That’s what our strategy covers at a high level, but of course 
when the CEO comes he will also touch on the sixth element of our 
10 
strategy which is about for example just to give you a sense of it, it’s 
about financial sustainability, the second one talks to content and 
platforms that we need to have compelling content, that is available to 
all South Africans in different platforms, it talks to governance, it talks 
to partnerships, that we’ve got to leverage different partnerships for us 
to be able to deliver to South Africans, it also talks to HR issues, 
attracting the best talent, competent people who have the prerequisite 
skills and experience to help us with what we need to do, but the other 
other key element talks to digital element of SABC because the future 
of broadcasting will require us to be leveraging or innovating in terms 
20 
of technology and digital elements. 
 
So in a nutshell those are the elements that sits in our 
strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do want to ask you some questions further on some 
of those aspects but it may be that Ms Norman is going to be asking 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 166 of 216 
 
you the questions I am thinking of so I will allow  her to proceed but if 
she is going outside of those, then I will ask. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes thank you Chair.  So then you have 
already said that the Board had approved this strategy. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Now what I would like to know is you 
have four Board members  resigning at the same time with immediate 
effect.  How did that effect the functioning of the Board? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    It was devastating and 
in a way the impact of that it had a very harmful impact, in terms of the 
10 
ability of the Board to continue with the business of the day, because 
all of a sudden we were incorrect, we couldn’t have meetings, the work 
that we had started that was aimed at dealing with all these remedial 
action had to stop because certain things could not be done without a 
Board that could take decisions that are proper and binding.    
 
There was a five months gap where SABC did not really have a 
functioning board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you the board members who resigned 
let’s go back to your board being stopped to do what it believed had to 
be done in order to execute its mandate and perform its duties.  You 
20 
have mentioned that you went to the Portfolio Committee and presented 
your turnaround strategy, which included cost cutting measures and 
which could lead to retrenchment and you were stopped without an 
alternative being put on the table to say if going that route is wrong 
here is an alternative, did I understand you correctly? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 167 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Correct Chairperson. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    And when you said that 
you were saying that in regard to the portfolio committee, is that right?  
That the portfolio committee was not able to give you an alternative and 
yet it was against the cost cutting measures that could include 
retrenchment or are simply saying the stopping came from somewhere 
else, not the portfolio committee? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    Chairperson the 
stopping of the tenure of the retrenchment was done by the current 
Minister, who basically had taken over as the new Minister, we had a 
10 
meeting with her as a Board and in that meeting she basically said the 
retrenchments should not continue.  What she said at the time was that 
she needed more time to familiarise herself with the portfolio and the 
response of the Board was that we would be willing to look at the pace 
and the quantum of retrenchment but until there is money we can’t stop 
because from where we are sitting we would be held liable as Board 
directors, we have fiduciary duties to do what is responsible and right, 
to prove the point and that the Board was right in taking that stance, 
almost 23 months later we still had not received any funding.   
 
The Portfolio Committee ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how are you supposed to operate? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    It becomes very hard, 
you know even for us as a Board and the Executives that we have been 
able to attract to come and work for the SABC if the support that is 
necessary for them to implement their turnaround strategy is not given.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 168 of 216 
 
You would have seen from the letter that one of the Board members, Mr 
Mathatha Tsedu, resigned specifically because of that, that there is no 
resources that are being given for us to be able to fund what needs to 
be done, so it becomes impossible and really demoralising for us as the 
Board and the Executive. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair – oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it’s – I guess I will hear more about various 
aspects but it’s a matter that I am quite interested in because as you 
may be aware in connection with the evidence that has been given in 
this Commission in relation to what has happened in various SoE’s over 
10 
a certain period there has been a view that certain Board members or 
certain Boards didn’t do their job the way they should have done it and 
that they may have acted corruptly, that they may have – or some of the 
members of certain boards may have been for lack of a better word, 
may have been captured, may have been advancing agendas other than 
the agenda of the best interest of the SoE concerned, and there has 
been evidence by some witnesses who have said part of what has 
happened over the past few years has been that if in a particular SoE 
you have executive managers or Board members who want to do the 
right thing they are victimised, they are suspended, they are 
20 
transferred, all steps are taken to drive them out of the SoE or the 
Board and other people are put in who later on turn out to have all 
kinds of allegations of corruption against them and interference.   
 
That’s just speaking generally part of the evidence that I have 
heard, so the question that may arise in relation to what you have told 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 169 of 216 
 
me is whether we may have a situation where at SABC – SABC had 
found a Board that wanted to do the right thing, and look after the 
interest of the SABC and may have taken – may have done a lot of work 
in good faith to try and make sure that they make a difference in an 
institution that was going down, but when they put on the table 
solutions that politicians might not have liked, maybe because there 
were elections coming those politicians stopped them.   
 
Was it – was that improper interference in the performance of 
the duties of a Board that was trying to solve a problem, trying to do 
their job, or was that not an improper interference, was it a legitimate 
10 
intervention, so there is that question that I think I will have to look at, 
but it becomes more important because you may not in a number of 
cases that I have had relating to SoE’s the criticism would be levelled 
maybe at the government and maybe at people who are members of the 
ruling party, but from what we have said I think you have said that 
opposition parties were also saying no, no, no, no, you cannot 
retrench, don’t retrench.   
 
So that may raise the question whether part of the problem we 
have in South Africa is that people that occupy certain positions, who 
are supposed to stand for what is right, will not stand for what is right, 
20 
for political reasons, for expedience, or what was the position.  To what 
extent in other words was the SABC Board stopped from doing what 
was commercially correct, just because of considerations maybe that 
should not have been – should not have come into the picture.   Maybe 
they should have, maybe they shouldn’t have, I don’t know but that’s 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 170 of 216 
 
one of the things that I think is important for me to understand and 
maybe you might be able to speak on it up to a certain point, but other 
witnesses will take it further but I thought I must just mention that 
because I am interested in knowing whether that wasn’t an improper 
interference with the Board performing its duties.  
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    Thank you Chairperson.  
I must say that my understanding of how a capture has materialised or 
happened in most of these SoE’s, certainly credible, competent, 
experienced people of integrity gets victimised, they get pushed out 
and frustrated, and they get frustrated in a number of ways to a point 
10 
where you have to ask yourself why must I continue doing this if one I 
am not getting the support that I think I should be getting but also 
getting to a point where they attack you personally and put your life at 
risk, just for trying to do what is right. 
 
So I can say that what resulted to this Commission being – 
doing the work that it is doing it is still a reality for us, you know we 
are still living under those circumstances where you worry about your 
safety, for just trying to do what is right, and what is the most 
frustrating things at times they will cover some of these things as 
transformation, they will label you as somebody who is against 
20 
transformation when they are hiding corruption under transformation, or 
they will label as somebody who is gender insensitive, just because 
they want to cover certain things using gender and transformation, and 
when you look at what the Public Protector found about pressure of 
competent experienced people and those people being replaced by 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 171 of 216 
 
people who were not that qualified and without necessarily following 
processes what happened in that 2014 is still happening today. 
 
So that interference wasn’t proper, in a sense that the strategy 
of the organisation, SABC, in this case, is drafted by the executive 
team, approved by the Board, only the Board can approve the strategy 
and the executive then must implement that strategy, nobody else, not 
the Minister, not Parliament can come and say this strategy is not right. 
 
We will take input as we have always said, but the approval 
sits with the Board, so stopping the implementation of the strategy 
without providing sound alternatives its improper and why I say there’s 
10 
no alternative given we are at 24 months down the line, our financial 
situation has worsened, we have had instances where we had diesel 
spillage, our employees ended up in hospital because we hadn’t been 
able to maintain our buildings, we haven’t been able to invest in 
content, we haven’t been able to pay people who supply us with 
content, we owe almost R2billion and that talks to the content 
providers, signal distribution costs and so forth, so it is okay to give 
input, an alternative but you can’t just stop something without providing 
an alternative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe I could just mention this in this context, I 
20 
heard evidence earlier this year relating to Denel, in terms of what 
happened to Denel, the evidence hasn’t been completed and there will 
be another phase but one of the witnesses I think was Chairperson of a 
certain Board of Denel and the evidence seem to suggest that that 
Board had done a very good job but she said it was replaced and after 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 172 of 216 
 
it was replaced certain things happened, and I will hear the rest of the 
evidence, so I am just linking what I am talking about to say here is an 
example where a Board was said to have been doing quite well, I think 
the Minister who was responsible for Denel I think there was 
correspondence which suggested that the Minister was also - had 
indicated that the Board had done very well, and so on, so it is is 
important to examine  how the boards operate but also to see whether 
they try to do their job there is improper interference, whether that 
happened many years ago under another President and whether it 
happens now under a new President I have got to look at everything, I 
10 
am not going to look at one and not the other, we must look at 
everything because in the end we must be able to say yes the following 
things are improper interference they should not happen in order for 
the Board to operate properly these are the things that must happen, 
because in the meantime I am sure that a lot of criticism is directed at 
the Board in the public domain. 
 
Yes, thank you.  You might or might not wish to add anything, 
ja okay, continue Ms Norman.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes thank you Chair.  Maybe let’s skip 
then and deal with the matters that the Chair has just raised with you, 
20 
and those are the matters that we were going to deal with later, but 
let’s deal with them.  The issue of funding, in paragraph 16, 17 you 
deal with the fact that the SABC applied for government funding, so 
then there’s a distinction, am I correct between paragraph 17 and what 
you deal with in paragraph 20, where you deal with the bail-out, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 173 of 216 
 
government guarantee, and also you deal in paragraph 17 with 
government funding. 
 
Let’s talk about the government funding that you applied for, 
that is the SABC applied for in 2017.  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Norman, I may have interrupted your 
plan, at a certain stage you were dealing with the reasons given by the 
last – given in the last letter of resignation and you had said you would 
go backwards, so I don’t know whether you still want to finish that or 
whether you ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Or maybe ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m just feeling guilty that I have may interrupted you 
or your plan. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    No not at all Chair, we go back to them, 
but this ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    But this will link in nicely with what you 
have just raised yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Okay could you then tell the Chair about 
this application that you made – that was made by the SABC to 
20 
government in 2017, what was this for? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    Thank you Chairperson.  
After the work that was done by the Parliament ad hoc committee 
following up on the 2014 report that was done, or issued by the Public 
Protector, it became clear that SABC was in dire financial  need, and 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 174 of 216 
 
what then happened at the time the interim board came in February 
2017 and roundabout June they put their first government guarantee 
application.  It was a government guarantee application to government, 
and that basically didn’t materialise and in 2017 November another 
application went in by the permanent board, that I am still part of, and 
that was really to help SABC out of the situation that we were faced 
with.  I have already touched on the inability of the SABC to honour 
their monthly obligation to the suppliers, I have touched on lack of 
funds to maintain our broadcasting infrastructure.   
 
I have also touched on the SABC inability to invest in content.  
10 
In broadcasting you need to invest between 24 months to 36 months in 
advance, for you to be able to recoup or get some revenue coming out 
of the advertising, so that application went specifically for that, but I 
must also distinguish that in terms of what we get from government 
SABC has got a number of strings in terms of revenue, 85% of our 
revenue it’s commercial revenues so which means we have to go out 
there, complete with other players for advertising revenues, like any 
other broadcasting, that’s what we have to do, 85%.   
 
About 13/14% of our revenue comes from TV licenses, that’s 
why I touched on the importance of relooking at the amount people pay 
20 
towards TV licenses, but government give us 3%, so if you look in the 
last financial year 3% maybe amounts to about 200million but if you 
look at the mandate the public mandate that SABC has to carry it runs 
over 3billion, that’s the situation we’re faced with. 
 
And in paragraph 20 I am referring to that funding that has not 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 175 of 216 
 
yet come, it is the reason why Mathatha Tsedu resigned at the time 
when he resigned in December, it is the same reason we’re sitting here 
today we still don’t have the funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Makhathini you placed before Parliament, and 
therefore before the Nation, the Board’s turnaround strategy, by which 
you were saying this is how we think the situation at the SABC can be 
turned around, alright.  
 
And with regard to your cost cutting measures, in particular 
retrenchment, you were stopped.  You have not been given funding that 
you have just talked about.  Has anybody, has government or anybody 
10 
put before you an alternative plan, what is it two years after you put 
your turnaround strategy before Parliament, has anybody said we don’t 
agree with your turnaround strategy, here is a better one? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    Chairperson what has 
happened the shareholder, the Minister, basically offered services of an 
entity called GTech which is a government entity that assists with 
strategy projects.  So that entity was meant to come in and help us 
enhance our strategy, which we welcomed.  I mean any input can be of 
– can help, so that team came in and they are due to present their final 
version of their strategy I think next week to the Executive Team, but 
20 
when you look at what they have come up with, they haven’t come up 
with anything new, they have actually to a certain extent, a great extent 
endorsed what the Board had put in place. 
 
To prove to you that that strategy that was put by the 
Executive Team at the time the reason why we have kept SABC going, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 176 of 216 
 
afloat, for almost two years without any funding it is because of that 
turnaround strategy that we put together.  It is because of the calibre of 
the executives that we have been able to attract.  It is because of the 
commitment of some of our clients who continue to invest with SABC, 
run their ads on SABC platform.   
 
It is also because of our employees, who in spite of the danger 
they face when they go to our buildings, that are falling apart, continue 
to come to work, and deliver on their mandate and what is expected of 
them, in spite of the situation we’re faced with, so in essence we have 
not been given anything other than the support we got from GTech but 
10 
of course there are engagements, but at some point engagement you 
know ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  They must produce. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    They must produce 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Results, ja, and they haven’t. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    And they haven’t.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair.  The Minister of 
Finance recently was on television announcing the bail-outs to the 
various SoE’s, Eskom and to the SABC, and my recollection is that a 
20 
R3.2billion was going to be offered to the SABC – was offered to the 
SABC, but the Minister made it very clear that that was going to come 
with conditions.  Now the question is you may not be getting the 
funding because you have not met the conditions that the Minister, or 
National Treasury, has put up.  What is your response to that? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 177 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:    We actually agree with 
the Minister that any funding must come with conditions.  It is the right 
thing to do, because people must be held accountable, you can’t just 
give money and not hold people accountable.  So that bail-out of 
R3.2billion came with eleven conditions and as the SABC we have met 
those conditions, or substantially met, completely met those conditions, 
because it is about eleven of them, and some of those conditions are 
very interesting.  One of the conditions for example says what is the 
reason why the previous turnaround strategy was not successful, before 
our time.  That was before this Board, this was before the Executives 
10 
that we have, because we have inherited a broken organisation. 
 
I mean we were not there.  Government was there to put that 
as a condition to release the 3.2 billion to an organisation and to a 
team that is prepared to do the right work leaves a lot you know to 
question.  But in essence we have met all the conditions.  In areas 
where there is maybe issues I am sure it is because it is not possible to 
fully meet some of the things now.  To give an example if somebody 
says give me a sense of your non-core assets?  Alright.  Now before 
you say that radio station is not profitable as a public broadcaster you 
cannot just decommission or sell that or put it as noncore without 
20 
understanding what will be the impact of that decision on you fulfilling 
your public mandate?  Because it may not be making money but it may 
be helping us meet our public mandate.   
 
So you have got to evaluate these assets and evaluate the 
impact of selling them if you want to sell them.  But you cannot just 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 178 of 216 
 
wake up and sell things without assessing the impact.  Part of the 
problem SABC finds itself in they went into deals without evaluating 
their assets to know what to demand when they get to negotiating 
tables.  We are not going to do that.  We will do what is necessary and 
we will adhere to the Public Management Finance Act and we will 
adhere to that. And anybody who expect us to do stuff without 
complying with the prescript of the law we are not going to do it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And now these – these conditions I would 
imagine how are you – are you supposed to update National Treasury 
as you meet you or were you just simply going to report to National 
10 
Treasury that you asked – you put up eleven conditions and we have 
complied with six or we are still complying with seven.  How are you 
supposed to respond to – to you – your compliance in terms of those 
conditions? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  So basically they put the 
conditions to us we then in formal we wrote to them presenting what 
they needed for us to comply.  But also we have had meetings between 
the executive and National Treasury to align on it.  Even on the letter 
that was sent to us we have respectfully responded to that letter and 
said maybe the Ministers were not given the information that we shared 
20 
with them?  Because the truth of the matter is we have fully complied.  
In areas where we have not – we 90% there.  So we have formally 
communicated and not yesterday months ago. I will say four to six 
month ago we started sort of like adhering and responding to those 
conditions. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 179 of 216 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  And maybe the last point 
that I need to mention just to clarify things.  The G-Tech which is an 
entity that is helping to boost our strategy was actually brought in to 
help us but if you look at some of the comments about where they are 
saying we have not complied they relied on the original version of the 
G-Tech Report which has been improved.  Because when you come into 
an organisation you will do observations until you engage with people 
who work there you may get certain things wrong but once they sat with 
the team, they sat with the board where we gave input.  So to rely on 
10 
the original version which was not checked and validated with the 
executive and the board is wrong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe whilst we are still dealing 
with the finances maybe it is important for me to take you back to 
paragraph 15 of your statement at page 6 of your statement.  You deal 
with the dire situation 2018/2019 financial year.  And you say the 
corporation ended March 2019 with a cash balance of only R72 million.  
Now what I would like to know one would have expected now because 
part of – or if not most of the Public Protector’s Remedial action had 
been put in place you would have put in place the Ad-Hoc Committee 
20 
proposals or recommendations.  What is it that really put the SABC in 
this situation now in this financial year?  Leave the fact that you were 
asking for a guarantee I am just talking about the operations and the 
financial status at this point? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I indicated that in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 180 of 216 
 
broadcasting you need to invest 24 to 36 months in advance for you to 
be able to get the benefit of that investment.  To put together a soapie 
take months a good one that can end up performing like Uzalo for an 
example.  It takes months.  So why we have not been able to achieve 
much is because though we have a solid turnaround strategy but that 
turnaround needed financial injection.  But I have also touched on the 
regulatory and policy issues that has crippled the SABC.  Those 
regulations and policies have not been changed.  Yes ICASA has 
started a process to review those but as we stand today the status quo 
still stands.   
10 
 
So it basically means that we are still affected heavily by 
those things.  But the efforts around the Public Protector in terms of 
trying to recover the monies have not healed that much because we 
have not recovered anything.  Yes we are in court.  There are seven 
cases that already in litigating in court but that process can take years 
before we can see money flowing back to the SABC.  So where we are 
we are suffering because of the poor decisions that were made at the 
time the landscape that has not really changed with technology, 
innovation and how our audiences consume our contents.  So that is 
why we are where we are.   
20 
 
But in spite of that the fact that we have kept the organisation 
going it tells you that the turnaround strategy has got potential to fix 
the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that where you talk about the 33 
improvement in paragraph 16 of your statement? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 181 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  33%. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you deal with the figures there.  
Would you mind just putting those on record? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Okay I mean in me trying 
to ensure, explain and justify why we said a comprehensive turnaround 
strategy works.  If you look at the numbers the year 2018/2019 
unaudited loss for the SABC sitting at about 483million.  Losses have 
decreased over the past number of years from R1 billion in 
10 
2016/2017down to R622million in 2017/2018 and an unaudited loss of 
R483 million in 2018/2019 so that is an improvement of about 33%.  It 
shows that if we had been given the money at the time we requested it 
we could have got SABC to break even in 24 months. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually the figures that you have just read do – do 
show that each year since – since the first year – financial  year that 
you mentioned the losses have been going down.  There has been an 
improvement in the losses.  Is that right? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is right Chairperson 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually significant improvements.  
MR 
BONGUMUSA 
EMMANUEL 
MAKHATHINI: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 182 of 216 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  In paragraph 19 you touch on 
something that the Chairperson already asked you about when he was 
giving you the scenarios about whether certain executives or the 
certain boards do not do things according to certain wishes of maybe 
your political heads or something but you deal with it and you say the 
depoliticising of the SABC is of paramount importance.  Could you just 
explain to the Chair what you mean by that?  Now we talking not – we 
talking if you have examples of what you mean by that you could just 
10 
give those examples but you want to understand why you believe that 
the SABC needs this most. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
If you look at what was [indistinct] as the outcome of the Public 
Protector Report – Investigations and the Addo Committee it talks to a 
leadership that was not doing what was expected of them from a 
judiciary duty perspective.  It also talked to people who were not 
prepared to defend the independence of the SABC.  Now that comes 
from in other instances when you going to give – going to give jobs and 
position to people who are not suited for those roles those people get 
20 
desperate to please.  So to depoliticise SABC meant one of the key 
things we had to do was to get the executive team that was competent, 
experienced and at the same time having high levels of integrity so that 
they can do what is expected regardless of the push back or the 
challenges that they face.  So doing that it actually restored order – 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 183 of 216 
 
restores order and help us drive this rehabilitation and the renewal of 
the SABC. It is very important because the independence of the SABC 
needs to be protected and if you have wrong people in wrong jobs you 
not going to be able to do that.  But secondly part of the contracts that 
were – are in question did not make commercial sense for the SABC.  
Now if as an executive you sign a contract that is not benefitting your 
entity, benefitting somebody else elsewhere it raises a lot of questions.  
So we had to bring people who have got commercial and business 
acumen to make sure that they help the SABC get back on track.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So how do you balance the public mandate 
10 
that the SABC has and the commercial interests because it also 
operates within that space as a commercial entity?  So how do you 
balance the two because government is going to say, look we want you 
to educate people and you say, I want to educate people but I want to 
make money, so how do you draw the line – where do you draw the line 
when you have to discharge your mandate as a board? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  There is an editorial 
policy currently it is being reviewed that really guides the decisions at 
the SABC and when it comes to news and editorial decisions that has 
got – it is somehow protected from the commercial interest.  It is 
20 
important for the SABC to make money like I indicated that 85% of our 
revenue comes from commercial activities but that does not mean that 
we then compromise our independence because we are getting the 
support from private or from commercial activities.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Chair if you… 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 184 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry – oh I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I go back to what we were talking about under 
paragraph 16.  The decrease in the losses made by the SABC or the 
improvement in the losses that were made by the SABC as testified to 
by you a few minutes ago in relation to paragraph 16 were those 
improvements in the losses as a result of the implementation of the 
turnaround strategy that you have talked about? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson 
certainly it is the outcome or the result of the turnaround strategy.  
10 
Because before the turnaround strategy was in place it was downhill for 
the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So the strategy – turnaround strategy that you 
put in place is already has been – and has been showing positive 
results? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Certainly.  We have 
saved almost R1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  As a result of that 
turnaround strategy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  We have been able to 
attract top talent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  To come work for the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 185 of 216 
 
SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Because they feel that 
SABC [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:   I mean if you look at the 
calibre of the executives that we have been able to attract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
[MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is testimony that the 
turnaround strategy is working.  But the fact that we delivered the 
10 
election in this dire financial situation that was rated the best coverage 
ever should give South Africans confidence that we are turning around 
the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm,  Hm thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then maybe Chair I 
might just finish up with the letters before I forget? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry so can you just go back.  We were 
still dealing with the – and I had asked you and you explained what you 
think Mr Naidoo meant in his letter about the failure to understand the 
20 
difference between corporate independence and accountability.  Now he 
also identifies the fact that the SABC does – ag it does need funding, 
does he not?  He does that sorry – I will tell you now.  Yes in the third 
paragraph.  He also alludes to the fact that the SABC also needed 
funds.  He says: 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 186 of 216 
 
“The SABC has a pressing issue of lack of funds 
which requires immediate attention.” 
Do you see that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes he did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He did? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you would find that then that also talks 
to what Mr Mathatha Tsedu had referred to in his letter.  Then let us 
just deal with the letter of Mr John Mattison okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before you go to that one.  On this one 
10 
from Mr Krish Naidoo I get the impression and you must tell me if I am 
wrong that he had a difference of opinion with the majority of the board 
on certain issues and he talks about – he says: 
“The difference between corporate independence, 
accountability and political interference” 
He seems to have taken a certain view and maybe the majority of the 
board took a different view.  Are you able to speak on this in terms of 
practical examples and are they connected in any way for example with 
the issue of cost cutting measures or not really? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
20 
I must indicate that all these resonations came immediately after the 
meeting we had with the Minister where we disagreed on the 
retrenchment element.  So the majority of the board was of the view 
that the strategy has been approved by the board, has been shared and 
presented in Parliament and the Minister at that time actually gave 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 187 of 216 
 
input and her input was incorporated.  So all we needed to do now was 
to hold the executives you know to implement the turnaround strategy.  
So some people felt that we were supposed to stop the retrenchment 
without necessarily having anything tangible so that is where the 
difference of opinion is.  But also the issue around – if you look at the 
Matojane judgment it clearly outlines what is the role of the board and 
what is the role of Minister and people seem to struggle to get to terms 
and to accept that SABC is independent and the board of the SABC is 
in charge of the affairs of the SABC not the Minister.  The Minister yes 
through a shareholder compact will hold us accountable on certain 
10 
things, are we meeting our targets and so forth?  She had got enough 
in the shareholder compact to hold us accountable in terms of the 
performance of the board and the entity but in terms of the decisions 
that must be left with the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position that Mr Naidoo felt that there was no 
political interference that – because he refers to political interference 
he seems to say some members of the board do not understand 
political interference, accountability and independence – corporate 
independence.  I am trying to understand what the difficulty was. Was 
he thinking that the board was allowing the Minister to interfere 
20 
improperly?  Was he thinking – was his view that the board maybe was 
thinking the Minister is interfering improperly when actually she was 
not interfering improperly?  Are you able to recall exactly where the 
differences were between him and the board? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Chairperson it – beyond 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 188 of 216 
 
what is on the letter it gets harder for me to speculate what he was 
thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But if I was to look at 
what was happening at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The board had taken a 
resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  And – which was 
10 
supported by the majority of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  And a minority within the 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Felt that we should just 
fall over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  And do whatever that 
was required of us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  So that is the only way 
where I could basically frame 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  My understanding of the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 189 of 216 
 
letter but as to what was going on in his mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I would not be able to 
speculate on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and maybe because after he resigned there was 
no interaction? 
MR 
BONGUMUSA 
EMMANUEL 
MAKHATHINI: 
 
There 
was 
no 
interaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But again when you look 
10 
at – at his letter he talks about an interim structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Which meant that there 
was a view that maybe the board that is in place was meant to vacate 
office and then an interim structure should come in because that is 
what is in his letter.  When he says he does not want to – to delay the 
installation of an interim structure that can deal with the affairs.  Now 
when the four members resigned it put a mammoth pressure on the four 
that remained because if we had resigned that was going to make way 
for the interim board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But we felt that we had 
done nothing wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  We had delivered on 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 190 of 216 
 
what is expected of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  And we were prepared to 
stand and fight and defend the independence of the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Which then made it 
impossible to bring an interim board because you cannot bring an 
interim board without doing an enquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Which is what was done 
10 
by the Addo Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  But you see all of these things become 
quite important for this commission because certainly in regard to other 
SOE’s or government institutions there certainly has been complaints 
that sometimes certain structures were weakened to such an extent 
were weakened in a way that sought to push them out so that other 
people would be put in who would then behave in a different way. So it 
becomes very important to understand all of those things because also 
some people might feel hey if I am not wanted I must just leave.  But by 
doing that you might be allowing somebody who might have improper 
20 
motives and objectives to then bring in somebody who is going to put 
up no resistance when they should put up resistance. So it becomes 
very important to understand all of those things and sometimes you – 
you think that corporate governance requires that when people believe 
they have done nothing wrong they should stand their ground and say 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 191 of 216 
 
we see that we are being pushed here and people think we are going to 
resign so that other people can be put in if we think we have done 
nothing wrong we are not going anywhere.  And if somebody has power 
to fire us let them fire us.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you Chair.  Maybe just 
one other aspect linked to what the Chair has asked about what Mr 
Naidoo was saying.  Was there in fact a despond – a breakdown in the 
relationship between the board and the Minister? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It was a very strange 
point for – to put in the letter because the Minister had just come in.  
10 
She was just – she had just been appointed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  And this was the first – 
very first meeting with the board.  So it is just that there was this 
contentious issue around Section 189 but I am not of the view that the 
relationship was broken but it was the very first meeting that we had 
with her. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Alright thank you.  And then let us 
then go to Mr Mathatha Tsedu’s letter.  Each one follows Mr Naidoo yes 
it is Mr Mathatha Tsedu is at page 3.   I think it is important linked to 
20 
the matters that the Chair had put to you that you have somebody who 
was part of the interim board and now he also became part of the 
permanent board but what he says there about rooting out corrupt 
practices and reversing fraudulent activities and he then commends 
both the interim and the permanent board.  Are these matters that Mr 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 192 of 216 
 
Mathatha Tsedu speaks to here?  Are these some of the matters that 
when you are asking for a bail out from National Treasury, the Minister 
of Finance would consider?  That is what you have done about the 
corporation whether because you are there now corruption has simply 
escalated or you have actually tried to root out corruption.  Are these 
some of the considerations? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Chairperson that is 
correct.  One of the conditions is how far have you gone in 
implementing the corrective measures coming out of the Public 
Protector?  And we have met that condition. I mean you would have 
10 
seen that we are tackling the irregular appointments.  We are hold 
people accountable.  There has been people that have been put 
through an independent disciplinary processes.  We are hard at work 
and we are actually doing very well.  Even the government both 
Ministers agrees that in that area we have done exceptionally well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then we have then 
the last letter because we do not have the one of Ms Kweyama.  Then 
we have at page 2 that one of Mr John Mattison.  One of the things that 
he raises is that he does not agree with the current board’s direction 
and in particular its failure to appreciate the oversight role of 
20 
Parliament and its committees, the dissatisfaction of oversight 
committees was apparent in three successive hearings and reached 
across all political parties.  So what he was he talking about here?  
Was he still referring to the issue of retrenchments or were there other 
areas that he felt that the board’s direction was not consistent with 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 193 of 216 
 
what he believed in? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
The truth of the matter is if you look at how our engagement with the 
Portfolio Committee and [indistinct] the only issue that they were 
always picking on was retrenchment.  Why are you retrenching?  There 
has never been a substantial input or alternative that was ever given 
other than them expressing concern about retrenchments while South 
Africa has got high levels of unemployment.  So him talking about us 
having challenges it was specifically about that and he was of the view 
rather also that we should suspend retrenchment.  And the position of 
10 
the board was until we are given money we are prepared to review the 
pace and the quantum of retrenchment.  But to just say you cannot 
retrench and no money given, no alternative given it would have been 
irresponsible for the board to accept that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have misunderstood you but I think you must 
have intended to say the board’s position was as long as we do not 
have money unfortunately this is one of the cost cutting measures that 
we will have to do namely retrenchment but if we are given money then 
we can look at the situation.  Am I right? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
20 
Cost cutting – the position of the board was exactly but was that we 
were going to review the pace and the quantum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  You may have maybe in 
your initial projections put about let us say 900 employees. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 194 of 216 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But when there is money 
given and you can drive efficiency in other areas you can then maybe 
reduce that to like maybe 700.  But to just take it off the table 
completely when it is about 45% of your expenditure and you are not 
able to identify another lever where you going to reduce costs.  
Because our main cost drivers is staff, payroll. It is signal distribution 
or connectivity cost.  It is also sport rights which falls under content.  
So you can never around the finances of the SABC without tackling 
those three areas.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so every month as you paid salaries there will 
be this 45% that goes to salaries and your turnaround strategy 
contemplated that the numbers of staff had to be reduced if there was – 
they had to be reduced I think that is what you say and by how much 
they would have to be reduced could be affected by whether or not you 
were getting – you are going to get funding and how much funding you 
were going to get.  But there was no doubt in the minds of the board 
that retrenchments had to happen. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I may not have the 
numbers details here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But there is a number of 
things that needed to be done around our staff mix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  In terms of for example 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 195 of 216 
 
freelances versus permanent staff but also looking at where we going 
as the SABC?  What skills do we need?  You know but there were a 
number of irregular appointments and a lot of things that needed to be 
looked at and reviewed.  Even our operational model as the SABC 
needed to be relooked because we operating in a digital space where 
things have changed and competition also has intensified.  And like I 
indicated that if you look how people consume content it has changed.  
So do we still need everything that we have now in its current form or 
shape?  All those things were being reviewed and it is what the 
executive team was looking at. But certainly without reducing your cost 
10 
you can never turn around SABC because you are not going to be able 
to grow your revenue in this competitive space without tackling your 
cost elements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then he says in the 
last sentence which you have already read into the record that his 
endeavours to persuade the board to change its course including the 
suspension of retrenchments have not been accepted.  So I would take 
it that you have one person who is not happy with the strategy or with 
the way you going but the majority of the board would have approved it 
20 
and then he decided that look if it cannot be done as he is suggesting 
then he would rather leave.  Was that the impression you got? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Certainly.  I mean a 
board of about fifteen people if you have fourteen people agreeing and 
one person disagreeing the majority of the board agrees with the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 196 of 216 
 
strategy and we move forward. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm yes thank you.  Then before we go to 
the some paragraphs of your statement I would like us to just finish 
with all the media documents which we have placed before the Chair.  
Shall we now got to Exhibit CC23 I beg your pardon I have not dealt 
with Exhibit CC23A?  May I refer you – do you have that?   
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Exhibit 23? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  23A. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have it okay thank you.  Then the first item on 
10 
the index which goes to page 2 of that document deals with sports 
broadcasting rights role still unresolved.  We are not going to read 
these letters but you can just – because I know that the CEO is going 
to talk to them.  He has dealt with it in his supplementary statement.  
But just roughly you have already indicated to the Chair that sport 
rights are expensive but this role that they referring to here what are 
they talking about? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  So… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just high level overview of what this was 
all about.  Mr Mxalwe is going to deal with in detail. 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Ja.  Maybe just high 
level thank you Chairperson.  One of the key things there were a 
number of contracts that SABC had entered into that were not 
financially or commercially making sense for the SABC.  Sports rights 
for an example sports rights prices had become so high and our ability 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 197 of 216 
 
to commercialise those rights was not in line with what we were paying 
for these rights.  So we as a board took a position as the majority of 
the board let me emphasise that that will no longer sign any contract 
that does not make commercial sense for the SABC regardless of what 
that contract is about and sports fell into that basket and we - we have 
had a number of engagements and - and we have agreed now for an 
example SuperSport and PSL on the rights. 
Where they manage to understand our position and we had to 
understand also their position and go to a form of an agreement that 
will result to SABC making some money from it because if you look at 
10 
the sports rights alone in the last five years SABC has lost about R2.3 
billion as a result of sports rights. 
I spoke to you about the financials for the last financial year 
of about 483.  About 410 million of that 483 loss is due to sports. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then I would like to just highlight 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that because - I mean you referred earlier on to 
some contracts in which - concluded by SABC and other entities that 
20 
did not make commercial sense.  Did you - is this one, one of them 
where there is such a loss that happened over that period?  Is it 
because it did not - the agreements that SABC had got into did not 
make commercial sense in your view? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Certainly Chairperson.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 198 of 216 
 
Some of these are part of those contracts that needed to be reviewed 
because if you paying let us say R20 million for something and you only 
making R5 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It will be irresponsible 
for any Board Director … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  To go in knowing that 
they are going to have such a significant loss … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  But also to expect the 
SABC to carry this alone without a financial injection.  It also becomes 
a - unsustainable for us. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair and then if I 
may just take you to page 6 of that bundle which is EXHIBIT CC23A.  
So this is some of the correspondence that happened over the 
weekend.  It talks to the bail out.  Am I right? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes Chairperson, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then it says: 
“SABC top brass threatened to quit over board 
20 
meddling.” 
Could you just explain to the Chair who is the top brass and 
why was there a threat to quit because your board is meddling into the 
affairs of the executives? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The top brass in this 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 199 of 216 
 
case refers to the Group CEO, CFO and the COO and - and the 
challenge there - there has been some issues that the executive raised 
with the board in terms of minority of the board doing things that makes 
it impossible for the executive team to do their work which when you 
look at the incidents given it - it talks to some level of interference 
second guessing the executives and creating an environment that is not 
conducive for the executives to do their work but as a board we are 
dealing with that matter. 
It has been brought to the attention of the board and as a 
board we are tackling that issue. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  When you say minority members of 
the board how many members are we talking about? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  The board is made of 12 
non-execs and then three Executive Directors.  So when the three 
executives are complaining about the board they will be referring to the 
non-exec which is the 12.  So out of the 12, you will have a minority.  A 
minority for me will be any number less than three when or three going 
down if you have a total of 12 people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh, yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  So which means where 
20 
we are the board is fully functional and still able to do its work but of 
course because boards are made up of people from different 
backgrounds and who approach things differently and for every new 
team or group of people when they meet for the first time there will be 
teething issues. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 200 of 216 
 
What I normally say is that as long as everybody’s guided by 
the prescripts of the law one but secondly guided by what is at the best 
interest of the entity that they are part of.  Not being pushing their 
personal interest that have got nothing to do with the SABC but also 
allowing the executives space to do their work. 
Nobody 
should 
block 
the 
executives 
from 
driving 
consequence management from implementing the turnaround strategy 
and so forth.  So that is the stance. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then there you quoted.  I am not 
sure that it is you who is quoted.  You will tell me.  It is paragraph - 
10 
paragraph 8.  It starts with: 
“It is the SABC Board’s understanding …” 
Could you just read that into the record? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  This pertains to the 
bailout.  Our response goes like this: 
“It is the SABC Board’s understanding that the 
Public 
Broadcaster 
has 
either 
complied 
or 
substantially complied with each precondition as 
demonstrated by the substantive documentation 
supplied over a period of eight months.  In the 
20 
letter to the Ministers the board attached detail on 
the SABC’s compliance with each - with each 
condition and has asked for an urgent engagement 
to discuss the matter.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 201 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “The board has 
- had informed the Minister that as a result of the 
current status of the SABC funding request the 
board was left with no option but to implement the 
requirement of the Companies Act taking into 
account the severe implications on the Directors 
liabilities.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the last one. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  “The board has 
assured the Minister of its commitment to serving 
10 
the corporation in the public interest.  To this end 
the board will continue to work with the Department 
of Communications and Digital Technologies and 
the National Treasury.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then if I may just take you - I just 
what to highlight those particular articles which are relevant to your 
evidence.  You have already spoken or testified to the issue of TV 
licences and you - this is dealt with in - at page 17 of this - of this pack 
and then there is - the - in fact how it is captured in the index.  It says: 
“SABC wants to increase TV licences but DA says 
20 
no 
way. 
 
The 
opposition 
says 
the 
Public 
Broadcaster needs to find another way to turn 
around.” 
So that is - that was part - this issue of increasing TV 
licences did it also form part of your turnaround strategy? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 202 of 216 
 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes it is one of the 
things that we - we had highlighted. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So this is one of the things that 
would have been opposed to by some political parties or all? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then at page - sorry.  Then you - 
this was linked to the first one.  At page 22: 
“MultiChoice signs deal with SABC for premier 
soccer league rights.” 
10 
And this is what you have already testified to that you had 
reached agreement.  Is that what you are talking about there? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  That is at page 22 and 
there is an article that says: 
“SABC lets down the poor.” 
At page 23.  Could you just read what this - this is a 
Mr Vukile Maki from Mdantsane.  What his complaint was about there 
because he talks to the issue of sports rights and how the public views 
20 
it or at least one member of the public who has actually documented it, 
yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Okay.  It - it says: 
“I was totally flabbergasted at the way SAFA, the 
PSL and the SABC have taken people for granted.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 203 of 216 
 
League games started a few weeks back yet there 
was no agreement about this - about - there was no 
agreement about which matches would be publically 
screened.  The blackout of soccer matches was a 
terrible blow for the football lovers and a shameful 
way to treat the beautiful game.  Not showing the 
game was like showing the middle finger to the 
public and soccer fans.  This shows how greedy the 
leaders of these organisations are.  They prefer to 
show lots of matches on the pay channel rather 
10 
than letting their have nots watch.  Rugby fans also 
have to wait until matches are finished on the pay 
channel.  SABC shows them by the time you already 
know the score, Vukile Maki.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Mdantsane. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So to the members of the public how do 
you explain this?  How would you explain this because people they 
have SABC1, two, three?  You have mentioned the sports rights that 
SABC does not have but to a layperson how would you then explain 
20 
why is it that you are not able to show these important games to the 
public? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
When it gets to sports regulations it says the free to air players must 
carry sports of national importance but what is interesting is that other 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 204 of 216 
 
players like your eMedia do not even bother to bid for these sports 
rights because they know the pricing is not making commercial sense 
and then the SABC because we are a Public Broadcaster we are then 
expected to carry these games at huge costs for us. 
It would have been ideal if we were getting some support 
funding that actually makes it possible for us to carry these games 
while at the same time being financially viable because we have to pay 
millions and millions of Rands and run at huge losses which the very 
same South Africans are going to complain and say why is this SABC 
not turning around. 
10 
Why are the losses at SABC so high?  Part of the things that 
drive those losses is because of the very same issues around content 
that is very, very expensive for us but also the content that becomes 
harder for us to commercialise.  When I talk about commercialisation of 
content it is okay if I am going to pay 20 million and then sell 
advertising space to advertisers and make - let us say - 30 million. 
So then I have a R10 million profit but from where we are we 
have to incur huge costs acquiring the rights.  We have to incur costs 
of production.  Costs of on air talent and when you add all of those 
together it makes SABC impossible for the SABC to be financially 
20 
viable.  So South Africans need to understand that inasmuch as we are 
committed to fulfilling our public mandate it comes at a cost and we 
need all players to play their part. 
The Department of Sports must play their part and other 
players must play their part.  It cannot be the SABC’s only burden to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 205 of 216 
 
carry these. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and maybe lastly I would like to take 
you to page 8 which is headed - oh sorry this is the - I will take it up 
with your Head of News.  Your Head of News is going to testify - this 
deals with Head of News.  Sorry.  Sorry Chair.  I think we have dealt 
with most of the things that would warrant your attention from that 
report and then lastly - lastly Chair if I may just refer the witness to 
EXHIBIT CC23C.  You have already dealt with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It deals with the SABC threatening to 
10 
quit over board meddling.  Remember that? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  (No audible reply). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have already touched upon that and 
then the next page at page - sorry.  This is not numbered.  It will be 
page 4.  I am sorry.  It is not numbered.  It will be (indistinct).  Mine is 
not numbered.  Page 4 it says: 
“SABC Board response to Sunday Times story.” 
That is your response then to that - to that article.  Is that correct? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and I think it is important this is 
20 
something that you said you wanted to place on record.  You have - you 
have already mentioned how skilled your executives are.  Maybe you 
want to just read into the record what your response to that statement 
was. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 206 of 216 
 
As the SABC Board we decided to respond to the Sunday Times story. 
“SABC top brass threaten to quit over board 
meddling.  The SABC Board reaffirmed its utmost 
support and respect for the SABC Executive 
Directors who have done a sterling job thus far in 
very difficult circumstances.  The board will not be 
drawn into discussing internal board matters and 
alleged differences between board members.  The 
board comprises of persons chosen through a public 
process who have a range of skills and experience 
10 
and who will continue to be critical - critically 
engaged in their duties and responsibilities.  It is 
well know that the SABC faces huge historical 
challenges which the board is committed to turning 
around.  This was reported in Parliament last week 
Wednesday.  The SABC Board denies that there is a 
disagreement among Board Directors about meeting 
the preconditions set by the - by Government for 
providing the 3.2 billion bailout.  At a meeting of the 
SABC Board on 30 August 2019 it was unanimously 
20 
agreed to write to the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Communication and Digital Technologies 
respectfully disagreeing with the view that the 
SABC had not met the Treasury pre conditions for 
funding.  In the letter to the Ministers the Board 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 207 of 216 
 
expressed its concerns with the content of a letter 
from the two Ministers received on 27 August 2019 
and believe that the Ministers have not been fully 
briefed on the information provided by the SABC 
thus far.  It is the SABC Board’s understanding that 
the Public Broadcaster has either complied or 
substantially complied with each precondition as 
demonstrated by the substantive documentation 
supplied over a period of eight months.  In the 
letter to the Ministers the board attached details on 
10 
the SABC’s compliance with each condition and has 
asked for an urgent engagement to discuss the 
matter.  The SABC - the board has informed the 
Minister that as a result of the current status of the 
SABC’s funding request the board is left with no 
option but to implement the requirement of the 
Companies Act taking into account the severe 
implications on Directors liability.  The board has 
assured the Ministers of its commitment to serving 
the corporation in the public interest.  To this end 
20 
the board will continue to work with the Department 
of Communications and Digital Technologies and 
the National Treasury.  Issued by the Chairperson 
of the Board on behalf of the Board.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  There are two reports 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 208 of 216 
 
which you - we have not mentioned which you testify - I beg your 
pardon - you have not testified to just yet.  Those are dealt with at 
page 22 - at paragraph 22.  I beg your pardon.  At page 7 of your 
statement where then as part of the cleaning up of the SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 7 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Seven. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 22, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The - the - you - the SABC commissioned 
10 
two other inquiries.  Could you just talk to those inquiries please? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Coming out of the work 
that was done by the Public Protector and the Ad Hoc Committee 
specifically there were a number of complaints that were raised around 
the issues of harassment and political interference with the editorial 
decisions of the SABC. 
So in our effort in implementing these remedial actions like I 
have said that we are committed in doing that.  We commissioned two 
Commissions one to look into the harassment issues and the other one 
to look at political interference.  Both Commissions have concluded.  
20 
We are almost done with Phase 1 of implementing the recommendation 
of the harassment one. 
The one on political interference was just released a few 
weeks ago.  The recommendations coming out of that will be 
incorporated or considered as we update our editorial policy and then 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 209 of 216 
 
we will be able to make sure that we strengthen our governance to 
ensure our editorial independence and protecting the editorial 
decisions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  When you are talking harassment 
you mean sexual harassment? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
I 
mean 
sexual 
harassment yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then the other report that dealt 
with interference editorial independence.  That is the one that by 
Mr (indistinct).  Is that correct? 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Chair that report is contained in 
EXHIBIT CC19 and it has four volumes.  CC19A to D but Mr (indistinct) 
is going to testify to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then - you then in 
paragraph 23 say that most of the matters - the details you leave them 
up to the executives which are lined up to testify after your - after you? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
20 
Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then lastly - then if - 
then according to the correspondence that you have given to the media 
houses like the statement that you have just read out about either the 
SABC complying fully or substantially with the conditions.  What could 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 210 of 216 
 
be the reason for this bailout not forthcoming?  It has been how many - 
you said 18 months now? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  It is almost 24 months. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  If you consider the 
period under the Interim Board because the Interim Board put the first 
application in 2017, June. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So - so what could be the reason?  
Do you - I do not want you to speculate but do you - is it something 
that you can talk to or you feel that you do not want to even speculate? 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  To be honest because we 
were given 11 conditions and we have complied with all of them and the 
results are showing that the business is turning around.  You could see 
that even our losses are decreasing.  We have reduced it by 33 
percent.  I am not sure what will be any other reasonable reason for not 
assisting the SABC considering what the team has been able to deliver. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you - did - did you have to communicate with 
the Minister of Communications and she in turn has to communicate 
with the Minister of Finance or does SABC or is SABC able to approach 
20 
National Treasury directly and find out what is holding things back? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  
The protocols for communication is that SABC submits anything that 
they need to submit to the Department of Communication and then the 
Communication Department then engages with the Minister of Finance 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 211 of 216 
 
and I think that is why in our response we are respectfully saying 
maybe the Ministers have not been appraised or given sight of what we 
have submitted because in the last 18 months - sorry - eight months we 
have submitted substantive documentation to comply with those 
conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and you have not been told by the Minister of 
Communications why there is a delay in the decision being taken with 
regard to granting SABC what is referred to as the bailout or either the 
funding that it requires or the portion that falls within the budget of 
Government?  In other words if you have asked for 100 percent. 
10 
They must be able to say we cannot give you anything for 
reason A, B, C, D or we can only give you 50 percent and these are the 
reasons why we cannot give you the other 50 percent.  Have they not 
come back to you - the Minister of Communications - to tell you whether 
a decision has been taken one way or another as to what if anything 
SABC would be given? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chairperson 
for asking the question.  Reasonable - logically that is what you would 
expect.  That if I was given 11 conditions and let us say for argument 
sake I have met 50 percent of those.  I should then be given 50 percent 
20 
of the funding.  Now there are 11 conditions. 
We are of the view like I have read the statement that we 
have substantially all met these conditions.  We have not been given a 
cent of the R3.2 billion but there are even instances where they 
themselves admit that we have met the condition around for an example 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 212 of 216 
 
consequence management.  So where is the money that talks to that? 
So to hold back the entire amount when you know that the 
organisation is planning.  People’s lives are at risk.  Business are 
being shut because the fact that we cannot pay those suppliers it 
means some of these businesses are shutting down.  Our employees 
are in and out of hospital because of us not being able to maintain and 
comply with health and safety standards.  It leaves a lot of confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean you talk about businesses that you are - are 
being shut.  I mean - I think for some years now I think Government 
was - has been talking the language that small businesses must be paid 
10 
within 30 days and all of that.  In your situation there must be a lot of 
small businesses that you are not able to pay for quite some time 
because there is simply no money. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chairperson.  Thank you.  The only thing we are able to pay religiously 
every month is our staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Our salary bill is sitting 
at about R260 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  After paying that there is 
nothing left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what - what it means it goes back to the point you 
- part of the point you have just made.  What it means is that if there 
lots of for example small businesses suppliers that the SABC relies on.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 213 of 216 
 
They are not being paid and those business people who are supposed 
to help the economy grow.  They have to close down their businesses 
because they are not being paid for months and months and months on 
end. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it means.  Is that right? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  That is what it means 
Chairperson.  SABC plays a critical role in the entire broadcasting 
industry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  If SABC goes down it 
has got a ripple effect in the entire industry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see part of the - sometimes what - what is 
difficult to understand is when people do not - people who are 
appointed to make decisions - whose job is to make decisions do not 
make decisions for a long time.  I mean you have got to make a 
decision whether people criticise you and say it is a wrong decision or 
not. 
If your job is to make a decision you must make the decision.  
One way or another people must know where they stand and you must 
20 
provide your reasons.  There is a time to gather information that you 
need in order to make your decision one way or another but for - for a 
situation to be allowed to develop where you know an important public 
institution waits for a long, long time without decisions being made and 
in the meantime you know small businesses get really affected in a very 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 214 of 216 
 
bad way. 
It is - it is something that should be avoided and - and all one 
would expect is that at least decisions must be taken.  If the decision is 
that look we cannot give you the money or we can only give you so 
much let the decision be taken so that everybody knows okay that is 
the decision.  How do we live with it?  How do we plan our - our 
operations appropriately?  So - so hopefully those decisions will be 
taken soon.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you - do you have any or did you want to say 
10 
something … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI:  I fully agree with you 
Chairperson that leadership is about making decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I mean you know sometimes it is just worse 
that you are putting in a leadership position but you cannot make 
decisions.  It is - sometimes you feel it is better to have somebody who 
will make a bad decision.  Then everybody knows where they stand.  
Okay.  Ms Norman. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Chair that 
is the evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From this witness.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Makhathini for coming to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154 
 
Page 215 of 216 
 
share with the Commission what you know is happening in regard to the 
SABC.  If a need arises we will ask you to come back but for now you 
are excused. 
MR BONGUMUSA EMMANUEL MAKHATHINI: 
 
Thank 
you 
for 
the 
opportunity Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Chair I was 
going to suggest that we adjourn today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe we could start early tomorrow but - 
10 
but we are not particularly worried Chair.  I think we have spaced … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the spacing of - yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Our witnesses quite, quite fairly.  I think 
we will be able at least those … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That are lined up for the week.  They will 
definitely finish this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we can start at 10 tomorrow if you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Feel that … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you look at the whole week. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything should be fine and we start early only if 
we need to make sure. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 154

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  10 o’ clock. Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.
