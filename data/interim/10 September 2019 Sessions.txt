ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you for being… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you see I helped you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you.  You helped me thank you Chair.  
Thank you.  Mr Jansen Van Vuuren where are you currently employed? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I am employed in the 
South African Post Office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Could you just state your qualifications 
for the record please? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I matriculated in 1978 I 
10 
know that it stands there 1979 it was an error. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And I started my career 
as a teller in the South African Post Office in December 1978. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  You have made the – you want to correct 
what you put in paragraph 5 Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  At page 2.  Where he says he matriculated in 
1979 he says he would like to change that to 1978. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  But a supplementary will be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes thank you Chair. Thank you. And you were 
telling the Chairperson then you moved through the ranks – Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja I moved through the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 5 of 174 
 
ranks and was promoted as a senior manager in 1997.  I served in 
various positions in the South African Post Office as senior manager 
and is currently deployed in the South African Post Office Project 
Management office in the strategic department. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Through the years I 
built up extensive experience and expertise in the following [indistinct] 
areas in the post office in contract management, product management, 
regional management, operations management, project management, 
business solutions for new innovations and services, implementation of 
10 
new innovations.  I have been appointed as the South African Post 
Office Project Manager for the Broadcasting Digital Migration Project in 
November 2014.  My role in the project is to ensure the successful 
execution of the South African Post Office role as a distribution partner 
in accordance with the DTTMO that was signed off between USAASA for 
the rendering of the service. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes thank you.  You – before we proceed with 
your evidence there is a demonstration that you wish the show the 
Chairperson.  Now could you just briefly tell the Chairperson what is it 
that you want to demonstrate to him? 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair I just want to 
– there is two SEB types involved.  The one is the DTT antennae and 
the other one is the satellite decoder.  If you allow me I would just like 
to take you through how it works? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 6 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And the intelligence 
that have been built in from the distribution aspect on the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may do so. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Okay sorry you might 
have to just stand just behind that other microphone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja he will – if you would be able to give 
instructions from – from where you are please do that so that you will 
be recorded properly. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Thanks.  Can I ask that 
you – that we go to that [indistinct] or we can start at this one first?  Mr 
Chair the one on your left side is the one that works with the antennae. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I do not know if you 
will be able to see the antennae there in the window. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And then the decoder 
is here on the white piece of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  On the thing.  So you 
would see that the equipment is exactly the same as that of MTN and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 7 of 174 
 
the current ones that is used by ETV for open view.  So it is the 
decoder and antennae and then that guy’s on that side is also a 
decoder for the satellite and then also it is linked to a satellite dish on 
the outside.  I am just going to show you how the DTT antennae works.  
So we got – currently we got in the – there is currently twelve channels 
available on the – on the DTT the date work and they are all free to 
Edge Channels.  On the MTN side we currently it is a subscription.  So 
if you already on MTN you are already on digital.  If you are on Open 
View of ETV also already on digital.  Then the areas then currently in 
the areas that is – that is not covered by the Max – Max7 there is 
10 
currently seven channels available and nineteen radio stations.  I am 
just going to take you through the one for the DTT side.  There is SABC 
if you can just go through the channels.  SAB2, 3, 4, SABC Encore, 
SABC News HD, Parliament, E-TV, Extra, E-Movies, E-Tunes and that 
is your communicare radio station.  Now Mr Chair you would see where 
we rolled out we have started in the Northern Cape and the far remote 
areas.  Some of those areas did not even have signal they never had a 
TV. Now most of the areas had either TV2 with snowflakes and they 
also had maybe not SABC3 and 1.  So you can see on antennae side 
what is the improvement. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  If we can go – if you 
allow me we will go to the DTTH one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 8 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  On the DTTH – oh it is 
remote sorry.  You can just go also there through the channels SABC3, 
SABC Encore, SABC News, E-TV, Parliamentary, Johnny that is a 
community TV, Elf.  Now this is the additional channels that is – that is 
currently on the satellite side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And so there is many 
more – when the person cannot or a household that has been receiving 
the DTT and it cannot receive the signal we issue then the DTT satellite 
decoder.  And the channels however there is that there is more 
10 
channels currently available on the channel and that currently leads to 
some social political problems which has to be addressed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  So are you installing both in all the 
communities or a household as a choice? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I am going to explain to 
you how the process works. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes alright thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  You will see that.  I do 
20 
now know if there is anything else on the screens you want to see Mr 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no if you think that is enough I do not – I think 
that should be fine. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 9 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you Mr … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  From a distribution 
side on the – as the last aspect before I go over to the presentation 
what we have done is the equipment.  We have created a barcode for 
the four types of equipment.  That is the antennae for the DTT and the 
DTT decoder.  Then it is the satellite dish as well as the satellite 
decoder.  They have – all four of them have a product code which is 
10 
formulated into a barcode.  In the barcode we built in the name of the 
supplier, the type of equipment and then also the serial number which 
reflects the quantity of the specific product.  Now from our side we can 
then manage and control all the stock through those serial numbers at 
any point in time.  If we – if there is anything that comes that is broken 
that must be – that is faulty or received by getting the – by reading the 
barcode we know immediately to who does it belong. We know what is 
the error code and we put all that in reports for USAASA who will then 
take it up with the suppliers.  That is what I have on the demonstration 
side. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes thank you.  And then can we then move 
onto the slides now. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes please. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes thank you. Chair mostly his evidence is 
contained on the slides but he has dealt with it in his affidavit. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 10 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  We thought it will be quicker to deal with it 
through those slides thank you.   
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair I am going to 
first give you just a highlight on the background. If we can go to … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Paragraph 9 at page 3. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Page 3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh sorry you mean the slides? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Alright sorry. 
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Page number, number 
20. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  If we can go to page 
number 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I am just waiting.  Ja 
on the – that is the facilitator I have indicated we have aligned the 
presentation in accordance with the statement.  So I think you will get a 
good understanding if we – if we have gone through the [indistinct] 
20 
presentation.  If we can go to slide number 3.  The next one.  Thank 
you.  Mr Chair I have – I just want to – want to explain to you how the – 
the transmission and the signal work because it is directly linked how 
we issue the equipment.  You would see on the left side is the – is the 
transmission centre of Centac they send the signal to the satellite.  The 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 11 of 174 
 
satellite will send the signal to the centre towers.  Now there is 
currently 183 of those terrestrial towers across the country.  Now if the 
person… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I can see where it is written Centac 
transmission centre on my – on page 20 that is light there which you 
are showing there. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am looking for the centre where you say the 
satellite sends transmission to. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So – ja so if you look 
10 
on the left hand of the block it shows those two lines going up to the 
satellite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN 
VAN VUUREN:  That is the 
transmission that Centac sends to the satellite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Then Mr Chair if you 
look down it comes then down with the arrow to the towers.  The arrow 
on the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there are two arrows one goes almost vertically 
20 
down. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes that correct ja,. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one you talking about? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 12 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  To the satellite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those are the towers? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Then it will – then you 
will see the signal will come down from the satellite to the towers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Now what will happen 
is if the person qualify for a DTT decoder that signal he receives it 
through the tower and it will go then to the antennae at his house.  If 
10 
you go – if you move to the right to the block underneath to the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is the one you are talking about yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes that is correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is the one coming from the towers? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the left hand side? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes to the antennae. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh to the left of – to our right? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  That is right ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes 100%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Then if you – if the 
household there is – they cannot receive the DTT antennae we issue 
them with a satellite decoder and you will see from the satellite on top 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 13 of 174 
 
right there it takes the signal directly to the satellite dish at the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I am just going to ask you repeat what you 
have just said.   
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the household does not have? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  If the household – if 
the household do not qualify for a DTT because it cannot receive the 
signal through the tower. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We issue that 
10 
household then with a satellite decoder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And it works exactly on 
the same concept as Mnet, DSTV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And E-TV currently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  It goes then directly to 
the satellite dish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  And sorry Chair that demonstration assumes 
that each household will have a flat screen and what if it is a different 
TV? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 14 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  The TV it does not 
matter it will receive both signals. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  It will? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja both signals. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Okay thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair I think now 
that is the – I am not a technical expert on things but that is the best 
that I can demonstrate it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is now at page 21. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Right we going to then 
to page number, number 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  The Post Office 
because of our large infrastructure throughout South Africa and 
because of our current experience that we dealt with in the past we 
have done major black empowerment share schemes which all involve 
application technology and platforms.  Then the Post Office we in the 
parcel – we in the parcel business.  So because of that experience and 
things we had all that we have done with this project is that we link the 
20 
application and the parcel thing together.  Because end of the day the 
household has to register.  We created an application form for that.  We 
will come to it and then we have to issue him the kit that he qualifies 
for and I am going to take you through the process how it works. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 15 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Now for this the Post 
Office have then entered into a MOU with the Department of 
Communications with USAASA and the SABC on 31 July 2012 and for 
the rendering of the service as a – as the division partner we enter into 
a DTTMA with USAASA directly.  That MOA have expired in 31 March 
2018 we have renewed it and the new expiry date is now 31 March 
2021.  We go to the – to page number 22.  Initially when the rollout was 
planned it was planned for a three year period and based on that three 
year period our planning was that we have to issue about 5 800 
decoders a day.  You can – you can understand the impact of that on a 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A day over how long? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Over a period of three 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shoo. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So if you take 5 million 
decoders into consideration that – so it is a massive project.  It 
involved huge operational expertise and logistics and the Post Office 
are perfectly positioned for that.  We have started with the pilot in the 
SK area because it was one of the priority areas to have radio silence 
20 
with the satellites they have put up in that area and we started in 1 
October 2015 and it has been completed in that area.  We – the DOC 
then for the second phase and I am going to come to the detail on that 
the delivery plan was approved for on the 11 October 2018 and the – 
and the latest plan it is based on the completion of the registration and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 16 of 174 
 
distribution of the current 1 405 073 kits that USAASA have purchased.  
We want to get that done.  We want to get it out of the way and we are 
going to show you where we currently in the process with that.  The 
second one is that they want to embark on the remaining 3.3 million on 
a voucher model and that model is currently under review by the 
Minister.  Then based on the – on the latest completion date the rollout 
is now scheduled for completion by June 2021.  If we can go to the – to 
the next slide, slide number 23.  There is a lot of stakeholders and 
scope of work involved in this project.  The Department of 
Communications, Department of ag IKASA, The Bureau of Standards 
10 
they were involved in the testing of the equipment, Centac as the signal  
provider, DOC as the radio frequency spectrum an harmonisation with 
neighbouring countries as well as the Public Awareness Campaigns 
they were – they are driving that.  USAASA was… Bureau of Standards 
they were involved in the testing of the equipment, Centac as the signal  
provider, DOC as the radio frequency spectrum an harmonisation with 
neighbouring countries as well as the Public Awareness Campaigns 
they were – they are driving that.  USAASA was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the second DOC what does it represent?  
There is the first Department of Communications, DOC and then there 
is another DOC? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja it is Department of 
Communications.  I just … 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 17 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Department of? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Of Communications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same communications. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  It is just the same one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh why is it done twice?  Is there any particular 
reason or that was an error? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  May I ask where Chair is looking? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  On which page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking at page 23. Are we on the same page? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh yes Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja on the same page 
ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh I see what you mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the first stakeholder is mentioned as 
Department of Communications. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in brackets DOC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you go down then there is a bullet point and 
another DOC and I was asking whether that refers to Department of 
Communications as well and if so why it was mentioned twice or 
whether it was an error? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  No, no Mr Chair they 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 18 of 174 
 
just got three rolls in a total scope of work.  So we used abbreviations 
to explain that rolls further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  No sorry Mr Jansen Van Vuuren is it not 
because Centac is also part of government?  Is there not a relationship 
between Centac and DOC? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Currently the Centac, 
USAASA and the South African Post Office reports to the DTPS which is 
now Department – which is now the new department. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And Centac is – they 
are responsible for the establishment of the transmission and the 
network. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  From that side so they 
also report now – so we altogether now in – as one department. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh actually I see that you have got DOC three times 
so there is another one later. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 19 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  May I just find out I see that all of the 
stakeholders are all sort of national departments or national agencies.  
How does that affect then the rollout in provinces because I do not see 
that local government plays any role in here or is that not relevant at 
all? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I think when I come to 
the – in the presentation if you allow me I can explain it there because 
it is coming up how we – how it is working. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Alright. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  But we directly 
10 
involved with right through to the ground. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  To the our local 
structures. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Alright thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes thank you.   
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Okay so Mr Chair so 
you would see that then on my focus in this presentation is then on the 
South African Post Office.  And our role there is the logistics and 
20 
distribution of DTTP and the DTT devices.  If we can go to slide 
number, number 24.  Now the Post Office role as distribution partner is 
that we display and distribution for the marketing material.  We receive 
that from the DOC and we distribute that to the branches or our outlets.  
We also process the application forms for the subsidised set of boxes 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 20 of 174 
 
during the registration phase.  We do the ordering and the warehousing 
and the distribution of the equipment to the outlets and I am going to 
explain to you on the next slide how it works. Then the process and 
delivery of the equipment to the households.  Now when each and every 
household that we register we give a sequential distribution number per 
province.  If you are in Eastern Cape you would – and you the first 
person that registered there your unique reference number or your 
distribution number will start with EC 0001 so you will be number 1.  So 
that is what we use to track the household through the end to end 
process and the system automatically create that unique reference 
10 
number.  And I will take you through the process how it happens.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Then we are also 
responsible for the issue of the insulation voucher to the qualifying 
applicant.  We also then notify the assigned installers to arrange for 
the installation.  We do the verification of the installation vouchers and 
the payment of the process to the installers.  We also then handle the 
exchange and the placement of any faulty equipment and we then also 
accept in the case where a household have moved away or he cannot 
be traced or found by the installer they – we then handle the return of 
20 
getting that stock back and we then reissue it to a new applicant.  Then 
we also do the insurance of the STP kits up to installation level.  If we 
can go to slide number 26.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Page 26 Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair you would see 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 21 of 174 
 
that the Post Office as I said we are ideally positioned to render this 
service.  You can see all the platforms.  We got a financial system.  We 
got the tracking system.  We got the SMS platform which is all existing 
systems.  The only thing that we have done you will the three circles.  
We have developed a STB data base where we register the household 
on and where we do then all his registration process, his qualification, 
the issuing of the stock for what he must qualify for and the installation 
of that.  We also accommodated on the STB system on behalf of 
USAASA the DTT installer data base.  Now how it work USAASA are 
responsible for the appointment of the installers.  We get those 
10 
installers from USAASA.  We upload them on the system and we 
activate them.  USAASA if for argument sake if we got three installers 
we say installer A, installer B, installer C.  USAASA tell us what is the 
frequency of that – of the number of kits that that installer must 
receive.  If USAASA say they all three receive equally we then set the 
percentage on the system and the system will then when the first 
customer comes will then select installer 1 and he will select then with 
the next customer installer number 2.  So everything is – it is real time 
and it is – it is system based that we make sure that installers are 
strictly then managed according to that – that allocation.  Currently 
20 
USAASA through the bank all the installers the percentage each one 
received the same quantity and the system are able to do that.  The 
other area that we had to do some development it was in the front end 
and that is to create a specific for a teller the application form so when 
the customer come that we register him on the point of sale.  And then 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 22 of 174 
 
you would see the last circle is the STB web server.  This enable the 
call centre at any point in time when they receive a complaint from a 
customer of anything to go directly in real time to our – to our data 
base. They will then put in the sequential that unique reference number 
of the customer or his ID number if whatever it is required and they will 
then can tell the client that any point in time where is his – his 
installation process.  Whether he have registered if it is in that phase. 
Whether it is in the distribution side or on the – on the installation side.  
However we have done the development and done but because of the 
challenges currently with the call centre and it is mainly – it is funding 
10 
issues we waiting for the call centre to get automated to get that link 
directly.  From our side we currently on all the enquiries we receive we 
do it currently manually. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  The whole - the whole 
system can at any point and time if the DOC or the Minister whoever 
requires for us what has been registered in what province, in what 
town, in what local municipality in what district municipality.  With a 
press of a button we - we have that information available and I am 
going to explain to you what is all that information. 
20 
The same thing applied with the issuing of a kit.  With the 
press of a button if I have the unique reference number of the customer 
I can tell you when was his - his stock issued, what were the serial 
numbers that were issued to him, when was it installed and/or whether 
it is not installed.  All that information in intelligence is available in the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 23 of 174 
 
system of the - of the South African Post Office. 
So you can see the - the sophistication of the system that the 
Post Office has built here and it is all for the Government. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  From our side at the 
end of the day the platform is in place.  Whatever other services we 
need we can give that confidence to the Government that it works and it 
is there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Yes 
and 
can 
I 
please 
Mr Jansen Van Vuuren can I take you to page 92?  When you talk about 
10 
registration are these the forms that the households would have to 
complete … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Before they get registered?  Page 92. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  90 - 92? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja.  It will be under folder marked C. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja.  100 percent.  If we 
go to that form Mr Chair you would see on page 92 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  That is the application 
20 
form we have designed.  So you would see there is - is the personal 
detail of the applicant.  His residential address.  All his - his address 
where - where he stays and then what is the total number of 
households in - in the family and then we also again with the - the 
capturing of this and I am coming to that - that slide we process then 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 24 of 174 
 
the documentation from here. 
You would see the bottom part - Part 2 of that form in the 
front that is all the things that is built in the system to help the teller to 
make sure that he does a quality check on the application form when it 
is captured.  I just want to - if we go to the - the second page, page 93 
of that application form. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  It shows we have given 
there how the person who - who qualifies for it.  So we - we are stating 
there that he must be - he must be an owner of a - of a functional TV 
10 
set.  He must be a South African citizen.  The household that is - that is 
already covered by the - the SABC’s concessionary TV licence they 
qualify by default. 
As well as all your - your people - your SASSA grants and 
recipients.  They qualify by default. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Then the - the other 
requirement is that the household must - must have a total household 
income of 3 200 or less.  I can just ask that we can go - if you happy 
with this just go back to the one … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  To the second page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Page 27. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  On the - on page 
number 20 - 27 Chair you would see that is the - the logistic system 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 25 of 174 
 
that the post office have - have put in place for the project and you 
would see that we have established or set up 14 warehouses nationally.  
That warehouses is that if the person is in Upington we have a 
warehouse in Upington. 
So that we have the stock as quickly as fast as possible at 
that - at that warehouse.  Now what happened, as I have explained 
earlier on?  We have created four product codes for each of the items.  
We have created - we will create the order.  That order will go to 
USAASA.  USAASA will place that order with the supplier. 
We will say we need thousand DDT.  We do not mention a 
10 
supplier.  USAASA will select a supplier who they have appointed and 
they will provide the - the thousand ones.  Then the - we will receive 
with the equipment a tax file.  Now the tax file if we order a thousand 
let us say DDT from - from company A.  They will give us an electronic 
tax file having all the serial numbers inside there three days before the 
time. 
That serial numbers has to go into our financial system and 
we then receive the stock.  We compare it with that and then we then 
activate that stock on the - on the financial system.  You would also 
see then what happened.  Then thereafter the post office branches then 
20 
place an order which is happening centrally and the nearest and that 
warehouse delivers then the stock to the branches in place. 
The same - the same process happens in the case where 
stock is exchanged.  Reversed logistics happen.  As the stock has 
come down the stock would - the stock will go back.  On the - on the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 26 of 174 
 
graph itself you would see that USAASA is right on top.  The - the SAB 
suppliers the four is on the left and the two antenna and the suppliers 
on the right and they bring the stock that we ordered then to the - the 
warehouses that we have got and from there we take it to the branches. 
Mr Chair if we can go to the next slide.  I think this is the - 
the one that I want to explain to you how the whole process works at 
the post office itself.  We have gone through the application form.  You 
have seen the form.  Now what will happen is that the - the applicant 
has to bring the form in.  He has to bring his proof of ID.  His 
household income. 
10 
He has - he must have proof that he has a functional TV and 
his - his residential address.  We then capture that on the system at the 
front end.  Within - if the teller is - is trained and he is a teller there for 
a few years he will finalise that transaction between two and three 
minutes.  We then issue him the customer the - the information that is 
captured on the system talk immediately to the - the DDT database and 
within seconds we tell the person he has qualified or not and we 
printing the receipt. 
In the case if the person has a foreign ID the system picks it 
immediately up and it will print a receipt and say this person does not 
20 
qualify.  It is a foreign ID and you will give him the reason code and he 
can take that process then further to the call centre.  On all the 
receipts there is a - the - the call centre number is there and they 
address that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And part of the requirement for qualifying is your - 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 27 of 174 
 
your level of income.  Is that right? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Your - ja.  It is your - if 
you have - if you do not - if you earn more than 3 200 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  You will - the system 
will tell you do not qualify and will indicate that as the reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you have to earn no - not more than 3 000 … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  200? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  As a household. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a - as a household? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  As a household yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not just an individual? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  No as a household and 
- and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the household would - would include working 
children as a matter of interest? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  It could be. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would include working children? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes.  The -  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja.  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 28 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We take the total 
income.  If the household indicates - there is an affidavit form - they do 
not - do not have no income.  They just complete the - the affidavit 
form if there is no proof because when you give proof either you have a 
bank statement but the people that we have here is the poorest of the 
poor.  They do not have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Any accounts anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So we made it easy for 
them and flexible the system … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  To accommodate them 
as far as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So if there are six of you and each one you 
earns for argument sake R1 000 each.  Then you do not qualify? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  You will not qualify 
because it is - they - they take the combined household income. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if - if I go and live alone and I earn R1 000 then I 
- I qualify? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I can make myself qualify by getting out of the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 29 of 174 
 
household and taking my own household. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Well that - that can 
happen.  Ja, ja.  That can happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May I just ask about the 
residential address?  In - in the households that are in informal 
settlements where there is no street number.  There is no home 
number.  How do you deal with those case? 
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We - we use - again we 
- we are very flexible on that.  Either a letter from - from the landlord if 
there is a landlord or an affidavit or in the case he can if he has - if he 
has any proof of address any proof whatever it is that he got any - any 
documentation for that - that shows that.  We use that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry.  Sorry about that; and then once 
the post office says you do not qualify.  That is the end of the matter.  
There is no appeal process or anything. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  What we - what we do 
is on each and every - the areas that - that is currently that we 
identified or built into the system for non - for non-qualifying is a 
foreign ID.  You exceed the income.  You do not have a - you do not 
give us any proof of address.  We help you then but at that point in 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 30 of 174 
 
time we have to give him an affidavit that you has to go and complete. 
At that point in time it will say no proof but - or he has not 
got the proof of a functional TV.  So the person can always go back.  
So we give him a receipt and we tell him you have to obtain this and he 
will come back and we will then reregister him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm.  Yes, thank you.  Yes, thank you.  You 
may proceed. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN: 
 
Okay. 
 
What 
will 
happen then Mr Chair and that is where you - the facilitator had asked 
me earlier on how do we know which type the person is qualifying for.  
10 
Once the teller captures the residential address of that person.  The 
system talks immediately to SENTECH.  Like you - the same you buying 
airtime the same communication. 
Within two seconds SENTECH sends us a message back and 
says that this person’s address he qualifies for a DDT antenna.  What 
he qualifies for a DDT Decoder. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We print that then on 
the registration receipt and also what we then - is the division number 
of that is on the receipt and if you can go to annexure number D that is 
20 
on page number - Annexure D. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That will be page 95 Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  95, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair so you would 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 31 of 174 
 
see that is the registration receipt that the person receives.  I have just 
highlighted for you the green part on top.  That says it is a registration 
receipt.  Now there you can see his ID number is there.  His title is 
there.  How many households is there.  Where does he stay and most 
important the - the second one in green shows the SAB type that he 
qualifies for. 
In this case the person qualified for DDT and remember the - 
the network of SENTECH 84 percent is DDT and 16 percent they are 
seeing as - as satellite. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So in this case the 
person qualified for a SAB type and you will see at the last - the last 
one there is the distribution number.  So this person has registered in 
Gauteng and he was number 773 that registered. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSE VAN VUUREN: 
 
So 
this 
receipt 
is 
immediately after we captured his form.  He gets a receipt and he tells 
me he qualified.  Now if we go back to (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And is there - sorry, before you move on.  
Is there a monthly payment that this person will have to pay? 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  No.  It is all for free. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  All for free? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN: 
 
Remember 
as 
I 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 32 of 174 
 
explained early on currently when you go with DSTV or M-Net there is a 
subscription fee? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  With E.TV there is no 
subscription but there is a - a once off fee that you have to purchase 
the equipment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN: 
 
With 
this 
system 
everything is for free. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes, thank you.  Yes.  You 
10 
may move on. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We can go to - back to 
- to that slide. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That will be page 29. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is where you are dealing now 
(intervenes). 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Page - page 28, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  28?  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Page 28. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Yes, thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  I am sorry that I jump 
around but I have - I have (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 33 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Mr Chair you will then 
see that when the person has registered we then - the stock is - is 
delivered.  So step number two is when the stock is delivered by the 
supplier as I explained earlier on and we take it then to the post office 
and the post office warehouse is then number 3 sends then a truck and 
we deliver it at the branch. 
Now when the equipment arrives at the branch the system - 
we inform the customer via SMS that your equipment is here.  You can 
come and collect and we send an SMS.  So when the customer comes 
10 
to the - the post office all that you have to do is you have to give us his 
registration receipt.  If he has lost it we only need his ID number.  We 
go on the system. 
We verify - the screen will bring up - the person has 
registered.  We verify with his ID and we then see he qualifies for DDT 
and the teller will go and select a decoder - that one and an antenna.  
Now all the equipment that the post office received is sealed.  We do 
not open any equipment.  It is like the same when you go to Makro or 
wherever you go and you buy your DSTV or that you receive it sealed. 
So we have - everything is sealed and all the equipment is - 
20 
what is supposed to be there for the - for the guy to receive the signal 
and for the installer to do it successfully is inside this equipment.  We 
then issue it and you - if you can go to page number - slide number - 
ag, Annexure number E.  Excuse me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 34 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Annexure number E, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That will be on page 96 Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  It is 90, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then it is - 96 is the divider.  It is 
actually 97, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Now Mr Chair in this 
case remember now we have issued him a registration receipt.  Now we 
issue him the equipment.  Now you would see again his ID number.  His 
name appears.  His ID number appears.  His distribution number 
10 
appears and for the first time we show the serial number of the 
equipment that he has received. 
We then also show that his - that this one is - in - in this case 
it is also his warrantee and if you look right on the top 16 April is 
marked there in green on the receipt.  So his warrantee is then two 
years from the date of issue of this receipt.  So this is the receipt he 
must keep as a warrantee.  If any of the equipment becomes - becomes 
faulty. 
We then at the same time when we issue when the teller 
prints the system to print the receipt the system sent a SMS directly to 
20 
the installer inform - give him the detail of the customer to contact the 
customer to - to arrange for the installation.  At the same time you will 
see there the installer’s name is printed on the receipt - is there the 
name of the installation company. 
This in this case is Durban Quick Installers and we also in 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 35 of 174 
 
the case of a DDT antenna SENTECH have given us the direction the 
antenna must be installed.  So an installer is also when he received 
this and he made contact with the customer he knows what is the - the 
direction of the antenna and he has his name … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  And we issue that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  With this we also issue 
the - the customer with an installation voucher.  Now the installation 
voucher if you just as a - as Annexure G. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that will be at page 102 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Now Mr Chair in - in 
this case you would see that when we issued the installation voucher 
there is no - the form is blank as it is here.  Only at the bottom if you - 
if you look right at the bottom of the - of the page there stands pack 
label for post office use only.  When we issue the - the issue receipt it 
prints a - a bar code label. 
That bar code label contains all the intelligence of the 
customer.  We print that.  We put that bar code there and you will - you 
20 
will see now what happened there.  So what will happen then is the 
installer will contact the customer.  The customer there they were all 
happy.  The customer then has to complete Part 1 of the - of the 
installation voucher and the installer has to - and he has to confirm that 
the system has been successfully connected and he signs it off. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 36 of 174 
 
The same declaration must be - must be given by the - by the 
installer and he signs it off.  What happened then is the installer will 
bring this form to the nearest post office.  What we then do is - we - the 
teller goes through that Part 4 and he checks everything is right.  He 
checks that the form has been completed correctly by the - by the 
customer and the customer is happy that the service is successful. 
The - the installer - that the installer also has signed and 
when he then - when he has checked that the form is 100 percent 
correct he then scans that barcode at the bottom.  That barcode opened 
for him on the screen the full detail of the customer and the assigned 
10 
installer and that two has to compare. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  If it does not compare 
we issue him then a receipt that tells him either this has already been 
installed or it is the wrong installer or the wrong - or the wrong - the 
wrong customer.  So all the controls are in place if the people followed 
the correct process.  You would see on - on Annexure H what will 
happen then is … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is page 105 Chair. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We issue that receipt 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN: 
 
To 
the 
installer 
indicating to him that the installation was successful and he - what will 
happen then is within 72 hours he is - he gets then an EFT payment 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 37 of 174 
 
into his bank account and we send him also a payment advice as 
confirmation of the payment that has happened via email.  So you 
would see from the registration to the installation process all our 
procedures are there and again Mr Chair all of this information is with 
the press of a button.  It is available. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  We know what it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Then if we can just go 
back to that original slide.  I think we are nearly finished.  If go to item 
10 
number nine on that slide.  You would see that in the case - now what 
happened is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we back on - on page - page 28 or …? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Page - page 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  28? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Yes, yes Chair.  I am at 
- at bullet point number nine.  In the case the installer arrived at the 
person’s house and he opens the equipment with the customer and he 
20 
sees that the remote is not there or anything is wrong.  They then 
contact the call centre or they do not get any signal.  Let us say he has 
been issued with DDT because remember if the person stays behind a 
mountain or any obstacle and there is interference with the - from the 
tower to his house. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 38 of 174 
 
That means he has - we have to convert that customer then 
to a DTH. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So what will happen is 
the process is either the customer or the installer contacts the call 
centre.  The call centre issues them with an authority number after they 
established what the error is and they will also capture what is the 
reason for the error.  Let us say in - in this case it is a wrong SAB type.  
It should have been a DTH. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  They give the authority 
number then to the customer and installer and that person brings the 
equipment back to the post office.  We have also received then from 
the call centre the authority number.  The teller will first verify the 
equipment.  Have we issued that equipment? 
It belongs to us and by just merely scanning the - the serial 
numbers of the equipment and then what will also happen then is he 
will verify the customer that it is the customer and the installer who - 
who has been assigned.  If that is all okay he takes then the other 
authority number and he matches the two and we then exchange the 
20 
equipment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  The last one on that - 
on that slide is the return of uninstalled kit.  In that case what happens 
there is if the - if the installer has gone out and he cannot trace the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 39 of 174 
 
customer or the customer has passed away or whatever.  Then that 
equipment is returned back - back to the - the post office.  I just want 
to explain currently due to the - the size of the - of the satellite 
because it is - it is the biggest one you get. 
It is about that size (as the witness indicates) and also to fast 
track the - the issuing process.  We have also implemented a bulk issue 
process where we issue the stock not to the customer but directly to 
the installer in bulk.  The installer comes to the - the post office.  We 
issue it.  He gets an SMS that he must come and fetch the stock.  Let 
us say we have given him five sets. 
10 
We will then process a proof of - of delivery and if you go to 
the proof of delivery.  It is Annexure F.  We can just go to Annexure F 
because I think later on it will be critical. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Come to that one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page 99. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We - we do not have to go through all that 
but you just … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Want to demonstrate what he gets 
recorded? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja.  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On Annexure F. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So that is the proof of 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 40 of 174 
 
delivery that we - that we give the installer.  So Mr Chair you can see 
all the - the detail that appears of that customer.  We know it is exactly.  
He will then on the right hand - he will verify that that he has received 
that serial numbers and then on the last page he then signs it off and 
that is the proof that we then also give to the post office and the proof 
of the stock that we have issued to him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  That is on the - on the 
- I do not know whether there is any - any questions on - on that slide 
but that is the total process. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  How it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then - then - you then deal 
- sorry.  I think we have covered right up to pages - page 4 of your 
statement.  Am I right? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  (No audible reply). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe we - we do not have because the 
interest was on showing how it works. 
20 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We do not have to go through all the 
slides but you can quickly just itemise without really giving to details.  
The Chair has read your statement. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 41 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As to the challenges.  Just pointing out 
the main challenges that - that you have noted. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Okay.  So we are going 
skip the - the number of stock that we have issued and everything at 
this point in time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That - that no, no.  I think we - Dr Mutuvhi 
has given those details … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Okay.  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To the Chairperson, yes … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And he also given details of how much has 
been installed so far and how much is still outstanding. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Great. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then challenges noted - if you go 
back to page 4 of your statement.  You could just deal with those 
matters briefly.  Those that you - you regard as key. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Okay.  The challenges 
that we - if we - if we can go to page 4. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  The first one that we 
20 
had is the - is on the program side.  I think the issue Mr Chair if you 
can see where we have started for - we have planned for three years.  
From the post office side we can go per province.  We can go per 
municipality.  We can go per district municipality or nationally.  It is in 
place. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 42 of 174 
 
The - the thing is there - there is the main thing why the 
registration is - is slow I think is because of - of funding challenges and 
I think the Ministers are - are aware of that and what they have done in 
the meantime is that they have embarked on a DDT volunteer 
registration process whereby we using the current community workers 
program right down on - on provincial level. 
So we have already seen the - with the DOC the first four - 
four provinces.  From the post office side we are responsible for the 
payment of those volunteers and we are - we are processing the forms.  
The - three of the - of the provinces have been activated now and I 
10 
think they are starting to pick up speed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  So that is why I think 
with the - the current stock we have to still register about 300 000 
people.  I think that will happen within the next two to three months. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  The second one is the 
non-activation of the - of the issue phase in the - in the Gauteng and 
the Western Cape.  Now the - the challenge there is that from the post 
office side as I said we got currently 1 500 outlets.  Now they are 
20 
spread all - all across the country.  I can understand the - the impact of 
that they - that they want to go province by - by province but if I do one 
- one province the others are standing still while I have the people 
waiting for that. 
So you can understand that some of these guys have been 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 43 of 174 
 
issued - they have been registered in 2016.  They are still waiting for 
the equipment and the challenges are coming out now which is one of 
this.  I just want to emphasise that from the post office side we can go 
provincially or nationally.  Then the - the biggest one … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  That we - that we 
currently experiencing is the delay with the appointment of the - of the 
local installers.  Now what happened is the installers contracts expired 
in - it was a phase in process from November last year and the last one 
was - was expired in January.  There was a lengthy process.  So we 
10 
had - no stock had moved. 
No issues had taken place over the last seven months.  So 
the Minister has - has also then understood the importance of this and 
she has actioned it and we are in the process now to see where we can 
have the first province up and running within the next two months. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If - if I may … 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just direct you to number 15 which 
becomes the extended bulk warehousing which is something that the 
Commission has also investigated going through all the warehouse - 
20 
most of the warehouses and picking up that there is a lot of stock lying 
around. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:       Currently we – as 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 44 of 174 
 
we said before the installers, the contract expired we were focusing in 
the Free State and the first province that they want to switch off is the 
Free State province.  So I’ve only got currently one warehouse and that 
is in Bloemfontein for that area and all the other 13 there’s no 
movement which means that, that stock has to wait until I’m getting 
there.  We have registered already about 511 000 households that can 
be issued so I have to wait for the installation programme to kick in to 
get these local installers into place so that they can activate that and 
no it means that you will keep on charging – pay housing cost until 
those stock has been depleted. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And that is coupled with the challenges 
that the post office has in terms of capacity? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Which you deal with in paragraph 
[indistinct]. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:     Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then you have dealt – just given the 
Chair an idea of the investigations that SAPO has dealt with and you 
have a slide that you’ll show the break ins and the fire problems and 
stuff that gets lost in transit and what is the figure that you have there 
20 
at page six? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:     Page six.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Is that R50 885. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:       Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That’s just the losses yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 45 of 174 
 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:     Ja so from our side 
the most losses that have occurred, there’s only 12 incidents you would 
see that the total items that was lost or damaged is 85 and the total 
value of that is R50 885.  In that case we are insured and we replace it 
and the money will be paid over to SASSA for the replacement of that.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you and then at page seven you 
deal with the auto general reports, we are not going to deal with that at 
length because a witness is going to come when he deals with Bosasa 
and the investigations that were conducted by PWC and National 
Treasury, those would relate to those investigations but they tally with 
10 
the evidence that you’ve put up. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:       Yes we received the 
AG reports from Bosasa, we’re waiting currently for the final report but 
I can just emphasise from our side it’s a major – it’s a massive project.  
From our side what happened, AG that we do an audit at all the 
warehouses, we have cleared the most of the warehouses but there was 
a timespan of two days that we had and we couldn’t do the remaining 
ones so the variances have been addressed and the most of those 
variances are human errors.  You know because the project is keeping 
on so long we got – we replace staff on a continuous basis.  New staff 
20 
comes in staff – so you will have human errors that happens and – but 
from our side we put those controls back again and we cleared those 
variances.  At the branch side currently the same scenario, we have 
cleared all the – there were 30 branches selected, all those branches 
the variances has been cleared and I think there was two items where it 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 46 of 174 
 
was [indistinct] branch level but otherwise the rest of the variances 
were all cleared and we have communicated that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you. 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:     Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then in order to make sure that the 
project doesn’t get stalled you have proposed some way forward and 
you’ve placed those proposals to the Minister am I correct? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:    From our side as the 
Minister, I think she understands the importance the spectrum must 
become available as soon as possible, from our side we are preparing 
10 
and get operationally ready and what the minister wants is that the 
current stock must be registered and issued, that means the remaining 
balance of R855 000 kits that lies there – we have already registered 
R1.1million households so we can already start immediately to install 
[indistinct] issue R511 000 of that R855 000 and then we still have to 
register the remaining R300 000 which can happen soon with the 
volunteer process and we can issue that, that’s the first goal.  The 
second goal is then – is that the ministry or the project office embarks 
on that national volunteer programme to register all the remaining 
3.3million households towards the end of the year and we also fully in 
20 
place with that.  From the post office side to ensure from a capacity 
perspective we have got approval for appointment of staff as well as for 
warehouse and trans level that they can deal effectively with the 
capacity that’s going to come. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, and that’s what you cover 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 47 of 174 
 
in page 13 and 14 of your statement? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:      That’s correct.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And all the kits and the numbers and the 
figures you’ve given there, we’ve taken note of them, we don’t have to 
put them on record as to how much your stock is in detail as it is 
evidence before the Chairperson and then lastly then what you deal 
with in other at page 14 which is  the last part of your statement in 
paragraph 44, I think roughly you have covered it because when you 
deal with the way forward it’s – what you state there it’s also involved 
there but is there anything else that you want to highlight in paragraph 
10 
44? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:      Mr Chair I just want 
to give you a piece of mind that from the post office side this is our 
core business.  This is the – with this platform we can render any item 
whatever government wants to community the platforms are there.  We 
are committed to ensure the successful completion of this project and – 
because we realise it is in national interest and from our side we are 
getting ready, once the Minister announce the plans on the way forward 
to get operationally ready for those plans. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you and that is your statement 
20 
before the Chairperson? 
MR ANTON LOURENS JANSEN VAN VUUREN:       That’s correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes and your evidence, thank you.  Thank 
you Chair the one thing that I forgot, Chair to mention before we 
started is that the post office is legally represented, may their counsel 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 48 of 174 
 
place himself on record, I apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Alright let’s…[intervenes].

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Means that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Creates the impression that there is another affidavit 
that it is supporting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I suspect that was just an error? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I – yes I suspect that the 
lawyers may – his representatives maybe made that error Chair yes.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is his main affidavit. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair these are the only ones that have 
been submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To the commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr 
Motsoeneng it is correct – is it correct that you were approached by the 
investigators of the commission? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is true. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 55 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you were requested to deal with 
matters that related to the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Is it correct that at some point you 
will give us the details you were employed by the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is true. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes in what capacity were you employed? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hey I occupy many positions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  Every position within the 
10 
SABC I went through all the steps within the organisation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Except the Chairperson of the 
board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That one is still coming possibly.  Yes 
thank you.  Could you just take the Chair through those steps that 
you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not want that one? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one you did not want? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I started at the SABC in 1989. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  As a freelancer.  At that time I 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 56 of 174 
 
was still at school.  There were some talent search where the late 
Hlapane Masitenyane is the one person from the SABC and others they 
were head hunting young people because there was a Chappies Little 
League it was – it was sponsored young people soccer so they 
identified me there as potential to work for SABC as a freelancer at the 
time I was still at school. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I – ai okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I moved from that position as a 
10 
freelancer. I was approached by the late [indistinct] Qwaqwa to leave 
television. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry how long did you work as a freelancer or 
you cannot remember? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I work from 1989 until 1995 
early because I started working permanently in 1995 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  After that I was a 
freelancer for radio as a journalist until 1995 when I was approached by 
20 
Alwyn Kloppers who was in charge for news at that time to join SABC 
permanently and reason being that at that time they were looking for 
you know black journalists, also looking for people to come on board 
especially as journalists for different radio stations.  We were many as 
freelancers from different radio stations.  They approached me.  I agree 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 57 of 174 
 
to join SABC permanently so in 1995 I was head hunted.  And I want to 
deal with the issue Chairperson here which for me it is – it is an insult 
for people to say that I have lied about matric.  It is very serious issue 
to me Chairperson. It does not go well with me when everyone media 
and others they portray me as a liar including Public Protector.  And I 
am going to demonstrate to you Chairperson that I was approached by 
Alwyn Kloppers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was – I do not know if it is he or she – what was 
his or her position? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson at that time Alwyn 
10 
Kloppers was in charge for current affairs news. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that a man it is just that I cannot hear the name 
properly except the surname? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Alwyn Kloppers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes would that be a man would that be… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Oh a man Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that would that be a man or a woman? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  A man Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes it … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say his position was what at the time? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  He was in charge for current 
affairs news. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In the Free State? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Ja he was the [indistinct] in the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 58 of 174 
 
head office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At head office? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  At head office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson.  I was head 
hunted and I declare from the onset that Alwyn I do not have matric and 
we have discussion with Alwyn and then he said to me but you are so 
talented I do not think I need matric for you to work for SABC.  Because 
I have seen your contribution when you were still freelancing.  He sent 
the late Olivier.  The late Olivier was from Bloemfontein to say go and 
10 
check this man.  He does not have a matric go and engage him.  So 
Olivier came to Qwaqwa to engage me now because I was supposed to 
go to Bloemfontein to work in Bloemfontein.  I also declared to him 
when I declared he said no Alwyn told me that you do not have a 
matric.  So we went and then we talk. Before I joined SABC 
permanently Chairperson they took me to a course to go and learn 
about broadcasting.  Normally SABC they do not take a freelancer to go 
and train a freelancer.  It has never happened in the history of the 
SABC.  I am the first person to be taken. Even when I was taken 
Chairperson if you look the records of the SABC because normally what 
20 
they will do I mean you know when you attend these courses they ask 
about qualifications, they ask about everything, about yourself and so 
on and so on.  In those where we fill those forms you will never find a 
matric.  You will never find where I said I have passed matric because 
it was a well-known fact that I do not have matric.  And Chair I want to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 59 of 174 
 
demonstrate to you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry Mr Motsoeneng sorry to disturb 
you so that you do not lose this point that you have just made about Mr 
Kloppers.  Chair if I may just refer Chair to the reference bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which is Exhibit CC32.  Mr Motsoeneng 
you will see next to you on your left hand side there is a box. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On the left. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In that box you will find… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  One CC sorry. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  CC32.  32. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  CC – oh yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair could I please refer the 
witness to an affidavit that the investigators found in his personal file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Deposed to by Mr Alwyn Kloppers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That he has mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That appears Chair at page 404. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  404. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  404.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Is that Alwyn Kloppers 
that you mentioned to the Chairperson just now? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 60 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Are you aware of this affidavit or are 
you seeing it for the first time? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I know that affidavit even if I 
am sleeping. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh do you – do you want to  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I feel that he was still wanting to make his points.  Do 
you want to let him finish the points he wants to make then revert to it? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then refer to this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us allow him… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay Chair I thought he had moved… 
CHAIRPERSON:  An opportunity to… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deal with this matter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is obviously a matter that is quite 
20 
important to him and it is important to the public. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is an opportunity for him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deal with it properly. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 61 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Thank you Chair.  So I was on 
the point that I went and attended this course here in Gauteng from 
Qwaqwa and I was fetched by the SABC employees at that time.  
Everybody knowing that I do not have a matric.  I attend a course.  
There is a certificate Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words part of the point you make is there 
would have been no point in you at that time saying you have got matric 
10 
when everybody knew that you did not have? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is part of the point you wanted to make. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So I attend this course and the 
reasons for me to attend that course according to management now of 
the SABC.  The reason was I shall get more experience on 
broadcasting.  Because when you are a freelancer you are just you 
know reporting but you do not know the game of broadcasting.  So I 
20 
went.  Everything went well Chairperson.  After that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long was the course?  What was the duration of 
the course? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It was not too long Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like a week, a month, three months? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 62 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Let us say between a week and 
two weeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I am – to be honest I will just 
check but yes it was not too long.  So – and we went with others who 
were just employed by the SABC.  Immediately Chairperson on the 17 t h 
February in 1995 I received a letter immediately after completing the 
course that you are employed permanently so from Olivier.  And Chair if 
you look at that letter it is part of my attachment here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know what is very 
interesting?  That letter it does not say a matric certificate and because 
they knew that I do not have a matric certificate.  I think the SABC they 
were concerned about my health.  You know when you read it you will 
see that they are talking about my health I – that is the condition that 
they put a health condition.  So – and when you read that letter in full 
you will realise that there was no condition for matric.  Because even in 
that document they are saying bring qualification.  What will be 
qualification?  Qualification it may be course that you did which I 
believe that is the course that I did.  I gave them that qualification that 
20 
they have empowered me.  So that is qualification.  There is no matric 
nothing because they knew and Chairperson when Alwyn came 
remember Alwyn I was supposed to go and work for Lesedi FM.  It is 
just that he was a white man in charge for all this radio stations.  What 
he need to do after that he need to go to the Lesedi FM management to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 63 of 174 
 
say I want this man and here are the reasons.  When he talk and 
engage management of the SABC at that time the lady [indistinct] 
Phulaphula Mathibe [?] they said no actually we are very happy.  Ndada 
[indistinct] I am the one who recruited the man from television and 
there is affidavit of Phulaphula Mathibe confirming the same matter 
Chairperson.  I was appointed people know him exactly. The only issue 
that I want to demonstrate to you Chairperson you have probation at 
the SABC – six months’ probation.  If you join SABC you have that 
probation.  The affidavit is – the attachment is there.  That probation 
for six months which means if I lied about matric I could not pass that 
10 
probation.  Because probation in my view they will look at your 
performance.  They will look on your qualifications. They will ask you 
where is that matric that you said you have matric?  We cannot employ 
you without that matric it has never happened.  That is why I went 
through that probation.  They were happy and they were not unhappy 
Chairperson.  I want to clarify that Chairperson.  The only issue that 
you will find there Chairperson is the issue that when I went to a clerk 
the lady called Marie Swanepoel – because now it is where you need to 
submit whatever that you must submit.  In our discussion but I was 
already appointed by the SABC.  In our discussion she said Hlaudi here 
20 
is the form and this form you must fill this form.  I said to her, look you 
know what I have written matric but I did not pass matric.  But at that 
time I am working for SABC Chairperson.  And you will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long after you have started was it when you 
spoke to that lady? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 64 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how long had you started working permanently. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Ah Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you spoke to that lady more or less?  A month, 
two months, six months? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No, no Chair remember I was a 
freelancer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no I mean after permanent appointment. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No, no after permanent 
appointment I was appointed in February but staring in March. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  After that appointment I 
went to the lady… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it was immediately after getting the letter for 
appointment. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think it was after a day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After a day or so. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  [indistinct] [Chair and Mr 
Motsoeneng speaking over one another]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright okay. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I went to the lady to do 
whatever.  I mean your medical aid because I went and I give all those 
documents. There was a form there where I was supposed to fill 
whether I had passed Standard Ten or not.  So I discussed with the 
lady.  I said no you know what I have written matric but because I have 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 65 of 174 
 
been supping you know you write and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have been writing supplementary exams? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And not even going to school 
because I was already … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not attending school ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Working at the SABC and 
Chairperson I want to demonstrate this.  It is so painful for us as black 
people when you know our history.  You know I was alone and you find 
10 
here now SABC is employing you as a freelancer I am not even talking 
about permanent.  And you do not have anyone to look after you.  What 
you will choose?  You will say ai the bread I choose the bread.  I say 
let me go and work for SABC.  I will go and write which I did but 
normally if you do not attend classes the full time you will fail.  Which I 
failed. But I said no someone actually called me and said Hlaudi you 
know what you need to do.  If you can – if you can check with the 
Department of Education maybe combine your symbol you may get a 
pass.  That was the information that I have got and I went – I said to 
this lady no I was advised that if maybe I go and combine the symbols I 
20 
may get a pass.  She said no it is fine but fill this form.  I filled this 
form Chairperson.  I said but I am not even sure about these symbols 
that I am putting here because remember it has been long I do not 
remember.  I do not even have those symbols with me.  They are in 
Qwaqwa I am in Bloemfontein at school.  So I fill this symbols which I 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 66 of 174 
 
mention I am not sure about the symbols and then he said no because 
you are going to Pretoria you can fill this one. When you come from 
Pretoria you can tell me whether you did combine the subject and you 
did receive a pass.  I went with Sophie Mkwena to Pretoria to check my 
symbols. I came back. After coming back I told the lady no you know 
what it is a pity I did not succeed and I asked her myself. I said 
remember you said I should fill this form.  She said no do not worry I 
will write outstanding.  In my view outstanding it means that I do not 
have matric.  That was my understanding.  I did not take that issue of 
that I have written Standard Ten there as really the main issue that it is 
10 
an issue. Because she said to me outstanding for me I do not have 
matric.  But there are also engagement after that where the same lady. 
When I was investigated now by the SABC in 2000 the lady wrote a 
letter and the lady said I am aware that Hlaudi went to Pretoria to try to 
combine his symbols to get a pass.  How can I combine if I said I have 
a matric?  What am I going to combine?  Because already I have a 
matric.  It is insulting Chairperson for people who do not follow that 
narrative where I come from about all these issues.  In any case 
Chairperson my view is the only person who can say I lie is my 
employer. The person who went and head hunt me and the management 
20 
of the Lesedi FM.  Those are the only people who can say I lied.  
Anyone who comes I do not know to be honest and it is so painful 
Chairperson because Media people have been tarnishing my name 
about matric certificate.  Worst part is Public Protector. I do not know 
what was happening in the – in her mind with due respect Chairperson.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 67 of 174 
 
Because here is the Public Protector. If you will check the transcript 
Chairperson or you listen the recording I deny lying about matric 
several, several times. Hey Chairprson she push.  And the guy who was 
working with him investigator… 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now the previous Public Protector? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes the former Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry Chair the former Public 
Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  She pushed I can see but the 
Public Protector here what she is pushing?  She said to me and this 
guy was closing the matter.  Actually she was closing the matter.  He 
said to the guy no, no, no Hlaudi has answered that question.  I said 
okay.  For me I am done.  She went and said Hlaudi but looking back do 
you think you were supposed to write Standard Ten?  Looking back, 
thinking about at that time you were 23 year old. Do you think?  I said 
in my view I mean because Media has been tarnishing me and anybody 
– I was saying but maybe I was not supposed to even take advice from 
the HR to fill that form.  But I am not accepting that I lied about my 
20 
matric.  I am just saying that looking now what people are saying about 
me. How people view me I think I was not supposed to do it.  But it 
does not – I am not saying I accept that I lie – I never lied Chairperson. 
God knows that I have never lied.  Those people who employed me they 
knew and what is very interesting Chairperson about this matric issue.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 68 of 174 
 
Even at the SABC you know when I address people everybody know 
that I will talk about matric.  I will boost about matric.  And I will tell 
people not here at head office even when I was in the Free State that 
me I will beat you.  I am not afraid with your qualifications because I 
think I am capable and I have a vision and I have a plan. And 
Chairperson I have won many awards within the SABC.  I have – 
including outside recognition including outside Chairperson.  And I want 
to say Chairperson because I am going to talk about heads or argument 
Chairperson on the light note you know.  You use that in court so.  Here 
is my issue Chairperson I want to define education because if we do 
10 
not tell the truth about education this country will collapse.   
In my view Chairperson I am very educated.  I am very 
educated and I will tell you why Chairperson I am saying this.  If you 
check all the minutes of the SABC you will see 70 percent of the 
resolutions of the board or the resolution of the Exco I am the main 
man influencing the decision within the SABC.  So that shows that I am 
capable. 
I have skills but also Chairperson when you look and I am 
asking time on this Chairperson and I am sorry I know I am talking long 
… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I would just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Want to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want you to … 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 69 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To - to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is an important point for you and to the public and 
this is an opportunity for you to put your - your side of the story on.  So 
that is why I am allowing you but obviously we cannot go too far … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am allowing to you a fair opportunity to put your 
side of the story. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
And 
on 
the 
right 
note 
Chairperson when you were asking some questions to others you said 
10 
to them but if you did advertise this post and allow others to participate 
you do not think maybe I am just - you did not say that - but you do not 
think maybe you will get another person who is better than Hlaudi.  I 
can tell you in the SABC no one was better than me. 
Even if they advertise it and Chairperson you - we should 
also look at the calibre of management and the board that the SABC is 
appointing.  We must look at that because that is where the problem is 
Chairperson and I am going to demonstrate to you why I am saying this.  
You know you go for interviews.  You will find the people who are 
asking you questions they are clueless but these people they have 
20 
been put there and when I am saying they are clueless Chairperson I 
am not judging people about the degree that they have - how many 
degrees because the degrees Chairperson if you are appointed to sell 
milk. 
You are a manager somewhere selling milk it does not mean 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 70 of 174 
 
that you know the SABC because for me education is the knowledge, 
the expertise the skills of that environment. What I have realised 
Chairperson why I beat many people there is because at the top I was 
the only one who has grown within the ranks of the SABC and I 
understand the SABC. 
Even when I talk to the employees of the SABC they know 
what I am talking about because those are the issues that they know 
but if you take someone from outside Chairperson those who are saying 
I am not educated I trained doctors at the SABC.  I train lawyers.  
When they join SABC what do you know?  It is theory because that is 
10 
what our education system is. 
People know theory and when you know theory that is where 
the problem is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You should combine … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you - you taught them about what happens in 
practice at the SABC and how SABC works.  That is what you say you 
taught them about? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is why I am saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is an insult … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  For anyone who is saying 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 71 of 174 
 
Hlaudi is Matricless. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you - you say that the fact that you do not - you 
did not have Matric did not prevent you from acquiring a lot of 
knowledge about how SABC works and that was an important advantage 
on your side? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson and I want to 
thank the SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because even if you check my 
profile … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They took me to universities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I lecture at the universities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I wonder how many people who 
are saying I am uneducated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Even the - at - at Wits Business 
School … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I lecture and my lectures … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  About leadership … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 72 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They have turned them as part 
of their syllabus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Who said I am no - I am - I am 
educated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is an insult because we must 
view education … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The way people are viewing it 
because to have paper Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You are not educated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Paper opens doors for you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But also you need yourself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To empower yourself and I am 
also always saying Chairperson, education for me I learn every day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 73 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So that for me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Is 
education. 
 
Maybe 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So that I do not long … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Let me pause Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine and then Ms Norman … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can then … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then take you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take you through step by step … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that might involve referring you to some of the 
documents that may have been - that are relevant to something you 
have already touched upon but she will then now lead you but I wanted 
you to have a fair opportunity of dealing with this matter that you feel 
strongly about. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank - thank you very much Chair.  
Mr Motsoeneng could you just please have a look at that bundle that is 
marked CC32 which is next to you.  It is - it is a reference file.  I think 
this is the one on your write. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 74 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  CC32. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  32? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes.  On the spine - it is written on 
the spine outside 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Oh, outside? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It would be written 32.  Is that the one? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  It is the one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much.  Could you please 
turn then to page - I wanted to refer you to page 4-0-4.  The affidavit of 
10 
Mr Kloppers. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  4-0-4? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Have you found it? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am - I am nearly there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay, thank you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes - yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, have you found - thank you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is quite - it is about three pages long 
but I would like to take you just to identify who Mr Kloppers was and 
20 
maybe just take you to the paragraphs that deal with your qualification 
if you are happy with that.  Unless of course you feel that there are 
other paragraphs that you need to highlight.  Thank you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am fine.  I am fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In paragraph 1 he says: 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 75 of 174 
 
“I the undersigned Alwyn Kloppers do hereby make 
the following statement under oath.  I am an adult 
male employed by the South African Broadcasting 
Corporation (“the SABC”) as its Manager Regional 
Resources SABC News.  Facts deposed to herein 
contain save where otherwise stated or contrary 
appears from the context within my personal 
knowledge and are to the best of my knowledge and 
belief true and correct.” 
And then he talks about Mr Reddy but in paragraph 5 or 
10 
maybe four he says - I beg your pardon page 4.  He says: 
“Most newsrooms obliged …” 
It does not make sense now if I start there.  Maybe Chair I 
should start from paragraph 3 in order to - for it to make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is it?  Thank you. 
“During 1994 I was tasked by the then Head or 
Radio 
Mr Govin Reddy 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
appointment of staff to make the SABC’s newsroom 
and political desk more representative.  At the time 
20 
I was the Managing Editor of SABC Radio News.  
Mr Reddy pointed out that the staff should reflect 
the language needs of the SABC’s audiences in the 
country and that reporters, news bulletin writers 
and current affairs staff were required to file 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 76 of 174 
 
editorial content in all languages.” 
Paragraph 4: 
“Most newsrooms obliged and staff members were 
appointed over a period of a few months.  However 
the Free State Newsroom expressed reservations 
about the drive to transform the SABC Radio News 
to reflect the demographics of SABC audiences.  
Several discussions were held with the then 
Regional Editor of the Bloemfontein Newsroom to 
convince him to appoint staff.  His main reason not 
10 
to appoint staff was that he could not fine Sesotho 
speaking journalists.” 
Five: 
“I pointed out to the Regional Editor that he has 
only one Sesotho speaking person in the newsroom 
and that it would be impossible for that person to 
fill for news bulletins and current affairs.  I advised 
him that more staff members were needed to gather 
news, to produce bulletins on the hour and to fill 
the current affairs slots of Lesedi Radio Station.” 
20 
Six: 
“I reminded the Regional Editor that some months 
earlier I provided him with contact details of his 
Eastern Free State freelance Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng 
who was in regular contact with the Bloemfontein 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 77 of 174 
 
newsroom 
and 
provided 
quality 
news 
for 
broadcasting.  He said that Mr Motsoeneng did not 
have Matric and as such he would not appoint him.” 
Seven: 
“The matter was subsequently discussed with 
Mr Reddy to whom I explained the difficulty I had 
with the Regional Editor in Bloemfontein and how 
he was not …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is too long - or maybe the one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman ja.  I do think you should read the whole 
of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, thank you.  Can we move to paragraph 
10? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 10 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just to tell us what the gist is what it is of what 
it says. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he has … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He has testified … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To it. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 78 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe paragraph 10 Chair because this is 
important.  He says … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  “Mr Motsoeneng never lied to or 
misled the SABC about his qualifications as the 
SABC was fully aware that he did not have a Matric 
Certificate when it employed him.  In fact he 
declared this from the outset.” 
So is that the affidavit that you say you know off by heart? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In response to the questions and then 
following that page Mr Motsoeneng there is page 4-0-7.  There is the 
application for employment form.  Do you see that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I see that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you complete that form yourself? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  I did but some of the - 
20 
some of the spelling there or the one who wrote Matric is not me.  It is 
the two people who wrote there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  If you can check the spelling.  
It is not even the same. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 79 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes but on - on the form itself did you 
complete your name and your names there? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Your name and your surname there? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And your home address and postal 
addresses? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And telephone numbers? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then if you turn over the 
page you have put in your ID number and your place of birth? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you put in the high school? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then the highest standard past if you 
look at that form and you put in there 10? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you put in the year that you passed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are - you are at page 4-0-8? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 80 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You put in highest standard past and what 
did you put in there? 
R HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I put 10. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then you - there is year and then what 
year did you put in? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is 1991. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then you put in your age? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So do you agree that that 
information was false?  That you had standard - you had passed 
Standard 10? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I do not agree.  Reason 
being as I have already alluded to the issue I did not lie about Standard 
10.  I was advised by the HR.  That is the reason why I went to Pretoria 
to check whether I can combine those symbols to give me a Matric 
Certificate.  I did not lie at all and already I was employed by - by the 
SABC. 
20 
The - the issue that I am saying Chairperson that I am saying 
- I am saying looking back.  Not accepting - looking back I was not 
supposed to take this advice from the lady but there is no lie and the 
SABC did not - the SABC knew that I do not have a Matric.  They 
employed me because the Public Protector what he was pushing he was 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 81 of 174 
 
saying no actually Hlaudi was - he was supposed to be employed 
because of Matric. 
That is false.  It is wrong and misleading Chairperson 
honestly … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I - I - if -if I was 
another person I would say no because this form even if you check 
Chairperson is - is written - many people written there but because I am 
honest I accept did you say who.  Yes.  I - I put that one.  I will say it is 
Marie Swanepoel because she is the one who wrote here if I was 
10 
having my own but I knew that did it but I was not lying.  I did not lie. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I am going to put this question 
differently. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If I divorce my mind from your evidence 
that you have given earlier and all I have before me is this form page 
408.  If I look at that form I can say that the person who is mentioned 
on this form has passed Standard 10 and … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry, sorry.  May I finish please? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  The person who is mentioned on 
these pages passed Standard 10 and his subjects he had English an E 
symbol; South Sotho, E symbol; Afrikaans, E symbol; Bibs, E symbol 
and History F.  That is what I read from this page.  Alright.  Would this 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 82 of 174 
 
information be correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is not correct because when 
you look Chairperson in that form outstanding Matric. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On the right hand side which 
was written by the lady called Marie Swanepoel.  When you look here 
and this talks to the issue that I was not even sure about my symbols 
Chairperson - when you look here the symbols that I put here I was just 
putting - I put the symbols there but they do not even give you a pass.  
Those symbols they do not give you a pass. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are - four of them are symbol E and then the 
fifth one is - is it J? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  F Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  F, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So the point that I am making is you 
must remember a person looking at this form does not know your 
interactions with Ms Swanepoel.  The person looking at this form is 
20 
looking at a person who has passed Standard 10 according to what is 
recorded here. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair with due respect I will 
submit that just reading the form it does not give you the person 
passed Standard 10.  If you did not go to school you can believe this 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 83 of 174 
 
but if you went to school you must read you must check what is the - 
what is the meaning of all issues and analyse it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So I just want to understand.  Are you 
saying because I need to understand exactly what the point you making 
is.  I am not understanding it.  Are you saying that this information that 
you are putting - that you had put in here was unreliable information 
because you must look at it and compare with what Ms Swanepoel had 
said on the right hand side? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
I 
- 
I 
am 
saying 
this 
Chairperson.  I was advised - I am saying I was not sure about the 
10 
symbols which Marie Swanepoel in her own letter confirmed this.  
Marie Swanepoel in her own - by writing outstanding Matric confirmed 
this.  This document according to me Chairperson in - in my view when 
I came from Pretoria now coming back to say I do not have Matric. 
I cannot get those symbols to give me a pass.  For me the HR 
- they were supposed to remove this paper.  They were supposed - as 
HR - they were supposed to - to remove it but instead of removing it 
they put outstanding and in my understanding because I engaged - in 
my understanding outstanding is - Matric is outstanding. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So - and it - it was well known 
that I did not lie about Matric. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So in other words then if you say they 
could have put it away then it makes the point which I am making to 
you that then - that information was unreliable - incorrect information. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 84 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  You know it is 
English. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I do understand, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is unreliable the … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The information. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let - let me … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me - let us leave - leave aside reliable or not 
reliable.  Let us go back to the question that Ms Norman put about 
whether the information was false.  The information that you had 
passed Standard 10 on what you have told me today could not have 
been true.  Do you - do you understand that or do you want me to 
continue before you - so that you can follow it? 
Maybe let me continue.  It could not have been true because 
you yourself have told me today that you did not have Matric.  Standard 
10 was Matric.  Okay, but it seems to me that what you maybe wanting 
20 
to say is that although this information that you had passed Matric was 
not true in writing it down you may have acted in good faith on the 
advice of Ms Swanepoel if that is the case but it seems to me basically 
from what you are saying that you cannot say you did not have Matric 
then but the information that says you had passed Standard 10 is 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 85 of 174 
 
correct. 
The two are mutually exclusive but it is a different thing if 
you say I accept that what I wrote there is not true but here are the 
circumstances under which I wrote what I wrote there and when I look 
at those circumstances I believe I did not do anything wrong - if that is 
what you say.  You - you understand?  You understand the distinction? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  100 percent I agree with you.  
That is why I was saying even when the Public Protector earlier - when 
10 
I said looking back I was not supposed to take that advice … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  From Marie Swanepoel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and on the point now that 
you have agreed with Chair maybe we should take you to what is 
20 
contained at page 4-1-3 of the same document - same bundle … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  CC32.  Page 4-1-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry Ms Norman.  Let me just clear this. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 86 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the words outstanding Matric Certificate which 
are written on that page 4-0-8 were they written after you had come 
back from Pretoria or before you went to Pretoria or do - do you not 
remember? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I Chairperson.  I remember 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  The - the symbols 
on the left hand side … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I have written them before I 
went to Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The outstanding one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Marie Swanepoel wrote when I 
came from Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay.  That is after you had reported back 
20 
to her how you had gone in Pretoria? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Maybe to - to be 
fair to you Mr Motsoeneng we should start at page 4-1-1. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 87 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am there Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  4-1-1.  Are you there?  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Page 4-1-1 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  4-1-1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the same bundle, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMN:  Same bundle, yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This is a letter that was written to you 
Mr Motsoeneng from Mr Paul Tati Human Resources Consultant.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And - and that letter was dated 
27 March 1996. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then it - the reference is “Educational 
Qualification” and this is what it says: 
“We refer to the conversation between yourself and 
the writer on 19 March 1996 in the above regard 
and confirm that you have undertaken to write the 
outstanding course towards obtaining your Matric 
20 
Certificate during October 1996.  We also confirm 
that it was pointed out to you that the lack of this 
certificate will be a serious impediment in your 
career progression in the corporation.  We wish you 
every success in your academic endeavours and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 88 of 174 
 
advice that we will follow your progress with 
interest.  Yours faithfully, Paul Tati.” 
You - did you receive that letter? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  If you could just turn over the 
page at page 4-1-2.  This was another letter it appears to be.  It looks 
like a memo but it - it is - it was written to you.  Mr Motsoeneng from 
Ms H Mofokeng dated 12 October 1999 and the subject: 
“Educational Qualification Matric Certificate:  we 
refer to letter dated 27 March 1996 from Paul Tati 
10 
regarding outstanding Matric Certificate.  You are 
hereby once again requested to hand in a copy of 
your 
Matric 
Certificate 
as soon as possible.  
Attached please find a copy of the letter sent to you 
by Paul Tati.” 
Which is the same letter that we have already read.  Oh 
sorry.  I beg your pardon.  It is another letter and that appears at page 
4-1-3.  That one was date 4 May 2000. 
“Dear Mr Motsoeneng, Matric Certificate:  I refer to 
the above matter and confirm that despite numerous 
20 
requests and reminders your Matric Certificate is 
still outstanding.  Management must insist that this 
certificate is submitted 
to 
your local 
Human 
Resources 
Office 
by 
no 
later 
than 
Friday 
12 May 2000.  I must also draw your attention to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 89 of 174 
 
the fact that you have recorded your highest 
standard passed as Standard 10 in the application 
for employment form which you completed when you 
joined the SABC in 1995.  I appreciate your 
assistance 
in 
this 
regard. 
 
Yours 
faithfully, 
Mr P M Tati.” 
Did you also receive that one? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Then the last one I would like 
to refer you to is the one written by Ms Marie Swanepoel.  Is that the 
10 
lady that you referred to as the one who had written outstanding 
certificate? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and that appears at page 4-1-4.  
She mentions your name in the second paragraph.  Although says re - 
reference: 
“To whom it may concern.” 
The letter is dated 5 September 2000. 
“G H Motsoeneng, A398.” 
And she says that - I am sorry just: 
20 
“Ms H Botes 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
Mr Motsoeneng 
did 
not 
hand 
in 
his 
Matric 
Certificate which I just wrote on the application 
form outstanding Matric Certificate March 1995.  
Mr Motsoeneng thereafter went to Pretoria to see if 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 90 of 174 
 
he can get a Matric Certificate to combine his 
symbols.  
He 
informed 
me 
on 
the date 
of 
appointment that he was not sure of the symbols of 
his subjects and I informed him that it was fine.” 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Is that correct; and then the last one 
on the Matric Certificate issue is also from Ms Letsatsi and that is page 
4-1-5 dated 4 May 2000. 
“I refer to the above matter and confirm that despite 
numerous requests and reminders your Matric 
10 
Certificate is still outstanding. Management insists 
that this certificate be submitted to your local 
Human Resources Office by Friday …” 
Is it not the same that I read?  Yes, it is the same.  It is the 
same letter as the one that I read.  I beg your pardon Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It is the same letter as the one that 
appears at 4-1-3 and then page 4-1-6.  Do you recognise that document 
Mr Motsoeneng? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  I do. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What - what is this?  What - what is 
this document? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  This document it will be the 
symbols. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.

MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That I was referring to the - 
now when you combine your - your symbols. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Is this the certificate that you 
submitted then to your employer? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes) certificate. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think this one Chair it goes 
hand in hand with Marie Swanepoel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is when the SABC they were 
10 
starting to investigate this matter.  Some people were believing that no 
I lied … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  For me to be employed at the 
SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And then that is when now I - I 
tried to get this - what do you call?  This certificate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So that I can check … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  My - whether - my symbols. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Yes. 
 
It 
confirms 
what 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 92 of 174 
 
Marie Swanepoel was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you.  So just to end up then that 
topic all in all then as you can read from what Miss – I know what you 
had said outstanding matric but outstanding matric certificate may 
mean that you passed matric but the certificate you have not 
submitted? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    In my view, not at all, in my 
understanding I’m just talking in my understanding especially knowing 
that I have lied, I have never said I have got matric certificate.    
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   But then why is that Mr Tati kept on 
harping on the certificate, when are you submitting your matric 
certificate? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Ai Chair, maybe he knows 
why because if you look at his letters, contradiction, in one letter he’s 
saying that our discussion, which is true, our discussion, in that you 
were right outstanding subjects and he said this is going to have impact 
on you for your progress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let’s go to that letter because that might be 
important. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That is true Chair, we’ll find it, 
sorry…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:     Maybe before we go there just remind me again on 
which page I find Mr Motsoeneng’s application form, the one 
written…[intervenes].   
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 93 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The one we referred to Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Page 408. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay I’d lost it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Page 408 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    And then the letter that Mr Motsoeneng 
refers to that is 411. 
CHAIRPERSON:     411? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That’s correct Chair.     
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, well if you – if one reads that letter from Mr 
Paul Tati at page 411, it – just reading that letter alone leaving out 
others, it seems that certainly, as at the 27 t h of March 1996, which is 
the date of his letter to you, he did understand that you had – you had 
not passed matric yet? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    It is true Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and he confirms that in the conversation that he 
had, had with you there was an indication that you undertook to write 
the outstanding course – I don’t know if it was course or courses at that 
time but the outstanding course, that’s what he says, towards obtaining 
20 
your matric certificate, that’s how he puts it at that time? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    That’s true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I wanted to go back to when you were 
employed permanently in 1995, I think you said earlier on, something to 
the effect that possession of matric was not a requirement for the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 94 of 174 
 
position for which you were appointed, did I understand you correctly? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Are you sure about that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chair, I’m sure because I 
needed to produce the letter where we can see my appointment letter, I 
think it would talk to your question Chair and give you comfort on that, 
on that letter what the letter says, and also Chairman, let me just add 
there are many people at that stage that don’t have matric, even today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    SABC even on record 
10 
publically so. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I think Dr Ngubane said the same thing yesterday. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes there are many people, at 
the SABC Chairperson, you also look at talent, you know SABC 
Chairperson even if you can come with a degree if you don’t have 
talent, if you are not a singer you are not a singer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, hmm.    
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes if you are not a 
broadcaster because broadcaster is talent, that’s why Chairperson 
you’ll find that – and I’m not saying this because I don’t have those 
20 
degrees, the history of the SABC most people who are excelling is 
talent, it’s not those qualifications.  There are those that are excelling 
but you can see that at least they have empowered themselves and 
also enhanced their talent. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 95 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    But most of them they are not 
– because talent is talent Chairperson, we even in a Board meeting 
argue these issues to say, look here you are not Eskom so even if you 
employ people, we even – I don’t remember well Chairperson but I think 
we even changed the policy of the SABC to say, let us look at talent 
because when people have talent you can’t go wrong.  They are the 
ones who bring audience because it’s all about – sometimes 
Chairperson those who are not really having all those degrees, you 
know some people will say, no these people useless stuff but that 
person is the most person that is being followed by the audience.  For 
10 
me it’s just maybe – it’s a broadcaster Chairperson.  People who are 
acting as actors, your soapies and dramas, some of them they don’t 
have even matric but…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:       But they are good actors. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think even the judges they 
watch these people, they are so excited. 
CHAIRPERSON:     [Laughter] 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     So you see Chairperson 
that’s why I’m saying in South Africa we must be able to talk to the 
business. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well you see Mr Motsoeneng, and we’ll go back to 
my question now, I mean, you don’t have to convince me or persuade 
me that somebody who doesn’t have matric or somebody who never 
went to school may have talent, may be bright, may be smart and may 
be very good in certain things, you don’t have to convince me I know 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 96 of 174 
 
that to be true.  So I would not look down upon a person just because 
they don’t have formal education or because they don’t have matric, or 
because they don’t have a degree, you see.  Obviously if in an 
institution  the law or the policies or the regulations say for this 
position you must have a certain qualification, then for me it is 
important that there must be compliance with the law, the regulations 
and the policies but just because somebody doesn’t have that 
qualification doesn’t  mean that they are useless, doesn’t mean that 
they don’t deserve respect, it doesn’t mean that they don’t have dignity.  
They are important, they can play a very important part and make a 
10 
very important contribution in society without that.  So I just thought 
maybe I must just make that clear.  But let’s go back to the question, 
you were looking for a letter but when you gave evidence earlier, I 
understood you to be suggesting that the letter might not necessarily 
have said anything about matric but it said something about your health 
and  I – from that I suspected that the point you wanted to make was if 
matric was a requirement, the letter would have said something about 
it, is that correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In other words if we go – if we look for it, it’s not 
20 
going to – we’re not going to find any sentence in the letter that says 
matric is not a requirement but what you want to say is, it doesn’t refer 
to matric because matric was not a requirement, that’s how you read it 
ad it does refer to the issues of health because issues of health were a 
requirement, that’s what you wanted to say? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 97 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair because normally if 
you are employed in that letter it will be, submit your matric certificate 
or your diploma, I’m just giving…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s how normally it would – yes but in this 
case it didn’t say that?     
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    It didn’t say that Chair and 
that letter is here…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes I’m sure we will find it.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes it’s page 209 Chair – I beg your 
pardon Chair that would be page 209 of CC…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the bundle that has got his statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   His statement it’s an Annexure to Mr 
Motsoeneng’s…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the divider? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    The divider number Chair, would be at 
number 11.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:       Have you found it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:       Yes I found it, it says, 
 
“Dear Motsoeneng the SABC has pleasure in offering you’re 
 
the following position, that is trainee journalist”,  
20 
 
Then it gives details thereafter it says, 
 
“Your appointment is also conditional upon a satisfactory 
 
medical certificate and X-ray report.  Attached is medical 
 
questionnaire to be completed by a medical practitioner, it will 
 
be in your own interest to undergo the medical examination 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 98 of 174 
 
 
before you commence service.  The corporation will make 
 
arrangements for the X-ray examination after you been 
 
appointed.  Membership of the pension fund”, 
 
Then I think the point you wanted to make…[intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:       The next page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh the next page, 
 
“Please report to blah-blah-blah then says documents relating 
 
to 
appointment 
including 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
corporations 
 
disciplinary code and grievance procedure which form part of 
 
your conditions of service will be handed to you, in accordance 
10 
 
with the personnel regulations you are requested to submit, 
 
the following document’s when you report for duty, 1) birth 
 
certificate or national identity document, 2) educational 
 
certificates, 3) unemployment insurance card, income tax 
 
reference, valid drivers licence ban/building society, then 
 
kindly inform me within 15 days of this letter whether you 
 
accept the appointment, this is done by completing the 
 
declaration at the end of the original of this letter”, 
 
I think what I’ve read includes what you wanted to highlight. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:       Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it says you must submit your educational 
qualifications without saying matric, just educational qualifications. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes okay so going back you say on the basis of this 
letter, you say that possession of matric was not a requirement of a 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 99 of 174 
 
position to which you were appointed in 1995?   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:        
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes, and then in regard to – if we go back to 408.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:       That will be in the other bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja the other bundle that is the application for 
employment, so the symbols which you wrote there appear to be very 
much more or less the same as the symbols that appear in the letter 
from the Department of Education that we looked at some minutes ago, 
maybe there might be one or two differences, you remember that letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:       That will e 416 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     416 okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:      Yes I remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the difference – or maybe I’m wrong, the first, 
you said the first three English, South Sotho and Afrikaans and 
[indistinct], you said there you got E, symbol E, in terms of that letter 
South Sotho, first language higher grade what was E, English second 
language standard grade was f, Afrikaans second language standard 
grade it was F, Biblical studies it was E and the History F, Biology H. 
you say when you wrote these symbols on the application form, you 
were not sure of the symbols that you had already received? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:       Yes Chair that will be 
supported by – if you check 1990 and then you check 1992, [indistinct] 
this is what I was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.     
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 100 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay alright but just to go back if you – as I 
understand it you have now accepted that writing 10 where the form 
required you to write the highest standard passed, that was not true but 
you say, it should be looked at in the context of the evidence you were 
given in regard to what advice you were given? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Chair the time 
now is 1 o’clock, may we take the lunch adjournment?     
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh yes let’s take the lunch adjournment we are 
10 
going to resume at 2 o’clock. 
REGISTRAR:     All rise. 
INQIURY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you going to move away from this Matric issue? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, Chair but there was just one 
reference we were going to make before which related to the question 
that you asked whether Matric was a requirement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Let’s do that.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s do that because I may have two or three 
questions to round off that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To that? Yes. Thank you, Chair. Mr 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 101 of 174 
 
Motsoeneng, could you please turn to page 214 of where your 
statement is, Exhibit 30; CC30? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the bundle that has got his statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  His statement. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 214. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That’s CC30, three zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bundle that has got your statement. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Page 214. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  214? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. It will be under divider number 11. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, I’m there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. This is an email dated, 
sent. It’s from Ms Mofokeng sent on the 31 s t of October 2014 to Ms 
Mosweu or Mr Mosweu, I beg your pardon and this is what she says, 
Dear Mr Mosweu, requested clarification letter by Ms 
HM Mofokeng dated 12 October 1999. Mr Motsoeneng was 
appointed as a trainee journalist with a condition that he will 
20 
complete his Matric certificate as agreed having written the 
outstanding course in October in 1996. He should have been in 
possession of the certificate during 1997. It is procedural that 
HR from time to time audit the personnel files to ensure that 
all required documents are correctly filed. Hence, my follow-up 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 102 of 174 
 
on Mr Tati’s letter to Mr Motsoeneng. The expectation by the 
employer was that Mr Motsoeneng would have written the 
outstanding subjects as per his discussion with Mr Tati and 
should have handed in the certificate which was a requirement 
for the job.  
What is your comment to that? She says that says that that was a 
requirement for the job and you were expected to complete your Matric. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  It was not a requirement that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  But I think when you read Mr Tati’s letter, 
10 
for me to be honest I think it was good to encourage someone to go and 
acquire a certificate but it was not requirements. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And then just on that score. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry. Where is the part in the letter that says, 
Matric was a requirement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which was a requirement for the job. 
That’s page, the last two last sentences Chair just before regards. The 
expectation, it starts with the expectation by employer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry. Is that 208? No, 214? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  214, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I’m sorry. I’m looking at a wrong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  214, okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it says which was a requirement for the job. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the paragraph before that makes it clear that 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 103 of 174 
 
when he was appointed, that is Mr Motsoeneng.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a trainee journalist, he was appointed as it says 
with a condition that he will complete his Matric certificate as agreed. 
Now, to say he would complete his Matric certificate is of course not an 
accurate; not accurate language. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must mean that he will complete his Matric. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  His Matric. That’s correct. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, which means if one looks at this letter, this email 
10 
it must mean that the author is acknowledging that when he was 
appointed, that is Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was an acceptance that he was yet to complete 
his Matric. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  His Matric. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, although he says or is it a she later on in the 
email, this was a requirement for the job. It may mean that it was a 
requirement for the job but it had been decided for whatever reasons 
that that should not be enforced immediately. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was encouraged to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To complete his Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To complete his Matric. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 104 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They may or may not have discussed within what 
time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within what time frame and what would happen if he 
failed to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He failed to fulfil that condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. And then maybe lastly… 
10 
(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would go along with that interpretation? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair and I can also allude to the 
issue that all these people who are writing these letters they were not 
there when I was employed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  So, at that time the conditions of 
employment no Matric as the letter alluded to the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you ever see the documents that would have 
specified what the requirements for that position were? Or are you 
simply saying possession of Matric was not a requirement simply 
because nobody said to you this is a requirement? And the way they 
handled the situation suggested to you that Matric was not a 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 105 of 174 
 
requirement?  
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chair, I think the Matric issue the way I 
see it in my view is because I have already told them that I don’t have 
Matric. So, maybe that letter that is the reason why they didn’t look for 
Matric. But in the history that I, in my history at the SABC even Alwyn 
Kloppers during my disciplinary hearing he alluded to the issue that he 
was not even sure whether Matric was a criterion to employ at the 
SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no but what I want you to, what I want to 
establish is whether when you say Matric was not a requirement for that 
10 
position you say so because you did have a look at the requirements, at 
the documents of SABC where the requirements for the position were 
laid down. And you know that they did not include Matric or whether you 
are simply saying it was not a requirement because one, they employed 
you knowing you did not have Matric. Two, that letter that we talked 
about earlier on. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chair, I can only deal with my issue 
because they employed me knowing that I don’t have Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  On other matters really, I can’t go far. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. So, in that event think the correct answer 
therefore is that you are not sure whether possession of Matric was a 
requirement for the position at the time. But what you do know is that 
you disclose to them that you did not have Matric and nevertheless that 
did not present an obstacle to them appointing you. That’s all you can 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 106 of 174 
 
say. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. And in his opening 
address, Mr Motsoeneng had mentioned the fact of him having, of his 
probation having been confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair, would recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And may I just refer Chair to page 212? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 212 of the same bundle.  
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  212. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  I have lost the page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, you mentioned early… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it, Mr Motsoeneng? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got the page? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Not yet but I know very well about the 
20 
letter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  I’m comfortable. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, it says written on the 25 t h of October 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 107 of 174 
 
1995 addressed to you Mr Motsoeneng. It says, 
Dear Mr Motsoeneng, as you have successfully 
completed your probationary period, I have pleasure in 
confirming your appointment to the permanent staff. We wish 
you every successful in future. 
Is this the confirmation that you were referring to? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. Mr Motsoeneng, just to 
close this issue. Would you agree with me that were it not for the form 
itself that had the symbols and that indicated that you had passed 
10 
Standard 10, no one would say there was any misrepresentation? 
Because according to the letters that we’ve addressed, Mr Tati and 
everybody else appreciate that you had to complete a certain or one of 
the subjects at least. So, were it not for the form and the way it was 
completed that we find at page 408 of Exhibit CC32, no one would be 
raising the issue of misrepresentation? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, I think as the Chair did alluded early 
when you check the background of my employment. But if someone just 
check and have his own and interpret it differently. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and in fairness to the Public 
20 
Protector you might find that that was her focus as well. That form was 
her focus. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  I explain several times. To be honest 
Chair, I don’t know why the Public Protector came to such conclusion. 
Remember also, she ignored the main employer. The affidavit of Alwyn 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 108 of 174 
 
Kloppers, the affidavit of Pupula Muthibi she ignored everything. So, for 
me in the issue is really getting the truth she was supposed to even 
call them, Chair. To say, can you come and clarify these issues 
because I’m confused here. So, for me I don’t know what informed the 
Public Protector but I can say here, Chair I have never agreed with the 
Public Protector that I lied on my Matric issue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are done? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Let’s go to, would you please just repeat the 
10 
conversation that transpired between you and Ms Swanepoel as best as 
you can in terms of your recollection on the occasion when you were 
signing, you were completing this employment form which is at page 
408 in the bundle that has got your statement. Just tell me how the 
conversation happened. Is she the one that gave you the form? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She’s the one who gave you the form? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Are you there already the form or you are able 
to, you don’t need to see it? You can answer questions. 
20 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Ah Chairman I’m very good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, I know the story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, she gave you the form and then did you complete 
it in front of her or did you go away to complete it and brought it back? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 109 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  She gave me the form, Chair. We 
discussed the issue of writing Standard 10 in that form between me and 
her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, how did that come about? I just want if you are 
able to. I know it’s a long time ago. If you are able to remember say, 
after she had given me the form, I realized that I was supposed to write 
this and this and this is what I said and this is what she said. I just 
want to understand that conversation. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chair, she was told that I don’t have 
Matric. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now before she gave you the form, she knew 
that? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  She knew that because when the late 
Olifire went to QwaQwa to engage me on the matter, Alwyn has already 
told Olifire. Olifire told other members of the SABC. So, when I went 
there, she knew already that I don’t have the Matric certificate and in 
any case Chair, she was just a clerk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but your knowledge that she knew that you did 
20 
not have Matric, is that based on the fact that that’s what she told you 
in the conversation? Is that based on the fact that you knew that she 
was present when somebody told staff or told a certain group of people 
that you didn’t have Matric? How do you know that?  
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  No, Chair I know that because she is the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 110 of 174 
 
one who called me to say, come and fill these forms. I was told that you 
were appointed and you don’t have a Matric. That’s why Chairman in 
that the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that’s what she said, ja. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  We discussed the issue of Matric. And 
then I said to her, no someone just told me that. Why can’t you go to 
Pretoria to check if you combine your symbols you can’t get a pass? 
Those were discussion between me and her. She said, no Hlaudi if that 
is the case it’s fine. You can write what you remember and then maybe 
when you come back you will come and tell us what. And then I went 
10 
Chairperson with an employee of the SABC to Pretoria to check. When I 
arrived there, they told us, no even if we combined the symbols you are 
not getting a pass. So, I went back. I said, no I didn’t get a pass. That’s 
why she wrote outstanding Matric because I came back and report 
back. Yes, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, so did you specifically discuss with her? Did the 
two of you specifically discuss what you should write on the block 
where it says, highest Standard passed? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  She advised me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the advice? 
20 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  The advice, fill this form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  When you come back, we will deal with 
the form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 111 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Which I came back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  When I came back that’s why she wrote 
that outstanding, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So, when you went to Pretoria you had already 
filled the form and completed that part? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG: Yes, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Now you have just said, she said fill this form. 
Did she say, put 10 where it says highest Standard passed? Did she 
say that? 
10 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and what did you say in response? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  In my response Chair I said, no but I 
didn’t pass Standard 10. And then she said, but you are going to 
Pretoria. We will sort out the form when you come back. So, even when 
I came back, I explained to her as to say, you see I didn’t go well. So, 
she said, no it’s fine. That outstanding, Chair that she wrote confirms 
what I’m saying. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, did I understand correctly that at the time you 
may have been 23 years old? 
20 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: But if you don’t want to disclose your age Mr 
Motsoeneng. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  No, no it’s not a problem Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 112 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  It’s true, Chair. I was 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were about 23? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now of course, when you are 23 you are young but 
you are not 10 years old, you’re not 15 years old. Okay now, why did 
you not say to her but I’m not prepared to write something that is false 
here? I haven’t passed Standard 10. It would be wrong. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, the issue is why I didn’t say 
that is because we agree. Her letter said combine the symbols. So, 
which means when I come back report to her to say, I don’t have that 
10 
Matric certificate. She wrote outstanding. In my personal view, 
outstanding is I don’t have Matric. I didn’t make an issue, Chair to be 
honest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, I did and make an issue about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you know I think you are right in saying 
outstanding Matric certificate you know may be said to mean Matric is 
outstanding or the certificate is not there because you haven’t passed 
Matric. You know that’s possible. I think based on that certainly after 
she 
written 
that 
there 
must 
have 
been 
certainly 
a 
common 
20 
understanding between the two of you that definitely you did not have 
Matric. I’m just concerned that before that happened here is a clear 
block where the question is, write down your highest Standard passed 
and you know that you have not passed Standard 10 and you have told 
her that you have not passed Standard 10. One, on what you have told 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 113 of 174 
 
me she says, write that you have, write Standard 10 and yet she knows 
that that would not be true. You understand what I’m looking at? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, and understand you clearly 
so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  And that issue Chairperson as I said even 
during the Public Protector, I was not supposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  To take that advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. It was a wrong advice. 
10 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  It was a wrong advice Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  That when I have admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  What I said I don’t admit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Is I lied for me to be employed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  By the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes because all those who made decisions about 
20 
your appointment knew that you did not have Matric. You are disclosing 
that part you have indicated. So, what we have on your version is 
simply that you wrote something false on the employment, on the 
application for employment form and you must just tell me if I 
misunderstand here. My understanding is that you knew when you wrote 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 114 of 174 
 
it that it was not true but you were given advice. That’s the point you 
make by Mr Swanepoel, Ms Swanepoel that write this false information. 
Effectively she didn’t put it that way but the both of you knew that you 
had not passed Standard 10. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, the Standard 10 it was well-
known as I have alluded previously. Even when I went to her it was 
well-known. The only issue that in my mind after someone told me if 
maybe you combined your symbol you will get a pass. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  That is the only reason why. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  I wrote those symbols. Even though 
symbols Chair normally you will do seven subjects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  So, I was not even remembering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  How many subjects. I just wrote those 
subjects but I knew I failed History. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  That when I was sure. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  That is why I wrote that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  These others I was not really if I 
combined maybe I did very well. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 115 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chairman that is the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time, was there a process where somebody 
who had been writing supplementary examinations because I think you 
said you had been writing supplementary examinations. Was there a 
process within the Department of Education in terms of which 
somebody in that position could go to the department and say to them, 
look what I have, look at the symbols I have achieved? Have I not now 
passed to be eligible to be given a Matric certificate? Was there a 
process like that that you knew about? Where did this idea come from 
10 
that if you combine the symbols you could get a certificate? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  I was told by my lady principal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, to say no what you need to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  You can come to school. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  And then we can work that process and 
check with the Department of Education. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  But at that time because I was also 
coming to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  It was easier for me. I’m coming to 
Johannesburg and then I took my colleagues and then we went and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 116 of 174 
 
check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  And then they confirmed that I did not 
pass Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay thank you. Do you, is Ms Swanepoel still 
available? Is she going to be called to talk about the advice? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair, the investigators are looking into 
that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, they must try and see if they can find her. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, that she can testify about the advice that she may 
have given Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but except that something that comes 
close to that is that letter that you read where she says, I said you just 
put it in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But the advice aspect doesn’t come out 
clearly in the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you very much Mr Motsoeneng. Yes, 
you may continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Chairman. Chair, just 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 117 of 174 
 
for completeness sake maybe just where the Public Protector deals with 
this issue Chair, is in bundle CC27 at pages 295 up to, I think it ends at 
page 298 yes. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Do you want to ask Mr Motsoeneng to get it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Motsoeneng, next to you on your left-
hand side. Have you? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Sorry, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Do you mind if I just because I know all 
this? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No, no if you are comfortable that’s fine. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  No, Chairman. Yes, I know everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no if you are comfortable. Ja, but if it any 
stage you think you want to look at a document just say so. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let me get to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it page 295? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  296, Chair. In fact, it starts from 295 but 
the actual point that you are dealing with, with Mr Motsoeneng now is 
at page 296. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Are you there, Chair? Have 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 118 of 174 
 
you found it? Oh, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I found the page, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. Mr Motsoeneng, just for us 
to complete this issue and understand exactly what is it that the Public 
Protector actually said. If I may read from paragraph 6.1.3.22 at page 
296. In the preceding paragraph she had listed the symbols as they are 
reflected at page 408. And then she says, 
On 
the 
application 
form 
that 
Mr 
Motsoeneng 
completed, he only noted five subjects completed and not the 
usual six. During the interview, Mr Motsoeneng admitted 
10 
falsifying his Matric qualification and blamed a Ms Swanepoel 
whom he said gave him the application form to fill in anything. 
In other words, to make up the symbols from the top of his 
head which he did. With regard to the Matric certificate the 
form says outstanding giving the impression that the certificate 
exists and would be submitted in due course. A copy of a 
transcript of the interview held with Mr Motsoeneng on 19 July 
2013 with me is annex to the report. Below is an extract from 
the transcript. 
Advocate Madonsela:  But you knew. You are saying 
20 
to me you knew then that you had failed. So, you because 
when you put the symbols you knew that you hadn’t found or 
never seen them anywhere you were making them up. So, I’m 
asking that in retrospect. Do you think you should have made 
up the symbols? Now that you are older and you are not 23. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 119 of 174 
 
Mr Motsoeneng:  From me, for now because I do 
understand all the issues. I was not supposed to be honest. If I 
was, now I was clear in my mind. Like now I know what is 
wrong, what is right. I was not supposed to put it but there 
they said, no put it. But what is important for me Public 
Protector is everybody knew and even when I put there I said 
to the lady, I’m not sure about my symbols. And why I was not 
sure Public Protector is because I go SAP you know. I 
remember okay in English I think it was E because it was you 
know after it was 1995. If you check there, we are talking 
10 
about 1991. Now it was 1995 and for me I had to even go. I 
was supposed to go to school to check. Someone said, no, no, 
no. You know what you need to do, just go to Pretoria. At that 
time Public Protector taxi go and check. Then said, no you fail. 
I went that one and people we are putting this Public 
Protector. I know it is Siphumelele and Charlotte and these 
people when SABC were charging me they were my witnesses.   
Mr Madiba:  I think I want to understand you 
correctly. You say you were asked by the SABC to put in those 
forms, I mean to put in those and Advocate Madonsela to make 
20 
up the symbols? Mr Madiba to make of the symbols. You recall 
who said that to you and your answer was Marie Swanepoel. 
And Mr Madiba, Marie Swanepoel and the answer is, yes. 
So, this is the portion of the evidence of the Public Protector that you 
say you challenge as not being correct; the finding. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 120 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes. Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Can I? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you want to add something? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Through you, Chair I think this goes back 
to what I was saying when it comes to this issue of Public Protector. I 
said I didn’t lie about Matric but when she was saying looking back 23 
years because people were talking about all these issues Chairperson 
10 
about, he has lied about Matric and so on. I said but looking back 
checking I was not supposed to take this advice from Marie Swanepoel 
which I still believe I was not supposed to take that advice but I was 
not admitting that I lied to be employed at the SABC. In any case, I’m 
the one who confessed to the SABC to my employer that I don’t have a 
Matric. And also, the issue is why the Public Protector didn’t go and 
call those people who employed me or including Chair Marie 
Swanepoel. Although, Marie Swanepoel was not my employer. When I 
went there, I was already employed by the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see I think because that form says 
20 
application for employment the form which we are talking about it gives 
the impression that that is when you were applying for employment but 
you are saying when you filled the form you had already been 
appointed as I understand.  Is that correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  I did not even apply. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 121 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was headhunted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They catch the fish that they 
were looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So - so these forms that application for 
employment and then somebody says okay this person applying for 
employment is being asked what is your highest standard that you have 
passed and this person says Standard 10, but we know in this room 
that you have made it clear that that was not the true position. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see.  So it seems to me that whatever point you 
want to make insofar as the filling in of that form in regard to saying 
Standard 10 it seems to me that whatever you maybe wanting to say 
would be directed at saying that you - you accept that what you wrote 
down when you said Standard 10 was false but you are simply saying 
there is an explanation how and why you came to write information that 
was false and the explanation is the discussion you had with 
Ms Swanepoel and the advice that you say she gave you and the - the 
advice amounted to saying even though you - we know that you do not 
20 
have - you have not passed Standard 10 write down Standard 10 and 
there was an understanding as I understand your evidence that you 
were going to go to Pretoria and see whether as you put it if they 
combine all the symbols that you had obtained when you were writing 
supplementary examinations that would not give you a pass for Matric. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 122 of 174 
 
That - that seems to me the upshot of what you are saying.  It 
does not seem to me that you can deny that writing Matric on the form 
was false but what you - what you are saying is do not ignore the 
context in which that happened.  Do not ignore the fact that I was given 
advice and do not ignore the fact that everyone knew I did not have 
Matric and do not ignore the fact that I was going to go to Pretoria to 
see whether when they combine all my symbols the result would not be 
that I have passed.  That is my understanding.  Is - is that correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  
Thank you.  Mr Motsoeneng maybe let us go back to your statement 
now.  In fact let us go - we are still dealing with your career 
progression and then - then we decided to deal with this issue.  You 
were at a point when you were telling the Chairperson that then you 
were then employed as - as a - as a journalist.  Am I correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  From there then could - could you 
then continue from - from where you left off? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I was a trainee 
20 
journalist when I was employed at the SABC and I grew within the 
SABC.  I became a - a journalist.  I became a producer.  I became an 
Executive Producer.  I became a Specialist Producer.  I became - I was 
also at a certain point Acting as Regional Editor Free State and 
Northern Cape. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 123 of 174 
 
I was appointed to be General Manager in the Office of the 
GCO.  I was appointed to be Group Executive for Stakeholder and 
Provinces outside now the GCO.  I also dealt with the issue of the 
communication of the - of the board and that is where I moved to 
become the Acting COO of the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think that is my profile. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In short. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In short, yes and then - and then one bit 
10 
was when then after Acting as COO then you became the COO. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  I … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry, sorry Chair.  I became 
the COO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could - could you just tell the Chair 
how - how was that process handled?  You had been acting.  
Dr Ngubane who testified yesterday had - we had taken Dr Ngubane 
20 
through letter - a letter from the Minister when - when you were 
appointed to act as - as COO.  You would recall that Minister Dina Pule 
approved that - that acting appointment.  Then from then - (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then from then Dr Ngubane testified that 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 124 of 174 
 
he then left the SABC and you were appointed after he had left the 
SABC.  Could you just take - I know the - the issue of your appointment 
has - has been - has been subjected to litigation and there are 
judgments that relate to that but can you just in your own words briefly 
tell the Chairperson the process that was followed before you were 
appointed the COO of the SABC. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair I do not think I can deal 
with that one because it is the board issue who took that decision.  I 
may say that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I did raise the issue about me 
raising more than - you know acting more than two years … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  As COO. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And not me alone also.  As the 
Acting COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Not me alone.  I - I was saying 
but if I am this fish that you want I mean why can you not - you move 
on.  I mean I cannot act for more than two years because I do not know 
whether I am going backwards or I am … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am going forward … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And - and I also wrote a letter 
Chairperson. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 125 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I must declare that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I wrote a letter to I think to the 
Chairperson of the board to say here is my situation.  I am unhappy 
about this situation.  I cannot act forever … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But the appointment and the 
process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was not party, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Of course what you would be able to do is to 
ask - to answer specific questions in regard to that process where you 
do have knowledge of what happened but you are right to say in fact 
you did not appoint yourself.  Those who appointed you are the ones 
who can answer certain questions but there would be certain things that 
you know about.  How you came to be appointed … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe Ms Norman can specific questions to you 
… 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what you know you would say.  What you do not 
know you would say you do not know. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  You would have applied for 
that position.  Am I correct? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 126 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I did not apply Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes and this is - we go back to my 
first question.  So if you did not apply was it simply offered to you - 
that position?  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe we should because - I am sorry Ms Norman 
… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he did say he wrote a letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wrote - you said you wrote a letter I assume to 
10 
the board.  Is that correct?  Where you were complaining that you were 
effectively complaining or expressing concern that you had been acting 
for a long time.  There is uncertainty.  You do not know whether you are 
coming or going.  Is that right? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the board - was the - a letter addressed to the 
Chairperson of the Board or you do not remember? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Let me say Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To the Chair but the Chair 
20 
represents the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, it was addressed … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  (Intervenes) yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you meant for the board? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 127 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not for him alone. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they respond to the letter either in writing or 
verbally and if they did what was their response? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No Chair.  What I know there 
were some discussions because those are minutes of the SABC where I 
was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were discussions within the board? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Within the - within the board 
and then they discussed the matter and I think they voted amongst 
10 
themselves.  There is some of them disagreed with the process and so 
on and so on Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did - did you - were - were you present when those- 
when your - when those discussions took place in the - in the board 
meetings or were you asked to recuse yourself or anything like that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was not present Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not present each time they discussed? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but you - you knew that in that meeting they will 
be having a discussion that concerns the - that concerned you or the 
20 
feeling of the position? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No the - the Chair did not 
explain to me that she is going to raise the issue.  They are going to 
discuss the matter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he did not say that to you? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 128 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  (Intervenes) yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So these - these discussions at a certain stage the 
Chairperson must have come back to you after those discussions and - 
and told you something or did he come back to you and say I did 
receive your letter and since then we have had some discussions in the 
board and this is what we propose to do? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  I think - I think 
through HR if I - I do not remember well who … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, but what I know that I - I 
10 
received a letter from - from HR but the letter was signed by the 
Chairperson of - of the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But you know SABC is SABC 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Everything already all over … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In the board meeting this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  This is what happened.  How 
many people voted?  It - it was - I mean it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you - you mean before you received the letter 
you - you knew what had happened? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  People were - were already 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 129 of 174 
 
talking about that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and the talk was - was the talk that you had 
been appointed by the board? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I think so Chairperson.  The 
talk was that there were divisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there were divisions within the board? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes amongst the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About - about your - your appointment? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then you received a letter.  You said that 
was signed by the Chairperson of the Board then.  Who was the 
Chairperson of the board at the time … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Dr Ngubane said he had left already by 
then? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hm, hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it professor …? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was it? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Maybe Chair let me - the letter 
- I received a letter from the - the HR because normally the - HR is the 
custodian … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 130 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Of the process of the SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I - I want to withdraw the 
Chairperson signing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you are not sure about (intervenes)? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  I expect that one whether 
it was the - whether it was HR or who signed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was a letter that you received that was on the 
10 
HR letterhead or something? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, it - SABC letterhead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SABC letterhead but Human Resources Department? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  They - normally after the 
appointment they will call you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You will engage with HR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the letter that you got? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was the letter saying the board has decided to 
appoint you as COO of - Group COO of the SABC in effect? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I - I will have to 
check. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 131 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I do not want to talk 
about issues and then I am not sure about the content of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But yes I received the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But obviously you - you remember the gist of what 
this letter said?  I would imagine. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you cannot remember what the gist was of the 
message it was given you? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson when you hear that 
you are COO of the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was really excited.  These 
other matters they did not (laughing).  What - what I know Chairperson 
is the process will be the board they will need the approval from the 
shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That process I knew that it went 
- it went through because they could not appoint me without the 
approval of the shareholder. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 132 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am trying to - to understand is to 
distinguish is what you heard in the grapevine as it were as to what the 
board had decided and that there were divisions and so on and what 
was written in black and white.  So I am trying to - I - I understand that 
you did hear from the grapevine that the board had appointed you and 
that there were divisions within the board about the issue but I am 
trying to establish whether the letter that you are talking about is the 
official letter that conveyed to you the decision of the board to appoint 
you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the one? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but you say once you had this what happened? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was thinking of transforming 
South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Especially the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
That 
it 
should 
change 
especially Chair I - I think everybody knows my impression is content. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so this letter told you about the decision of 
the board to appoint you as COO of SABC but your understanding was 
or the letter did say that this was subject to the concurrence or 
approval of the shareholder? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No Chair.  When I received the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 133 of 174 
 
letter at that time I think the Minister has already approved the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The whole issue was finalised? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes was finalised … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because when I received the 
letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Now we were engaging with HR 
10 
just to finalise … 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You - you know the package of 
the position and so on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And so on yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you did not apply for appointment to this 
position of COO as such but what you did was to complain about how 
long you had been acting in the position.  Is that correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and nobody ever asked you to a - to apply for the 
position - to fill in forms or anything like that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No - no Chair because they did 
not advertise the post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not advertise the post? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 134 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Do you want to take it from there 
Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you very much Chair.  We had -

problem he will tell you. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 135 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do not ask him to look for … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To - to look for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pages and documents, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  This is reference 
bundle.  It is EXHIBIT CC32 at page 2-1-6.  This is an advert for the 
position of Chief Operations Officer.  We - we referred to this advert 
yesterday when we were dealing with the evidence of Dr Ngubane and 
the closing date for applications was 15 February 2013.  Were you 
aware at this point that there was an advert for this position of the 
10 
Coo? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair through you - you know 
that position of COO it has been going up and down because of the - 
the previous person who was supposed to occupy the positions 
advertising and then - not advertising because he went to court.  So 
there were - there - there were many issues there really.  I think at a 
certain stage SABC said we are going to advertise. 
We withdraw - withdrawn the application - the advert - the 
advert because of the court matters.  I - I saw the - the advert but 
really I cannot attest because there were - I think there were more than 
20 
three adverts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At different stages? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  At different stages and I am not 
sure which one at that time when I Acting COO … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 136 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That went - went through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What can help of course is for you to confirm the date 
with effect from which your appointment started … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am sure you cannot forget that date. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Not at all Chairperson.  The 
acting one Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no the permanent one as COO.  That is the one 
we are talking about. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you remember the acting one? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
That 
- 
the 
acting 
one 
Chairperson I - I remember very well.  This (indistinct) has been caught 
in the (indistinct).  Sometimes I want to just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I think it was around 
July 2014 Chairperson. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The permanent appointment? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The acting one would have been in 2012/2013? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  2011 in November …

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to the above terms and conditions, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Then 
maybe before we deal with your era as the COO of the SABC because 
we are going to have to relate to certain minutes there.  Maybe we 
should just go back to the statement so that we can continue from there 
before we deal with that era because it is going to relate to some of the 
people that have implicated you as you are aware where we had written 
or issue - where the Commission had issued 3.3 Notices to you.  Are 
10 
you happy if you do that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  (Intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Can you just go back to page 
5 of your statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
- 
you 
not 
pursuing 
anything 
on 
that 
advertisement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no Chair because there is - there is a 
lot that we need to deal with.  There is a lot of litigation that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Relates to that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair but I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 140 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just thinking because it will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Once we start with it then we must go 
back to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Notices as well.  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.

REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s proceed. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 141 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair thank you, at page Mr Motsoeneng 
of your affidavit you deal with the support structure of the SABC, I take 
it that this is the support structure at the time when you were now the 
COO, am I correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and you deal with what the 
operations team was dealing with in paragraph 14.3, could you just tell 
the Chairperson what were you dealing with there? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Here Chair I am referring to all 
the divisions that reports to me, which I have already mentioned, which 
10 
divisions there were reporting me.  The key divisions there would be 
your television/radio and media technology and commercial space, 
those I am just mentioning a few Chair so that I don’t put everything, 
but also I mean if you look Chairperson you also have your office 
manager the role of office manager is a very, very critical one, she is 
not above the Group Executive but the – everything that comes to me it 
goes to the office manager, to check the process, to check everything 
whether – the same group executive they have followed process that 
they are supposed to follow, it is a very critical position Chairperson.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes and at page 43, if you could just turn 
20 
to page 43, you make reference to that annexure which is the 
organisational structure of the SABC, page 43. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes I am there.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Is that the picture of the organogram?   It 
will be under divider number one? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 142 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh you have it, oh I beg your pardon, 
okay, thank you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes I have it.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then where would the office manager 
fit in there on that organogram? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     The office manager sits in my 
office, you have divisions that reports to me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:       Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Also she will be in this office where you 
are if one were to draw a line within on that organogram, so one would 
have to put the office manager next to the COO’s office, the position? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is part of your staff? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     She is part Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay.   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    She is the most family person 
in the organisation because every time in the morning we meet each 
20 
and every day.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She would be the most, would she be the most senior 
staff member within your staff, within your staff in your office of COO?     
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 143 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair, thank you Chair.  And then this 
structure is it the structure as it was at the time when you were COO, is 
– it has always been the structure that everybody including news would 
report to the COO or was it the organogram that you’ve put up at the 
point when you were the COO? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    All the broadcasting divisions 
they have been reporting to me, the only division that we put together it 
was the technology and the commercial one.  The reason being Chair a 
broadcaster you need A to know what B is doing, so you need a team.  
10 
In the past the divisions they were independent from their units, so we 
put a strategy that let us put this team together so that when you go 
and – sales division you go and sell content, you know what you are 
selling, you are part of that team, you sit in those meetings, you take 
decisions together, so but in the past everybody was doing operating in 
silos, that is the reason why we put that structure together and that 
structure Chairperson did very well to generate more revenue and also 
put stability within the organisation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And in paragraph 17 you state that you 
couldn’t allow the Board to appoint senior management, and could you 
20 
just – or at least to appoint the people that were reporting to you 
suggesting that you had to appoint your own staff, is that what you are 
trying to convey in that paragraph? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair, in the past the 
SABC Board they were appointing Group Executive because you have 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 144 of 174 
 
directors, your GCO, your COO and the CFO, they were appointing 
these people for three directors.  My view was if these people are going 
to report to me I am accountable, why should be appointed by the 
Board when in any case the Board appoints us and that Chairperson it 
was causing havoc in the organisation because people that report to 
you they will tell you no, the Board is responsible, you are not 
responsible so it was causing more tension, operational tension within 
the team, but in a normal organisation the three directors they should 
be able to appoint but not only them also, even senior managers they 
should appoint people within their delegation of authority.   
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, I’m sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say before this change happened that you are 
talking about the Board used to appoint Group Executives is that right? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those who fell under the category of Group 
Executives were the GCEO, the COO, the CFO and who else? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:       Can you repeat the question 
Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question who fell under that category of Group 
Executives? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who were appointed by the Board at some stage 
before this change happened? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160

MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Okay Chair, it would be all 
your Group Executives, your Group Executive of Television, Radio, 
Technology all of them those divisions.  There are about eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there would be about eleven? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes they form Exco, together 
we form Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but if one has regard to the organogram that 
you have put up or that has been put up at page 43 that we are looking 
at, before the change that you are talking about who would they be 
reporting to, would they be reporting to those people to – would some 
10 
of them be reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, others to the COO, 
others to the Group Chief Executive Officer, or would they all be 
reporting to only one of these people?    
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:      No Chair, you are correct, 
they will report, the broadcasters will report to the COO, the financial 
team including your procurement they will report to the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Your legal, HR and other 
divisions they will report to the GCEO but the two directors, COO and 
CFO, will report to the GCEO. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, okay, so the change that you wanted was 
that even if people fell within the category of Group Executives, if they 
were not COO and they were not CFO and they were not GCEO they 
should be appointed by the relevant Corporate Executive among these 
three, so some would be appointed in terms of your proposal, would be 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 146 of 174 
 
appointed by the COO, the broadcasters, those that fall under that and 
those that fall under the Chief Financial Officer in terms of your 
proposal would have to be appointed by either the Chief Financial 
Officer or somebody lower than that within that stream and then there 
would be some that may be appointed by the GCEO.   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    The Exco Chair which is the 
Group Executive, eleven of them, if they were supposed to be 
appointed the three directors including the HR they will sit down, go 
through all the interviews and appoint.  For instance when I was the 
COO I appointed eight women, same time Chairperson, because at the 
10 
SABC at the top we did not have women in those positions Chairperson, 
so that will – but it is not me, it is me and the panel the three directors 
we appointed those although I championed women to be appointed at 
the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  And then by making 
those appointments I take it that there would have been advertisements 
and people would respond, there would be interviews and then those 
women would then be appointed.   Did you follow that process or did 
you introduce a new process? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     We followed the process of 
advertising the post Chair.  Although I was having a different view 
Chairperson and I will tell you why I was having a different view, but 
not just to appoint people, now I was saying why do we want – when 
you know that you want women why do you want men to come in, the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 147 of 174 
 
HR said to me no, it’s discrimination, but I said you know the equity is 
there that you must have, they said no but it is fine, allow them to go 
for interviews, but unfortunately even in those interviews we appoint all 
these women chairperson, which I am very proud of. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  Thank you.  And then in paragraph 
Mr Motsoeneng you make the point about the broadcaster not being a 
political party, I am just trying to understand why you needed to make 
that point at this stage of your affidavit, and could you just take the 
Chair through the reasons why you felt that at this point of your 
evidence in your affidavit you should raise that point? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Chairperson I think everybody 
knows that SABC it is a public broadcaster, everyone is having interest 
in the SABC, so the reason why even when people were appointed as 
Group Executive for me they were appointed some of them politically 
so, that is why Chairperson during my time I argued forcefully to say 
why can’t we employ people within SABC because SABC already was 
bloated and if the SABC is bloated why can’t you advertise and appoint 
within the organisation.   
 
The reason why there is no stability at the SABC is because of 
politics Chairperson, and I raised issues even the Board, the 
20 
appointment of the Board to say in my view Chairperson, I know some 
people they  hammer me on this, but that is what I stand for, I even 
said the SABC should not be appointed by Parliament, and I said it 
should be chaired by a retired Judge, because of the politics that I 
have been through within the organisation and I serve under three 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 148 of 174 
 
Boards Chairperson, so I have seen that there is a problem when it 
comes to politics. 
 
Example Krish Naidoo, who was a Board member, we 
discussed these issues of politics and then including my former GCO, 
the one that I still respect even today, Me Lulama, I was having a 
problem where they would report ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, you mentioned the name, what was the 
name?  You mentioned the name of this GCEO that you said 
...(intervention)  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     My former GCEO Me Lulama. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay Ms Mokhobo. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:       Yes Chairperson.  Where a 
politician will call the directors of the SABC to attend workshops of a 
political party, so I was fighting for that, I said no I don’t agree that we 
as SABC, and Chairperson I can tell you I come from the ANC, but I 
cannot allow to be controlled by a political party when I am supposed to 
serve the public.  This is what I said in those minutes of the Board, 
where I was warning Krish Naidoo because he was saying no I am – we 
are deployed here as political – coming from different political parties, I 
said no but that is wrong because immediately when you occupy this 
20 
position you leave that head, now you focus on the SABC, and Chair 
what happened there is Krish Naidoo to be honest me and him I know 
that my GCEO was saying no we lock horns, but I do not have horns I 
think he was just teasing, we worked very close together and I still 
respect her even today Chairperson, but ...(intervention)  
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 149 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ms Makhobo, she was the CEO. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair.  So Krish Naidoo 
was working in Ntuli House and I was always having a problem because 
Krish Naidoo is the one who said to ANC as long as Hlaudi is there you 
are not going to make it and I was fighting with Chris because Chris 
was interfering Chairperson, in the operations of the SABC, where he is 
not supposed to operate.  I raised those issues in the Board, in the 
minutes you realise those issue are there.  I said Krish I disagree with 
you and many Board members who had been influenced by politics 
Chairperson.  That was the issue to be honest I don’t believe that 
10 
political parties should get involved in the running of the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he fulltime at Luthuli House, Mr Krish Naidoo, to 
your understanding was he employed fulltime there or what was the 
position? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson I can’t say really 
sure but every day he was in Luthuli House, most of the time, not every 
day, most of the time he will say no, no, no, we are having a meeting in 
Luthuli House, I am coming, we are having a case in the Free State, he 
is in Northwest, I am going to work,  so for me I think he was – but 
under correction Chairperson, I don’t want to put ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes you are not sure. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    But I think he was working for 
ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now you made a statement which you attributed 
to him a few minutes ago namely that he said something along the lines 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 150 of 174 
 
that we are deployed by the ANC, did I understand you correct, is that 
what he said?    
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes Chair in these minutes 
we have those minutes, yes you’re correct so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay thank you.  So you say except for your 
disagreement on this issue the two of you worked quite well? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     With Krish Naidoo? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:      Haai Chairman no, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I thought that’s what you were saying. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    No I was saying the former 
GCEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Not with Krish Naidoo Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay not with Mr Naidoo. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson hey the story 
there is it’s tough but we will not talk about it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   No, it didn’t go well together. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now that you 
20 
mentioned Ms Makhobo maybe I should put this question to you.  I don’t 
know whether you did watch her evidence when she testified but she 
did mention something that – after the appointment you took her to the 
Gupta Family where she was congratulated by some of the Gupta 
brothers.  Could you just deal with that? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 151 of 174 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair we enjoyed curry 
there, big time Chairperson, together with Me Lulama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she said it was something like within a week after 
her appointment? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   No Chairperson as – I was 
acting as the GCO ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before she was appointed? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes, I was acting as a GCO, it 
was part of handover. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   And it was partly because I 
said to her look compliance they inform me that there is this 
relationship between TNA and the SABC but we as SABC are not 
complying because there is no MOU on this matter.  These are the 
people that we are working with them, but these people they talk to me 
to say we will be happy if we can meet your new GCO, what she is 
saying I went to her a day before that morning that she is referring that 
I just came and said let’s go to the Guptas, now we discussed 
Chairperson.   Yes, in the morning I went into her office and then when 
20 
I arrived I said hey GCO you know what I have some stuff that I want to 
deal with at ten so but if we can see these people if you are okay, but 
we have already discussed a day before, we went there Chairperson, 
she was very happy, I was very happy, including myself, what happened 
there it was breakfast Chairperson, we went and then we eat breakfast 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 152 of 174 
 
and they proposed Chairperson like any business people, you know 
even Chairperson when I go in the street people propose, they give you 
a proposal, they said because you are going to migrate we wish that we 
can have channels in that bouquet of the SABC, which it is normal, 
everyone does that, there was nothing wrong about those issues.    
 
But the concern Chairperson is I don’t know when you talk 
about Guptas there’s this people they don’t want to hear anything, they 
run away, they want to go under the tables, I don’t know what is the 
problem, but reality is we have met Guptas, we have engaged them 
Chairperson and I was to allude to this Chairperson because 
10 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you ate the curry. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I enjoyed it Chairperson, yes.   
And I want to allude to this Chairperson, you are dealing with State 
Capture Chairperson, in my view I was capturing private sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that?  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that sentence. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   You know sometimes you want 
to speak your own language.  I am saying Chairperson now I was trying 
20 
to capture private sector and I want to demonstrate to you, that is only 
where I know that I differ with my former GCEO, Me Lulama, because in 
a meeting of Eskom I said to her, not to her, Eskom, as we were 
discussing issues, I said but these people we have a partnership with 
them, and they have jet, they have all these things, nice stuff, flying, 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 153 of 174 
 
why can’t we – because we – already we were in this partnership, why 
can’t we use them Chairperson it was a big no from Me Lulama, maybe 
she was referring to that, that is the only issue that we really and I was 
very, because for the first time she differed with me on that issue, but 
not – we were still working, laughing, but she said Hlaudi, the Guptas, I 
said what’s wrong, everybody now is talking about the Guptas, we 
can’t.   But I said no already we are in, we are partner, why can’t we 
use their jet, because Chairperson we fly to all these Provinces, we fly 
to Cape Town, for me it was an opportunity, for me also to capture 
them. 
10 
 
So and that Chairperson it will go the same with – maybe 
because I’m talking about this issue, it will go to MultiChoice, you see 
even MultiChoice Chairperson they didn’t approach us at the SABC, for 
that channel or those two channels, I approached them, but the first 
person who approached Multichoice it was our former GCEO, Me 
Magubo and Dr Ngubane, they went and approached them because 
there was a pressure to say but you SABC why are you not competing 
in this space of news. 
CHAIRPERSON:  24 Hour news service ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes chair, when you have your 
20 
ETV competing in that space there was pressure even from the 
Portfolio Committee but even citizens generally to say why you don’t 
have a channel like ETV because they’ve got a channel there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A 24 hour news channel? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   A 24 hour news channel 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 154 of 174 
 
Chairperson.   So and then what happened is they went and talked and 
engaged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now Dr Ngubane, the chairperson of the Board 
and Ms Mokhobo the then GCEO. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes, they went and approached 
them, they came back to the Board, the Board was not happy about 
their process and so on but we resolved those issues, but it could not 
kick off because of the financials, because their Multichoice they were 
saying they are going to fund SABC for R50million for five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Motsoeneng, I know that Ms Norman will 
10 
be dealing with that at some stage. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I don’t know whether you might not go that far, so 
that we keep to the point, I think you were the question, you were 
dealing with the question of you and Ms Mokhobo going to the Gupta 
residence.  That’s how it ended, you were saying you had spoken to her 
before, the day before you didn’t just come out of the blue and say let’s 
go somewhere, you say you had spoken before and then the following 
morning you came. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair but I want to submit 
20 
with due respect Chair, what my former GCEO was saying it was not 
correct, because when she was dealing with the issue it seems as if I 
went into her office, called her, let’s go, even my daughter eight years 
will ask me dad where are we going, she knew where we were going, 
yes Chairperson she knew where we were going, it’s not like I 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 155 of 174 
 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she know that from the previous day’s 
discussion? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the previous day you had said, the two of you had 
a discussion in terms of which you were going to go to the Gupta 
residence the following morning. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   What we discussed Chair we 
said the Guptas they have asked me so that I can see her, but we didn’t 
say the same morning we will go. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you didn’t fix the date? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   No, no we didn’t fix the date, 
but I – the issues that we are talking about it was compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes, but in the morning when I 
came I went to her office, but she knew that that plan was already there 
to go to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you went to her the following morning did 
you say let’s go to the Guptas? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so she didn’t find out only when she arrived at 
the Gupta residence? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair because I have 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 156 of 174 
 
already mentioned the compliance issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Talking about the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   And the previous day I told her 
about they want to see her but we didn’t finalise the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, alright.  Before Ms Norman continues I just 
want to ask you another question, you say once you were at the Gupta 
residence you enjoyed curry there, what curry was it? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson I went there more 
10 
than – I can’t count. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You went there many times? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   No, no Chairperson I cannot 
count. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes, because I must tell you 
the truth, I cannot count, I went there several times and I enjoyed curry 
Chairperson I don’t want to lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and it would be fair to say you became friends 
with them?  When you say you went there so many times you cannot 
20 
remember it looks like you were friends with them. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   No Chairperson you know I 
know people have friends, but now I don’t have friends, I have people 
that I know, I don’t call them friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay, so that must be a wrong term, but 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 157 of 174 
 
you interacted with them countless times? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, now I will tell you later why I am pursuing the 
issue of curry, what curry was it, was it beef curry, was it lamb curry or 
was it chicken curry, what curry was it, can you remember? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson I don’t think they 
eat meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hey! 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I don’t think they eat meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   But it has something called 
curry, yes I don’t know ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Which didn’t have meat. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   But I don’t think it’s – they call 
it curry ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not the curry as we know it. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I think so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, as far as you recall there was no meat in the 
curry that you ate, that you enjoyed. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   No Chairperson, I don’t think, 
20 
yes I don’t think there was meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I was asking that question because in Ms 
Mentoor’s statement and in her evidence before the Commission she 
said that when she had a meeting, when she was at the Gupta 
residence where she was offered the position of Minister of Public 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 158 of 174 
 
Enterprises on her version I think she was offered curry and I think she 
said, I don’t know if she said lamb curry or beef curry, now in response 
to that Mr Ajay Gupta in his affidavit said there is no way we could have 
offered you beef curry or lamb curry, I just cannot remember which one, 
but he said we couldn’t offered you that, we are Hindu and so on, so I 
wanted to check what kind of curry you were given but you say it did 
not have meat. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you, Chair. Maybe Mr 
10 
Motsoeneng, we could just deal with the 90/10 policy and just get it out 
of the way. Could you just tell the Chair what motivated this policy and 
what was it all about? Because it’s something that the interim board, I’ll 
direct you to those pages was critical of and also, one of the witnesses 
if you may recall Mr Phiri testified before the Chairperson. That he 
didn’t think that it was a bad idea to introduce that policy but it was the 
manner in which it was introduced that he was critical of.  
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, I think it is very important 
for all people of South Africa to bless their own people first before they 
can bless people from outside the country. Reason being when we 
20 
came with 90%, we didn’t wake up in the morning and introduce 90%. It 
has been a process Chairperson because in broadcasting as the COO I 
have the summit. Annually so I have a summit where we go through all 
the programs that are performing and non-performance and when you 
look all those programs the non-performance our international content. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 159 of 174 
 
I know that they were saying that no, local content actually caused 
harm for the SABC. It is not true Chairperson. Look Generation, look 
Uzalo those are the most watched soapies in South Africa. So, there is 
no way that international content will beat local content. We went 
through Chairperson after our summit but my issue was, we as SABC 
we have been talking for many, many years Chairperson. Even before I 
came, people were talking about local content but when they talk at the 
SABC they believe that when they have a paper they have put, they 
have delivered. So, for me when I see outcome I have delivered. But 
also, Chairperson we look at the books of the SABC. Example, when 
10 
you take artist of South Africa you know people tape the… (indistinct) 
and people are so excited. I mean I don’t know because people talk 
about it. For me it’s painful if you are going to use that word for your 
own artist. I realized that actually we are paying artists outside more 
than our own artists in South Africa. And I said to the team, we can’t be 
a blesser. You must bless your own children first before you bless 
people from outside. So, that is the reason why we introduce local 
content. But we also went across the country talking to people, citizens 
asking them about what the feel about the SABC. The majority of them 
they said, why do you show us the Bold and the Beautiful? Some of 
20 
them they are saying no, when we grow, we are getting older. We are 
still seeing this the Bold and the Beautiful. So, I said, why can’t we 
have our own the Bold and the Beautiful as South Africans 
Chairperson? And if you look in Africa Chair, many people they watch 
Nigerian content. Why? Because it’s appealing. Even here in South 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 160 of 174 
 
Africa we can do that Chairperson, South Africa will create employment, 
South Africa will create sustainable artists because they die as… 
(indistinct) because the money goes out. So, those are the issues 
Chairperson. But also, Chairperson it is not about the artist. It is also 
about your production houses because we were saying it can’t be right 
that when you go to KwaZulu Natal, you go to Limpopo I can’t leave my 
province Free State Chairperson. You go to Free State, you don’t have 
actors coming from those provinces when actually we are a public 
broadcaster. What kind of content are we supposed to do? It’s a local 
content. Even when you check the broadcasting Act, it talks about 
10 
SABC developing local content production houses. That is what we did 
Chairperson. To be honest I have a pain where I am Chairperson that 
the board, they reverse 90/10. You know why they reversed it? They 
didn’t want the person but the person was correct. But if you don’t want 
the person don’t destroy what is good for the country because that is 
what SABC is doing. They are destroying everything that we 
implemented Chair. And you can imagine Chairperson President 
Ramaphosa now another president comes. He just wake up and feel no 
man that president was not doing and you destroy everything. That’s 
why SABC will be always in these troubles that they are facing 
20 
Chairperson because you should take the good and leave the bad that 
you think this one is not working. But in the local content I can attest 
it’s the diamond of South Africa for our artists and business people 
generally Chairperson. So, I believe in us before I can believe in other 
people. And Chairperson, I went abroad. You know what is very 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 161 of 174 
 
interesting I was really honoured to be invited by broadcasters 
internationally in India not to the Guptas, Chair. In India were all the 
broadcasters went and discussed because when I introduced 90/10 all 
South Africa people were excited. Wake up, I mean you go to the 
airport you feel you are in South Africa. It’s all this music, our African 
music. They invited me to come to say but why are you getting rid of 
us. Why are you saying 10% international content not at least 60% for 
South Africa? At least we can see that we are moving somewhere. But I 
said to them, tell me how many artists do you play in this country? I 
have been here for a week. I have never listened to music or a 
10 
musician from Africa. It’s all the Americans and others. You don’t play 
our music. When it comes to content Chairperson, I said to them, for us 
to buy your content our own actors here those who are acting 
Generations and other soapies when we buy, we must benefit. We must 
have our own actors there in the Bold and the Beautiful; example acting 
internationally because I believe our people are capable to act 
internationally. We agree Chairperson. I’m surprised that the new board 
is talking bad about local content. But I can tell you Chairperson, they 
don’t know broadcasting. This one Chairperson I can attest to you. 
They 
don’t 
understand broadcasting. 
Example 
Chairperson, 
the 
20 
Chairperson of the board including the GCO they talk about you need to 
invest in time before you put a content and they make misleading issue 
about Uzalo. Uzalo Chairperson is my project, it’s my baby because it 
was a pilot project when we introduced to say, we want to see all 
provinces producing content in their own languages. So, when I and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 162 of 174 
 
people were fighting Chairperson. They didn’t want that Uzalo. I think if 
you were reading newspapers Chairperson if you read newspapers 
Chair you realize that at certain point there was hullabaloo about Uzalo 
and so on. And I said to the team of the SABC, let us give them a 
chance and see how this baby will grow. Chairperson, within three 
months Uzalo was leading Generation and other soapies. Which means 
people love local content. As I’m speaking now Uzalo is competing 
amongst the top three. So, which means local content is lekker and we 
as South Africans we must invest in local content, Chairperson. That is 
what I want to say to you, Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. May I just refer you to what the 
interim board in its report says? It will be in the reference bundle CC32 
at pages 5, matters that relate to the 90/10. It will be page 5, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 5. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Where the heading is, Performance 
Review. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. But your attention Mr 
Motsoeneng is drawn to paragraph 2.1.2D, C I beg your pardon where 
they say, 
The interim board took the following decisions 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 163 of 174 
 
reviewed the 90/10 local content directive to align with ICASA 
rules with particular reference to those stations which suffered 
audience and revenue loss. 
And then it page 11, Chair paragraph 2.1 .13 the subheading is, 
Evaluate financial and legal implications of unilateral changes to policy. 
It was established that the 90/10 local content 
directive had a negative impact on audiences and advertising 
revenue of some radio and TV stations totalling 183 million 
(unaudited) in television and 29 million (unaudited) in radio. 
These figures excluded the additional costs of 72 million for 
10 
the replacement of local content and losses due to unused 
foreign rights already contracted. The interim board has taken 
a decision to reverse the 90/10 local content directive. The 
corporation 
remains 
compliant 
and 
above 
with 
the 
requirements of the ICASA regulations. 
Thank you. Do you wish to comment? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes. Through you Chair, I think Chair the 
board is misleading the public. There is no way where local content can 
cause revenue for SABC. As I have alluded to the issue that local 
content generates more revenue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean can cause revenue loss? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean there is no way local content could cause 
revenue loss for SABC? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  There is no way Chairperson. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 164 of 174 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you mean, ja. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  There is no way because local content 
Chairperson, when we introduce local content well, I must be honest 
Chair. Some of advertisers they were not happy but they were not even 
happy even when we were still having that content that we were having 
at the SABC. So, after introducing local content we went to see all 
these advertisers and we, it was public knowledge because it was on 
media, it was on television where we engaged them there indoors. To 
say that they were going to invest in local content it can’t be correct. 
The issue that I’m thinking Chairperson they don’t know the SABC you 
10 
have a sales division. Their work is to sell the SABC the value of the 
SABC and when they sell this value of the SABC most of the time they 
give discount. If you give discount which means you don’t value your 
own SABC because I value SABC very highly so. If you don’t give them 
discount because when people want money, they want quick money. So, 
they will say 100 million is coming tomorrow but you lose half of 100 
million. So, for me is they don’t understand the business. Why SABC 
didn’t collapse when I was there and the previous boards? Because 
Chair I can attest to you. If you look the financials of the SABC you will 
realize that from 2008 until 2016 especially 2013 Chairperson we 
20 
improved a lot. It was around billion, billion, billion. When I left at the 
SABC it was 881 cash in the bank and that is where they come in. 
When they come in Chairperson, if you have 881 cash in the bank, they 
just know there is money but they don’t know what they need to do to 
make sure that they increase the money. Because that money 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 165 of 174 
 
Chairperson that I’m talking about the financials they are audited 
financials. I saw when the board when they were presenting and the 
GCO they were talking about hearsay. They were telling the 
Commission about their own views. They didn’t produce the report 
Chairperson. If you go through those lies you will see that SABC 
financially has been doing very well. And when you check Chairperson 
if you have 881 million to run SABC to operate you need 600 million. 
But those when you close the financials they are audited, everything is 
done. Now you have 881 million. What do you need to do? I call cycle. 
You have the first cycle where you need to recover because now you 
10 
have paid everything. Now you have 800 million. You must make sure 
when you come to June at least you have covered that amount. When it 
comes to September you are around 1.1 billion/1.2 billion. That is how 
we have been running SABC Chairperson. It’s the understanding of the 
business. They don’t understand the business Chairperson. That is my 
view that I will submit that no, these people they don’t know what 
they’re talking about Chairperson. Even if Chairperson they can be 
given bailout, they’ll never take SABC anywhere because Chairperson 
why do you just want to eat, eat, eat you don’t think? In the board 
meeting Chairperson, the minutes are there will attest to that. I said, 
20 
why do we want bailout from government Chairperson? It’s written in 
the minutes Chairperson and reason being Chairperson when I came at 
the SABC now I’m talking as an acting COO. I realized that people they 
don’t use their own thinking and innovation to deal with issues. 
Because when I came Chairperson the financials were bad and I’m not 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 166 of 174 
 
taking credit as an individual. I’m taking credit with the team in the 
previous boards but I had come with innovation Chairperson how to 
make sure that SABC is sustainable. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. We are going to deal with that maybe 
in the morning because I think there is a paragraph where you deal. 
There is minutes where it’s dealt with about you having raised funds for 
the SABC. So, we are going to deal with all of those. I think that also 
falls within what you call your innovations. But for now, let’s just deal 
with another big policy change.  
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Sorry, Chair 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Through you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  I just before because I’m going to forget 
this one Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  On the same matter Chairperson, you 
know the weakness there at the SABC also it was people will project 
loss and also if you go to the minutes Chairperson, I refuse SABC to 
20 
project loss. Because if you project loss, what are you saying? You are 
saying let’s collapse, let’s close the shop. So, those I’m just saying. 
Those are the issues Chairperson that we must think about. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, you say that will be dealt with tomorrow morning? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 167 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, tomorrow Chair. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair, I’m not sure whether I should start 
but we still have 15 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s try and use. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And use it. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because yesterday we, was it yesterday? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, we finished early. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourned about 15h40. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That’s correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let’s try and go. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And make time. Thank you. Mr 
Motsoeneng, can we also deal with another change that you 
implemented as the COO. You must have heard the journalists that’s 
testified including, these are matters that would relate to the SABC 8 if 
you recall about the change that violent protests were not to be 
covered. They have testified to the Chair that they felt that was 
interference with news and that was something that they frowned upon 
and you would have listened to all of their evidence. In fact, I think one 
of the witnesses categorized it as a matter that was kind of treasonous 
20 
because in other words you are saying to the public, I’m not going to 
show you exactly what’s happening but I will conceal that from you. 
Could you just testify to that? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  With pleasure, Chair. Chairperson I think 
people when we talk about media, they confuse issues. I did hear when 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 168 of 174 
 
they were testifying to say I was interfering. It was my job to interfere. I 
don’t Chairperson I just want to demonstrate. It was my job to interfere 
because their argument is, they are independent. The question we need 
to ask Chairperson, independent to who if they are independent 
because independency it is an organization. It’s not me as an 
individual. It is an organization independent. In the Broadcasting Act, 
Chairperson it’s clear the independence of a broadcaster, all re-
broadcasters 
not 
individual 
and 
when it comes 
these 
visuals 
Chairperson, I don’t know what is happening in South Africa because I 
want to demonstrate Chairperson. The visuals, what we see today is 
10 
because of how media cover these riots that is happening in South 
Africa. And if you check the Nigerians are taking business people in 
Nigeria, what cause that? When they saw it on our television. 
Chairperson, my view on the visuals you can show the visuals but there 
are certain visuals that you can’t show. Their issue Chairperson is no, 
the journalist should be creative, independence. The Broadcasting Act 
they don’t talk about journalist being independent as journalist. And my 
view on independence Chairperson is that you should not be influenced 
by other forces maybe outside but internally Chairperson. You know 
people interfere to me as the COO. They interfere in my work. They will 
20 
tell me here we think you are wrong or we think here but I don’t take it 
as an interference. I take as people who are assisting me to do what we 
are supposed to do at the SABC Chairperson because the Broadcasting 
Act, Chair is against the glamorizing violence. It’s there in the 
Broadcasting Act and it is unlawful. It is not me. In the Broadcasting 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 169 of 174 
 
Act it says it is unlawful to the glamorizing violence Chairperson. So, 
my view is Chairperson that decision that I have taken or we have 
taken at the SABC we were within the Broadcasting Act because that’s 
what the Broadcasting Act says. That know when we deal with 
broadcasting, we must be very careful about some of the issues that we 
are doing. Chairperson, I don’t believe that you should go and burn a 
library at Wits University. Where are our children going to learn if you 
burn a library? Because for us as South Africa it seems as if we want to 
produce monsters in my view Chairperson. Because if you check 
Chairperson, South Africa what is news is bad. Bad news is news that 
10 
is occupying everything. Why are we not producing role models? Why 
the journalists are not going and talk to people who are doing well for 
the community? I’m just giving you examples Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Can I just interrupt just on that? How 
would you want it to be covered? If the Wits is being burned down, how 
would you in terms of your policy how would you have expected 
journalists to cover that story? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  They can cover the story. I don’t have a 
problem with them covering the story but let’s take a burn example 
Chairperson which I clarify to media general not even SABC workers. I 
20 
said, no look let’s take Vuyani. People go and burn a school. You don’t 
know who is inside the school. Television these days is live 
Chairperson. You can see people walking around being burned on 
television. We must not allow that to happen Chairperson. Even here in 
Alexandra, that burn people were found there, Chairperson. I’m saying 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 170 of 174 
 
when I was dealing with the issue, Chairperson including myself and 
Joe Tloloe and Ntate Joe Tloloe and I respect him. We went and 
debated this issue of visuals. I said, no my issue is the physicality of 
showing those visuals. You can show the building but I don’t think 
every day we must watch building, people have burned a building, 
people are killing each other and I’m aligned with the Broadcasting Act. 
Chairperson I want anyone who will say the Broadcasting Act is talking 
differently from what I’m saying because there are portion even in my 
affidavit that I’m referring to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And I think that portion is in 
10 
paragraph 43 of your statement that where you are quoting the conduct 
for broadcasting licenses regulations of 2009. Is that the one? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which is, 
The broadcasting service licenses must not broadcast material 
which judged within context 
a. contains violence which does not play an integral role in 
developing the plot character or theme of the material as a whole 
or sanctions or promotes or glamorizes violence or unlawful 
conduct. 
20 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That’s the point that you are making? 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  That is the point, Chair. That is the point 
that I demonstrated to the SABC personnel. To say, as a public 
broadcaster because they compare them with a private broadcaster or 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 171 of 174 
 
media general outside. In their minds they are independent because 
they are media but we are guided by the Broadcasting Act. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. But then even taking that example 
that you’ve given. So, what it means that the public then if supposing 
that you are correct in your interpretation of what the regulations say 
and supposing that you have used the correct, it would mean that a 
journalist would go and cover a story. That story without anyone’s plan 
turns or the situation turns violent and buildings are burnt down. If one 
were to look at what you suggesting then that journalist must simply 
cover the aspect where there is no violence and then walk away from 
10 
the scene. Meaning then the public would not know what happened, 
what situation developed from the initial story. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  My interpretation is different. My 
interpretation is you can show the visuals but you should be selective 
what kind of visuals that you are going to show people. You can report 
about people toyi toying but Chairperson in my understanding I may be 
wrong and I know Chairperson you will correct me when you deal with 
your findings. I may be wrong because I’m not even a lawyer but it’s 
just my understanding what I’m understanding and that point. Actually, 
were not even supposed to glamorize this violence. It is unlawful 
20 
because that is what the Act says there, Chairperson. It is my 
understanding but as a human being Chairman now ubuntu. As a human 
being, as an African you know Africans, we, I don’t know Chairperson 
and I know they said, no I said to them America. It is true. America 
there is poverty Chairperson. America even when the plane, you know 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 172 of 174 
 
that plane you know is normal. What you see there, Chairperson you 
just see kwi but they don’t show you. They hide it. So, for some own 
their own reason because I don’t want to get involved there. But here 
Chairperson 
I’m just 
dealing 
with 
what the 
law says 
in 
my 
understanding. I’m not a lawyer but that is. I may be right, I may be 
wrong but that is my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. You are explaining how you, what informs your 
view on the issue. 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are explaining. 
10 
MR HLAUDI MOTSOENENG:  And my view Chairperson is South Africa 
or Africa we can’t really just because this encourages Chairperson.  It’s 
a, I was a journalist Chairperson. When you go with cameras, even 
these journalists they will tell you here. When you go with cameras 
especially when you are known, they know you they do some stuff. 
Stones, everything just happens. Chairperson, we should not really 
encourage that Chairperson. I’m just talking from, not from the point of 
view of the SA. Personally, that is what I don’t think because I think 
Chairperson especially SABC we should make sure that we balance the 
stories. But we don’t really put all these visuals that are bad for the 
20 
country. Even I’m happy Chairperson. The president of the country 
currently agrees with me. Minister Naledi Pandor agrees with me which 
means now they are following me because this is what I have been 
saying. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. On that note, Chair it’s now 4 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 173 of 174 
 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  May we then adjourn for the day? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s your estimation of how long we should be 
tomorrow with Mr Motsoeneng? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair, we should finish in two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In two hours? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then how many witnesses have you lined up for 
tomorrow other than him? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I’m sorry, Chair. Chair might I just? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Two. We’ve got after Mr Motsoeneng we 
could move another witness. Then we can have two more witnesses, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are the others brief witnesses? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, Chair. Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What were you going to suggest, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. I was just thinking whether if we start at 
20 
10 o’clock we would be fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, whether we should start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think let’s start at 10 o’clock, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will be fine, Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 160 
 
Page 174 of 174 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. We are going to adjourn for the day and then 
we will proceed tomorrow. We will start at 10 o’clock tomorrow. So, you 
will come back Mr Motsoeneng tomorrow morning. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.
