on record thee bundle that we will be referring to that 
relates to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Dr Ngubane was supposed to 
20 
start his evidence yesterday and it did not happen because 
we took long with the other witness is it not?  Dr Ngubane 
you – you were ready to give your evidence yesterday is it 
not or not really?

11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 6 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were ready to give your evidence 
yesterday is it not? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it did not happen because we took 
long with the other witness. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we apologise for that but we are 
thankful – we are thankful that you are here today to 
continue. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ngiyabonga [African language] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Placing on 
record Chair is Eskom Bundle 09[A] and 09[B].  Exhibit 
U19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes ja.  Eskom Bundle 09[A] and 
Eskom Bundle 09[B]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they both deal with Exhibit U19. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed.  Dr Ngubane I believe you also 
have the same bundle of files in front of you. 
DR NGUBANE:   I see.  Yes.  Am I still [00:04:54] with 
this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is one written on the spine Eskom 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 7 of 254 
 
Bundle 09 on the spine here – here on the spine. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is one written Eskom Bundle 09[A] 
DR NGUBANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the other one is Eskom Bundle 
09[B]. 
DR NGUBANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when he refers you to these he will 
say 09[A] or 09[B] and then you know which one. 
DR NGUBANE:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Dr Ngubane the bundle 
Eskom Bundle 09[A] if you open it it has on page 1 thereof 
your affidavit to the commission – to this commission.   
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes go to page 1. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And that affidavit it is 51 pages so 
if you go to page 51 that is the last page of the affidavit.  
The top right-hand page 51 – top right hand corner.  I think 
20 
that is – that is the one you are at?  The one you had now. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes.  Yes.  Except to say that I had an 
addendum to the affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Exactly with some annexures to it.  But 
go to the last page.  Page 51.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 8 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have explained to him about the red 
and black numbers? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes I have referred him to the top 
right hand corner which – they are red. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Red pagination Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are two numbers at the top of each 
page.  One is red; the other one is black.  When he refers 
to page numbers he will be referring only to the red 
numbers. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I was saying – I was asking you Dr 
Ngubane to go to page 51 which is the last page of your 
affidavit.  Anyway… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The number will appear as 0051 but he 
will just say 51 he will not mention 00. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes have you got page 51? 
DR NGUBANE:  Page? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  51 red numbers. 
DR NGUBANE:  I have found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so there appears a signature – the 
signature and the date 4 August 2020 do you confirm that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 9 of 254 
 
is your signature? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So Dr Ngubane then you 
can go to the first page of the affidavit.  Now you set out in 
your affidavit your qualifications in paragraph 2 and then 
the next page paragraph 3 you deal with your appointment 
to the Eskom Board.  Now could you tell the Chairperson 
how you became appointed to the Eskom Board which as 
we have heard the evidence was the board of December 
2014.   
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Well there was what I would call a request 
for 
proposals 
issued 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Public 
Enterprises in the public press.  And at one discussion with 
my nephew Sibosiso Sibisi he was interested if I would not 
want to contribute because of my experience in the 
Department of Science and Technology where I had been a 
Minister from 1994 to 2002.  And obviously I should have a 
good understanding of technology and physics and so on.  
So I said I was interested and then he – he submitted the 
nomination. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Dr Ngubane you would know that 
this Board is one that has been allegedly referred to as the 
Gupta board. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well that was referred by Mr Tsotsi which I 
find absolutely disgusting.  You know it was an open 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 10 of 254 
 
process run by the department who had no contact or 
connection or telephone conversation that from anyone of 
the Gupta people to say we want you to be on the board.  
And I presume this would go as well for all my other board 
members.   
Now to be described as a Gupta board I think it is 
very, very unfortunate particularly coming from a public 
figure like Mr Zola Tsotsi.  Mr Zola Tsotsi himself had been 
accused in the press – it was the Sunday Times publication 
around probably 15/16 or 18 April which said he had 
10 
leaned on the management in the procurement sector to 
grant Tegeta two mining contracts.   
One at R400 million a year another one at R500 
million a year. One of them was Klipfontein I cannot 
remember exactly the other one and one of these mines did 
not even have a proper water licence from the Department 
of Water and Sanitation.   
But on top of that at the beginning of this year a 
coal contract worth R3.7 billion was set aside by the 
Gauteng North High Court.  That was signed in Mr Tsotsi’s 
20 
time.  Brian Molefe, Koko Molefe, myself were hardly - 
when I was at Eskom in December but Molefe only came in 
April. So it could not have been him who dealt with that 
contract.   
So those are questions that Mr Tsotsi must ask who 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 11 of 254 
 
did favours to the Gupta’s?  We worked very hard with my 
board.  We found Eskom in a shambles.  The reports that 
Mr Matona gave us at the first board meeting on the 11 t h 
March stated that whereas Eskom should have a buffer of 
R20 billion in order to service debt, pay for services 
etcetera it had been reduced to find R4 billion of which 
dependent on loans that were still going to come in.  The 
net effect was that Eskom was in the red by R3 billion.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  May I – please.  If I may?  We will come 
to that. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just give me the – the date of the 
media article you refer to about Mr Tsotsi? 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You mentioned a media article or media 
report. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About Mr Tsotsi. 
DR NGUBANE:  We did not ask Mr Tsotsi about that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but you just mentioned it. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes I do.  I am just saying for a man who 
can come to the commission and say that we are a Gupta 
board is very offensive particularly knowing what appeared 
in the media. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes what was the date of the article you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 12 of 254 
 
mentioned? 
DR NGUBANE:  Somewhere in April.  I think between 16 or 
18 somewhere there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  April this year? 
DR NGUBANE:  You know in that region. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of which year? 
DR NGUBANE:  This – 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2015? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now you yourself Dr Ngubane have 
10 
been linked to Mr Salim Essa. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who is related to the Gupta’s. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 And 
would 
you 
explain 
to 
the 
Chairperson what was or is your relationship with Mr Salim 
Essa? 
DR NGUBANE:  You know I – it was not a special 
relationship let me put it there.  You know there were more 
than twenty companies where I have been invited to come 
20 
in as a partner, a director and they are recorded in the 
commission – I mean the company Intellectual Property 
Commission.   
I had known Salim from about 2011 when I was 
Chairman of the SABC Board.  We used to attend the same 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 13 of 254 
 
meetings on digital migration.  He was on the Board of the 
Broadband Infraco South Africa which is on the – a state 
owned company.  And we were preparing for migration to 
digital television at SABC.   
You know I got to know a lot of people on that 
Board because at those meetings and I came to know Mr 
Salim.  You know it was sort of a relationship like any other 
of the people I know.   
Then it happened that in 2013 at that time I was in 
a company called Global Collieries Fuel Distribution which 
10 
was a company populated by British Oil people and that 
some South Africans as well and they had established a 
subsidiary in South Africa.  We were at JP’s in Melrose 
meeting these guests when Salim appeared in the same 
restaurant and came over to me and I started introducing 
my partners to him and he said well he himself was in the 
oil business can he be part of this.   
So after a fair amount of discussion my colleagues 
said well, we will give it a thought. But the fact that some 
of them were in Mali in West Africa on oil business and 
20 
railway business.  They then suggested that if we formed 
another company for exploration in West Africa for oil wells 
they will be happy with that.   
And we then met with Salim subsequent to that and 
ultimately came up with Garda Oil and Gas which would be 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 14 of 254 
 
almost a service level provider to Global Collieries Fuel 
Distribution.  Then we agreed that Salim was going to 
arrange for travelled to CAR which was a Southern African 
Republic which had just – had just announced that they 
were auctioning oil blocks.   
I was going to use my connections with African 
ambassadors to gain access to whatever was needed in 
that exploration trip.  Of course arranging these things 
takes time.  In that year there was an outbreak of violence 
in CAR and our soldiers were placed there for maintaining 
10 
peace and order.  There was a fight and some of our 
soldiers were killed.   
Then I went back to Salim and to my other 
colleagues at Global Collieries I said, we cannot go there 
anymore because South African soldiers were killed there.  
There is instability and that is how that whole venture fell 
down; did not go through.  And Global – I mean Garda 
called Oil and Gas never then did any business in oil 
exploration.   
Later on Mr Essa resigned you know and – but I did 
20 
not bother to actually delist Garda Oil and Gas because 
you know you just did not occur to me it was dormant, it 
was not doing any trading.   
Now Salim Essa as I say was not a special friend.  I 
knew him when decided to work with.  Later on he 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 15 of 254 
 
appeared at Eskom with McKenzie.  McKenzie had I think 
in 2015 early had been given a contract at Eskom to 
manage several things.   
One of them was Majuba Power Station.  One of 
them was Optimizing our corporate plan.  One of the other 
duties was to create a consultancy of young engineers at 
Eskom in order to cut down the expenses that we spent on 
consultants.  So he was a familiar face at Eskom.  But that 
did not justify any influence in terms of the work that we 
were doing at Eskom.  So I think Chairperson that sums up 
10 
my association with Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Ngubane.  But you will 
also know Mr Ngubane that Ms Daniels; Suzanne Daniels 
who worked in your office was charged with exchanging 
emails with an email address infoportal and that that email 
address according to the Chairperson of the Disciplinary 
Hearing it most probably belonged to Mr Salim Essa.  The 
exchange of emails came from your office. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I think I have in the file a copy of that 
email.  I am not sure if you have it.  I can quickly look for it 
20 
here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is just one of the emails. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That will be just one of the emails. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 16 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well the first email that came … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we can – you can look for it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka might assist in locating where 
it is but if you are able to look that is fine.  Mr Seleka you 
know where it is? 
DR NGUBANE:  Let me ask Dr Ngubane.  Which one are 
you referring to Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says the first one.  Does it help 
saying the first or it does not. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  He will find it in his file and then 
he will give the date and then we can look. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. Alternatively I can 
give you the one I have Dr Ngubane.   
DR NGUBANE:  It should be here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.   
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry I am taking up time for this one.  But 
I think it is important to contextualise [00:23:13]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine just look for it if you 
20 
have got it there. Then once you have got it you tell us the 
date and the evidence leader can look for that one in the – 
in his file.    
DR NGUBANE:  Let me assist Mr Ngubane if you turn to 
page 51.147. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 17 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  51.147 I think it starts at 51.146. 
CHAIRPERSON:  51.17? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  51.147. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Eskom Bundle 9 – 09[A].  Ja that 
is the correct bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got 51.147. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  It would appear that you 
have to read it with point 146. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  You said it is 17? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 51.147.  51.147. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  No I think I am lost. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can – junior counsel can assist. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness ja. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Anyway Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
The 
first 
email 
that 
came 
from 
Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 18 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just pull the microphone closer to you.  
Yes. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
The 
first 
email 
that 
came 
from 
Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Was addressed to Ms Suzanne Daniels 
and copied to me.  The caption went like this.  Comments 
on the Chairman’s media statement.  At the bottom of that 
was the media office of Eskom.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh media office of Eskom ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Of Eskom.  And he said I want to make 
comments 
on 
the 
statement. 
 And 
then 
there 
were 
comments given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  When I asked Ms Daniels who was making 
these comments she said it was the DG of Public 
Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  So I said this was this email?  She said 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because I knew I was going to make a 
public statement then I assume someone had passed it – 
passed the draft to the Director General for comments.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 19 of 254 
 
Because you know there had been complaints from DPE 
that we publish statements and they see them for the first 
time in the media.  So it made sense that probably it was 
passed to them.  So there was to and fro exchange of 
emails 
between 
myself 
and 
Ms 
Daniels 
about 
the 
corrections.  Ultimately the last final correction I just said 
it was alright with me.  That was the essence of the email 
exchanges.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
DR NGUBANE:  On that subject. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not succeed in locating the email 
in your file?  That first email that you wanted to look at you 
did not… 
DR NGUBANE:  I have – I have done so Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have.  Okay.  Have you got the 
page – the dates? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do not take it out of the file.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that is just to – so that you can 
identify it otherwise we return it to him.  Mr Seleka did you 
20 
identify do you have it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have the – I have opened the page we 
were looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the one that he is talking about? 
He wanted you to see it so that you know whether you have 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 20 of 254 
 
got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or whether it is the same as mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well whether it is – whether it is an email 
you have got – you said there are one of many that you 
wanted to refer him to.  We must just know whether we 
have got that email or not.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  And [00:29:04] I can add. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just one second. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Dr Ngubane.  Yes, no this is – I 
will take him to the other one Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He – this page is pulled out from the 
bundle before the commission so it is exactly the same as 
my bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought he pulled it from his own 
private file? 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Okay no that is alright. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Well it is the same as I have in my files. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it the same? 
DR NGUBANE:  [00:29:30] they found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no look.  The idea was just so 
that we know whether the email you are referring to is an 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 21 of 254 
 
email that we have got.  So that if it was an email that we 
did not have then copies could be made.  So if we have got 
that is fine. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you wanted to add something Dr 
Ngubane before Mr Seleka continues? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I would say – I was going to say the 
Director General was very supportive of Eskom and its 
management.  I think it is prior to this email where it is 
written 
to 
the 
CEO, 
Brian 
Molefe, 
who 
was 
having 
10 
uncomfortable conversations with the chief procurement 
officer at Treasury.  He wrote to Brian and said:  Before you 
answer any question on the office of the chief procurement 
officer, you send it to me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was that?   
DR NGUBANE:   The DG.  Or was it Seleke? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was that Mr Richard Seleke? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  
DR NGUBANE:   I mean ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct] Chairperson, showing 
support. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  I am sorry, Dr Ngubane. 
[laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is emphasising that that one ends with 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 22 of 254 
 
an E. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   As his ends with an A. 
DR NGUBANE:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a material difference, Chair.  
[laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] I suspects it is the same as 
Zondo and Zonde.  [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is right.  [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   So I was familiar with his approach to 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   He wanted to give us support.  I just 
wanted to add that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, the... 
against that background you have given, one wonders why 
this 
very 
strange 
email 
address 
was 
used 
to 
then 
communicate official documentation with an official in the 
20 
department.  Why not use his official department email 
address? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka I wonder whether we 
should not first hear what the email says and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, before we talk about what its contents 
was and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Dr Ngubane, if you go back.  You 
have closed your file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 1... Page 51.146, sir.  Page 51... 
please assist him.  Page 51.146.   
DR NGUBANE:   Oh.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are on the page? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is... should we consider the 
emails from page 51.1.46?   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Gmail.  That appears at the top of that 
page. 
 
And 
your 
name 
there 
Baldwin 
Ngubane.  
baldwindoctorngubane@gmail.com.  Below the line it reads: 
“I am sharing draft positioned statement forward 
payment to Tegeta, 19 June 2016 .bock with you.” 
 
And 
below 
that 
it 
is 
businessman,

portal...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Ngubane, do you confirm whether that 
is your email address, baldwindoctorngubane@gmail.com? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 24 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is a personal email? address 
DR NGUBANE:   Personal email, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Dr Ngubane, 
did you have an Eskom email address when you were at 
Eskom? 
DR NGUBANE:   I am...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you have an Eskom email address 
when you were at Eskom? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Is there a reason why the 
communication here appears to be from your private email 
address as opposed to your Eskom email address? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, when I used to come... when I came 
to Eskom, I will plug my computer into a converter at 
Eskom@ which converted this email to Eskom email.  So I 
was not so concerned because I could access my Eskom 
20 
email when I was in the office.   
 
So some of the emails came directly to my private email.  
Some when to the official Eskom when I accessed them 
through the Eskom system.  I mean, and every month, the IT 
people at Eskom changed the password on the Eskom 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 25 of 254 
 
system.   
 
So where it was probably official business, they would 
keep on changing the password every month.  But then at 
home, I could access my personal email if people send 
whatever to the Gmail address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  My question is.  In respect of this 
document by ensuring draft positioned statement forward 
payment to Tegeta, 19 June 2016.  Why was this draft 
positioned statement not forwarded from your Eskom email 
address? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I am sure I could access it through the 
Eskom email once I plugged in my computer to their system.  
So I never thought about that because a lot of times, 
documentation came through my private address.   
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 And 
just 
to 
clarify. 
 
So 
this 
communication is in June 2016? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   May you can be precise?  19 June 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chairperson.  We will go 
20 
into the dates of the emails.  I think it ranges from 
10 June 2016, 11 June 2016 and the document itself seems 
to be dated 19 June 2016.  Do you confirm that Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you follow? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 26 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The email... the dates of the emails/ 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is 10 June 2016. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
And 
there 
is 
three 
on 
the 
10t h of June 2016.  I shall take you step by step.   And there 
are two on the 11 t h of June 2016.   
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me take you step by step. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe let us do that.  Go to the 
earliest one if you can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Say who it was from, who it was 
addressed to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then either you or the witness can 
read what the email said and then so that we have a full 
picture.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Chair.   
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Can you... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the witness is looking for the 
current...  And generally, they are in a reversed order when 
they are printed out.  So we will have to start from the 
bottom and go to the top.  But you will see the dates, it will 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 27 of 254 
 
guide us. 
DR NGUBANE:   Is it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And junior counsel can assist him.  You 
know this thing of starting with...  
DR NGUBANE:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It can be confusing.  
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I do not understand this technical 
arrangement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You need to be assisted.  You are not the 
10 
only one who does not understand some of these things. 
DR NGUBANE:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what should happen is.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are 
you 
refer 
him to 
each 
email 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...your junior counsel must approach him 
and I think show him which each you are talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So Dr Ngubane, I am going to 
follow the chronology of... the chronological of the emails.  I 
am starting at the page 51.146.  This is on the Friday.  So 
what you read there is on Friday, 30 June 2016.  The time 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 28 of 254 
 
stamp 
is 
21:36:58. 
Then 
you 
read 
Suzanne 
Daniels.  
suzannedaniels584@gmail.com.  And then it says, wrote: 
“This is what came back from Comms Team.  Going 
to read through it now.  At home office now.” 
 
Shared from Word for Android.  Do you see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you have Ms Suzanne Daniels’ 
details at that bottom end.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And who is sending that one to whom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is... is it apparent from there Dr 
10 
Ngubane who is Ms Suzanne Daniels writing to? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I presume he must have got the... this 
comment from earlier.  It must have.  That is the only 
explanation I have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Who do you think it came from? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   From info portal? 
DR NGUBANE:   Businessman.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Businessman? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, because he said that was the person 
20 
commenting.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And you say who is this 
businessman.  
DR NGUBANE:   Seleke. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Richard Seleke? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 29 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And not Salim Essa? 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not Salim Essa? 
DR NGUBANE:   No.  In fact, I do not think Salim Essa would 
use... send emails because he was there at Eskom.  They 
were already working with McKinsey and ...[indistinct] at 
Eskom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us carry on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us do it this way with each email.  
One, we identify who it is from, who it was addressed to, 
what the date was, what the subject matter was if that is 
made clear.  And then we will read it and then we can 
comment on it so that it gives us a proper picture.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So let us start with this one.  What I 
think... Mr Seleka, you... the first one is the one at the 
bottom, right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says on Friday, 10 June 2016, 21:36 
suzannedaniels584@gmail.com wrote: 
“This is what came back from Comms Team.  Going 
to read through it now.  At home office now.  Chat 
from Word for Android.” 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 30 of 254 
 
 
Now who is she writing to?  Can anyone tell?  Or is that 
we cannot tell?  Are you able to tell, Dr Ngubane?  I am not 
good with technology.  So, I rely on people.  Are you able to 
tell who she was writing to? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I assumed Chairperson it was the 
same person who was completing comments on the previous 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Businessman. 
DR NGUBANE:   Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Mr 
Seleka, 
is 
that 
your 
10 
understanding as well? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is my understanding, Chair.  And I 
think the answer lies in the email above. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that one was a response 
to...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one above.  If you look at the time 
stamp. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it was a response. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  The one immediately above is at 
20:14 and Ms Daniels is at 21:46. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so that one came first? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It did indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think that is what is confusing me 
because I was looking at the boardroom email as what it 
would arrived... been sent first. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 31 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you probably all of you understand it 
better than I do.  [laughing]  So the first one is on Friday, 
10 June 2016.  No, that is not the first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is at 20:14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  The 10 June 2016 at 20:14.  The 
businessmaninfoportal1@zogo.com, wrote.   
“It is too long.  It needs to be half page in total 
without too much detail and highlight the rand 
saving achieved as opposed to buying form Exxaro 
10 
please.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that is an email from Businessman to 
Ms Daniels? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would seem to be the case 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because then she responds on the same 
evening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At 21:36. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   36, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   10, Friday, June.  She writes: 
“This is what came back from Comms Team.  Going 
to read though it now.  At home office now.” 
 
Okay.  Dr Ngubane, do we know what the two of them 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 32 of 254 
 
were talking about here?  Businessman say it is too long.  
Needs to be half-pager. Do you know what that, what he was 
talking about? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson I assumed it was what 
was the title of the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   That unfair draft positioned statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   [Indistinct] to Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  And that draft positioned 
10 
statement, do you know what draft positioned statement they 
are talking about?  Was it a draft statement that you had 
prepared? 
DR NGUBANE:   It was what they were going to issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a media statement, draft media 
statement? 
DR NGUBANE:   Draft media statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was before you issued it? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it looks like... does it look like 
20 
Businessman got hold of that statement or was given that 
draft statement. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was commenting, saying: 
“It is too long.  It needs to behalf page in total 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 33 of 254 
 
without too much detail and highlight the rand 
savings achieved as opposed to buying from Exxaro, 
please.”   
 
Those are his comments, is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then Ms Daniels says this is what 
came back from Comms Team.  What is Comms Team.  Do 
you know? 
DR NGUBANE:   The Communication Team of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the Communications Team of Eskom.  
10 
Going to read it through.  Okay Mr Seleka, continue.  What 
email came after that and let us just follow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  Then Dr Ngubane if you 
go one more up.  It is on Friday again, 10 June 2016.  The 
time now is 23:20.  That is twenty past eleven at night.  Ms 
Suzanne Daniels.   
 
From the emails suzannedaniels584@gmail.com, wrote:  
“My first attempt at editing.”  So she [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I can see my... oh, ja.  I can 
see where you are. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that?  Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  It is the Gmail account 
Chairperson.  That is the one that is confusing us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is she still writing to Businessman? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 34 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is responding to “too long”.  So she 
says:  My first attempt at editing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that Dr Ngubane? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somewhere in the middle. 
DR NGUBANE:   You see the Gmail changed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now... please assist Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:   So Businessman says it needs to be half a 
page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   In total. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   [Indistinct]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And she responds at twenty past 
eleven p.m.  She says:  My first attempt at editing.   
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then one more up.  You see that 
one?  One more up. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At 21:23.  So three minutes later, the 
20 
same night on 10 June 2016 Businessman from Info Portal 1 
at Zorbo.com writes: 
“We ,must add the point that Exxaro wanted 1 300 
for 2016 supply and the times bough elsewhere has 
therefore saved Eskom XXX billions.” 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 35 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this Businessman asking for an item 
to be added what would be ultimately be your media 
statement.  
DR NGUBANE:   Well, there is a technicality there because I 
think this figure must come from Primary Energy Department. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well he does not have the figure but 
10 
what he is saying is the right figure must be added. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It must be settled.  Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think that the point that Mr Seleka is 
making is, can you see that Businessman or whoever this 
person is, is making suggestions on what points to add to 
what would ultimately be your media statement. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You accept that?  That is what he is 
20 
doing? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Then you 
have... now it is the next day.  The email above, it is on a 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 36 of 254 
 
Saturday.  Saturday, 11 June 2016 at 13:54:59.  Suzanne 
Daniels, the email address suzannedaniels584@gmail.com 
wrote... 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  “Let me know what you think.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “We do not have Exxaro volumes for 
2016 as the contract ended in 2015.”  Do you see that? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not why I though these emails were 
2015 emails.  We can just make it clear that they are 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are 2016 emails, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  I think the reason why I thought 
2015 is because we were at the beginning of Dr Ngubane’s 
evidence and 2015 was the first year at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Yes, continue Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Can you see that Dr 
20 
Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “Let me know what you think.  We do not 
Exxaro volumes for 2016 as the contract ended in 2015.”  Do 
you see that? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 37 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You appreciate the significance of that 
statement? 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not? 
DR NGUBANE:   No.  I thought it was just a statement of 
fact. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but do you appreciate the 
significance? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Businessman said:  Add something about 
Exxaro. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The volumes for 2016. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Businessman clearly has no 
knowledge that Exxaro’s contract ended in 2015 and that 
Eskom will not have volumes for Exxaro for 2016. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you knew that at the time, is it not? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, as I say, Eskom will have all the 
figures in terms of supply volume, supply agreements, you 
know. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 38 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but what I am saying is, you knew 
that at the time.   
DR NGUBANE:   Did I know it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You knew at the time what Ms Suzanne 
Daniels is conveying to Businessman.  That you would not 
have volume figures for Exxaro for 2016. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, the problem Chairperson.  You know, 
these are very specialised things.  As I say, the Primary 
Energy Department deals with coal contract, when they 
begin, when they end, the volumes, the qualities.  So one 
10 
takes for granted that what people say they know what they 
say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would your answer as at the time of 
this email you did not personally know whether the Exxaro 
contract had ended in 2015 or is the position that you were 
aware of it at the time of these emails? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I was not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not aware? 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  When... or let me ask you the 
question, otherwise I will lose the point.  Dr Ngubane, 
would... can you tell the Chairperson, would you have 
satisfied yourself prior to the release, you releasing the 
media statement of the correctness of what is contained in 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 39 of 254 
 
that statement? 
DR NGUBANE:   It is a very difficult issue Chairperson 
because I have produced a whole lot of speeches, held a 
whole lot of media statements, relying on the knowledge of 
the people who drafted the statement.   
 
When you are running a big organisation like Eskom 
which is about 36 to 40 000,00 employees and many, many 
divisions, it is very difficult to know the precise facts about 
everything.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   But in this case, you have a 
10 
person...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe let us... before you continue Mr 
Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say before you 
issued the media statement or any statement, you would at 
least take steps to do what you can to make sure what it 
says is correct?   
 
And that includes maybe if there are, if it has got parts 
that are technical, that includes talking to the technical 
20 
people to say is this correct, is this fine.   
 
So if they say to you this is fine, then you take their 
advice.  Otherwise, other matters that you can check 
yourself which do not need technical knowledge, you would 
check that yourself? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 40 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson one of Ms Daniels’ rules 
was linkages ordination and essentially... I mean, paper 
came from Treasury to buy X, Y bonds and I would not sign 
that without Ms Daniels saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is fine.   
DR NGUBANE:   ...sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   So a lot or reliance was placed on her very 
extensive knowledge of Eskom.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   In fact, this is why she was brought in my 
office to assist me.  Because there were a lot of pitfalls and 
snags and... You know this is a very bad terrain and they 
there were a lot of cases that ended up in court like 
Westinghouse 
and 
Ariva 
about 
the 
boot 
back 
steam 
generator.   
 
You know, a chairman cannot know that.  I mean, so one 
relies that her professionals who have had the statements 
and if they say it is fine, then one goes ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   I mean, even documentation from senior 
management invariable came through her and there was a 
big fight at Eskom where she filed all these documents from 
different senior managers, exports.  And one took it that if 
she says it is okay, it is okay.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 41 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, 
obviously it could be... anybody other than Ms Suzanne 
Daniels could have been assigned to assist you within 
Eskom? 
DR NGUBANE:   I did not interact with officials at Eskom 
directly except the CE.  So all these other people, when they 
wanted me to know something or ask something or intervene, 
it always came through Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what was her position in your office?  
What was her title or what was she called? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   She was the Head of the Office of the 
Chief, I mean, of the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:   Later because of her skill, when Malesela 
Phukubje retired or resigned she was made company 
secretary as well and everybody was happy with this 
because we knew her skill. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes but prior to her 
becoming the company secretary, that is the time when we 
20 
was serving in your office. 
DR NGUBANE:   She was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, she combined both work duties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, before that, before she became the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 42 of 254 
 
company secretary she started in your office. 
DR NGUBANE:   I first met her at the first tender board 
committee I chaired.  You know, when we came on board 
as non-executive directors …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I put my question differently so 
that – can I put my different differently? 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that they expedite the process.  
When Ms Daniels was assigned to you, was she the 
company secretary? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no, she was not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes, that is what I am saying to 
you.  So what I am saying to you then, is this, anybody 
could have been assigned to your office to assist you 
together than Ms Suzanne Daniels.  Suzanne 
DR NGUBANE:   I would not have agreed to anybody 
because as far as I am concerned, the people who headed 
the Chairman’s office previously under Mr Tsotsi, their 
knowledge was very doubtful.  As I was explaining, I first 
met Ms Daniels at the board tender office and she knew 
20 
everything  and warned me of all sorts of things, so I have 
confidence when it came to the fact that she must come to 
my office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, well that statement about the 
people who assisted Mr Tsotsi is quite interesting because 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 43 of 254 
 
when Ms Daniel was assigned to your office, you had only 
been there for how long?  Was that three months? 
DR NGUBANE:   No.  What, January, February, March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   March, yes, three months. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how would you have determined 
that the knowledge of the other people is doubtful in that 
period?   
DR NGUBANE:   If you check the minutes between the 9 t h, 
14 minutes, there were several meetings.  Many board 
10 
members …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is March. 
DR NGUBANE:   In March, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 2015, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Many board members complained that the 
office of the Chairperson was not responding to their 
queries.  It was a general complaint which made me  - I 
had the same complaints myself, so I knew that somewhere 
in the management of the Chairperson’s office there was 
inefficiency. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Now in regard to the publication 
of the media statements – and as I understand from you is 
that you would not verify the information yourself, you 
would rely on what you were told, is that correct? 
DR NGUBANE:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 44 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now you were a director on the board 
of Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were a director on the board of 
Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You ultimately were appointed as the 
Chairperson of that board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Acting Chairperson first and later 
Chairperson. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now how do you execute your fiduciary 
duties on the board vis-à-vis what you say was your 
reliance on the say-so of somebody giving you a draft 
media statement for you to release. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, again, Chairperson, Eskom had so 
many divisions, so many documents came to through the 
board via the company secretary’s office.  No one would 
say bring me the person that drafted this document, I want 
to question him because it was impossible to question 
technical information which might have been idea about or 
20 
a glimpse about but the final detail, this would be matched 
when we come to the TCCs.   
It was impossible to question the recommendations 
from Excos because they came with technical explanation 
why that contract could not be terminated at that time and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 45 of 254 
 
we had to mandate a continuation of the contract.   
It was typical information so although with my 
previous experience in Science and Technology I could 
question a number of things but you could not go to each 
and every division and say come here and tell me why you 
say this.  You are dependent on people who knew the 
system, 
who 
had 
direct 
linkages 
with 
the 
heads 
of 
divisions, you know, and that is how it worked, it worked on 
trust.  Let me put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you proceed, Mr Seleka, I 
10 
would like us to just deal with a certain angle of the 
statement, the draft media statement.  Now earlier on you 
spoke – you said – I think you said you assumed that 
somebody had forwarded your draft statement to Mr 
Richard Seleka, is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now that draft statement, had you 
drafted it yourself when it came into being or had Ms 
Daniels drafted it for you or had somebody else drafted it 
for you to look at an approve? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   The process was this, Chairperson.  
Media statements, there was a media division in the 
corporate sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The communications division. 
DR NGUBANE:   Communications division.  They would 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 46 of 254 
 
create the draft, hand it to Ms Daniels, if she was satisfied, 
I would then sign it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I would read it.  You know, if I did not find 
anything contentious in it, I would accept it and sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So before the communications 
team drafted a statement, I take it that there would be 
communication with you to say what is the statement going 
to be about. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe to say what point should it 
cover.  Would that be such a conversation before they 
drafted? 
DR NGUBANE:   Certainly there would be expression of 
need. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Chairman, you must respond to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Chairman, you are going to speak at 
such and such a venue, you need to say this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know, that sort of communication 
always took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. So would they identify the need for 
a media statement first and then approach you or would 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 47 of 254 
 
you identify that need and then say to them we need to 
issue a statement on this issue, please draft something or 
is 
the 
position 
that 
sometimes 
they 
would 
initiate, 
sometimes you would initiate too? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson.  At that 
stage there was a lot of press controversy about some 
payments that were made to Tegeta.  I think it must have 
been called from the Koornfontein Mine, Arnot or Majuba or 
Komati.  But there was a lot of controversy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   You know, there was a controversy about 
the quality of the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Coal. 
DR NGUBANE:   About the values and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   So there was a need to clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now – so sometimes you 
would see the need then to say to them there needs to be 
a draft statement, a draft something and let me see, is that 
right? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sometimes they would identify the need 
and communicate with your office to say the Chairperson 
needs to deal with this, we are going to draft something. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 48 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:   But in this case, if I remember well, it 
came from some discussion at the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   That we had to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   To this controversy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would they be in attendance at a 
board meeting or they would be briefed after the board if 
there was something, some media statement to be drafted? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   No, that would depend on the company 
secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the company secretary would, ja, 
they would not attend board meetings. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so in this case do you recall 
whether after the discussion of the issue at the board 
meeting do you remember whether the company secretary 
would then have been in touch with them and been in touch 
with Ms Daniels and then a draft was prepared? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Ms Daniels would have been at the 
board meeting and then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So she would know fully what 
…[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   She would know fully what was needed. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 49 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   And proceed to produce the draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  So would the case be that 
sometimes you would not even talk to the communications 
team yourself but Ms Daniels would talk to them because 
she would know exactly what had been discussed at the 
board and so on. 
DR NGUBANE:   Probably once or twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   I had a query and brought in the person 
10 
who actually wrote the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   But I think that was not more than once or 
twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Now before you became 
aware that the draft statement seems to have been sent to 
Mr Richard Seleke, had you already seen the draft 
statement or by the time you saw it, it had been sent to 
him? 
DR NGUBANE:   By the time I saw it, it is when these 
20 
emails started happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so it must have been sent to 
him before you became aware of it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Must have been ja, much earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now that this person that Ms 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 50 of 254 
 
Daniels was communicating with was Mr Richard Seleke.  
Is that something you were told by Ms Daniels or did you 
know that independently, namely that it was Mr Richard 
Seleke?  Were you told by Ms Daniels that this person that 
she was communicating with was Mr Richard Seleke? 
DR NGUBANE:   I asked, Chairperson, who was making the 
comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were asking Ms Daniels. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Then she told me it was the DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was the DG? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who at that time the DG was Mr Seleke.  
Okay, alright.  And you were comfortable with that. 
DR NGUBANE:   I was quite comfortable, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, but does that mean that it 
would have been sent to the DG by Ms Daniels or could it 
have been sent by the communications team of Eskom? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I do not think the communications 
20 
team with Eskom ever corresponded with the DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it must be …[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   Must have been Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Daniels, yes.  Would there have been 
some discussion between yourself and Ms Daniels before 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 51 of 254 
 
this which would have made her comfortable to send your 
draft media statement to Mr Seleke without clearing that 
with you first?  Why would she send your statement to 
somebody outside of Eskom without you knowing? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, there was a lot of communication 
between this Ms Daniels and DPE, different levels of 
officials.  It was an accepted fact that there was this 
communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had no problem with it once it came 
to your attention. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she might have known that you 
would not have a problem. 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely.  Otherwise, Chairperson, we 
would not have been able to run Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, my own – one of my concerns 
is why the DG of the DPE must get involved in how Eskom 
media statements must read?  Eskom is a separate entity 
and the board is running Eskom, why must he get so 
involved in that, the board must be able to make its own 
20 
decisions right or wrong, run the business, why must it look 
like he was macro-managing the Chairperson? 
DR NGUBANE:   Again, Chairperson, this is a difficult – I 
agree with you, in a normal company this would not 
happen. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 52 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But there was so much pressure from the 
war room, from the Minister, from the DG himself to be kept 
informed about everything we did, particularly as is related 
to the public because ultimately it involved them in 
answering about our actions.  So I was not averse to them 
taking interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I can understand up to a certain 
level just getting informed, I am just concerned where it 
goes beyond getting informed, getting to a point where 
10 
they say no, no, your media statement must contain this 
point, contain that point, half a page, not the full page of 
whatever. I am getting concerned when it gets to that. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, probably let me just go to the issue 
of the media statement by Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Mr Tsotsi’s defence of himself was that 
what 
he 
wrote 
before 
I 
get 
it 
to 
DPE 
and 
the 
communications people in DPE advised him to change 
certain parts of the statement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So it was the normal …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I would be concerned even with 
him doing that, so it is not about the person, it is just 
about the  practice.  But I think the point you are making 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 53 of 254 
 
is, you know, you were not the first one to do it, he did it 
as well, maybe in the context in which it happened with all 
the pressure from the war room and DPE, you know, there 
did not seem to be anything wrong with it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, one wants to work in peace. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I should not put out a statement and DPE 
comes on me and say why did you do this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well you just referred to Mr Tsotsi 
now about his own media statement and the input that he 
10 
said DPE put – made his statement when we are talking 
about the input that you say Mr Seleke was making to your 
media statement.  I must say that when you say one wants 
to work in peace, Mr Tsotsi also talked about trying to work 
in peace within – I think it is something [indistinct] 17.55. 
DR NGUBANE:   Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think maybe we should take the tea 
break.  Let us take the tea break, it is nearly twenty five 
past, we will resume at twenty to twelve. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just before I let you continue Mr 
Seleka, 
Dr 
Ngubane 
are 
we 
agreed 
that 
whoever 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 54 of 254 
 
Businessman is, he is making a contribution to how your 
media statement will end up looking like? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Dr Ngubane 
you say you could not yourself verify the information given 
to you, you relied on those who gave it to you? 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct, it is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, now you are inside Eskom, 
Businessman is outside of Eskom but he comments on the 
10 
factual details even to the minute details regarding the 
volumes in relation to the supply by Exxaro, how is he able 
to do that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well there are probably different levels to 
this answer, because he can communicate directly with 
heads of divisions, but every quarter when we compile the 
shareholder report a lot of annexures are put in those 
reports, relating to each division at Eskom.  So the DPE 
has an extensive record of the work at Eskom, I mean for 
instance the Minister was complaining about the pricing of 
20 
coal and diesel, she complained about some suppliers of 
coal getting paid more money while others were getting 
paid less, that was a lot of detail that she had and I will 
take it that these reports were sent through she actually 
reads and I would assume also the DG actually reads them.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 55 of 254 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
so 
what 
you 
see 
from 
Businessman’s email is details about quantities, what 
Exxaro wanted and he is helping you to put that in your 
own statement, how come that you cannot do it yourself 
with Ms Daniels, why do you need him to suggest that that 
be inserted in your statement. 
DR NGUBANE:   As I said Chairperson there is a lot of 
information that goes to the DPE, so I can’t ask – answer 
precisely why he would have such information, but I do 
know that I get information on coal quantities, on who got 
10 
what tender, and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But my question is different, my 
question is why do you need his input, the information you 
say he has comes from Eskom, it comes from you. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you first have it before he has it, 
you have first hand information, he has second hand 
information, why do you need him to tell you what you need 
to say with your own information. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well probably I was not comprehensive 
20 
enough in terms of reading every document thoroughly, but 
I did try my best to go through every document, one would 
sleep at one o’clock, two o’clock preparing for Board 
meetings with reports from all sorts of sectors of Eskom.  
You know it is quite possible not to know everything on 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 56 of 254 
 
your fingertips. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Mr Seleka’s point might not just 
be about you but maybe about those within Eskom who had 
a contribution to make to your statement and therefore the 
question being since they know the information, Ms Daniels 
for example, and I assume the communications team, you 
now, but at least Ms Daniels you know, one would have 
thought that if someone like the DG of DPE was to have a 
look at the media statement before it went out it would be 
on the basis that he would have a look and really see 
10 
whether there was really anything out of the extraordinary 
otherwise leave it to the Eskom personnel to put into the 
statement what they believe should be put in and not to try 
and now get so involved in the content of the statement, do 
you understand what I mean, because the team at Eskom 
he would be expected to assume know what they are doing, 
they have got the technical expertise, so they will put in 
their statement if they shared it with him.   
 
They would have a look not with a view to getting 
so involved in what it says but have a look and say is there 
20 
something that is out of the ordinary that might not be 
okay, otherwise leave it to Eskom to issue a statement that 
they are happy with.  You understand? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chairperson but I think Ms 
Daniels corrected him.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 57 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   You know about this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   So I presume that was normal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  So Dr 
Ngubane this you say is the first email communication 
between – from Eskom, yourself Ms Suzanne Daniels and 
Businessman?     
DR NGUBANE:   I do not recall other emails.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no I heard you earlier saying this 
is the first communication as you were going into it, which 
is attached as BSN38 to your affidavit.   
DR NGUBANE:   Where as I say I do not remember their 
communication? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me help you there.  Go to the 
second bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is Eskom bundle 09B.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
was 
going 
to 
place 
it…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is better to call it like that otherwise 
when you say second bundle whoever reads the transcript 
then one does which one is first bundle, which one is 
second bundle.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you were a step ahead of me 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 58 of 254 
 
DCJ.  On page 761.6, 761.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   769?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   761 Chairperson point 6.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh 761.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  There is an email …[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay 761 point?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   6.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Point 6, okay.  The emails we were 
dealing with earlier where June 2016.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   2016. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   These emails are September 2015, a 
year before and the one at the bottom of the page Dr 
Ngubane 
it 
is 
an 
exchange 
of 
an 
email 
between 
Businessman dated 28 September 2015 and that email is 
specifically addressed to yourself, subject forward for 
Chairpersons, so documents as discussed.  Do you see 
that?    
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, I see that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay at page 761.6 the bottom email 
20 
comes 
from 
Businessman 
it 
is 
addressed 
to 
“to 
Dr 
Ngubane” it is dated the 28 September 2015 at 04:41pm 
and the subject is for Chairpersons and then it says serve 
documents as discussed.  Do you remember that email Dr 
Ngubane?    
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 59 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I was not presented with this email 
when I met with the investigators.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
DR NGUBANE:   So I did not search for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but from your as you see it, it does 
not ring a bell? 
DR NGUBANE:   No I do not know what documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might have received, you might not 
have received you just did not get a chance to search and 
check?   
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
DR NGUBANE:   And above that is from Suzanne Daniels 
to me a Round Robin resolution document.  I presume this 
is the document that is referred to below.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the one above that seems to be 
from you to Ms Suzanne Daniels.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is dated 28 September 2015 at 
5:23pm so it came after the one that we have referred to 
20 
that came from Businessman and was addressed to you 
and it simply says sent from my Samsung device.  And I 
suspect that that means 
you sent – well you sent 
something, maybe you sent something with the email to Ms 
Suzanne Daniels maybe it was the same documents that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 60 of 254 
 
Businessman sent to you.  
DR NGUBANE:   It could be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it could be but you cannot remember 
not having had the chance to check.  
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well on the understanding that you 
said 
the 
person 
who 
was 
using 
this 
email 
address 
Businessman was Mr Richard Seleke.  So where it says 
serve documents as discussed so that would suggest that 
you had had a discussion with Businessman before he sent 
10 
these document but I take it you might not recall.    
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not having checked.   
DR NGUBANE:   I would have to check. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka.  
DR NGUBANE:   But I am not sure if I will be able to check 
and get it now but anyway probably Ms Daniels might give 
...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Ms Daniels might be able to clarify.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us do this Chairperson, thank you 
Chair.   Dr Ngubane let me assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.   
ADV 
MKHABELA:   
Mr 
Chairman if I may 
without 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 61 of 254 
 
interrupting the flow of Mr Seleka’s evidence as you will be 
aware, we have prepared a comprehensive affidavit which 
includes in it various annexures and we came here on the 
understanding that that will be the evidence that we will be 
going through.  The documents that have just been referred 
to now for instance we have not have sight of them and as 
I sit here I do not have accesses to that documentation. 
So it hinders my ability to provide proper legal 
advice to Dr Ngubane.  I do not know if it is not 
possible...[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure arrangements can be made   
ADV MKHABELA:   For Mr Seleka to at least provide us 
copies of the additional bundle that he seems to be 
referring to which we have not had sight of which we had 
not seen.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV MKHABELA:   So we are able to follow the 
proceedings 
and 
possibly 
be 
able 
to 
assist 
the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is fine, Mr Seleka.    
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, we could share with 
the legal representative of Dr Ngubane a copy that my 
junior has. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well a copy should have been provided 
to Dr Ngubane’s lawyers of everything so that we are all 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 62 of 254 
 
speaking, using the same documents.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A full set of the bundles should have 
been made available to them as well.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the bundle is not an additional 
bundle it is what the document office has regularised in 
order to separate what was one bundle into two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so Dr Ngubane will have exactly 
what I have and what you and have Chairperson.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well can somebody and your junior 
arrange 
with 
somebody 
to 
identify 
exactly 
what 
Dr 
Ngubane’s lawyers do not have.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And copies can be made available even 
if we are not going to stop the proceedings but maybe by, 
depending on how many documents there are maybe in an 
hours’ time they might be available.  Can somebody work 
on that.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I will ask one of my investigators 
20 
to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so they will try and make a plan to 
make copies available to you. 
ADV MKHABELA:   Thank you Mr Chairman might I clarify 
though that we do not have anything except for the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 63 of 254 
 
affidavit that we deposed to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that so? 
ADV MKHABELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I think that you ought to at least 
well Mr Seleka might be able to say but whether they are 
given and they make copies for themselves from what you 
have or whether the Commission makes copies for them.  
So it maybe that the Commission does not make copies for 
them because that can be quite expensive and the 
Commission does not have money but if the bundles are 
10 
made available, they are requested to make copies for 
themselves I am sure that will not be a problem.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair.  
ADV LESLIE MKHABELA:   Even if I may Chair even an 
electronic version so that we are able to follow the 
proceedings without delaying …[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay that should be attempted.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we will do it right away Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, then Dr Ngubane I was saying let 
20 
me assist and I approached the documents from the point 
of view that you would be familiar with the documentation.  
If you turn to page 761.9 it is those 761.9 please assist Dr 
Ngubane, 761.9.   
          That is Eskom bundle 09(B).  It is that same email 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 64 of 254 
 
which is the second, you have got two emails one at the 
top and one below.  The one below from Businessman 
dated 28 September 2015, 4:41pm and it is addressed to 
yourself dalton.ngubane subject is the same forward for 
Chairpersons, serve documents as attached.   
Now the document is on the flip side if you turn to 
page 761.10.  It is dated well in brackets there is a 
company logo 28 September reference number Round 
Robin B1, 28 September 2015 the board, attention Dear 
members.  So they are drafting this document for the Board 
10 
to say urgent request to approve the suspension of 
contract they say contact, it is contract, and or commercial 
relationship with Mail and Guardian, City Pres and Sunday 
Times on a Round Robin.  This is the draft document that 
gets to be sent to you.          
DR NGUBANE:   Now I remember.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now you remember.  
DR NGUBANE:   I have not seen this document before that 
came from the investigators.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
20 
DR NGUBANE:   But this document was circulated to 
Transnet as well.  I am not sure about the other SOE’s 
which came from the department which asked us to seize 
contact with these publications until they could justify what 
they were saying about us.  So Transnet would have had 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 65 of 254 
 
the same document and indeed I took it to the board and 
we did issue a document distancing ourselves from these 
public issues.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but then let us go back to 
page…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well before you go back.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Ngubane that is worrying to me, that 
is worrying.  The entity the board are supposed to make 
their own decisions.  If some media houses say things 
10 
about Eskom it is supposed to be Eskom who decides how 
to deal with it.  It is not somebody else, not the department 
which is supposed to tell the Board how to handle Eskom 
affairs or relations with media houses.   
          So it worries me if the department says to you as 
Eskom Board distance yourself from these people.  Why 
are they getting so involved you are supposed to run the 
business of Eskom as the board yourselves.  They are 
supposed, I mean the board members get appointed by the 
Minister subjected to their cabinet approval I guess and so 
20 
and so and they are supposed to appoint people in whom 
they have confidence that these people can handle these 
matters on their own.   
          So why are they making decisions as to what you 
should do, what you should not do?            
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 66 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson we are a young 
democracy and there is a lot of hand holding between 
government and the institutions.  In any democratic 
transition the elite, that is the leadership in government 
guides 
the 
process. 
I 
am 
sure 
if 
one 
examined 
departmental relationships with any of their SOE’s you 
would find that there is a lot of involvement of the 
department in the SOE’s and I think this is inevitable in the 
transition phase in which we are going through.  For 
instance, I wanted pension conditions at Eskom changed.  
10 
Before 1994 when a person had served five years he was 
added five years to make ten years.  So that he could 
retire at fifty, having done five years but be given ten years 
to get additional benefits.  That was Eskom policy.  If the 
widow of a deceased Eskom employee or at a particular 
level whether it is F-Band or E-Band it could remain in the 
Eskom house permanently.   
          Those were benefits that were there before 1994, 
nobody in government or in the department bothered to 
change those arrangements.  So a lot of policies, benefits 
20 
and arrangements come from the past.  So this type of 
hand holding becomes acceptable in that context.  We do 
not as boards say department you cannot tell us XYZ 
probably Malesela Phukubje, who was company secretary 
at this time might clarify how all this came about.                 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 67 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair your microphone is off.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I normally remind other 
people.  So I am saying what you have just said does not 
dispel my concern that the board I would imagine had men 
and woman of diverse experiences.  Some of whom I would 
imagine had very high academic qualifications.  You 
yourself have been a Minister in the first democratic 
government 
under 
President 
Mandela, 
you 
mentioned 
Minister of Science of Technology for a number of years, 
you had been Premier of Kwazulu Natal, you had been an 
10 
ambassador, you had been Chairperson of the SABC board.  
Why must they think they cannot leave you to make your 
own decisions?       
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson I was also – while I was 
Chairperson of SABC, I was also a Chairperson of the Land 
Bank.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   And in all those instances one wanted to 
change practices and policies but it was difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
20 
DR NGUBANE:   You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it must be this attitude on the part of 
government departments I mean if I had – if I found myself 
in a position where I had to appoint somebody who had 
been Premier of a province, who have been a Minister, who 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 68 of 254 
 
had been an ambassador I imagine that I would say this 
person knows what he is doing I do not have to bother.  As 
long as he knows the parameters, I leave things to him.   
          So why would the department want to, maybe micro 
manage is a wrong word but they want to say you must 
make a decision that you want nothing to do with the City 
Press, you want to have nothing to do with the Sunday 
Times or whatever the publications are.  I mean you can 
make you own decisions about that, that is not something 
technical, it does not need a genius, it is something that 
10 
you can see how they have behaved towards Eskom or 
towards the board.  You can see what they have published, 
you can make your own decisions.  Do we ask for a 
meeting with the editors of these publications and have a 
constructive engagement or call them to account?   
          Do we report them to the relevant institutions or do 
we say we boycott them; we do not buy their papers or 
whatever.  You can make those decisions yourself why 
must somebody prepare statements to say this is what you 
must decide.  That is what I have a problem with because 
20 
one 
is 
not 
dealing 
here 
with 
people 
who 
have 
no 
experience.             
DR NGUBANE:   Well I agree Chairperson, fully agree with 
you.  But the reality is if the department takes the attitude 
that alright we let you lose, see to everything yourself. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 69 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  That will be very hard for the Board and the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  You know.  But I agree with what you are 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because you see I think the kind of 
independence I know it will not be complete independence 
but the kind of independence that the Board is supposed to 
have from the department ought to be such that it should 
10 
instil confidence even in the public that it is the Board that is 
in charge of Eskom it is not the department.  You know.  And 
this kind of communication where they seem to say this is 
the decision you must make about City Press and about 
Sunday Times does not instil that confidence you know.  
Because one says, of all matters that must be the easiest for 
them to handle. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
DR NGUBANE:  Probably we become cowards Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. And Dr Ngubane 
as you said the same last statement was sent to Transnet, 
Denel and Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry, sorry. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 70 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  No I am sure about Transnet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Transnet. 
DR NGUBANE:  I suspect Denel also. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see Denel on page 761.11.  It is a – 
where there is a resolve of that.  Denel/Eskom hereby 
suspend any dealings by placing advertising and so on.  But 
you say Eskom distanced itself from this. 
DR NGUBANE:  No Chair we took a resolution they 
implemented it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They implemented it. 
DR NGUBANE:  They implemented it ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is the resolution on page 761.7?  
If you turn the page back. 
DR NGUBANE:  Back.   
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Urgent 
request 
to 
approve 
the 
suspension of contact in any form whatsoever and or 
commercial relationship with [00:02:20] and Denton. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes that is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja page 761 is Resolution of the Board 
directors of Eskom Holdings.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean somebody who is – who does not 
sit in meetings of the Board is basically dictating what 
decisions the Board must take in this.  That is what is 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 71 of 254 
 
happening.  You understand? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think it is wrong.  If you want to 
influence what decisions the Board takes be a member of the 
Board.  Come inside transparently like everybody.  Be a 
member of the Board and influence but if you are not part of 
the Board do not sit somewhere and then dictate what the 
Board should decide.  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr Ngubane the other 
point is this and I think I shared this with you during the 
consultation.  These emails exchanged in September 2015 – 
September 2015. Mr Richard Seleke was appointed at the 
DPE only on 27 November 2015 and the Fundudzi Report 
finds that.  He is a month later appointed as the DG I think 
you said at the DPE.  So my question is who would you have 
discussed this draft with?  The Businessman who says 
documents as discussed.  Who is this man? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should – maybe you should put 
20 
it this way Mr Seleka I am sorry I am [mumbling]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not a problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what Mr Seleka is saying to you Dr 
Ngubane is you said that – well you said that this 
Businessman was Mr Richard Seleke and when you – but 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 72 of 254 
 
when you said that I think we were talking about the 2016 
emails.  Now what Mr Seleka is putting to you is that in 20 – 
in September 2015 you are – there is communication with 
Businessman and he says:  it cannot be that they are coming 
from DPE because Mr Seleka is not in DPE at that stage.  
What do you say to that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think I said Mr Seleka instead 
of Mr Seleke. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are forgiven Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are quite tolerant because… 
DR NGUBANE:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When somebody says Zonde to me I am 
not so tolerant.    
DR NGUBANE:  Well you know Chairperson in fact I have 
never gone around looking at those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So you… 
DR NGUBANE:  I am trying to locate correspondence from 
the DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  To Mr Brian Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because that will also confirm then what is 
being put before me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About his appointment? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 73 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no it was about the relationship with 
Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:  It says the DG wrote Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Brian about how we must conduct that 
relationship.  I was trying to look at that letter to sort of 
check the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:  And time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  But are you able to accept that 
Mr Richard Seleke was not at DPE in September 2015 or is 
that something you are not sure about? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I have not thought about that.  I 
prepared to accept – I said I had not thought about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  But I am prepared to accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To accept ja.  Yes okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then Dr Ngubane I – I wanted you to 
assist the Chairperson because the Businessman is writing 
20 
as discussed.  Who did you discuss with prior to the email of 
28 September being sent to you? 
DR NGUBANE:  As I say probably the company secretary 
can clarify this because I did not have a discussion on this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because that email of 28 September 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 74 of 254 
 
which is exchanged at 4:41 pm only the two of you feature in 
that email – is the Businessman and yourself.  An email 
comes from the Businessman and it is addressed to you.  
The company secretary is not copied in that email.  In fact at 
5:23 pm you forward that email to the company secretary the 
same day 28 September 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well 
do 
we 
know 
what 
documents 
Businessman is referring to there because it may be that 
when Dr Ngubane looks at those documents, he might recall 
who it is he may have discussed them with. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is the one we have already referred to 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At 761.7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 7 – well that is the Board Resolution 
that comes – that is a copy and paste of the document at 
761.10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  761.10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So those are the documents that… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Those are the documents. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are referring to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand that Dr Ngubane which 
documents they – this is referring to? 
DR NGUBANE:  I do Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 75 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  But there was a memorandum from the 
company secretary on this very issue of putting an end and 
you know unfortunately I would have looked for that if I had 
known about this initially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because it would then clarify  
CHAIRPERSON:  Help you ja.  Well I am – that is what I am 
thinking about I just want to make sure that what you have 
helps you to remember maybe the context and then you can 
10 
remember who it is you may have had a discussion with 
about these documents. 
DR NGUBANE:  As I say Chairperson I do not remember 
discussing this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Apart from forwarding it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  And also getting a memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  So I would need to … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: To see the memo. 
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The memo would have come from Ms 
Daniels to you? 
DR NGUBANE:  The memo would have come from the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 76 of 254 
 
company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the company secretary. 
DR NGUBANE:  And I think at that time it was Malesela 
Phukubje. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay and it was – the memo related to 
these documents. 
DR NGUBANE:  It was about this whole issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Well if we do not have a copy of 
that memo we must try and get it.  If we do let us go to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not think we have Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and maybe Ms Daniels might assist in 
getting it if… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes [00:10:50]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Actually Chairperson I think it was before 
Ms Daniels time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so. 
DR NGUBANE:  You know it is all confusing here because 
there is also an email to Ms Daniels but you know or it was 
during the transition, I am not sure. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay because that certainly does 
appear that you forwarded the documents to Ms Daniels. 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  But is there a possibility that 
these documents may not have come from Mr Richard Seleke 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 77 of 254 
 
coming through Businessman if – if Mr Richard Seleke was 
not at DPE in September 2015 is there a possibility that they 
may not have come from him – they may have come from 
somebody else? 
DR NGUBANE:  Very possible Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is quite possible. 
DR NGUBANE:  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you cannot recall who it might be. 
DR NGUBANE:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is – is the position that the only 
10 
person you dealt with who used this email Businessman was 
Mr Seleke 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
DR NGUBANE:  Thank you.  So Dr Ngubane if that is to be 
accepted that means Dr – Dr – Mr Seleke, Richard Seleke 
would have had an interest in Eskom even before going to 
the DPE. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I am not sure in what position he was 
in before becoming DG of Eskom.  But depending on he 
20 
was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he was at Transnet.  I am basing 
what I am saying on other documents that I have seen in the 
commission.  If I am not mistaken, I think he – he was a 
member of the Transnet Board or maybe he was not a 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 78 of 254 
 
member of the Board at Transnet maybe he was employed 
but I think he was at Transnet before he got appointed as DG 
of DPE.  So I think when he went to DPE he went there to 
take the position of Director General. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That seems to be correct Chair.  I 
understand he was prior to that a Board member at Transnet 
until appointed as the DG – as a DG at DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In November 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I can only speculate Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Well it would be necessary 
that Dr Ngubane obtains whatever documents he may be 
able to obtain that might enable him to be more helpful in 
regard to this.  So ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  That will be in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Dr Ngubane you are aware of that 
disciplinary hearing against Ms Suzanne Daniels that she 
20 
was by Eskom subjected to disciplinary action. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And that she found guilty? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And on this very aspect of infoportal 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266

email address that she was found guilty. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For having shared documentation with 
the Businessman? 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Were you still at Eskom at the time 
of her disciplinary action? 
DR NGUBANE:  No – I think I had left Eskom.  I left Eskom 
in June 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  17. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the Chairperson of the disciplinary 
hearing found that the probabilities that the email belongs to 
Mr Salim Essa and not Richard Seleke.  You aware of that 
ruling? 
DR NGUBANE:  I saw a bit of that report but she had said at 
that commission – that inquiry that the Businessman address 
belonged to the DG.  But the Chairperson of the inquiry said 
he doubted that.  But he did not say or identify who exactly 
these emails belong to. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well according to the ruling she did.  In 
fact according to the ruling she says you told her the email 
address belongs to Mr Richard Seleke. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I – I – probably my representative Mr 
Mkhabela might deal with that issue. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 80 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us – I just want to make 
sure.  Mr Seleka you – Seleka you were saying Ms Daniels 
according to the ruling of the disciplinary Chairperson – the 
Chairperson of the Disciplinary Hearing recorded that Ms 
Daniels said she heard from Dr Ngubane that that email 
address was for Mr Seleke. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Dr Ngubane you say you are aware 
that that is what the Chairperson of the inquiry – of the 
hearing found? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are aware of that. 
DR NGUBANE:  I am aware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I think what Mr Seleka was 
doing was to give you an opportunity to comment on the 
statement by Ms Daniels to the Disciplinary Hearing to say 
20 
she heard from you that this email address was for Mr 
Seleke.  I do remember that earlier on you said she was the 
one who told you. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that is the position as far as you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 81 of 254 
 
are concerned, she told you. 
DR NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes.  And she – she 
had recorded to have said you told her that in April 2015 
about the time she started working with you.  April 2015.  
Now that is way before June 2016.  Do you have any 
comment on that Dr Ngubane. 
DR NGUBANE:  Are you asking about the time when she 
came to my office? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No about the time according to the 
Chairperson of the Disciplinary Hearing you would have told 
Ms Daniels whose email address infoportal belonged to. 
DR NGUBANE:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it is dated they say – they place it 
somewhere in April 2015. 
DR NGUBANE:  No Chairperson it cannot be true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Is the position that you never  
told her that this email address belonged to Mr Seleke at any 
time whether it was April 2015 or September 2015 or 2016 
20 
you never told her that? 
DR NGUBANE:  No, no Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You heard from her. 
DR NGUBANE:  I heard from her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 82 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Now Dr Ngubane please turn 
to page 761.19.  Page 761.19.  There is again the second 
email there coming from Businessman.  This is 10 December 
2015 that is addressed to not yourself but to Matshela2010.  
What – do you see that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes I can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  The focus for present purposes is 
on the contents of the email.  It seems to relate to Tegeta 
two pager between Tegeta and Eskom salient points. Eskom 
will provide bank guarantee for R1.68 billion.  So now 
10 
Businessman is writing to Mr – what it appears to be Mr 
Matshela Koko and bullet points dealing with matters relating 
to Tegeta.  And the one-point R1.68 billion which you of then 
deal with in your affidavit.  You see that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Certainly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And at the top of the page it seems to be 
an email from Matshela2010 – Matshela2020@yahoo.com  
December 2015 time stamp is 7:31 and is a forward to Ms 
Suzanne Daniels – two pager.  You also see that? 
DR NGUBANE:  I see that. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does this ring any bell with you?  Does it 
remind you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Seleka should you not read that 
email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 83 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  First or ask Dr Ngubane to read – maybe 
you can read it.  So that we – the context. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is understood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So the subject is two pager.  Now 
that is the second of the two emails.  The one below. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The subject to pager.   
“Two pager between Tegeta and Eskom Salient 
Points. 
10 
1. Eskom will provide bank guarantee for R1.68 
billion. CP for release is Section 11 approval 
from 
DMR 
competitions 
commission 
approval. 
2. Tegeta will supply from OCM – “ 
I believe that is Optimum Coal Mine – is that correct Mr 
Ngubane – Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
• “As a contract but for the twelve months pre-
20 
payment January 2016 to January 2017 will 
give a 5% discount off the R154.00. 
• Tegeta will supply from Koornfontein as per 
contract for same period at the original 
R380.00 not the requested increase tariff. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 84 of 254 
 
• At end of each month starting end February 
2016 Eskom shall deduct R140 million from 
amounts due to recoup the R1.68 billion. 
• Tegeta 
receiving 
a 
pre-payment 
for 
two 
months supply but Eskom can use monies 
owed from all three mines [Brandfontein] 
also to recoup the R140 million a month. 
• Therefore if Tegeta does not deliver full 
volume from OCM or Kroon I believe that 
should be Kroonfontein the payments due 
10 
for Brakfontein can be [00:23:43]. 
• Any amounts due over the R140 million for 
each month shall be payable to Tegeta Two 
pager almost as addendum to the supplier 
contracts.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is an email from Businessman to 
Matshela2010 is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how it is written? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Matshela2010 and you said you think that 
it must have been directed at Mr Matshela Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which… 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 85 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which Mr Matshela – which the email 
address matshela2010@yahoo.com forwards to Ms Suzanne 
Daniels at the top of the page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me ask this question before you ask 
your next question Mr Seleka.  If the person using this 
business – this email address Businessman and infoportal or 
whatever is a government official such as would be a DG 
why would he consistently in these emails using an email 
address other than his or her official government email 
10 
address?  So that question arises to me I do not know – do 
you note that Dr Ngubane that it seems that consistently he 
is never using a government official email address he is 
always using this address? 
DR NGUBANE:  I see that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  However people use different addresses at 
times.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I accept that and it may well be that in 
terms of what we have seen the emails that we have seen 
20 
them coming from this maybe we have not seen enough to be 
able to say he never uses an official address.  But it is a 
little of concern that – I mean you were saying that with 
regard to yours some would be on Eskom email address 
others on your private email address depending on whether 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 86 of 254 
 
you at the office or whatever I am not sure when you were 
sending the email. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well that would be concerning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because this is an official … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes this is official. 
DR NGUBANE:  Discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  You know. But I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  I cannot second guess. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And because right now is really 
going into very serious details about some transactions. 
DR NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you see also for me another 
question would be why would the DG of DPE get involved in 
such details on transactions between Eskom and whoever?  
Because that – that seems to me it would be too much.  It is 
like – it is like he has a specific interest.  I mean does he 
have a department to run to get involved into these types of 
20 
details when Eskom and you were saying just a while ago it 
is an entity that has got thousands and thousands of 
employees.  It has got high ranking executives, officials who 
have the technical knowledge.  Why would the DG get – get 
himself to be involved in these types of details? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 87 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson as I said the company 
secretary kept a file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  In her office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Of all correspondence that she brought to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  Now I am not sure if this would be there but 
I do not remember seeing this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember seeing this? 
DR NGUBANE:  No 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  But would you – if it was the 
DG of DMR who sent this would you also be quite surprised 
that he would be getting so involved?  Or would that not 
surprise you? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well the DG of DMR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry DPE. 
DR NGUBANE:  Oh DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  I would not expect this detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would expect this detail? 
DR NGUBANE:  I would not expect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not expect this? 
DR NGUBANE:  Such detail. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 88 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes 
DR NGUBANE:  Other than probably giving a guideline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now Dr Ngubane would you even 
expect the intervention at this particular level from the DG of 
DPE?  Would she tell you the terms on which Eskom should 
contract with Tegeta?  Let alone the details but just getting 
involved even … 
DR NGUBANE:  Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the slightest? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, again Chairperson.  Normally I would 
not expect this.  But as they say, things happen differently.  
For instance, the motivation for prepayment to optimum coal 
mine was supported by the DG of Mineral Resources.  I 
mean, this was a direct involvement in a coal supply issue at 
Eskom.  So while one does not expect this level of 
involvement, it does happen sometime.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And then, Dr Ngubane 
the details in that email.  I mean, we know that the board 
had taken a resolution to do a prepayment in Tegeta. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that was ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Tegeta to OCM? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 89 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And the figure was exactly this 
R 1,68 billion? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we understand that the payment was 
subsequently converted into a guarantee. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
You 
have 
explained 
in 
your 
supplementary 
affidavit, 
you 
were 
not 
involved. 
 The 
guarantee decision did not come to the board. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But your involvement as the board was 
to resolve to make a prepayment? 
DR NGUBANE:   A prepayment to buy coal from OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   In fact, Chairperson, the MOI for Eskom 
has not allowed the issuing of bank guarantees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And... well, in your affidavit, I think you 
have subsequently clarified that, in your affidavit you had 
said: 
20 
“The R 1,68 billion guarantee was approved by the 
board during December 2015.  I do not have copies 
of the report but served before the board not the 
minutes of the meeting.”   
 
I am reading from your affidavit. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 90 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But I believe you have clarified the 
issue of the guarantee and the issue of the prepayment 
approval.  Is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:   I was concerned with that statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because it was information given to me.  So 
when I checked, you know, my statement to parliament which 
had been prepared by officials, I checked that... I found that 
Eskom Treasury had actually given the guarantee to ABSA 
10 
but that had never come to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the board would have been against 
that because MOI does not allow, is that right?  Is that what 
you are talking about a minute ago? 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  But the officials would have 
known that as well, is it not? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the MOI, what the MOI allowed and 
what it did not allow? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, the company secretary who is a 
custodian of governance would definitely have known it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, I think the 
Chairperson has already raised what would have been my 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 91 of 254 
 
next question.  The point being, that you see somebody from 
outside of Eskom, because this become ultimately the 
decision within Eskom, dictating the terms of what ultimately 
becomes that decision.  But the Chairperson has already 
raised it with you.  That is a concern. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You understand. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I went out of sequence then Dr 
Ngubane because of the issue of the boards being a Gupta 
board and that is what took us to that process.  You see that 
creates that impression. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so members of the public reads 
20 
these things and become concern.  Now let me to your 
service on the board, December 2014 and the events that 
followed after that.  I mean, we have heard ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 92 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe... I mean you already asked Dr 
Ngubane to explain his relationship with Mr Salim Essa.  I 
think that we must get out of the way the part of his evidence 
that relates to his relationship with the Guptas.  So I think 
to...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...analyse that part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to talk on that issue, Dr 
Ngubane, your relationship with the Gupta Family? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you speak in your affidavit, you deal 
with it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I am talking about.  Ja.  How 
you came to know them and ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I came to know members of the Gupta 
Family particularly people who were working on the New Age 
newspaper because SABC was broadcasting the breakfast 
meetings which were arranged by TMA.  And as chairman I 
20 
was to attend quite a number of those breakfast meetings.   
 
And I was seated at the same time with Mr Howa, Mr 
Williams who was the editor at TMA, New Age.  And some of 
the Gupta family members.  That was the more frequent, you 
know ...[intervenes]  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 93 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Encounter with them. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...encounter with them.  But there would 
also be social events at their home, at hotels.  For instance, 
the... what was it?  The presentation of the Person of the 
Year.  They had that programme where Ms Thuli Madonsela 
won the award.   
 
So there were events like and I used to get invited and 
attend.  And there was also the wedding at Sun City.  I got 
invited.  I attended.   
 
It was that sort of social level, engagement.  I mean, I 
10 
did not interact with them in any business way, particularly, 
because I had nothing to do with issuing of contract or any 
other such issues.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, in your affidavit you also said you 
got invited to their residence. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And sometimes you went there. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. Are you able to recall how many times 
you might have been to their home?  Obviously, if it is... I do 
20 
not want necessarily the exact number.  You might say it is a 
few times or you might say it is a number of times.  You 
might say it were many times. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I would say a number of times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A number of times? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 94 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Because the relationship as well was at 
SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So it was over a period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A period? 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Yes, Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Dr Ngubane, 
you were also saying in your affidavit that you have travelled 
to Dubai three or four times but never at the expense of the 
10 
Guptas. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I did a number of trips offices.  
Official trips were booked by the office with SABC and when 
I was at Eskom.  And I always travelled for official work on 
SAA.  But when I travelled to Europe or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Unofficial business. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...Japan for private business, I always use 
Emirates because they were the cheapest of all the airlines 
at that time.  And if... invariable you went to Dubai and then 
reconnect from Dubai to your travel destination.  And that 
20 
was my association with the trips to Dubai because it is a 
transit route.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were not... are you saying to the 
Chairperson, you were not going to Dubai here because that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 95 of 254 
 
explanation is not given that Dubai was just a transit.  You 
are saying you travelled... oh, sorry.  You used the word.  I 
beg your pardon.   
 
You used the word I travelled through Dubai three or 
four times.  Are you saying to the Chairperson you are not 
visiting the Gupta brothers in Dubai? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson.  I did not even go to do 
shopping in Dubai which a lot of people do.  It was to pass 
through.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then your relationship with Mr Nazeem 
10 
Howa? 
DR NGUBANE:   It was a good relationship because he was 
a journalist.  You know, he was the one who was linking 
SABC 
with 
the 
programmes 
of 
TMA, 
you 
know, 
the 
broadcast.  He was one at the forefront.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but what was your relationship with 
him? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it became friendly in the sense that 
we were in the almost similar institutions, media institutions.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the reason we are asking that and 
20 
you will recall the reason why? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You remember? 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because he sent an email in which he 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 96 of 254 
 
draft a statement.  That becomes your media release 
regarding Mr Tsotsi’s resignation. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.  Well, Chairperson I have been 
through that with the investigators  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I never ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You have to bring that through me. 
[laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   I mean, I never saw the speech that was 
alleged to have been made by Mr Howa because my speech 
10 
came as usual from the media section.  So I, I mean, unless 
I see both and compare them ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...I will not really be able to tell which was 
which. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the allegation that the speech that you 
ultimately made or statement that you ultimately issued, was 
the same as the one that it is alleged Mr Howa prepared in a 
sense true? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the allegation? 
DR NGUBANE:   That was the question Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but nobody has shown you both? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka, do we have 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 97 of 254 
 
both? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was checking with my investigators 
Chair.  They give me a note.  Dr Ngubane, did you not 
confirm to me that it is the same? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please raise your voice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did you not confirm ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I must tell you, today you are doing well 
with speaking aloud. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So do not spoil that record. [laughing] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I beg your pardon, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you not confirm to me that it is the 
same that was released? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, sir.  I told them at our second meeting 
with the investigators. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I said, I asked you to bring me a copy of 
the speech.  And one of them said:  No, this is off the table.  
That is how that discussion ended.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I was in that meeting.  I know the 
statement was shared.  The email and the statement was 
shared.  It is on page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was shared with whom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With Dr Ngubane.  That email is still 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 98 of 254 
 
contained in your bundle Dr Ngubane, page 761.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, give him more details to jog his 
memory. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it in the bundles? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in the bundles, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think your junior must help him to 
find it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 09(b).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Zero one? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   09(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 09.  Oh, 09 under B. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bracket B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 761. 
CHAIRPERSON:   761. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say 761.1? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson, 761.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I did... in fact, Dr Ngubane I get 
confirmation from the investigator that the one drafted - 
which is on the next page Chairperson – that statement was 
not released.  Eskom released a different statement.  So Dr 
Ngubane may well be correct.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 99 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us take it step by step. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 761.1 ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is an email from Nazeem Howa to 
Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject:  Statement from new 
board March 31.  Attachments, statement from new board 
March 31.  And then it says Salim by.  And then it says 
10 
amended version for your approval.  And the message says, 
this message has been scanned for... Oh, that is just ...  
Now the statement referred to in that email, is it the one that 
appears at 761.2? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one that therefore came from 
Mr Howa? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So based on the email at 761.1, Mr Howa 
sends it Mr Essa.  And then, what happened?  Did it end up 
20 
at Eskom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The draft statement, you would see 
Chairperson, the statement by Dr Ngubane.  That is the 
heading.  Chairperson of Eskom on behalf of the board.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 100 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now that statement goes up to 
where?  Where does it end? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a two page plus document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it end at 761.3? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 3.  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now have you ever seen this 
statement Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before today, you have never seen it? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I have not seen the statement.  I had asked 
the investigators to get me the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But when we met again ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...they did not give me the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:   They said, in fact, it was off the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I concluded, you know, it was a matter of 
20 
no issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, issue. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But I take it that you have not had a 
chance to read it, so you do not know what it says, except 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 101 of 254 
 
for what you might be more quickly? 
DR NGUBANE:   I certainly have not had the chance to read 
it but it looks to me very long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Very detailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And that is not a sort of media statement 
one would give. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, it is quite long for a media 
statement. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now... Mr Seleka, where is the one 
that Dr Ngubane ultimately issued? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By Eskom, Chairperson, I believe is the 
one on page 761.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   761.5? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 761.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you there Dr Ngubane? 
DR NGUBANE:   I am happy with that.  Well, that is the 
statement? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the statement you issued? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay.  Mr Seleka, you... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But do we know whether that statement, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 102 of 254 
 
the long one that came from Howa, do we know whether it 
was sent to somebody at Eskom or not? 
DR NGUBANE:   I would not know Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know anything? 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have not... the investigators have 
not been able to determine that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  How did they obtain it? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says from the Gupta leaks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the Gupta leaks? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I guess further work needs to 
be done to understand it.  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, they will indeed do so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is something quite important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because on the face of it, it seems that Mr 
Howa may have prepared a statement that he intended 
should be release by Dr Ngubane.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 103 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question would arise, why would he 
get involved in that?  So it is important to do investigation 
and see.  I mean, it is a long statement.  I guess you are not 
going to undertake such a long media statement for no 
reason.   
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
but 
the 
investigators 
should 
investigate and if need be, Dr Ngubane can deal with it at 
some stage if necessary.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Yes.  So Dr 
Ngubane ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe... Well, I just want to read 
some portions of this long statement into the record, just so 
that some of its features are captured in the transcript.  It is 
the statement up here at page 761.2 going up to 761.3.  The 
first paragraph says: 
“It is meant to be Dr Ben Ngubane, Chairperson of 
Eskom on behalf of the board. 
Merely a month has passed since we took the 
20 
decisive step to ask four of our most senior 
executives to step down from their day to day roles 
to allow the board to appoint independent persons to 
assist us to develop a plan.   
I 
am 
sure 
that 
Eskom 
is 
able 
to 
deliver 
a 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 104 of 254 
 
sustainable, secure and sufficient supply to its 
consumers.   
Yesterday, at a meeting of the board, it was decided 
or accepted the resignation of Mr Zola Tsotsi, as 
both chairperson and a director.   
On behalf of the board, I want to express our 
sincere thanks to Mr Tsotsi for his selfless decision 
and 
I 
want 
to 
wish 
him 
well 
for 
his 
future 
endeavours.   
The board has, once again, reaffirmed its approach 
10 
around its broad ranging investigation and the 
request for key individuals to stand down in order 
for the process to take place without fear or favour.” 
 
And then later on in the... on that particular page, 761.2 
it says” 
“The board, once again, confirms the key challenges 
impacting on Eskom and its ability to provide a 
sustainable, secure and efficient electricity supply.  
These are: 
1. Cash constraints at the utility. 
20 
2. An 
overburdened 
energy 
system 
leading 
to 
unprecedented load shedding. 
3. An aging fleet and seriously flawed maintenance 
programme. 
4. Rapidly increasing price of electricity. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 105 of 254 
 
5. Delays 
and 
cost 
overrun 
of 
the 
new 
build 
programme.” 
 
And then at page 761.3 it says somewhere: 
“It is our expressed desire that the investigations 
determine 
whether 
the 
current 
situation 
was 
exacerbated by incompetence, ill-informed decision 
making, mismanagement or untoward actions.” 
 
Ja, okay.  I just wanted to capture certain parts of the 
statement.  Maybe I should ask this question, a different 
one.  If indeed the statement was prepared by Mr Howa or at 
10 
his request, that would suggest that somebody would have 
spoken to him to say:  Would you prepare a statement?   
 
Or if nobody spoke to him from Eskom, he might have 
thought that the situation was such that if he forwarded the 
statement to Eskom, it would be found to be helpful and 
could be used.   
 
Did you know any grounds on which he could have 
thought that he was entitled to prepare a statement for you 
and send it and you would use it?   
 
Do you think your friendship, if it was a friendship, that 
20 
you had with him, may have made him believe that he could 
give you this kind of assistance? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, he was a journalist Chairperson.  And 
the story about Mr Tsotsi’s resignation was in all the 
newspapers.  But I am not sure if that will be justifying 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 106 of 254 
 
preparing the specific statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  In terms of your relationship, as you 
know it, is there a chance that he might have thought that 
you would welcome this kind of initiative on his part? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, you know, at one stage one of my 
nephews was aspiring to be a contributor of a column. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   So he wrote a number of articles which was 
sent to Mr Howa to check if generally speaking they are 
acceptable. 
 
That, 
of 
course, 
and 
that 
he 
know 
10 
commissioning.  So probably, on that basis he wanted to 
help me.  I do not know.  But that is... this is as far back as I 
can think of why someone would want to write me a 
document.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And at the time of... at this time, 
21 March 2015, how much did you keep in touch with him? 
DR NGUBANE:   Not much.  The occasion that he wanted me 
to contribute or ask questions about Eskom but it was not 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, you might have one 
or two questions and then we adjourn or we could adjourn for 
lunch immediately.  Okay, let us adjourn for lunch.  We are at 
seven minutes past one.  We will resume at five past two.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 107 of 254 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS:   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Dr Ngubane, 
on this draft we were dealing with, the draft media 
statement we were dealing with before the adjournment, I 
just want to put to you what Mr Tsotsi said about it and you 
can comment on that, in his affidavit to this Commission he 
says: 
10 
“Since the release into the public domain of the 
Gupta emails it has come to my attention that 
reference was made to communication between Dr 
Ngubane and a certain Mr Howa, who was then the 
editor of New Age Newspaper.  It stated that Mr 
Howa would assist Dr Ngubane in drafting a media 
statement detailing my departure from the Eskom 
board.  This communication too place on 10 days 
before the matter of my resignation from the board 
was discussed.” 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I do not know what Mr Tsotsi 
bases this on.  You know, I might be asked questions about 
his resignation afterwards but beforehand, I do not know 
where he gets it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 108 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you – ja, it is one thing where he 
might have gotten this from, it is another thing whether is it 
factually correct. 
DR NGUBANE:   It is not factually correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If no further questions from you, thank 
you, Chair.  Mr Ngubane then I wanted to go back to your 
service on the board of Eskom being 
appointed 11 
December 2014 as one of the new members, correct?    I 
do not whether you would know, maybe you could explain 
to the Chairperson, your recollection of when would have 
10 
been the first board meeting, the ordinary board meeting 
that the board was to attend. 
 DR NGUBANE:   We had an induction somewhere in 
January, probably 16 or somewhere, and then the board 
committees were meeting, quite a number of meetings.  But 
the official scheduled board meeting should have been 26 
February.  Sorry  - yes, 26 February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 26 February, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   2015. 
DR NGUBANE:   2015. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And that was cancelled where the 
Chairperson was Mr Tsotsi.  Then on the 9 t h he called a 
special board meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, just before that one, were you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 109 of 254 
 
given the reasons why the meeting, the scheduled board 
meeting of 26 February was cancelled. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, this – what upset a lot of board 
members because it did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, we understand the board members 
received and email from Mr Phukubje, Malesela Phukubje. 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, in which he explained that the 
meeting 
has 
been 
cancelled 
on 
the 
request 
of 
the 
shareholder. 
 
On 
the 
request 
of 
the 
shareholder 
10 
representative, meaning the Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it could be because on the 9 March 
2015 meeting board members wanted to know why the 
meeting was cancelled and Mr Tsotsi I think said it was on 
instruction.  So it was said then on the meeting of the 11 t h 
which was scheduled by the shareholder, she would be 
asked the reasons for the cancellation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And did she give – did the Minister 
give the reasons? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I do not remember her giving reasons, 
20 
but I would have to – I could check that, if you do not 
mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can check. 
DR NGUBANE:   I am looking at the minutes of the 11 
March when we met with the shareholder.  No, I do not see 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 110 of 254 
 
her actually giving reasons.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But did the Minister deny that she 
asked for the cancellation of that meeting or you do not 
recall her denying it?  You do not find it in the minutes.  
Are those the minutes of 11 March 2015 with the Minister? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, just the page reference 
without having to go to the minutes, in Dr Ngubane’s 
bundle that is page 286 to 289. 
DR NGUBANE:   What page? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that in bundle 09A? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   09A, indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 286 to 289. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   286? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 286. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is the file – these are the minutes 
of the Eskom board meeting with the Minister on 11 March 
2015 at ten o’clock. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chairperson, if you look at – and 
Dr Ngubane, if you look at page 287 at the bottom of the 
page there are two bullet points.  The line just before those 
two bullet point says: 
“During the discussion phase of the meeting the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 111 of 254 
 
following questions were asked by board members.” 
And there is your question: 
“What are the reasons for cancellation of the board 
meeting of 26 February 2015?” 
So I suppose that is one of the questions the Minister was 
asked. 
DR NGUBANE:   I do not see it, I do not see the response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not in the minutes, as far as I could 
tell. 
DR NGUBANE:   I am not sure if you have seen it, but… 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I have not.  I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your recollection that the Minister was 
asked that question? 
DR NGUBANE:   The Minister was definitely asked that 
question at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you cannot remember what 
answer, if any, she gave. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot remember, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  But is it not then – 
20 
because what Mr Tsotsi says and this is the version, his 
testimony before the Commission, that he was asked to 
cancel that meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, it could be true, Chairperson, but I 
was hoping that would have had a definite response on the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 112 of 254 
 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it would be strange if at the meeting 
the Minister was specifically asked a question and she did 
not respond, hey? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I would have expected to find the 
answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it might mean – it might mean that 
maybe the minutes are not accurate because I think it is 
10 
not – it might not be just that question.  Unless what 
comes on the second bottom half of page 288, unless what 
those bullets points are meant to be responses to the 
questions.  I think they start on the other side but my 
recollection was that certainly the one about the reasons 
for the cancellation of the meeting, there seemed to be no 
response at all.  
So I wonder whether it might mean that the minutes 
are not accurate because I would have imagined if the 
Minister was asked such a pertinent question, she would 
20 
answer in one way or another. 
DR NGUBANE:   Certainly, Chairperson.  Probably the 
person who took the minutes might have missed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  And the very 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 113 of 254 
 
- Dr Ngubane, the very fact of saying we are going to ask 
the 
shareholder 
representative 
why 
the 
meeting 
was 
cancelled, it is an appreciation of that the request could 
have come from the Minister and so the Minister must 
account for that cancellation. 
DR NGUBANE:   I agree, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see at page 288 that one of the 
questions that apparently was put to the Minister by 
members of the board was whether the Minister was 
comfortable with the composition of the board committees 
10 
as they currently stand.  Again, for me, that is strange, you 
know?   The board should not be – it should just make its 
own 
compositions 
of 
committees 
and 
should 
not 
be 
checking whether the Minister is happy with that or not. 
DR NGUBANE:   Agree, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   What happens, the Chairperson of the 
board assigns people to committees and then sends the list 
to the DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just for information, I would 
20 
imagine.  Ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, then 
the – well, you are the meeting of the 11 t h but let us take 
you back to the meeting of the 9 t h how you get to be 
notified of that meeting.  We understand you receive an 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 114 of 254 
 
email from the company secretary in which two documents 
were attached, a proposed – a memorandum and a 
proposed resolution for the board.  Do you recall that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And you have listened to the 
evidence that – well, let me rather ask you.  The 
memorandum that was received by the board and the 
proposed resolution relate to the Chairperson what you 
recall they were dealing with. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, the notice of the special 
10 
board meeting on the 9 t h came from company secretary 
together with the two documents.  The first document was 
the notice of the meeting, the second document had a 
resolution that we had to take that we accepted the less 
than normal days of notification and it was business 
unusual. 
 
And the second resolution was establish – well, 
problem is the sequence might be wrong, but there was a 
resolution establishing a subcommittee of three people, Mr 
Tsotsi himself, Ms Chwayita Mabude and Mr Zethembe 
20 
Khoza. 
 
A further resolution was giving authorisation for 
them to have a board mandate, board delegation, so that 
they can exercise the authorities as they would have been 
exercised by the board. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 115 of 254 
 
 
Further on, there was a resolution saying this board 
-  mean this subcommittee of three must be allowed to 
make deviations from the Eskom procurement procedure.  
In other words, they would get money, they would appoint 
the investigators, they will oversee the investigation, they 
will then report to the board and to cabinet.  I think those 
were the essential resolutions that were contained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know Mr Seleka is focusing on the 
meeting of the 9 t h now, I just want to go one step back.  
The cancellation of the meeting of the 9 t h – well, I said to 
10 
Mr Tsotsi when he was giving evidence, I found it strange 
that he agreed to cancel the meeting of the board at such 
short notice without being given reasons why because he 
said first he received a call from the former President Mr 
Jacob Zuma who said he had been trying to get hold of the 
Minister and Deputy Minister but he was not able to find 
them but indicated that the board meeting of the 26 
February needed to be postponed and said, I think, the 
Acting DG of DPE at the time would phone him and then Mr 
Tsotsi said not long after that call he received a call from 
20 
the Acting DG who said she had been asked by the 
Minister to ask him to postpone the meeting and Mr Tsotsi 
said he asked for the reasons and the Acting DG said the 
Minister had not given any reasons but he nevertheless 
went ahead and postponed the meeting.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 116 of 254 
 
So I said I found that strange again because this 
was going to be a meeting of the [indistinct] – background 
noise].  I hope we are safe, will somebody have a look at 
what is happening?   
So I said I found that strange again because this 
was going to be a meeting of the board and there was no 
indication that the Minister was scheduled to be part of 
that meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no indication that the 
10 
President was meant to be part of that meeting.  So why 
would somebody who is not meant to attend that meeting 
seek to have that meeting, a meeting of other people, 
cancelled?  I found it strange.  I do not know, what is your 
– do you have any comments to make to me about what I 
am saying? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chairperson, we were all puzzled 
and quite – I will say annoyed because we made plans for 
the meeting and then those plans changed without real 
reasons being advance. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they were never given, as far as you 
can recall. 
DR NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, continue, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  And Dr 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 117 of 254 
 
Ngubane, 
you 
have 
seen 
– 
just 
to 
conclude 
the 
Chairperson’s line of questions, you have seen that – or I 
am not sure whether you were here, we were referring to 
the MOI which gives the board exclusive control over the 
management of the SOE.  In this case Eskom.  Well, 
whether you were here, I do not know whether you will 
recall off hand the provisions of the MOI. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, certain powers are reserved for the 
shareholder in the MOI otherwise all control is with the 
board. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and Mr Tsotsi in his affidavit and 
when he was here he said the scheduled meetings could 
not be cancelled.  They could be postponed by the board 
itself.  So what I am asking you is, the limits, if you say 
certain powers are reserved for the shareholder, are those 
the powers that bear on what we are talking about here, 
the setting of meetings for the board and cancellation of 
that meeting for the board?  Could the Minister cancel the 
meeting? 
DR NGUBANE:   Not in terms of the MOI. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then you have gone to explain what 
was – the gist of what was contained in the proposed 
resolution.  To your recollection, because I did not hear 
you mention this, did you recall whether or not the 
proposed resolution also included the suspension of the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 118 of 254 
 
executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   It did, Chairperson, because it was 
emphasised that the inquiry should not be impeded by the 
board or by anyone so that it loses credibility. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 Therefore, 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
executives involved in the areas of investigation should go 
on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, we have looked at the 
document, both the memorandum and the resolution, none 
10 
of the two explicitly referred to the suspension of the 
executives, much less to indicate how many number of 
executives should be suspended. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, the Chairperson said there were 
charges to be dealt with concerning the executives, said he 
had a report – well, I am not sure if I can mention what he 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, tell us what he said unless you 
have a reason to think you should not say. 
DR NGUBANE:   What he said, Mr Matshela Koko was 
20 
caught on camera in a sexual escapade with a fellow 
employee at Eskom.  Mr Matona did not investigate this 
matter.   
The 
FD, 
Mr 
Tsholefelo 
Molefe 
had 
met 
with 
someone who was putting in a tender and had a discussion 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 119 of 254 
 
with the person during the evaluation of tenders.   
I cannot remember what he said in terms of Group 
Capital, Esso.  But if I recall there was general complaint 
about the huge numbers of billions that were being paid for 
claims a Medupi but I am not sure if that was actually 
framed like with that.   
So these were reasons he wanted us to accept the 
suspension with the charged to be preferred.  I presume by 
that stage the board has started to doubt Mr Tsotsi’s 
credibility because everyone said well, show us the papers, 
10 
show us the report, because these are serious allegations, 
before we suspend the executives.  He did not give us a 
report so then the board took that decision of approaching 
the shareholder to hear her view about the suspension. 
Later on the board again raised the issue of the 
report.  In a separate meeting Mr Tsotsi admitted that there 
was no report.  So this is the reason why it was 
emphasised that the inquiry will not include finding about 
wrong doing on the part of the executives but clearly the 
FD, Mr Koko, Mr Matona, Mr Dan Marokane, were included 
20 
in those misdemeanours that he wanted the investigation 
to be based on.  I am sorry that I have mentioned people’s 
name in this context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   But I resume there is no other way. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 120 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well what I find strange, and I 
mentioned this to Ms Klein yesterday, with regard to the 
evidence that at the meeting Mr Tsotsi relied on allegations 
of misconduct by – on the part of at least some of the 
executives to say they must be suspended because he said 
here the meeting of the 9 t h came about because of the 
meeting he attended at the President’s residence in Durban 
on the 8 March where he met, he said, with Ms Dudu 
Myeni, Mr Nick Linnell, former President Zuma.  I think 
there may have been one or two other people in the 
10 
meeting and he said this is where Ms Myeni told him about 
the idea of an inquiry, that there should be an inquiry at 
Eskom and that there should be a suspension of certain 
executives and he said that Ms Myeni said that the issue of 
the suspension of the executives should not be a problem 
because they would told that their suspension had nothing 
to do with allegations of misconduct on their part.   
They would be told that it was simply to ensure that 
the investigation was not hindered in any way by their 
presence and he testified that when he met with the board, 
20 
I guess maybe it must be the 9 t h , it was the 11 t h, he said 
he repeated the same line that the basis for suspending 
the executives would not be that they have done anything 
wrong, it would simply be to say it would be to avoid any 
hindrance to the investigation. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 121 of 254 
 
 
So it is quite interesting that your evidence and that 
of Ms Klein is that actually when he came to the board, he 
relied on allegations of misconduct on the part of the 
executives to say they should be suspended. 
 
So I am just saying it is quite strange but you seem 
to be quite clear that that is what he said. 
DR NGUBANE:   Very much so, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, and the idea that there should 
be no reliance on misconduct as far as you know came 
from the board members. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely because the board said or felt 
that these allegations were defamatory and there should be 
a proper document setting them out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  So, Dr 
Ngubane we have the minutes of that meeting of the 9 t h 
and they are in your bundle, page 276, now as you go 
there let me just say that the minutes on the face of them 
reflect that they were signed by yourself. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Signed by Mr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is P276 to P281. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 122 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   281 if you can turn to it – you are 
there? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if they’re signed by Dr Ngubane for 
purposes of noting the meetings, proceedings, so you 
confirm that you’re signing there, having signed there. 
DR NGUBANE:   18 November 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And there’s no other minutes of a 
meeting that took place on the 9 t h of March 2015? 
DR NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s nearly two years before you 
signed them. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now in these minutes what you say Mr 
Tsotsi said is not captured? 
DR NGUBANE:   Not recorded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not captured in these minutes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What you say he said about executives 
that 
they 
should 
be 
suspended, 
you 
can 
remember 
20 
definitely, the misdemeanours for which they should be 
suspended relative to the inquiry, sexual escapades you 
refer to, is not captured in these minutes, or even – well I 
cannot recall on that one, about the report, I can’t recall 
offhand so I can’t say that to you.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 123 of 254 
 
 
Do you want to have a look at it because – or do 
you want to comment? 
DR NGUBANE:   I looked at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did, okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I didn’t hear that. 
DR NGUBANE:   I did look at these minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:    A lot of things are missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
But 
we 
had 
a 
problem 
with 
the 
10 
Secretariat, 
where 
there 
used 
to 
be 
a 
backlog 
of 
transcription from the tapes into minutes.  If we want to 
find this bit of it we would definitely have to listen to the 
tapes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the tapes ja, and they used to keep 
the tapes for a long time? 
DR NGUBANE:   They are supposed to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, have those been checked? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The checking was done Chairperson, 
the investigators could not be provided with the audio 
20 
recordings for the meetings of the 9 t h of March 2015, there 
are other minutes for March that month which couldn’t be 
found, except for these ones they obtained.  I don’t know 
how they obtained these ones, but they were given these 
minutes.  We have obtained – I mean the recordings, we 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 124 of 254 
 
have obtained other audio recordings but not relevant to 
March 2015 from Bowman Gilfillan, the law firm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So were the investigators told that there 
were no tapes relating to the meeting of the 9 t h or were 
they told that there were no tapes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They were told the audio recordings 
cannot be fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They could not be found? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well I guess that needs to be done 
10 
is that the Commission must satisfy itself whether indeed 
the tapes cannot be found, so we might not – we might 
have to do more than just take somebody’s word that they 
cannot be found. 
ADV SELEKA SC   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
I 
think 
Dr 
Ngubane 
the 
Commission will do further investigation to try and find 
those 
tapes, 
because 
it 
looks 
like 
there 
is 
a 
vast 
difference, at least on this point between what the minutes 
say and what you say did happen. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson in a subsequent meeting 
the members were still demanding the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That report? 
DR NGUBANE:   Which are the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And the minutes of that meeting 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 125 of 254 
 
reflect that demand. 
MR NGUBANE:   Yes probably 14 t h or something, I think 
that was the date, but then the legal person, because it 
was said we cannot suspend people without charges, the 
legal advisor said you can suspend without charges 
because it will come out at the end of the inquiry, so that is 
how that issue ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.   Yes Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Dr Ngubane 
let’s deal with this report that you are referring to, and you 
10 
have seen the transcript of the audio recordings of the 
minutes of the 11 t h of March after the meeting with the 
Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:    Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we played that part of it where you 
are heard saying we don’t have the document, which is the 
report Mr Norman Baloyi was seeking to obtain to be 
provide with, you said the document might be out there, 
that is not our document, we are making the decision and 
this is our own decision. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so in the audio what you are 
saying now is different from what you said in the audio, at 
the meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   No but that was a subsequent meeting. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 126 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s the meeting immediately after 
you met with the Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson let me clarify this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   We were very unhappy about suspending 
the executives without charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Brought to us.  Then we go to the meeting 
with the Minister – well let me just go back.   The CEO, Mr 
Matona, at the earlier part of the meeting on the 11 t h 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes actually Mr Seleka I wondered why  
you did not start with that, the first meeting before the 
Minister so that we cover whatever Dr Ngubane might have 
to say about that meeting and we can move in stages, that 
meeting before the Minister, the meeting with the Minister, 
the meeting after the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes now indeed Chairperson, one 
would ordinarily do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you can complete ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can complete what you are 
saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Dr Ngubane I interrupted you, you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 127 of 254 
 
were seeking to explain something and saying something 
had happened at the first meeting, at the earlier meeting 
before the Minister came.  Ja, I think you wanted to explain 
that with reference to what Mr Seleka was asking you. 
DR NGUBANE:   The first meeting was a normal board 
meeting, we had a report, different reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   There was a report by the CEO, Mr 
Matona.  He spoke about the problems at Eskom, the 
voluntary severance packages led to Eskom losing a lot of 
10 
senior people, the skills war room had put a stop to this, 
then he mentioned other issues but came to the financial 
report; Eskom was in a dire financial situation.  Normally 
they have a buffer of R20billion to be able to transact 
Eskom business, but this buffer had come down to 4.6 or 
something billion which was made of loans that was still to 
come in.  If you remove those loans what they had was 
they were in the red for R3billion, so the going concern for 
Eskom was not there, so Eskom was technically bankrupt. 
 
Now we go to the meeting with the Minister.  The 
20 
Minister goes over this again, saying Eskom is in financial 
trouble.  Of course, he made also some other remarks 
which are there in the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And he said there needs to be a forensic 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 128 of 254 
 
inquiry into the affairs of Eskom and she tabulated the 
areas 
that 
were 
problematic, 
generation, 
lack 
of 
maintenance, delay in coming on stream of the new built, 
excessive expenditure on diesel, you know she counted 
quite a number of things, even the interest that was being 
paid in terms of loans you know all that came in. 
 
Now she virtually instructs us that we must conduct 
a forensic audit and also tells Audit & Risk to go out and 
look for an investigator who will be independent, who will 
not be compromised in any way to carry out the inquiry, so 
10 
when this is over and we go back to the meeting of the 
11 t h, in committee, then the decision is taken to approve 
the inquiry, because it’s clear now that the shareholder 
herself is seriously concerned.  Every year, or at the 
beginning of a term the Board signs a shareholder 
compact, 
this 
shareholder 
compact 
spells 
out 
the 
performance predetermined key performance areas for the 
Board and we sign this and accept it with the shareholder. 
 
Now what she was saying was essentially coming 
out of the shareholder, shareholder compact, namely that 
20 
she can give guidance to the Board on key areas of 
concern, so we go back to the meeting now in committee 
and we say after all this then let us proceed with the 
inquiry, that’s when the decision came in.   However there 
will be no investigation that seeks to target people, it will 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 129 of 254 
 
be about issues the Minister raised, about the performance 
of the system in general and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think the question that Mr Seleka 
had posed sought to say there is something that you are 
saying, I think with regard to the report, which Mr Seleka 
seems to suggest is not borne out by something, Mr Seleka 
do you want to repeat your question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes, thank you Chairperson.  Dr 
Ngubane you were saying members demanded to have a 
report from Dr Tsotsi but in the audios the transcript of 
10 
which you were provided with yesterday, you are heard 
there saying there might be a document out there but that 
is not our document, we are proceeding with the decision 
and that is our own decision, and that was in response to 
Mr Norman Baloyi who was asking for the report. 
DR NGUBANE:   This is after the meeting with the 
shareholder that we now have taken a decision to proceed 
with the inquiry, whether Mr Tsotsi has given us the report 
you know we can’t be controlled by that, because now we 
have got – if I can call it marching orders, that was in that 
20 
context. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no correct, I am talking about it in 
that very context as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I – is the point you are making Dr 
Ngubane this that prior to the meeting between the Board 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 130 of 254 
 
and the Minister you and other members of the Board were 
interested in seeing the report that Mr Tsotsi had talked 
about, but after the Minister had left as far as you were 
concerned at least, there was no significance in having 
hold of that report anymore. 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you are saying? 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Not that we exonerated the Chairperson, 
10 
for talking of a report which he did not produce, not that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, ja, just that for purposes of 
making a decision you no longer needed it. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so then Dr Ngubane what you are 
saying to the Chairperson is that the Board ultimately took 
the decision itself to commission an inquiry? 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the Board similarly take the 
20 
decision to suspend the executives? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well that has got its own history.  When 
Mr Tsotsi could not give us the report with charges, we 
said let them go on special leave so that we do fulfil the 
part that the investigation should not be hindered or 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 131 of 254 
 
fettered, let them take special leave.  The advisor, the 
legal advisor then came in to say, he was at the meeting, 
you cannot have special leave for investigations, you can 
have it for death in the family, or illness or whatever but 
not for investigation.  Now for lack of a better word 
suspension was used. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes you – okay a couple of things 
because you do – you did say that the Minister when she 
arrive or after she had arrived in the meeting, she went 
through the key areas that were affected and that required 
10 
investigation or inquiry. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you do say in your affidavit that 
the Minister then instructed you to commission this inquiry, 
so it became clear to you that it is the shareholder 
representative or government that wants this inquiry, in 
your 
affidavit, 
but 
you 
also 
go 
on 
to 
say, 
those 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that was a yes, your answer was 
yes, ja, I think you nodded, so want to capture that. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Thank you Chair, definitely a yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   And you also say 
the Minister said that the executive should step aside? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 132 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now did you ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   I think we can check that with the 
minutes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
You 
mean 
the 
minutes 
with 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Although it might not matter you know 
whether she said step aside or suspend, I think everybody 
knew what they were talking about that they should not be 
around 
during 
the 
investigation, 
that 
was 
the 
point, 
whatever label, whatever terminology was used. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, in fact in your affidavit you say that 
although the Minister did not direct the Board to suspend 
the four executives she raised concerns of her own against 
them and the last sentence in that paragraph says, 
paragraph 4.17: 
“The Minister felt that the presence of the four 
executives might hinder the investigation.” 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you ask her to provide a report 
20 
why they should be – they should step aside. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well it followed from the requirement that 
there is no interference or impudence of the investigation.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you know why I am asking this 
question is this, if the executives are ultimately suspended  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 133 of 254 
 
on the basis articulated by the Minister and not as you say 
on the basis articulated by Mr Tsotsi of misdemeanours, 
why do you still want the report, or you say to the 
Chairperson that you still want the report from Mr Tsotsi 
about misdemeanours, why is it relevant? 
DR NGUBANE:   Because if I as a Chairman say to Board 
members I have the report with something and then 
subsequently I cannot produce that report it means I have 
lied to the members of the Board, that was the principle 
here.  You said there was a report, you have not produced 
10 
this report, you know what are you, are you lying, I mean 
this is essentially the sentiment, not that because it was 
invalid, but because it was a commitment made and 
people’s names drawn through the mud, them being there 
in the report, because it is a fairly serious allegation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes now I hear you.  I suppose the 
challenge for the Commission is that that aspect doesn’t 
appear from the minutes that you signed, so one, number 
two is that notwithstanding the absence of that report, or 
even the existence of it, the Board decided to take a 
20 
decision, not based on that, on the reasons articulated as 
you say by Mr Tsotsi. 
DR NGUBANE:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – well we hear what you say 
because at the end of the day it seems to the Board, and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 134 of 254 
 
even as captured in the recording that to you that 
document was irrelevant.  You said it might be there, that’s 
not our document, we’re making the decision, it is our 
decision. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, because Mr Baloyi was insisting that 
that document forms part of what we are doing when in fact 
it was not there in the first place, we had taken a decision 
after consultation with the shareholder, in other words it 
was a new ball game that we’re entering, but the fact that 
Chairman said publically at the meeting that there was a 
10 
report and when do you want to enumerate allegations to 
the Board that to me was a very serious matter.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well the Chairperson explicitly told the 
Board that that report was the groundwork conducted by 
the Presidency.  Did you ask the Minister about the 
existence of that report? 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson he never attributed that 
report to the Presidency when he spoke to us.  What he 
attributed to the Presidency, which was quite ridiculous for 
us, was that he was the power to deviate from Eskom 
20 
procurement 
procedures, 
he 
was 
the 
power. 
 
The 
Presidency has done all the governance and legal work 
around this deviation.  Now no one having any idea about 
Eskom procurement can believe that, because no one came 
from the Presidency to the Eskom Commercial Division to 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 135 of 254 
 
conduct such procurement.  This is what he said to us. 
 
So we – I mean that was quite ridiculous to say give 
me the carte 
blanche, let me proceed because the 
Presidency has done the work, I mean who would believe 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am a little bit unable to follow 
your answer there Dr Ngubane, he did in fact say the 
President has done the work. 
DR NGUBANE:   On the deviation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well the minutes, which I will read to 
10 
you now of the 9 t h of March, the ones you signed, 
specifically 
say 
the 
President 
– 
let 
me 
read 
– 
a 
memorandum detailing the current status of events around 
Eskom was tabled for information, details of which had 
been circulated to members, the memorandum included 
resolutions around the establishment of an external and 
independent board of inquiry for Eskom at the request of 
the 
Presidency. 
 
The 
Chairman 
reported 
that 
the 
Presidency had expressed a concern that the impact of 
Eskom and power on the country was being understated.  
20 
In this regard it was felt that the Board had to be certain 
that it received accurate information from management for 
all 
issues 
and 
initiatives 
once 
the 
Board 
had 
the 
information it would have to make decisive resolution. 
 
He had been requested to request the Board to 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 136 of 254 
 
authorise and mandate an independent external inquiry to 
establish the facts of the current difficulties.  This inquiry 
will have to be unfettered and it carries on. 
 
The Chairman took members through each of the 
resolutions 
proposed 
as 
follows, 
then 
you 
get 
the 
resolutions. 
 
The issue of deviation was but one of those 
resolutions, I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka we are at four minutes past 
three, let’s try to – let’s aim at finishing evidence on the 
10 
meetings of the 11th by half past three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let’s try and cover all of those 
meetings of the 11 t h by half past three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  And that is 
assuming Dr Ngubane, assuming Dr Ngubane what you’re 
saying about what the Chairperson says is correct, that he 
made the allegations of misdemeanours, because we put 
that issue to Ms Klein that in fact the Chairperson himself 
was taken aback by allegations that the FD, the Financial 
20 
Director, had met with bidders in a tender process.  He was 
taken aback that there was such allegations that the 
Financial Director had met with the bidders. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson those allegations could not 
have come from anyone other than the Chairperson, he did 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 137 of 254 
 
make those allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there at any stage after the meeting 
of the 11 t h and even after Mr Tsotsi had left Eskom was 
there a stage at which these allegations of misconduct by 
the 
executives 
where 
they 
came 
back, 
even 
if 
the 
executives had also left, were they ever heard of these 
allegations again or they ended at that meeting? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well the issue of allegations was dropped 
in terms of a decision that was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   So we didn’t deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they never came back to the Board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now let me ask this question, do 
you remember whether when you heard about this idea of 
the suspension of executives for the first time, whether it 
is on the 9 t h of March or on the 11 t h of March whether there 
were only three executives being talked about who would 
be suspended, initially and the fourth one was only added 
somewhere along the way, do you have any recollection 
20 
whether from the beginning you only heard about the 
suspension of four executives or whether initially you had 
been told about three executives and later on the fourth 
one was added?    
DR NGUBANE:    From the beginning Chairperson it was 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 138 of 254 
 
clear from what Chairman Tsotsi said that it involved all 
four.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you – you heard from him about 
four executives to be suspended? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is why he gave reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Why they should be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is just that in his evidence he – he 
10 
said that at the meeting in Durban that he said he had with 
Ms Dudu Myeni and the former President and Mr Nick Linnell 
three names of – three names only were mentioned and I 
seem to think he said that the fourth name was added by the 
Minister. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the day that the Minister addressed the 
Board which would be the 11t h.  That is what he said and he 
said he was opposed to the idea of the Financial Director 
being added.  Does that ring a bell at all with you? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson I am almost certain this is not 
true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
DR NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 139 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now Dr Ngubane I 
have just read to you where you saying in your affidavit that 
the Minister raised concerns of her own against the four. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that felt that the presence of the four 
executives might hinder their investigation.  And the four 
executives I take you are referring to those who were 
ultimately suspended? 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but is it not that there already the 
10 
Minister says as you point out she says I have concerns with 
the four executives and I am – I feel that their presence will 
hinder the investigation.  So how do we reconcile that with 
your answer to the Chairperson that you are definitely sure 
the Minister did not say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think the – my question – the question 
he was answering from me was a question – was a question 
whether it was the Minister who added the fourth name and 
he said no the Minister as far as he knows it was Mr Tsotsi 
who mentioned all four names.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is what I… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes no I appreciate that Mr Ngubane but 
what I am saying then the Minister you should have – you 
would have written here that the Minister raised concerns 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 140 of 254 
 
with the three. 
DR NGUBANE:  With the three.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think there is misunderstanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it a misunderstanding Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja I think from your side.  Dr Ngubane’s 
version is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has never heard of the suspension 
being of three executives only. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the beginning he only heard about 
the suspension of four executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the person that he heard talk about 
the suspension of four executives from the beginning was Mr 
Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is right Mr – Dr Ngubane? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he says they might have also spoken 
about four. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 141 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But everybody was speaking about four as 
far as Dr Ngubane is concerned. 
DR NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes no I – I follow what you are 
saying Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe you missing something so if I am 
missing something you can pursue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes no that is fine.  That is fine Chair.  
So Dr Ngubane then the – the position of Mr Tsotsi to have 
10 
four suspended would have been similar to the Minister who 
wanted the four – who showed that the four will hinder the 
investigation. 
DR NGUBANE:  Correct Chairperson.  In terms of the areas 
of concern which you identified.  Mr Tsotsi identified those 
areas, the Minister identified those areas. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But then let me give you Mr Tsotsi’s 
version which is what the Chairperson has given you.  Maybe 
you have answered him but Mr Tsotsi and the audio show 
that Mr Tsotsi was opposed to the suspension of the 
20 
Financial Director.  He only gave three names. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well – well I do not know but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the – maybe the way to start is this.  
On your recollection Dr Ngubane when Mr Tsotsi talked 
about the suspension of four executives was he talking about 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 142 of 254 
 
the suspension of four executives on the basis that he was 
saying to the board the four executives whose areas of work 
is affected – will be affected by the litigation must be 
suspended or must take special leave of something.  In other 
words was he talking on the basis that all four must be 
suspended or did he ever speak on the basis that he 
supported the suspension of three but not the suspension of 
the Financial Director?  What is your recollection? 
DR NGUBANE:  Sorry Chairperson.  Not as far as I 
remember.  It was all four areas and their people had to step 
10 
aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  The – however to 
accelerate this Dr Ngubane – oh or expedite this.  Ultimately 
the board makes the – made the decision based on what you 
say 
was 
a 
clear 
direction 
from 
the 
shareholder 
representative. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you decided as the board then both to 
commission an inquiry and to suspend the executives. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the suspension was for three 
months. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As communicated to them at least.  So 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 143 of 254 
 
tell – well there is evidence – the witnesses have already 
testified let me rather rephrase my question.  The executives 
are then suspended and at some point they make enquires 
with the board about the Terms of Reference of the 
investigation.  One of them offers to assist the board in the 
inquiry.  The other one goes to the Labour Court.  How does 
the board deal with those enquiries from the executives in 
your recollection? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I do not think – there are minutes here 
where Mr Baloyi talks about this.  I am not sure which 
10 
minutes.  They wanted to have cell phones because they 
wanted to communicate with the executives at Eskom.   
Mr Baloyi was saying they cannot have cell phones or 
computers or cell phones or – somewhere you know 
communication equipment because they are not supposed to 
talk to the people at Eskom.   
Some other person said by virtue of suspension you 
cannot communicate with the people in the organisation.  So 
that issue was discussed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes my question is for instance Mr Dan 
20 
Marokane he writes a letter and he offers to assist Eskom in 
the inquiry if the board genuinely wants to find solutions to 
the problems that letter of his is dated 18 March 2015.  Let 
us start with him.  According to your recollection how did you 
deal with the request or offer made by Mr Dan Marokane? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 144 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well my recollection is that the fact that 
they were removed from their positions means they – it was 
not required for them to interact or interfere with the 
investigation.  So the offer of help is meaningless then if it is 
granted the suspensions were therefore meaningless. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that raises – please do not forget next 
question Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That raises a question that I was going to 
raise with you.  If it was – if the board accepted that the 
10 
investigation was not going to be into any wrongdoing on the 
part of the executives but the investigation was going to be a 
genuine investigation to try and establish what was wrong at 
Eskom and so on.   
Why did the board think the executives would 
interfere with that investigation?  Because they were not – 
this would not be a case where the investigation was into the 
any wrongdoing on their parts.  You know when it is said 
somebody must not interfere with the investigation usually it 
is 
because 
the 
investigation 
relates 
to 
allegations 
of 
20 
wrongdoing on their parts.   
Now here the board accepts that there is no 
allegation of wrongdoing on their part so if the investigation 
seeks genuinely to find solutions why does the board not 
think that the leadership of the entity which has been there 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 145 of 254 
 
over the years try different solutions should not be part of 
the solution.  Why does the board not think that these people 
can assist in the investigation so they should not be 
suspended? They should be part – they should tell the 
investigators if you are thinking of coming up with this forget 
because five years ago we tried exactly that and it did not 
work.   
If you are thinking of coming up with this idea to 
solve this problem forget because we tried it last year.  It did 
not work.  That would be a constructive way to try and find a 
10 
solution.   
But now when you remove them it seems to be – 
there seems to be some tension between saying on the one 
hand the investigation would not be into any wrongdoing on 
their part but at the same time removing them from the 
process of finding a solution.  What do you say to that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson it was emphasised that the 
credibility 
of 
the 
results 
and 
the 
reports 
must 
be 
unquestionable. 
 
So 
the 
reports 
must 
be 
based 
on 
completely objective assessment.  In other words if Dan 
20 
Marokane is paid R22 billion we attach Africa Power Systems 
for claims that they have made for modifications to the plans 
that they have made.  And he approved that.  There is no 
certainty that he would not want to justify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but when he wants to justify that that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 146 of 254 
 
is when you confront him as the investigator and say, how do 
you justify this?  As an investigator you are not going to be 
able to say you have completed the investigation without 
hearing what he has to say.  If he wants to justify it let him 
justify it.  You question his reasoning.  You question his 
reasons.   
If his reasons are plausible you accept them.  If they 
are not plausible you reject them.  But his reasons they 
become part of the investigation and that enhances the 
quality of the investigation.  It is an investigation where you 
10 
have looked at everything.  You have had all perspectives 
and you come to a conclusion having heard all perspectives 
this is the right way to go.   
DR NGUBANE:  Well I am not sure if the department or the 
government would have accepted this situation as being real 
to your finding or information.  Because the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why not? 
DR NGUBANE:  Because the person might have been 
defending himself; his actions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But a person is entitled to defend himself 
20 
but as the investigator you engage them.  I mean just like 
this investigation.  This is an investigation. We are not 
hearing only one side of people who make allegations up 
against other people.  We are hearing everybody.   
You are sitting there you were saying earlier on you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 147 of 254 
 
were taking exception to people who may have referred to 
your board as the Gupta board.  I am not going to say I do 
not want to hear your defence because – because I say then 
my findings will not be credible if I hear your defence.  That 
does not make sense.   
It makes sense that I should hear what you say 
because if I make a finding having heard your side too that 
finding has more credibility than a finding which does not – 
which is not based on hearing your side as well. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I am saying is I struggle with the 
reasoning that says on the one hand let us suspend the 
executives but we must make it clear the investigation is not 
looking into any allegations of wrongdoing to them.  We are 
simply wanting to find genuine solutions to the problems of 
Eskom.  So I do not understand it. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I hear you Chairperson however it 
should have complicated the investigation if the same people 
who were being said to have failed to prevent what was 
happening are then relied upon for information.  Rather go 
20 
into the department and say show me invoices, your contract 
management documentation.  Show me how the contract 
management office goes into the project site and records 
what is happening and records the claims purely on record 
not relying on what people say. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 148 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember the board was saying this 
investigation is not going to look into the conduct of the 
executives you see.  That is what the board was saying.  It is 
not going to look into the conduct of the executives. 
DR NGUBANE:  Precisely Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is why they should not be there.  
Because if we start looking into their conduct then that is 
another level of investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well I said to I think either Mr 
10 
Matona or Mr Tsotsi earlier this week.  I said I wonder 
whether 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
performance of Eskom to be conducted – to be conducted 
without that being also an investigation into how the 
leadership of Eskom has led the entity namely the executives 
what decisions they have made which may have led to poor 
performance on the part of the entity.  You understand that.  
These are – these executives were the leaders in terms of 
management.  If you want to – if you are looking into the 
performance of Eskom you say it is not performing well it 
20 
just seems to me that necessarily you are investigating the 
question of have, they been making the right decisions?  Do 
they know what they are doing?  Why is the company 
performing so poorly?  You understand what I mean? 
DR NGUBANE:  I do. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 149 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the company does not run itself.  
It is run by human beings.  Those executives are the top 
people so I was saying to either Mr Matona or Mr Tsotsi I am 
not sure how accurate it was to say you know the conduct – 
the investigation does not relate to their conduct because it 
seems to me they make decisions and those decisions either 
result 
in 
good 
performance 
by 
the 
company 
or 
bad 
performance.  And if you want to see how you will turn things 
around it seems you will be looking at how they have been 
running – running the company.  Do you want to say anything 
10 
about that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I see your standpoint but I am also 
trying to express the fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  If we started allowing them to come into the 
investigation then that will involve ipso facto finding guilt 
against the executives.  We were not going to try and find 
guilt among the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  We were going to find how the system 
20 
works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  J. 
DR NGUBANE:  And then the recommendation from Dentons 
put out a lot of recommendations how we can improve the 
system.  And that was what we were interested in. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 150 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Not engaging for instance Mr Matona why 
did you say load-shedding must become part of our lives in 
South Africa because load-shedding is going to take many 
years.  I mean if you were involved this is the question you 
would be asked.  Why did you say that?  But because he is 
not there, we are not looking at his pronouncements but we 
are looking at how the system works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just – but just go back to the need or 
end justification for the suspension.  You see as I see it 
10 
there is nothing wrong – there would have been nothing 
wrong with the investigation going on while they were there 
and them being asked to contribute whatever they can to the 
investigation.   
After all I would imagine a lot of them are technical 
people and so on and so on.  But that would not make them 
to be the investigators.  The investigators 
would be 
independent, they would ask them whatever they need to ask 
them in order to better understand the systems and whatever 
but in the end when the investigators make their report they 
20 
would be able to say this is the input we got from this 
executive and that executive about this and about that and 
about that.   
They would be able to say these ideas from this 
executive are good ideas. We have tested them objectively; 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 151 of 254 
 
we cannot reject them just because they come from 
somebody within the company.  But these ones have no 
basis.  We reject them.   
So they take what they believe is good and make it 
part of their report and the solution and reject what has no 
basis that they get from the executives.  But without the 
executives interfering in anything they keep their part – the 
investigators keep their part but they have a chance to make 
their own contribution and the investigators decide what 
persuades them and what does not persuade them. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  [Inaudible - mumbling]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine just have a look.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson may I add a question so we 
can deal with both or shall I wait? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay you can add if you think … 
DR NGUBANE:  Well I found what I wanted. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Alright. 
DR NGUBANE:  This is the Dentons Task Order 1. 
“In preparing the scope of work for Task 
Order 1 the scope of work we have sought to 
address the problems statement and key 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 152 of 254 
 
areas of concern described in Eskom’s Terms 
of Reference.  The problems statement that 
the scope of work is intended to address is 
defined as follows: The board seeks to obtain 
an 
independent 
and 
unfettered 
view 
regarding the credibility and the correctness 
of 
information 
that 
Eskom’s 
executive 
management EXCO provides – provides in 
their reports relating to poor performance of 
generation, 
delays 
in 
bringing 
new 
10 
generation etcetera.” 
That was the scope of work.  Then they continued to say: 
“When we go to Task Order 2 then there may 
be other investigations interviews and so on” 
Now the Audit and Risk committee in spelling out the Terms 
of Reference said Eskom reserves the right to stop or 
terminate the investigation at any stage once they are 
satisfied that these areas have been covered.  And this is 
what happened.   
When the information came about these issues it was 
20 
enough for Audit and Risk to package the reports which 
touched on every – each division and say put this into 
operation.  Because of your management in terms of 
maintenance and many other aspects the primary energy, the 
buying of coal and so on that enabled us in eight months of 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 153 of 254 
 
our existence at Eskom to stop load-shedding which had 
been going on for almost two years at stage 3 level.   
We stopped the load-shedding for fifteen months 
using these guidelines.  So the contribution that would have 
made by the executives I may not dispute.  But in terms of 
what was – the objective was to get to grips very quickly 
within a matter of three months that was achieved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  What I wanted 
to also say Dr Ngubane is that and you touched on it that the 
10 
methodology included the interviews.  The Dentons Report 
did in fact say in effect the methodology of the investigation 
was limited to 
1. Interviewing 
employees of Eskom and 
also other 
persons and 
2. Review of documents. 
But then they say there was a limitation.  They give you a list 
of limitations, access to documents, access to emails and 
then the third is interviews with suspended employees.  
Interviews were requested with certain employees who were 
20 
under suspension.  We were advised that these interviews 
could not be arranged due to the suspension of the 
employees in question.  We were required to make direct 
contact with these employees for these purposes.  So the 
interviews with employees even though suspended was 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 154 of 254 
 
envisaged in the methodology. 
DR NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But they highlight it as a limitation that 
Eskom could not provide them with – with the requested 
interviews.  So you said [00:28:34] director yourself. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
Chairperson 
there 
were 
task 
orders 
contained in proposals from Audit and Risk and we wanted to 
keep to those task orders for the sake of three months return 
of results.  We interview executives – to interview all levels 
of management would have taken a year or even two years 
10 
but we wanted as the Minister said she wanted a short sharp 
deep dive.  A short, sharp deep dive meant you have to look 
at the system and look at all the areas what – this just was 
not a general forensic investigation which can take any 
amount of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then – so the 
commission Mr – Dr Ngubane what it should accept from you 
is that their requests by the executives particularly the one 
who said he could offer assistance was not acceptable? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  No, because it was not part of task order 
number one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Mr Dan Marokane specifically has 
said that letter of 18 March 2015 went unanswered but then 
he called you when you were the acting chairperson 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 155 of 254 
 
...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...somewhere in May, 20 May.  And in 
two days you had arranged Mr Khumalo and Mr Zethembe 
Khoza to engage in the separation negotiations. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, if I remember well, Dan Marokane 
wanted to move on.   By the way, I go to the same church as 
Dan Marokane.  We know each other very well.  So he had 
implied to me that we are delaying is ability to move on.  So 
I asked Zethemba Khoza and Romeo, please we have to deal 
10 
with this issue urgently.  That is how they came to see him 
very quickly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So prior to that, was there an 
option for him to come back to Eskom? 
DR NGUBANE:   There was an option for everyone to come 
back after the inquiry was finished.  And somewhere along 
the line, for instance, I was president of the CCMA.  During 
the break...  
 
By the way, I was not the official representative of 
Eskom.  I when there because the board said Mr Tsotsi is 
20 
going there but we would also like you to be there.  At the 
intermission I go to him say... and Mr Tshediso, I have known 
for a long, long time.  We are on very good terms.   
 
I said:  Tshediso, why do you come here when you know 
that in three months’ time the investigation is complete and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 156 of 254 
 
you guys come back to Eskom?   
 
So he was very angry.  He said:  you have dishonoured 
my name.  You have cast suspicions n my integrity.  I am 
never going back to Eskom.   
 
We have had quite a long discussion.  I said but in the 
end, you will still need Eskom whatever job you go to say 
there was nothing wrong that you did.   
 
We parted on that note but his statement was very 
emphatic:  I am not going back.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what Mr Matona has told the 
10 
Commission is that he had taken Eskom to the Labour Court 
and to the CCMA ultimately seeking a relief that would give 
him his job back. 
DR NGUBANE:   Certainly.  But he knew that we had said at 
the end of the three months when the investigation is over, 
they can come back.  He knew that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he said to the Commission that 
when... the first occasion when you met with him, you asked 
for a postponement at the CCMA so that you can get 
instructions 
from 
the 
shareholder 
representative 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
Mr 
Seleka 
you 
are 
using 
instructions, I think, in a legal language.  Dr Ngubane might 
not understand that in that way.  I think you might be wanting 
to say ...[intervenes]  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 157 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...mandate.  Ja.  [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing]  Correct, Chairperson.  So 
that you could hear the mandate from the shareholder 
representative.  And on the second occasion, Mr Khumalo 
told him in that meeting that the option of going back is off 
the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But first of all Chairperson he is confusing 
me with the chairman.  It was the chairman who was going to 
consult the shareholder, not me.  I was there just because 
10 
Dentons is there as well but in my own initiative because of 
my relationship with him, I tried to persuade him that it was 
more useful to wait for the investigation and come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The chairman you referred to would have 
been who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zola Tsotsi.  But would he not have 
gone by then ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chair.  But the whole team was 
emanating from his term.  The suspension was during his 
term.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he would not be able to represent the 
board of which he was no longer a member even if the matter 
arose during his term. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I am not too sure on what basis the 
board said I should go there.  But I certainly did not go with 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 158 of 254 
 
the lawyer from Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Or consult with the lawyers at Eskom.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   I was just there as an individual in the 
gallery. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   And after the break, I went down to meet 
with Matona...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are certain Mr Tsotsi was there? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I did not meet Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you did not.  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   But I was told Mr Tsotsi will be there but 
you must also be there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Ja, it would be strange if... it 
depends when it was because Mr Tsotsi left the board on the 
30t h of March.  If the CCMA meeting was at some stage 
during March then maybe Mr Tsotsi might have been there 
but I...  
 
But 
even 
if 
it 
was 
after 
the 
20t h, 
because 
the 
20 
20t h of March, he effectively was charge, I think, by the 
board or...  
 
I am not sure if he would between the 20 t h of March and 
the 30 t h of March, I am not sure he would have performed 
any duties as chairperson of a board.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 159 of 254 
 
 
Or what is your recollection?  You remember... Am I right 
that on the 20t h, at the meeting on the 20t h, the board told 
him that he was... 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is 19, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   19 or 20 that he was going to be charged.  
So my own assessment is that it is unlikely that the board 
would allow him to go and represent it as chairperson at the 
CCMA between the 20t h of March and the 30t h, in the light of 
the issues that were there between the board and himself.  
10 
DR NGUBANE:   I agree Chairperson but my going there 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...was purely as an observer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you cannot remember who... well, you 
think it was Mr Tsotsi who represented the board? 
DR NGUBANE:   I think so because I think someone said he 
will be there. You know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:   But you must also go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
DR NGUBANE:   And I did not even interact with the Eskom 
lawyers. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 160 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, well... ja, it is 
only because I think the question has been asked Dr 
Ngubane that Mr Matona did not place Mr Tsotsi in the 
settlement discussion or even at the CCMA.   
 
He only mentioned your name and Mr Khumalo but I 
think Ms Venete Klein would have been involved as well 
because... in fact, the three of you were authorised by the 
board ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Sure. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...to engage the suspended executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chairperson but this was after the 
report that these suspended executives wanted to part with 
Eskom.  And their duty was just with... because we were 
trying to make this very smooth, you know.   
 
Not to engage again in protracted legal battles because 
obviously they will have claims and so on.  I mean,  I did not 
go into the legality of it but the essence of it was, to try and 
handle this in a calm and amicable way whatever the 
settlement issues or parting issues were.   
20 
 
But I must add that after my meeting with Mr Matona, I 
was not surprised when I was told he wants to part with 
Eskom.  I was not surprised at all.   
 
However, I did not attend all meetings because at that 
stage, I was busy going to... I mean, the staff morale at 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 161 of 254 
 
Eskom was absolutely low.   
 
So we started on a programme of visiting all the power 
stations to persuade people to give more into their work 
because we wanted to stop load shedding.   
 
And we could not do that unless each power station was 
working optimally and cooperating with others, for instance, 
the National Control Centre which was regulation the load 
shedding.   
 
You know, it was trying to get this thing to work 
efficiently.  So I did not spend much time with the issue of 
10 
the settlements or the executives.   
 
I did attend some meetings but I am sure there were 
other meetings that I was not part of.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we may as well deal with this other 
issue that I have raised with Ms Klein as well yesterday 
because she also gave evidence on the basis that the 
executives who left Eskom left because they made their own 
decisions that they wanted to leave Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not that the board did not want them 
20 
anymore. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now from what you say, it looks like you 
are going along the same line  Is that right? 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 162 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now what I am put to him which I am 
putting to you as well is, certainly Mr Matona, who is the 
only one of those executives who has given evidence here, 
said that he went to the Labour Court because he wanted his 
job back.   
 
He mentioned he was paying his lawyers from his own 
pocket if I remember correctly.  He was disagreeing with his 
suspension.   
 
And he said then the Labour Court referred his matter to 
the CCMA.  He said he still wanted his job back.  He said 
10 
that Eskom asked for the postponement of the CCMA 
process because he said they wanted to talk to the minister 
to see what offer they could make to him.  
 
 I may be mistaken but I thought he said you were the 
one 
who 
represented 
Eskom 
at 
the 
time 
when 
the 
postponement at the CCMA was sought.   
 
But he says, then subsequently there were two meetings 
between him and those who represented the board.  He says 
at the first meeting he was told by this delegation from the 
board, when he said he wanted his job back, he was told that 
20 
going back to his job was off the table.   
 
He says, as a result of that, he needed to go home and 
reflect on the whole matter.  And I assume that he meant, 
because he was still thinking he could get his job back.   
 
And he said, he reflected and realised that he was not 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 163 of 254 
 
wanted at Eskom anymore.  He said it was clear that the 
board did not have him as part of his future plans at Eskom 
and he realised that if he was going to litigate to try and get 
the job back, financially he would not make it.   
 
So he then realised that he should rather accept that he 
was not going to get his job back and talk about money.  He 
says at the second meeting, that is when there was a 
discussion about money and ultimately, he was given... the 
settlement agreement was that he would get a year’s salary.  
That is the evidence he gave.   
10 
 
Now my question was, if Mr Matona or any of the other 
two executives, who did not return, if they decided on their 
own to leave Eskom, why did the board authorise that they 
should be paid a year’s salary?   
 
Because if somebody wants to leave, you let them leave.  
They resign.  And they get... if there are any benefits that 
you get from resigning in the company, you will get those 
benefits. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not get given more benefits. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I did say is that, however, where the 
company does not want you back and you want to go back, 
ten there is a dispute and then in that context the company 
could say:  We will pay you so much, a year’s salary 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 164 of 254 
 
provided you agree to resign and let us part ways.   
 
So in that way the company is in effect buying his 
departure from the company.  Then I can understand that 
situation.   
 
But where somebody... where the company has no 
problem with you continuing working for it and you say you 
are no longer interested, one would have expect the 
company to say:  Well, then put in your resignation and what 
normally happens when anybody resigns will happen.  Do 
you want to comment on this? 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I think Matona is making some 
errors.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
DR NGUBANE:   I did not intervene with the CCMA to say 
they must postpone the hearing.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I may be wrong in saying that he said it is 
you but he certainly said the man at Eskom who ever 
represented Eskom but I thought he said it is you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I read that... can I read from his 
affidavit Chairperson? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says:   
“At the first CCMA hearing on 13 April 2015...”   
 
Now by that time Mr Tsotsi is out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 165 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“...Eskom represented by the then chairperson of 
the 
board, 
Dr 
Ben 
Ngubane, 
requested 
a 
postponement to enable the Eskom Board to consult 
the shareholder on what Eskom could concede or 
offer in the CCMA reconciliation process.   
Eskom requested two or more other subsequent 
postponements during which time they approached 
me and requested to negotiate directly with me.   
In 
my 
interaction 
with 
the 
Eskom 
Board 
10 
representatives, Dr Ngubane, Mr Romeo Khumalo, 
Mr Venete Klein, it was clear that the option of my 
return to my job to Eskom was off the table.   
The only issue being returns of my separation on the 
company.” 
 
Well, I went further but maybe you can concentrate on 
the first paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So from that affidavit it is clear that 
he says one, the meeting at the CCMA, the first meeting at 
the CCMA was during April which is when Mr Tsotsi was no 
20 
longer chairperson of the board.  Two, he specifically 
mentions that you were there and you were part of three 
representatives of the board of Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   At the CCMA, I did not contact Eskom 
lawyers.  I presume such an arrangement of postponing will 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 166 of 254 
 
be dealt with by legal representatives.   
 
I met Mr Matona during the break and we had a 
discussion.  I was looking for the minutes of the Audit and 
Risk Committee when they were employing Dentons.   
 
One of the statements they make is that:  Please, talk to 
the negotiating team.  Ask Dentons to curb their price 
because Dentons wanted to go not on a fixed rate but just in 
terms of this.   
 
Ask them to curb their price and ask them to finalise the 
scope of work with us because we want in three months’ time 
10 
to have the senior executives back at Eskom.  I will try and 
find those minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because to me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   ...it is very clear that the scope did not 
include sending away the senior executives but they were 
expected to return.  And at no meeting did the board take a 
decision that we want... we do not want these people back.  
At no stage, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say then about why the board 
decided they should be paid each one a year’s salary or 
thereabout in circumstances where the board had never said 
we do not want you back? 
DR NGUBANE:   Because at some stage, we were 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 167 of 254 
 
informed... I cannot recall exactly whether it was P & G or 
which committee, that the people wanted to part ways with 
Eskom.   
 
Now the challenge was to make this parting of ways as 
amicable as possible.  Hence, we were given the task to talk 
to the senior executives who wanted to go so that this thing 
is amicable, the parting is amicable and there is a proper 
settlement.   
 
I did not go into the discussions about how much the 
settlement would be.  It was P & G who did that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was leading P & G at the time?  It’s 
not Ms Klein, right? 
DR NGUBANE:   I think it was Zethembe Khosa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no.  It could not have been him.  It 
must have been Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because Mr Zethembe Khosa was now 
acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see my difficulty ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   I may be wrong about ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  That is fine.  My difficulty is 
simple that whereas an employer, I have no problem with you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 168 of 254 
 
coming back after you have been suspended and continue 
working for me but you decide you want to go, why must I 
pay such a lot of money to you?  It is your decision.  You 
wanted to go.  I want you to continue.  Why must I pay? 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, you are right.  However, there 
was a lot of panic at that stage at Eskom.  So I presume it 
was to try and limit the fall out because by large, these 
decision to suspend did not really been because we wanted 
to suspend.   
 
They came about through all sorts of processes.  So I 
10 
think the issue was to try and limit the fall out.  I mean, 
going back to court to fight about claims and so on.   
 
It does not state it but I think this must have been the 
reason why a settlement that is amicable were sought.  I 
have not read the settlement documents of any of the 
executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Ja.  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I am not sure what it says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   But I am sure the motivation was to have a 
20 
good separation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is really strange to me.  I would 
have thought even if they were... it was though that they 
would pursue mitigation, I would have thought that Eskom 
would say:  Look, what are they going to say about us?  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 169 of 254 
 
Because we never said we do not want them back.  They are 
the ones who say they no longer want to work for us. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if anyone of them is going to go court, 
let us see that but we are not going to pay a year’s salary for 
somebody who decides on their own they are leaving.  That 
is my thinking.  But you... it may be that you have said all 
you can say about the issue. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I cannot justify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   But my thinking is, after the commitment 
that in three months’ time stated in writing to Dentons you 
must be back at work, means to me that there was never an 
intention that they must never come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be good if you would be able to 
lay 
your 
hands 
on 
those 
minutes 
or 
give 
whatever 
information to your legal team to pass onto the evidence 
leader so that we can look for those minutes.  That we may 
have that. 
DR NGUBANE:   I will do so Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we are at four o’clock.  Let us talk 
about how far we can go. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 170 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   From your side Dr Ngubane we can still go 
on, is it not? 
DR NGUBANE:   Until midnight, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Ja, that is good.  I think from 
your lawyers also there is no problem. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly not midnight, Chair. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  But let us have an idea in 
terms of... we have to strike a balance between not taking 
10 
too long...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But please do justice to all the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what is your assessment based on that 
of how much more time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Will Chair be fine if we estimate five 
o’clock? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that would still be fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let me ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us try ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...to beat that deadline. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, it is fine.  But maybe we 
can take a short adjournment now and then return.  Okay let 
us take a short adjournment.  We will resume at quarter past 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 171 of 254 
 
four. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  Just a last shot, Dr 
Ngubane, on what we were talking about before the break 
about the payment to the executives, that if the position is 
that indeed Eskom or the board was quite happy to have 
the executives back at work then it means that Eskom paid, 
10 
I think – I think there was mention of about R18 million? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
a 
little 
over 
18 
million, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, paid to the three executives, 
together about R18 million so that executives that the 
Eskom board wanted to come back to work would go away.  
Does it make sense?  Eskom wants these executives back 
but it pays them R18 million so that they can go away. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I am sure if they went to 
court and what to claim it would be more than that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Ja, Dr 
Ngubane, the court issue, if you want them back would not 
arise, then you will simply get them back. 
DR NGUBANE:   Excuse me? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 172 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I say the court issue, if you want them 
back would not arise because you will simply get them 
back, the executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   You mean the CCMA? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The executives. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you are prepared to get them back, 
court disputes do not arise because they will simply come 
back. 
DR NGUBANE:   And I was saying if there was litigation. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   For claims and all that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   It probably would cost far more than 18 
million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they had a case. 
DR NGUBANE:   Invariably the Labour Court keep 
complaining. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought – I would have thought 
that the board would have a good case to say well, they 
must tell us where did we say we do not want them.  Where 
did we say we do not want them, they must tell us, show us 
were, when did we say that?   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 173 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, the 
legal representatives for Mr Ngubane handed me what, on 
the face of it, is a minute of Eskom Holdings Audit and 
Risk Committee dated 14 April 2015.  I think that is what 
Dr Ngubane may have referred to during his testimony.  
Their minute is, however not signed and I have been – 
what I am being referred to are two paragraphs in the 
minute.  The one underlined reads: 
“Commercial to get an agreement from Dentons to 
cap the price and commit to providing regular 
10 
biweekly 
reports 
in 
order 
to 
expedite 
the 
investigation 
so 
as 
to 
facilitate 
that 
the 
four 
executives promptly resume their duties…” 
I think “in Eskom” that part is cut out.  Then: 
“The resolution is resolved that Commercial to send 
an urgent email to Dentons indicating Eskom’s 
position and also get response from Dentons in 
terms of the specific clauses in the standard NEC 
contract.” 
I will leave the other part. 
20 
“Commercial to get an agreement from Dentons to 
cap the price and commit to providing regular 
biweekly reports in order to expedite investigations 
so as to facilitate that the four executives promptly 
resume their duties in Eskom.” 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 174 of 254 
 
14 April 2015 but it is unsigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in April? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is in April 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I guess that they need to be - 
somebody who was at the meeting needs to say whether 
what is written in the minutes reflect what was discussed 
before we can accept them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other ones have been accepted 
because they have Dr Ngubane’s signature.  
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Yes 
– 
oh, 
and 
Dr 
Ngubane 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we get somebody who can say this is 
a true reflection of the minutes and then if that is so then 
there is no problem.  But that might be arranged for.  There 
minutes that are signed that are somewhere in Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this might just be an unsigned copy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the members …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I think Dr Ngubane’s lawyers 
could probably obtain a signed version and then we can 
take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 175 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course if those minutes reflected 
the board’s position, the challenge is even bigger. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say – so there is even evidence that 
the board …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Audit and Risk, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the audit and risk. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The audit and risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I am saying is, if what audit 
and risk committee was saying reflected the position of the 
10 
board then there even a greater challenge to say why then 
pay so much because it is clear you wanted them back, you 
know?  But we have discussed it  with Dr Ngubane, I am 
not asking you to say anything further unless you feel you 
want to say something. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I would say the delegation of 
authority at Eskom gives these committees delegated 
approval authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I mean, not everything except it is beyond 
20 
the budget it should come back to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.  So is that to say the – in 
regard to this matter that the audit and risk committee had 
all the power, had the same power as the board, had been 
delegated enough power to make whatever decisions? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 176 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Absolutely, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, alright.  So I think it is 
important just to get signed minutes so that we are sure 
that it reflects what was said at the committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Dr Ngubane, 
before the adjournment you were saying you never saw the 
agreements of the – the settlement agreements of the 
executives or vet the details of it. 
DR NGUBANE:   No.  Once I got a report… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   That settlements had been arrived at but 
the quantities were not mentioned. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But can you recall?  You have in 
fact signed two of those settlement agreements.  You 
signed a settlement agreement for Mr Marokane and the 
one for Ms Molefe.  Okay?  I think they are in your file. 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will just read the dates.  One for Mr 
Marokane is 28 May.  For the record, Chairperson, page 
reference is 263 of bundle 9.  Eskom bundle 09(A), page 
20 
263.  So what you have been shown there is the settlement 
agreement of Mr Marokane, you will see you signed.   
DR NGUBANE:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your signature is just above his and 
then his below.  Do you recall this?  Do you recognise…? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 177 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, my signature is sitting there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is 28 May 2015 and the one for 
Ms Molefe is page 274.  That one is signed on 25 June 
2015. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  I was mistaken, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  The other thing I want to add to 
that, Dr Ngubane, is that 25 – by 25 June 2015 the board 
had already told Dentons do not do further investigation.  
In fact the board tells Dentons on 11 June – Dentons write: 
“On 11 July 2015 we were requested to prepare a 
10 
detailed presentation to the board in addition to a 
draft 
report 
dealing 
with 
the 
state 
of 
the 
investigation to date.  We understand that this was 
due to the need to meet the deadlines for various 
other commitments that had been made by the 
board 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
timeframes 
of 
the 
investigation.  A detailed presentation to the board 
was delivered on 25, 26, 2015.  For these purposes 
investigatory activities ceases shortly after 11 June 
2015 
and 
resources 
were 
redirected 
from 
the 
20 
normal 
course 
of 
the 
investigation 
to 
the 
development of preliminary findings.” 
So if the audit and risk committee meeting is to go by, 
expedite your process so that the executives can come 
back, by the time you tell Dentons to not do further work, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 178 of 254 
 
there was room open for Ms Molefe to come back on the 
strength of those minutes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So why did she not come back? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, as far as I know, all of them had 
decided to seek separation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But they say they were frustrated by 
the board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I do not know, Chairperson, 
because, you know, whether this was false information or 
10 
what but that was the standpoint where all the further 
negotiations took off.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a point relating to the meeting 
of the 11 t h which I just want to address with you. Do your 
recall Mr Nick Linnell?  He is present in the meeting with 
the board. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we heard you saying:  Nick, we 
are contracting with you and not ENS.   
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That is right.  So Mr Nick then 
gets contracted. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, sir.  [Laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, whatever words – ja, two 
witnesses before the Commission said it was not an 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 179 of 254 
 
appointment but it was an agreement that we will use Mr 
Nick Linnell and he was used, we could see from the 
documentation, to draft the media release, being invited to 
meetings of audit and risk and P &G which is People in 
Governance. 
DR NGUBANE:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the board did engage – let me use 
the word engage Mr Nick Linnell. 
DR NGUBANE:   There were frantic efforts coming from the 
office of the Chairperson for the tender board committee to 
10 
meet to produce a contract for Mr Linnell.  He was even 
asking the board build programme meeting to convert itself 
to a tender committee to achieve this.  I objected to this.  
In fact there is an email – I must give it to my 
representative – where there is this to and fro, must now 
have a tender committee.  I said I cannot – I will still 
Chairman of the tender board, I cannot just create a 
meeting from thin air and say sit here and give Mr Linnell 
his contract, it is a process.  So I am saying to Nick, if we 
contract, we will be contracting with you, not other people.  
20 
That I think was the essence of that discussion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, well – so that is what the board 
did. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, we never completed the process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So why was he requested to formulate 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 180 of 254 
 
– remember during the meeting? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You go out and you say Romeo has 
given you the name of a person, he said he will formulate 
the media release and you tell them – you call in Ronnie 
and you come back at some point and say Ronnie says the 
person is not available now but we must formulate a 
statement and give it to him.  But at that point Nick also 
says I have prepared the draft.  The board says, let us look 
at it. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, as I say, there was this frantic effort 
to conclude the process for him to consult.  However, 
because the shareholders had given this task to the audit 
and risk committee, the tender board would not carry on 
with that process.  I think that is what caused the further 
delay because then the responsibility shifted from the 
tender board committee, you know, to ARC, audit and risk. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But tell the Chairperson, Dr Ngubane, 
was Mr Nick Linnell engaged by the board to assist in what 
the board had started as in the build-up towards the 
20 
commissioning of the investigation?  
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So you then have Mr Linnell, at 
some point his engagement is said we do not need you 
anymore.  He received an email, he says we do not need 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 181 of 254 
 
you anymore.  Are you aware of that? 
DR NGUBANE:   I am aware the ARC decided otherwise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the executives are suspended 
based on the resolution of the board, an inquiry is 
instituted but then is short-lived on Dentons own report 
and Dentons own report says the findings are inconclusive 
because this is a midpoint report.  I will read it to you. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I agree with what you are saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you – okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   All I am just pointing out… 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   That the work was going to be arranged in 
terms of task orders.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know, the audit and risk would say 
now this is your task.  But audit and risk had also said we 
reserve the right to terminate the inquiry at any point when 
they think they have got what they want. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So they wanted now to get more work for 
20 
themselves. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who is that? 
DR NGUBANE:   Dentons. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja.  They wanted to now create another 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 182 of 254 
 
order so that they can go on to the next phase and that 
phase would have been essentially criminal investigation.  
Now that is not what had been the intention, the intention 
was to get a hold, do a deep dive, get a hold of the 
problems in the organisation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja and exactly the deep dive gets – 
you said the shareholder wants it real and pure findings of 
fact.  Now this report, Dentons rather: 
This 
report 
represents 
a 
snapshot 
of 
the 
investigation at the midpoint of the investigation 
10 
period (about 18 June 2015) and is provided to 
Eskom on the specific request of Eskom.  The 
findings, views, conclusions and recommendations 
set out in this report are accordingly subject to 
verification and testing, provided to Eskom as a 
record of the investigation as set out at the 
midpoint of the investigation period and do not 
constitute definitive findings, views, conclusions 
and recommendations.” 
Now 
where 
is 
the 
deep 
dive 
with 
the 
findings 
the 
20 
shareholder wanted?  Did the shareholder get what it 
wanted? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well – can I read this Chairperson? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 183 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   “Deliverables. 
“The 
Dentons 
team 
shall 
submit 
the 
following 
deliverables, 
progress 
reports 
to 
be 
issued 
fortnightly, draft inquiry report dealing with the 
independent finding of the inquiry, final inquiry 
report.” 
Now what we got in terms of what the deep dive produced 
where a number of recommendations which helped us to 
improve the system and stop load shedding.  That was the 
deliverable that we wanted.  We are not about to create a 
10 
forensic 
investigation 
in 
terms 
of 
who 
broke 
the 
procurement law, who did what or who did that.  We just 
wanted to fix the organisation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it seems on Dentons’ report this 
was not a deep dive but a shallow dive. 
DR NGUBANE:   Let me say so, sir, depends on how tall 
you are whether it is a deep dive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because they say you cannot – what is 
the word …[intervenes] 
DR NGUBANE:   And sorry, sir, can I also say this? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   By the way, at that stage Eskom was very 
short of money, I think that factor must also be borne in 
mind, you know?  In the following year, I think that is 
March 2017, Eskom had profit, it had investments, it was 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 184 of 254 
 
selling 
its 
electricity 
into 
the 
neighbouring 
countries 
because there was excess supply and we were paid in 
dollars, not rands.  So Eskom was creating a nest egg.  
Then we could have gone back and said now we are doing 
a real deep five but unfortunately, there were other 
pressures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so the deep dive was ultimately 
not done? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, were a short man, so it was a deep 
dive. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane, Mr Tsotsi was here and 
he, reflecting on the suspensions of the executives, the 
ultimate 
separation 
agreements 
concluded 
with 
the 
executives, against the backdrop of no allegations of 
wrongdoing, the board said we are making against them.  
Against the backdrop of an inquiry that did not have to 
investigate any misconduct or wrongdoing on the part of 
the executives he said to the Chairperson I think the 
purpose was to remove these people in order to make a 
space for other people. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, that is a horrific assumption, 
Chairperson.  I do not think that sophistry within us to 
actually plot this thing and plan it that way.  The only 
reason that we ask that the Minister allows Brian Molefe to 
come across was because the Acting CEO, Mr Zethembe 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 185 of 254 
 
Koza was a none executive director.  He did not have the 
reach that a real career CEO would have in reaching out to 
all the segments of the organisation.  So the decision was 
let us find someone who is familiar with SOEs, who is 
familiar with public service who can have a proven record 
that they have actually turned around some organisation.  
That turnaround to Molefe, who had done excellent word at 
PIC had taken the asset value of PIC from 1 billion in 
seven years to 800 billion.   
He had come to Transnet, he had taken a very 
10 
poorly functioning rail system, particularly the coal line and 
the coal exports at Richards Bay and turned it completely 
around so that they had about R372 billion to spare.  
Now these were the considerations to say let us 
find someone with that expertise to help us and we were 
right because the whole atmosphere changed at Eskom, 
the 
efficiency, 
the 
communications 
between 
different 
centres of work changed.  I went with him to some of the 
power stations.  Whenever he appeared people were 
applauding, clapping and he would there in the centre of 
20 
the room and dance and sing.  You know, it was incredible 
and it just changed so that within eight months there was 
no more load shedding.  That was the consideration, we 
are not so sophisticated as to plan to conspire.  If people 
did that, well, I was not part of it, you know, but that is how 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 186 of 254 
 
we approached it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  You know, as you were talking, Dr 
Ngubane, I am reminded of the point you said earlier on.  
You could not do a deep dive because of financial 
constraints and even this minute, if we are to go by, earlier 
you were saying the audit and risk told Dentons to 
expedite, cap the price.  Now what motivates you to spend 
over 18 million in settlement with the executives instead of 
taking them back? 
DR NGUBANE:   But, as I said, sir, we got a report that 
10 
they were not willing to come back so that represented a 
fight looming ahead. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, could you – then it goes back to 
the Chairperson’s question, why then pay them out? 
DR NGUBANE:   Because if people go the Labour Court 
and say we were badly treated, we were unfairly dismissed, 
this, this and that, we want to put this claim, I think they 
would have won it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Ngubane, how could they have won it 
if you did not treat them badly? 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I mean, that is what they thought. 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have to prove that you did 
not treat them badly. 
DR NGUBANE:   But Mr Matona, the CMA, was very angry, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 187 of 254 
 
says you people destroyed our integrity and all that.   you 
know, they were angry with us because our understanding 
of 
the 
term 
suspension 
was 
different 
from 
their 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, this is part of what 
complicates the matter because if you know one, there 
were good reasons for the investigation, you believe that 
you did nothing wrong by suspending them, in any event, 
while they were suspended, you were paying them their full 
pay, all their benefits, so when they are supposed to come 
10 
back and the investigation is done or is about to be 
finished, if they decide to leave in circumstances where 
you had to say to them, we have no problem with you, you 
should come back, but they decide to leave, on what 
grounds can they put in any complaint? 
DR NGUBANE:   But, you know, Chairperson, I do not know 
how much money we spent on legal opinion at Eskom.  
Most of our actions were driven by legal opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   Most of it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But on the facts that you know would 
you say that there was any – there would have been any 
basis for anybody to say they were badly treated? 
DR NGUBANE:   When people are just suspended and 
there are no charges I think they stand a very good chance 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 188 of 254 
 
of winning in court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why did you suspend them then if you 
felt they would win in court. 
DR NGUBANE:   Because our understanding of suspension 
was like step-aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if they won in court what would they 
get, because you were paying them, what would they get?    
DR NGUBANE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is not like you suspended 
them without pay so you would be ordered to pay their 
10 
money or any back pay, you would have been paying them, 
so what is the worst that would happen to Eskom? 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson you know that becomes for 
legal experts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] you see part of the problem 
is, one, if your version and that of Ms Klein is correct that 
the board had no problem with them and wanted them to 
come back, but well Ms Klein didn’t say this, but you are 
saying it, you say well maybe they would sue us and even 
though they are the ones who decided they don’t want to 
20 
continue working for Eskom so we wanted the separation to 
be amicable, even if they sued you I mean how much could 
they get if you are going to make it clear that we never 
said we don’t want them back, actually we wanted them 
back, here are the minutes of the Audit & Risk Committee.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 189 of 254 
 
If they had not decided to go they would still be working for 
Eskom, and if they left Eskom it would be for other reasons 
later but not because of this investigation, but I appreciate 
that we have been talking about this for some time, it is 
just that it keeps on coming back, but if you want to say 
something say so. 
DR NGUBANE:    Chairperson if we had an advisor like you 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
DR NGUBANE:   We would hopefully not need any kind of 
10 
... 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughing] yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I guess that is why he is a judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Dr Ngubane ja going back to what 
Mr Tsotsi’s observation to the Chairperson was, why was – 
fresh into the suspension you will recall you get that media 
conference convened by Minister Lynne Brown on the 17 t h 
of April 2015, and there she announces her decision to 
second Mr Molefe to Eskom. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And hence this observation that Mr 
Matona when told coming back to Eskom is not an option 
for you and he is talking about this in April and then after 
April subsequent meetings, it’s because the gap is now 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 190 of 254 
 
closed by Minister Lynne Brown seconding Mr Molefe to 
Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   If I remember well Chairperson Minister 
Brown said we would like Mr Matona to come back to 
Eskom but we would have to redefine the roles. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   You know which mean there could be two 
people at Eskom, the acting CE, the old CE, I don’t know 
how she was going to re-arrange those jobs, but that was a 
real possibility. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which might suggest that as far as the 
Minister was concerned, I don’t know about the Board, but 
as far as the Minister was concerned if Mr Matona came 
back there was no option of him coming back as CEO as 
long as Mr Brian Molefe was there, because I think he 
actually makes that remark in the context of bringing, 
appointed Mr Molefe as Acting CEO.   
DR NGUBANE:   It could be Chairperson but one of them 
could probably have become the COO. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes, no, no I accept that it 
could be but you know if you have been Group CEO and 
then now you must be something else, it might not be 
something that everybody would take well.   I just mention 
but I accept that that remark is attributed to the Minister, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 191 of 254 
 
not to the Board. 
DR NGUBANE:    At that stage I think Mr Molefe was still 
on secondment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   He was not a full CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And Transnet I am sure would have 
probably wanted him back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So but that even never got discussed at 
10 
the Board level. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja she, just to your point about Matona 
might be coming back she did say, she also did discount 
Molefe and Matona working together for a period, “I would 
like Molefe for the full year to actually work in turning 
around Eskom and if that means with Mr Matona beyond 
three months time we will find another title for him.”  I 
think that is what you were referring to? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now at that stage Dr Ngubane were 
you aware of Mr Molefe’s performance at Transnet? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well I was in government Chairperson and 
we all knew what Molefe was doing, we all knew, it was 
just public knowledge, he was a whizz kid who had a 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 192 of 254 
 
golden hand, you know.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Had the Minister when making this 
announcement on the 17 t h of April had prior consultation 
with the Board.  
DR NGUBANE:   No I think the consultations had gone on 
for some time and were ...[indistinct] to the Transnet Board 
and the Transnet Board had responded that they were 
willing to release Molefe, I think that is the time when the 
Minister made the announcement, when the secondment 
was final, was approved, I don’t think it was before the 
10 
secondment was approved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, now you have got to be sure about 
that because the Minister here on the 17h of April 
announced that she had consulted with the President, the 
Deputy President, the Transnet Board and the Eskom 
Board but had to later retract that statement, because the 
Boards had not yet been consulted. 
DR NGUBANE:   No I lose that, I cannot follow that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall when – I think in your 
affidavits you said when there was a gap in the CEO it was 
20 
the Minister, Lynne Brown, who suggested to you that Mr 
Brian Molefe should be considered for the position of CEO. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 193 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the idea to have Mr Molefe at 
Eskom came from the Minister? 
DR NGUBANE:   Probably but everyone was looking 
around as if – and obviously we were consulting her, but 
the sequence of events is difficult, remember now, but I 
can safely say she did point to Molefe as a possible 
secondment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now in the – that ruling of the 
Chairperson in Ms Suzanne Daniels’ disciplinary hearing 
the Chairperson had this to say and I want you to comment 
10 
on this to the Chairperson before us here.  He writes about 
Molefe and Singh and he says Molefe and Singh took up 
the reins at Eskom in the phase of damning evidence that 
the two of them were instrumental whilst at Transnet of 
causing the increase of the estimated total cost from 
R38.6billion to R54.5billion for the acquisition of 1 060 
locomotives 
without 
compliance 
with 
procurement 
processes.   To date no steps have been taken to recover 
the excess of R17billion lost to the people of South Africa.  
Instead Molefe and Singh were allowed to pursue their new 
20 
interests at Eskom.  In the Transnet deal R5billion was 
paid 
to 
an 
unknown 
entity 
which 
intervened, 
name 
Tequesta Group Limited incorporated in Hong Kong and 
headed by one Salim Aziz Essa a native of Polokwane and 
now residing in Dubai.   In May 2015 Essa purchased 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 194 of 254 
 
Trillian, 
a 
competitor 
to 
Regiments, 
which 
features 
prominently in the hearing before me.  That issue about the 
locomotives we know that it was widely reported in the 
media. 
 
Was the Board not aware of that? 
DR NGUBANE:   It never arose and I don’t think anyone of 
us has an in-depth knowledge of these figures and the 
timeframe I am not sure what the timeframe was when the 
locomotives and them coming to Eskom, but it never 
featured as a negative in any discussion. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I wanted to say that well I haven’t 
looked at what was known at the time when Mr Brian 
Molefe was seconded to Eskom, what was publically 
known, I haven’t looked at that, but certainly since this 
Commission has been hearing evidence, and of course 
much before that in the years preceding this commission 
there was a lot about – allegations of corruption at 
Transnet, including during the time when Mr Brian Molefe 
was in charge and Mr Singh was there, but certainly in this 
commission there has been a lot of evidence which 
20 
includes allegations, certain allegations against them while 
they were at Transnet and there are also allegations, there 
has been evidence led in this Commission in relation to 
allegations of wrongdoing on their part in Eskom so the 
picture that seems to emerge is this, and a lot of people 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 195 of 254 
 
will understand this picture against the proposition that the 
Gupta family had used various people within government 
and in SOE’s in order to loot and a lot of people will 
understand this picture against the background that the 
way they worked was that they wanted certain people in 
certain strategic positions that they knew would cooperate 
with them in their plans of looting public funds, and the 
picture that seems emerge is that you will remember the 
Public Protector ’s report that led to Mr Brian Molefe 
leaving Eskom, part of it was that it referred to a lot of 
10 
communications between him and the Guptas and I think 
visits to their house as well, that he was Group CEO of 
Transnet and during the time when he was Group CEO 
certain 
transactions 
happened 
that 
benefitted 
Gupta 
associated entities in transactions under Transnet. 
 
Similar allegations are made against Arnot Singh 
and then you have this situation where at a certain point in 
time according to Mr Zola Tsotsi a meeting – he gets called 
to a meeting in Durban in the President’s residence, there 
is Ms Dudu Myeni, there is Mr Tsotsi, there is the former 
20 
President, according to Mr Tsotsi and Mr Nick Linnell had 
been called as well by Ms Myeni according to both of them.  
There is a discussion that an inquiry must be instituted at 
Eskom and that certain executives must be suspended. 
 
He gets to Eskom and puts this to the Board, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 196 of 254 
 
ultimately the idea of an inquiry happens and suspensions 
happen, and you have this situation where on your 
evidence and on the evidence of Ms Klein the Board had 
no problem with these executives coming back after the 
investigation but nevertheless they are paid each one a 
year ’s salary to go away and then once they are not there 
Mr Brian Molefe is brought in to be Group CEO at Eskom 
and after some time Mr Arnot Singh is brought in to be 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
at 
Eskom, 
and 
against 
that 
background, think about the evidence that I have heard 
10 
from some of the witnesses about the Guptas, one of the 
first witnesses to testify before the Commission was Mr 
Themba Maseku, who used to be the CEO of GCIS or 
Director General, who said he had a meeting with Mr Ajay 
Gupta during which Mr Ajay Gupta demanded at about 
R600million, the budget that was to be used for media 
advertising and so on by Government should be used on 
their newspaper and when he resisted that he told him that 
anyone who did not cooperate with them they report to the 
President, and the President – I think he said sort him out, 
20 
and ultimately when he continued to refuse to cooperate 
with them Mr Ajay Gupta said to Mr Masego I will report to 
your seniors so that they can replace you and then a few 
months later Mr Masego gets transferred from his position 
under circumstances that to say the least seem mysterious. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 197 of 254 
 
 
This is a man who six weeks before he was 
removed had been subjected to a performance assessment 
and the panel included his Minister, Minister Chabane, and 
they were so happy with is performance in that position 
that they gave him something 114 or 120%. Six weeks later 
this person who was such an excellent performer in his job 
is moved to another position. 
 
And then I heard the evidence of Mr Jonas.  Mr 
Jonas said on the 23 r d of October 2015, that’s the same 
year we are talking about in regard to Eskom, on the 23 r d 
10 
of October 2016 he had a meeting at the Gupta residence 
with a Gupta brother, he could not remember which one, 
but the evidence establishes that the only Gupta brother 
who was in the house, in the premises, was Mr Tony Gupta 
and Mr Jonas says the Gupta brother who was there who 
had a meeting with me, told me that Mr Nhanhla Nene, the 
Minister of Finance at the time, was going to be fired 
because he was not working with them, that is the Guptas 
and he offered him – he said he must agree to be Minister 
of Finance after Mr Nene had been fired, but he would 
20 
have to work with them and he was prepared to – he even 
offered him R600 000 I think immediately and R600million 
or something like that later, and he said if he needed 
advisors they would provide advisors and then a few weeks 
later on the 9 t h of December indeed Mr Nene is fired.  He 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 198 of 254 
 
is replaced by Mr Des van Rooyen.   
 
Mr Des van Rooyen has given evidence before me, 
the first time he comes to National Treasury he is coming 
with two advisors and Mr Godongwana of the ANC had told 
the DG, Mr Fuzile the day before you are going to get a 
new minister and he is going to come with two advisors 
that he doesn’t know. 
 
One of the things that Mr Jonas said to me he was 
told by the Gupta brother who was with him on the 23 r d of 
October was that there were certain people that they as 
10 
the Guptas were working with and he mentioned, two of the 
people he mentioned were Mr Brian Molefe and Minister 
Lynne Brown, that is part of the evidence I have heard. 
DR NGUBANE:   The second one? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am saying he mentioned two, one 
is Mr Brian Molefe, the other one was Minister Lynne 
Brown, two of the people that Mr Jonas said he was told by 
Mr Tony Gupta these are some of the people we work with, 
you must also work with us, and Mr Jonas even said they 
said something like these ones, or Mr Brian Molefe, his 
20 
career is in fact taken care of, his future is taken care of, 
or something like that. 
 
That is what I was told by Mr Jonas in evidence. 
 
So when therefore one looks at what happened at 
Eskom, against this background, some of it is in evidence 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 199 of 254 
 
before the Commission, it causes one concern and then of 
course you may or may not have heard Mr Tsotsi say – on 
one of the days when he gave evidence, that on one 
occasion he had a meeting with Tony Gupta and Tony 
Gupta showed him on his cell phone Whatsapp messages 
that were exchanged by – he said about half of the 
members of the Board of Eskom, it was a Whatsapp Group, 
things that they were talking about, he said he would not 
give them, but he must just look. 
 
Now if all of those things are true it causes one to 
10 
be quite worried about what exactly was happening, do you 
understand? 
DR NGUBENE:   I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.   Dr Ngubane 
to add to that immediately before us also we have Mr 
Tsotsi who together with the Board takes resolution that 
lead to the initiation of the inquiry, the suspension of the 
executives, the Boards, and I use the words quite carefully, 
20 
engages with Mr Nick Linnell and seven days later – seven 
days after those resolutions are made on the 19 t h the 
Boards in a meeting decides that Mr Tsotsi should be 
charged for exactly the resolutions that the Board itself 
took with him. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 200 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I should add this while you are 
reflecting on the question Dr Ngubane, I don’t want you to 
forget the question, but he can always repeat it, Mr Tsotsi 
gets trashed and ultimately he leaves the Eskom board in 
circumstances where if his evidence was true the previous 
month, he left at the end of March, he said that around the 
beginning of February he said it was the State of the 
Nation Address and he says he was called by Minister 
Brown and at the meeting with Minister Brown, Minister 
Brown I think complained that she was, she had received 
10 
complaints both from the Board and from management that 
he was interfering with management or operational issues, 
he must stop that otherwise she will find somebody else to 
do this job as Chairperson.   
 
He says a few hours later Tony Gupta phoned him 
and he said I see that you are not assisting us, you must 
know or you must know or remember that we put you in 
that position, we can take you out of that position.  Two 
months later he is out of Eskom. 
 
Now of course I haven’t decided what is true and 
20 
what is not true, all I am simply saying is if some of this 
evidence is true it might connect in a certain way with 
other evidence and it might cause one to be worried.  That 
is all I am saying. 
 
But Mr Seleka had put a question, I think he must 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 201 of 254 
 
repeat it because I have disturbed your attention. 
DR NGUBANE:   Ja, ja, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka I think you repeat the 
question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now what the 
Chairperson has just explained, augments the question, 
because that is the picture you see in the information 
presented to us Dr Ngubane.  We in fact hear from the 
evidence that the Chairperson says to the Board the 
President has asked us to do this.  The minute of that 
10 
meeting which you signed on the 9 t h of March says exactly 
that, which was signed virtually two years later.   
 
When you signed that long time after the meeting 
you really have to apply your mind to make sure the contents 
are exactly as it took place many months before, is it not?  Is 
it not Dr Ngubane?  When you sign tomorrow. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For an incident that took place yesterday 
it is still fresh in your memory.  You can remember. 
DR NGUBANE:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But when you sign twelve months, 
eighteen months, twenty months later it is hard to remember 
what happened.  You have to refresh your memory and you 
have to go through the document to ensure that it is a 
correct reflection of what took place so a long time ago.  And 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 202 of 254 
 
there you find President has expressly that he has concerns.  
The Board is aware of this.  
 The Board calls for the Minister; the Minister comes 
puts the same position to the Board.  The inquiry, the 
executives must be suspended – must step aside whichever 
way it was used.   
You ultimately suspend them because you say it was 
clear to you now that this thing was coming from the 
government, from the shareholder.   
And in your affidavit you say you were taken aback 
10 
by this because you were an all new Board – an all new 
Board except for two people Mr Tsotsi himself and Ms 
Mabude.  So the Board does not know what is happening it 
was an I am trying to get to – ja at this time all of us your 
affidavit paragraph 4.13 –  
“All of us except Mr Tsotsi and Ms Mabude 
were newly appointed to the Board.  We were 
therefore taken by serious – surprise that we 
had to deal with an issue of such magnitude 
so early in our tenure.” 
20 
But you nonetheless agreed, you resolve it and you again 
surprisingly seven days later charge Mr Tsotsi with the 
decisions that you made with him and he is removed and you 
take over.  How should the commission deal with that? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well they say in my affidavit there was a lot 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 203 of 254 
 
of tension between the Board and Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair may I add something before Dr 
Ngubane? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Dr Ngubane may I add this – deal with it 
as well as you answered it.  You ultimately say it was clear 
that this was a request from the shareholder representative. 
DR NGUBANE:  [Inaudible] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No to make the resolutions that you did 
as the Board. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well from the minutes and deduce that 
[00:03:34] 
said 
must 
be 
done 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
shareholder and therefore even the state of the organisation 
and the company load-shedding, loss of income we had to do 
something.   
So we had to engage otherwise how would you have 
said we do not want to do this when in fact the state of the 
organisation was in a pallor state.  Load-shedding was 
20 
happening all the time.   
The War Room was getting in one month two reports, 
financial reports.  One was talking of dismal failure of the 
finances the other report was talking of a prosperous thriving 
Eskom in one month to the War Room and this is what the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 204 of 254 
 
Minister is asking us how this can be.  So we could not have 
said no we are not going to do a forensic report in the light 
of all of that.  But coming to an issue… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But – sorry you will go to the issue but 
you need to add also there were two – remember it is not 
just an investigation it is also the suspension. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay coming to the issue. 
DR NGUBANE:  Well the shareholder says if this is going to 
be credible there should be no impediment of people who 
10 
have an impact on the investigation.  Is that not what 
reasonable people would accept to say the shareholder feels 
strongly about this issue we have to do it, our shareholder 
compact actually spells out how we should cooperate with 
the shareholder and there was no other way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  My – what I am trying to get from 
you in order to explain to the Chairperson is if the decision 
is ultimately made by the Board because the Board itself 
accepts that it is the shareholder who wants the Board to 
make those decision that resolution why is it that the Board 
20 
charges Mr Tsotsi with – with charges relating to those 
decisions and yet you leave the Minister whom you say after 
the meeting – about whom you say, after the meeting with 
the Minister – paragraph 4.18 of your affidavit. 
“It 
was 
clear 
to 
the 
Board 
that 
the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 205 of 254 
 
government as the shareholder of Eskom 
required the inquiry to proceed and that the 
four executives has to “ – and I am reading 
how you write it quote “step aside” whilst the 
inquiry was underway.” 
So it is no longer Mr Tsotsi requiring this in fact on his 
version it was never him requiring this it was the President 
at the time.  And now the Board knows it is the Minister who 
wants this. 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson I spoke of the breakdown of 
10 
trust.  Tsotsi claimed the existence of a report which dealt 
with the wrongdoing of executives.  Later on he says there is 
no report.   
He suspends Koko on the basis that Koko is in 
charge of maintenance when Koko is actually in charge of 
commercial and the engineering and Mongezi Ntsokolo is in 
charge of generation and maintenance.  He does not charge 
him.  Instead he proposes that Mr Mongezi Ntsokolo 
becomes the acting CE of the organisation.  He proposes 
that a person who is on suspension [00:08:17] there would 
20 
come back as the head of – acting head of generation and 
commercial section.   
Madisela was on suspension.  He is proposed to 
come back. The Board kicks – pushes back. The Board 
decides that you cannot take a GE and make him acting 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 206 of 254 
 
when you have just removed other four GE’s in order to 
create no impedance for the investigation it does not make 
sense.   
So the Board proposes that Mr Khoza who is a non-
executive director should take the position of acting CEO.  
Now the fact that he had tried to reload – railroad us into 
passing a resolution that was giving him all the power, taking 
all the power from the Board through broad delegation to 
deviate from procurement processes and so on and the fact 
that he had in the newspapers and everywhere was talking 
10 
about him clearing executive functions.  Signing letters to 
companies and so on.   
Now although we come to a point where we are 
forced now to implement this inquiry and suspend executives 
there is a lot of frustration and ill feeling among Board 
members that this man we cannot trust.  He has lied to us 
and so on.   
That was the background to the passing of the motion 
of no confidence which was not passed because he appealed 
to us and said if you pass this resolution my livelihood will 
20 
be threatened because I am on many Boards and I depend 
on this Board earnings to live.  So then I said to my 
colleagues we do not want to destroy him so give me a 
chance to talk to him so that we do not pass the motion of no 
confidence but he resigns.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 207 of 254 
 
And then we spent a lot of hours talking with him and 
him kicking back and saying I did nothing wrong there is no 
reason for this motion.  And ultimately, I convinced him I 
think there was also Kumalo or somebody else, I convince 
him that the best solution for us and you is that we do not 
pass this resolution we safeguard your status in terms of 
other Boards just leave.  You know ultimately that is how we 
ended up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think that everybody accepts that 
this decision that there should be an inquiry at Eskom and 
10 
the idea that the executives should be suspended came from 
outside of Eskom.  Do you accept that? 
DR NGUBANE:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not come from inside Eskom.  So that 
on its own should be worrying you know.  Why are Eskom 
matters being dealt with outside of Eskom?   
 
 
Of course, some of the people who are outside of 
Eskom have a legitimate interest in Eskom like the President 
of the Country.  Like the Minister.  They have a legitimate 
interest on issues relating to Eskom and so on so one can 
20 
accept that.   
But there may be other people who might not have 
had legitimate interests and we do not know at this stage 
who exactly came up with this idea that Ms Myeni according 
Mr Tsotsi and articulating to Mr Tsotsi and if the idea has 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 208 of 254 
 
come from the President himself one would have thought that 
the President would call the Minister and discuss the idea 
with the Minister and maybe call the Minister and the 
Chairperson of the Board of Eskom discuss that there is this 
idea.   
Maybe the President did discuss it with the Minister 
maybe we just do not know but according to Mr Tsotsi and 
according to statement of Mr Nick Linnell that has been 
given to the commission at that meeting that took place at 
the President’s residence in Durban the President spoke 
10 
very little.   
The person who seemed to be – who talked most of 
the time according to I think both Mr Tsotsi and Mr Linnell 
was Ms Myeni.  So – so that worries one.  But of course, I 
have seen a statement by Ms Myeni that says well actually 
that meeting took place because Mr Tsotsi is the one who 
kept on contacting her seeking advice about Eskom issues.  I 
think I have seen something like that.   
And Ms Myeni will testify at some stage in due course 
and hopefully throw more light but it is part of what is 
20 
worrying why those matters Eskom matters were not being 
discussed at proper and legitimate Eskom structures.  You 
understand. 
DR NGUBANE:  What worries me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 209 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Is that the meeting with the Minister spells 
out the problems that Eskom is faced with.  And she 
suggests a solution that we should have a deep dive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  An inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  And then be able to deal with the problems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  Then we see this as a legitimate reason to 
carry on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  With the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  So it is not that this comes out from outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  It is that the facts are presented by the 
shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  That I am worried about these aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  We have a shareholder compact with her 
which comes from a strategic intent statement that is made 
at the beginning of our term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
DR NGUBANE:  I mean there is no way we can just say we 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 210 of 254 
 
are not following this.  What you are talking Minister does 
not make sense we will make the decisions.  We are in a 
situation where we are facing stark reality, we must do 
something about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no at the time when the Minister 
speaks to the Board that is one thing.  But that does not 
change the fact that there is a context there and the context 
is there was a meeting in Durban and to which the 
Chairperson of the Board attended where he basically was 
the only person from Eskom.  You know.  And he came back 
10 
with the idea and the Minister only comes in as I understand 
the position – only comes in because at the meeting of the 9 
March the Board says we want the Minister.   
If the Board had had no problem – had understood 
the motivation from Mr Tsotsi properly on the 9t h the Minister 
might not have come to address the Board.  But because the 
Board was not satisfied with certain things coming from Mr 
Tsotsi about these – this idea the suspension of the 
executives and the inquiry then they said we want to hear 
from the Minister.  So there is a background to it.  But I think 
20 
you have your points as well.   
DR NGUBANE:  But also Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  If a chairman treats a Board the way Mr 
Tsotsi treated us. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 211 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  There will be resentment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I accept that if you are a leader, if 
you are Chairperson and you do not treat your colleagues in 
a way that is acceptable, they will resent you.  I accept that 
that could happen.  Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Now Dr 
Ngubane reading from your affidavit paragraph 4.15.5 you 
are setting out the points discussed. 
“The Board – the points which the Board 
10 
required clarity on.” 
So the Board specifically needed to obtain 
clarity 
from 
the 
Minister 
regarding 
the 
following.  Then there is a list and I am going 
to read some of the points.  The second point 
is 
“The proposal of the appointment of Mr Nick 
Linnell.” 
The proposal to conduct the inquiry. 
“Mr Tsotsi indicated that President Zuma 
20 
required Mr Linnell to undertake the inquiry.” 
Then in Ms Klein’s affidavit and the Board resolution you say  
“you charged Mr Tsotsi with the failure to 
seek 
or 
obtain 
Board 
approval 
for 
the 
appointment of a consultant ie Mr Nick 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 212 of 254 
 
Linnell.” 
But he told you he is the President who asked him to – the 
Board to appoint him.  So what we are looking at is - was 
there substance to the charges that you levelled against him.  
Were they real charges? 
DR NGUBANE:  Well… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us deal with that first one because 
you in the Board meeting you said Nick we contracting with 
you not ENS. 
DR NGUBANE:  No.  You know Chairperson that is a red 
10 
herring in real fact.  Because we started working and talking 
and planning with Mr Linnell.  Nice gentleman, very 
knowledgeable but the process of bringing him in was 
defective.  Now we could not just simply say go away Mr 
Linnell.  He was there and he had already addressed us.  So 
we had to find a formalisation of that process through the 
proper procurement processes.   
But then at the meeting of the 11t h the Minister 
charges the Audit and Risk committee with carrying out the 
appointment of investigators and this where Mr Linnell I think 
20 
fell off because then they came up with Dentons.  So it was 
not a question of saying we do not want you at all Mr Linnell 
it was a process.   
So my comments with him at the meeting was that do 
not tell us about other people because we are talking about 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 213 of 254 
 
you.  But the process is not yet there.  It is not yet 
completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But that you did not say to him. 
DR NGUBANE:  I did not say to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You did not say that to him in the 
meeting? 
DR NGUBANE:  When I meant we are contracting with you 
that is what I meant that we – we – the process of 
contracting is about you not about other people. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is not the position that at that meeting of 
the 11t h Mr – the Board requested Mr Linnell to start doing 
certain work and actually members of the Board were making 
inputs into some – I do not know whether it was a statement 
or whatever but making inputs.   
Now if that is correct is the position not that the – the Board 
members would have known in the context of how Mr Linnell 
came that no processes had been followed in bringing him in 
and if they had known that why did they not they – what 
would be wrong with them objecting?  Saying but we cannot 
20 
put our stamp of approval to the – to this man working with 
us in circumstances where we know we are aware that there 
has been a breach of processes.   
So we as a Board cannot do that.  You Mr Chair – Mr 
Tsotsi why do that – do this because you would know 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 214 of 254 
 
otherwise the whole Board gets tainted with using somebody 
or a consultant or somebody in breach of processes.  Why 
use this person that you know should not be here? 
DR NGUBANE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR NGUBANE:  If you came or some lawyer came into our 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  We are discussing certain problems.  It is a 
friendly environment.  Surely if he participates no-one is 
10 
going to chase him out.  The only problem is going to come 
when he starts charging money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  Because then it is going to be – the 
question is going to be raised by the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  We did not agree on anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
DR NGUBANE:  But in case – in the context of being civil. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
DR NGUBANE:  You know and participating in conversations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:  We can surely do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no problem. 
DR NGUBANE:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 215 of 254 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so the point therefore is as long as 
Eskom was not incurring any costs. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In using him. 
DR NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no problem. 
DR NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Take it from there Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Did the Board know 
that Mr Tsotsi as you say in the affidavit, he had been asked 
10 
by the President at the time to invoke the services of Mr Nick 
Linnell?  If you doubted Mr Tsotsi did the Board enquire from 
the President? 
DR NGUBANE:  Nobody enquired from the Deputy – from the 
President.  Because it would have been improper.  Quite 
seriously improper to say Mr Tsotsi tells us you said this we 
do not believe him.  That is why the shareholder was brought 
in to try and reach that lack of trust you know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh okay so that is one of the points you 
say.  The Board specifically needed to obtain clarity from the 
20 
Minister regarding the following and number 2 is that point. 
What did the Minister say? 
DR NGUBANE:  About Mr Linnell? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About proposal of the appointment of Mr 
Linnell to conduct the inquiry? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 216 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:  Well the Minister ordered … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Address the Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:  Audit and Risk to work on appointing a 
consultant and then investigate.  She did not specify 
anything about Mr Linnell.  It was up to Audit and Risk to 
decide the process who ultimately gets the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that Mr Linnell at least at 
the end of the meeting of the Board with the Minister could 
well have been eligible to be considered by the Audit and 
Risk committee in due course for either being appointment 
10 
as a consultant or whatever.  Is that what he means?  It 
could have been him, it could have been somebody else. 
DR NGUBANE:  Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Are you saying Dr 
Ngubane that you pointedly raise with the Minister the 
question, the proposal of the appointment of Mr Linnell and 
the Minister did not answer to that? 
DR NGUBANE:  No I am not saying that Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Yes that is what I want to – you 
20 
need to clarify to the Chairperson. 
DR NGUBANE:  I am saying the Minister spelt out the 
process.  Audit and Risk must do this work, finding the 
investigator and then end of story.  Audit and Risk has been 
tasked with it. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 217 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes okay but here – well and I do not 
want to belabour it here the proposal is Ms Minister we have 
the Chairperson saying the President has asked us to 
appoint Mr Nick Linnell we want clarity on that? 
DR NGUBANE:  No we did not ask that Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then the other point is this.  You are – 
you wanted clarity on the role that the Board would play in 
relation to the activities of the War Room that had been set 
up to manage the power supply challenges that were facing 
Eskom. The Board was appraised of the War Room and its 
10 
activities by the Minister when she came to speak to the 
Board on 11 March 2015.  During this time the Board was not 
involved in the activities of the War Room.  Executives were 
responsible for that.  So you learn of the activities of the War 
Room from the Minister on 11 March 2015 – the new Board.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes she had spoken about complaints from 
the War Room etcetera.  But the concern of the Board was 
with the War Room focussing on Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:  And giving directives what is the role of the 
20 
Board in that situation?  That was the concern. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could – can you explain to the 
Chairperson insofar as the Minister and we understand 
complaints about the executives providing - the executives 
or 
management 
providing 
inaccurate 
information 
or 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 218 of 254 
 
inadequate information to the War Room.  Was that a 
concern to the board? 
DR NGUBANE:   Not... well, we were concerned in terms of 
the complaints that management was not providing the right 
and correct information.  We were concerned about that but 
we had no direct input into the War Room information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So would you have been concerned 
at the time here on the 11t h of March when the minister is 
telling you about the activities of the War Room? 
DR NGUBANE:   What we wanted that information passes on 
10 
the way to the War Room.  In fact, the minister conceded 
that it is one of the chairperson of board committee would go 
to the War Room to represent the board.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  If... you may address the 
Chairperson because what I am trying to figure out is.  When 
does the board become concerned about the issues of 
management relative to the information given to the War 
Room?  Is it on this meeting or after this meeting? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no, no.  I think on the 9 t h of March this 
issue was raised.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And do you know why that issue of 
concern which relates to Eskom’s operations does not find 
its way into Eskom’s reasons or the board’s reasons for 
suspending the executives? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, to us it was just inefficient.  There were 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 219 of 254 
 
a lot of inefficiencies at Eskom.  That is why we are having 
load shedding but it was part of that.  Eskom was broke.  It 
was part of that whole story.  But the minister pre-empted 
this whole thing by saying:  I am aware that you feel side-
lined by the War Room.  It came from the minister.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but the reason I am asking that is 
because Mr Matona testified here that the board never raised 
with him concerns regarding information by management 
given to the War Room.   
DR NGUBANE:   But they had a direct relationship with the 
10 
War Room, not with us in terms of that level of consultation 
and this is what we were concerned about.  Matona could not 
have solved that issue.  It was only the minister who could 
have resolved the issue of representavity of the board in War 
Room affairs, not Mr Matona. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but my question is and trying to 
explain to the Chairperson.  There are accusations made 
against the executives that they provided inadequate or 
incorrect, inadequate information to the board, to the War 
Room.  Does the board raise that with the executives if it is 
20 
also a concern of the board? 
DR NGUBANE:   We did not know what information they 
were sending to the War Room except what the minister told 
us.  But this was going to be found out in the inquiry about 
how trustworthy the information that was going to the Warm 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 220 of 254 
 
Room was.  And in the end Dentons says we could not really 
find examples of this information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then Mr Matona is then correct that 
the board did not raise the concerns? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, he is.. he is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  The information before 
this 
Commission 
regarding 
the 
decisions 
of 
Transnet.  
Transnet 
boards 
and 
Eskom 
boards 
relative 
to 
the 
secondment of Mr Molefe is that Transnet took its decision 
on 20 April 2015 and Eskom took its decision only on 
10 
23 April 2015.  Those dates are after the announcement by 
the minister on 17 April 2015 at the press conference. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Chairperson the minister by that time 
had already consented to the idea of secondment and had 
instructed us to write the Transnet Board and put our request 
to them.  So the issue that Molefe will be seconded to Eskom 
had been decided.   
 
That is why paperwork remained to be done.  And I see 
that you did not deal with the secondment of Mr Anoj saying 
in your affidavit:  “Do you have information about his 
20 
secondment came about?” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he dealt with it.  He said he did not 
know how he gets to Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no.  I subsequently found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you did? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 221 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I found it strange that you did not 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I had found it strange that you would not 
how the chief financial officer would have come to Eskom. 
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
You 
know 
what 
happened 
to 
me, 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
DR NGUBANE:   I have been out in KZN. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I got lockdown there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   During the lockdown time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   All my documents were here in Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so it made it difficult? 
DR NGUBANE:   Very difficult to construct all these. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   I could phone my son to look for this 
20 
document or that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And obviously not being a faired with 
Eskom documents, I got very limited information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 222 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   I wanted to give my representative this 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, to share with the Commission. 
DR NGUBANE:   On the secondments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that of Brian... ag, not Brian.  Of Mr 
Anoj Singh, Dr Ngubane? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that is the secondment of Anoj 
Singh that he is talking about. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, the secondment of both Brian and Anoj 
10 
Sing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  The junior counsel can...  Do 
you have your own copies or copies can be made for your 
lawyers and for all the Commission. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, if copies could be made for my 
attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
DR NGUBANE:   I do not want copies myself.  I will just give 
you what I have. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane, thank you.  We will attend 
to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you have to make arrangements with 
his attorney because he intends to make them available, first 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 223 of 254 
 
and foremost to his attorney. [laughing]  You have to make 
arrangements there.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless you are going to make copies for 
him soon because he will not mind letting us have them but I 
do not want you to be seem to grabbing them for yourselves. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  To the intended recipients.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well, Mr Chairman, we understand the 
Commission is short of resources. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Well ...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   [Indistinct] not one of the...  So we will 
make the copies available.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not know Mr Seleka you did not 
want to have a look at them and see whether, based on 
them, you wanted to ask Dr Ngubane questions or what your 
plan is.  Or you might need more time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I have asked my junior to look at 
20 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Dr Ngubane I do not know whether 
they are there on this.  So the minister makes a press 
conference, 17 April 2015.  And I have mentioned to you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 224 of 254 
 
earlier 
that 
there 
was 
a 
correction 
made 
by 
her 
subsequently.   
 
I do not know whether you are aware of the statement 
she released on the 21s t of April 2015.  And let me read the 
statement and you can let me know whether...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   No, sorry Chairperson.  I definitely will not 
have that statement.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, not you personally. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But this would have been a media 
10 
release by the minister.   
DR NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will read it and then see whether you 
have any recollection.  It is the reappointment of Mr 
Brown(sic), acting Chief Executive of Eskom: 
“Greetings to all present.  I am advised that this is 
an 
in-committee 
meeting 
and 
to 
a 
formal 
shareholders meeting.  
On Wednesday, 15 April, I briefed the nation on the 
current state of the grids and the reason for 
20 
implementation of Stage 3. 
With that announcement, I have also informed the 
nation that I am looking at immediate steps to 
stabilise leadership at Eskom, both at executive and 
board level. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 225 of 254 
 
On 17 April 2015, I subsequently announced my 
decision to second Mr Brian Molefe as the new 
acting Chief Executive of Eskom. 
I alluded to consultations with various stakeholders 
including President Jacob Zuma and the boards of 
both Transnet and Eskom. 
I believe that the statement needs to be clarified. 
Due to the urgency to stabilise Eskom, I called a 
meeting with the chairperson of Transnet Board, Ms 
Linda Mabaso and the acting chairperson of the 
10 
Eskom Board prior to making the announcement.” 
 
You were the acting chairperson at the time. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“This 
decision 
was 
taken 
within 
context 
of 
challenges facing Eskom as well as the urgency with 
which it needed to be implemented. 
I could only consult at this opportune moment with 
the full board. 
At the time, I needed to contain the matter in 
20 
confidence and avoid any media leaks.” 
 
So remember what she said is:  I have said I have 
consulted with, amongst others, boards of both Transnet and 
Eskom.  So the clarification is that she only consulted or 
called the chairpersons of the two boards. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 226 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, we were consulted.  We were both 
present at the meeting.  However, there was a lonely time to 
that stage.  I cannot quantify ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What?  It was a long what? 
DR NGUBANE:   A lonely time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   Discussing with the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   And then coming to the stage where she 
called both chairpersons to the meeting.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  H’m.  H’m.  The leap time, was that 
when the consultation was taking place or the consultation 
had taken place much earlier? 
DR NGUBANE:   The process had long started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
DR NGUBANE:   But these stages, you know, ultimately 
writing the letter to the board of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   I think it followed our meeting with the 
minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, thank you Chair.  Ja, Dr Ngubane I 
think you have... you will correct me that you have confirmed 
that the minister, the minister says that herself that it was 
her decision to second Mr Molefe from Transnet to Eskom. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 227 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Ultimately, she had to make that decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
DR NGUBANE:   You see I... for instance, we will write the 
minister and say People in Governance are recommending 
that while you give extension to Mr Molefe’s secondment to 
Eskom, we want to start the process of identifying a 
permanent CEO.  So these things goes hand in hand.   
 
We wanting to be continuing with secondment but at the 
same time we want to start the process.  And the minister 
writes back and says:  I agree.  It is that sort of sequence of 
10 
events.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You wanted to start what process at the 
same time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To find a new CEO. 
DR NGUBANE:   Looking for a new CEO. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now do you know what information the 
minister 
had 
at 
her 
disposal 
when 
calling 
the 
two 
chairperson of the board and conferring with them on her 
decision to appoint... to second Mr Molefe? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, we had asked for someone to be 
20 
seconded.  So I think it was in that context that she 
contacted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but do you know what information 
she had at her disposal to elect Mr B as opposed to anybody 
else? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 228 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I cannot know that Chairperson but 
we had... the matter was on the table and so these are the 
processes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the national... they did not share any 
information with you why on choosing Mr Brian Molefe? 
DR NGUBANE:   No, no she did not.  She just thought Mr 
Brian Molefe will help Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you ask any questions?  Why Mr 
Brian Molefe? 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, at some stage.  No, no, no.  That 
10 
happened when we were looking to employ a permanent 
CEO.  Then she asked that we get legal opinion.  That we 
get motivation and so on.  I mean, I considered those to be 
just formalities because she knew about Mr Molefe.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now did you... well, I do not know 
whether you had any say in the appointment.  Did you 
support the secondment of Mr Molefe? 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, we were saying:  Support the 
secondment.  But also support us looking for a new... a 
permanent CEO. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And in that process, we can see 
from your affidavit that Mr Brian Molefe was the person the 
board ultimately sought to have appointed permanently at 
Eskom. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson.  If anyone was at Eskom 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 229 of 254 
 
at that time and seeing the transformation within three 
months of Molefe being present at Eskom, would have never 
wanted to let him go away.  We were on the verge of turning 
things around.  And then to get a new player coming in would 
jeopardise that.   
 
I remember on Woman’s Day, he told us - well, probably 
the following day – that an assurance that load shedding will 
never come back again.  Now that was dramatic.  A person 
who can perform this type of transformation add value. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So we have to look at that Dr 
10 
Ngubane against what we know in regard to the Tegeta 
prepayments, issues relating to that.  The...[intervenes]  
DR NGUBANE:   Can I...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you can respond. 
DR NGUBANE:   But Chairperson, those things came later.  I 
am just talking about the period up to the end of load 
shedding.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Also, against the backdrop of what I 
have read to you earlier the locomotive deals at Transnet.  
And I think what the Chairperson was trying to convey as 
20 
well which is issues that had arisen at Transnet.   
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I only learnt about these 
issues after I had left Eskom.  I really never had the detail of 
those 
transactions 
except 
when 
reports 
started 
being 
published.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 230 of 254 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Also against the issues relating to the 
acquisition of optimal coal mine by Tegeta, specifically the 
meeting that you yourself and Mr Molefe have with the then 
Minister Ramathlodi.   
DR NGUBANE:   Well, now I think we are jumping a whole 
loop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, on the 5t h of August, I think it 
is 2016.  If that is the correct date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   2015 or 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was it 2016?  Let me check. 
DR NGUBANE:   Minister Ramathlodi suspended the licence, 
the mining licence of Glencore.  Now Glencore had quite a 
number of mines, you know, which was supplying power 
stations.  Not just Hendrina which was a big concern for us 
but also are not, I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
[Parties speaking over one another – unclear] 
DR NGUBANE:   ...were these supplied by coal from 
20 
Glencore Mines.  But not only that.  Glencore had shares in 
other mines throughout the coal basins in Witbank.   
 
So when these suspension happened and at the same 
time there was a quarrel... had a problem with Optimum Coal 
Mine about the pricing of coal, about the penalties that were 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 231 of 254 
 
being claimed and they had threatened to stop supplying 
coal and, in fact, they did stop supplying coal to Hendrina 
which was producing 2000 Megawatt of energy with a very 
high CV in terms of coal burning.   
 
We had to use reserves, stockpiles to breach that gab.  
Then comes the suspension of the mining basins.   
 
Now if you took out Komati, took Amot, took out 
Hendrina – you will have a national blackout in this country 
for certain.  And to come out of a national blackout, you 
need not less than six weeks of darkness.   
10 
 
And yet, on the 5 t h of August, we had barely stabilised 
the system and dealt with load shedding.  Now this was 
going to take us right back, you know.  So this issue...  
 
I mean, Minister Ramathlodi had called in Brian to talk 
about the penalty issues with Glencore.   
 
But this was an issue that required real intervention of 
asking to please remove the suspension because by the time 
our stockpiles finished and there was no fresh supply, we 
were sure to have a blackout.   
 
That was the motivation for requesting that.  And then he 
20 
says... he refused us asking him to stop... to withdraw 
licences but he had already withdrawn the licences and that 
is why we were pleading with him, please restore the 
licence.  So there is this communication ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No... well, first you said the evidence 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 232 of 254 
 
leader may have jumped also.   So he will need to remember 
to go back and cover whatever he dumped, whether it is 
today or another day.   
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now that he asked you a question on 
this issue, I want to engage you on it because it is an 
important issue.  You and Mr Ramathlodi what appears to be 
two very different what damage can he opposed versions 
about that meeting.   
 
Mr Brian Molefe has in his affidavit has been submitted 
10 
to the Commission also talks this issue and in dealing with 
his version, I think it is substantially along the same lines as 
yours.   
 
Mister or Doctor Arra Munja who was the Director of the 
Department of Mineral Resources when... at the time when 
Mr Ramathlodi was Minister of Mineral Resources has also 
been asked by the Commission to put up an affidavit to say 
what he remembers, what he knows to have happened.   
 
His version is along the lines of Mr Ramathlodi’s version 
up to a certain point.  But there is a certain point where he 
20 
says:  I do not remember this about Dr Ngubane at the 
meeting but I remember this.  So we can go there.   
 
But as you might recall from the affidavit of Mr 
Ramathlodi.  His evidence or in his affidavit and in his 
evidence, he said the meeting that he had with you and Mr 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 233 of 254 
 
Brian Molefe happened in September 2015 at the beginning I 
think ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, may I give you the 
reference? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am asking for it.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Eskom Bundle 09(b).  The 
affidavit of Minister Ramathlodi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have the right bundle but I have the 
page somewhere but... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   867. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   8610? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   867? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
DR NGUBANE:   Is that 867? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, (b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the relevant paragraph is on page 
871, paragraph 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it Dr Ngubane?  871 is the 
page.   
20 
DR NGUBANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He says on the 5t h of August 2015 or 
around 5t h of August 2015, the annual... M was complaining 
that Glencore was not following proper procedures during 
assessments at Optimum Mine.  He says: 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 234 of 254 
 
“I 
then 
authorised 
...[indistinct] 
to 
stop 
the 
operations to allow a team of DMR, NUM and 
Optimum representatives to resolve the issue of the 
retrenchments.  This was resolved in two days and 
the operational stoppage was lifted and the mine 
resumed operations.  
It is important to know that the stoppage was never 
dealt with as a suspension but rather under a 
provision 
of 
the 
Mineral 
and 
Resources 
Development Act.  I cannot recall the specific 
10 
section.” 
 
And then he says in paragraph 18: 
“In August, after the retrenchment issue had been 
resolved, it emerged that there was conflict between 
Eskom 
and 
Glencore 
over 
a 
penalty 
of 
approximately R 2 billion imposed by Eskom on 
Glencore for bad performance and poor quality coal 
if I remember correctly.” 
 
And then he says: 
“As a result of that conflict, Mr Brian Molefe, the 
20 
then CEO of Eskom, had stopped taking coal from 
one of the Glencore Mines known as Optima.” 
 
And then he says: 
“I arranged to meet Mr Molefe at a small boutique 
hotel at the Mall of Africa in Waterfall to discuss this 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 235 of 254 
 
issue with Glencore and he requested that I suspend 
Glencore’s mining licences during our discussion. 
I told Molefe that I was not going to suspend the 
licences as suggested and that nothing will be 
resolved if he does not meet with Glencore. 
I then suggested that a team from Eskom, DMR and 
Optima be created to mediate the situation.  He 
agreed to meet as suggested.  However, the 
following day, Molefe called me and advised that 
the Eskom Chairman, Dr Ben Ngubane would like to 
10 
meet with me.  I agreed to set up an official meeting 
between Molefe, Ngubane and myself, [indistinct] 
00.20 and Ramontja on or about 1 September 
2015.” 
He says: 
“At the meeting Ngubane requested that all licences 
for Glencoe must be suspended.  I asked him how 
this 
would 
affect 
coal 
supply 
in 
the 
country.  
Ngubane did not think that this was an issue and he 
was comfortable that Eskom would negate any 
20 
shortfall of coal.  I then said I needed time to 
consider all the facts to make an informed view of 
suspending the licences as it could have significant 
economic impact if not dealt with correctly.  We 
were already experiencing power outages.  The 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 236 of 254 
 
suspension of licences for mining concerns cannot 
be taken lightly as it is a protracted process.  
However, Ngubane became impatient as he advised 
me that had to brief the President on the outcome 
of the meeting before he left for his BRICS meeting 
that afternoon.  I did not waiver in my stance.  A 
few weeks after return of the President from his 
BRICS meeting on 22 September 2015 I was called 
to meet the President at his official residence.  
When I arrived, I met Mr Ace Magashule and Mr Ben 
10 
Sizwane(?), whom I did not know at the time, in the 
waiting room.  I privately met the President who 
thanked for my exemplary service as Minister of the 
DMR and informed me that he is moving me to the 
position of Minister of DPSA as there was a vacancy 
at the time.  I then agreed and left.” 
Now I wonder whether there might not be a problem with 
the time because I think in your affidavit you …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I give the Chair the page 
reference number? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is page 49. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Eskom bundle 09(A). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It would appear that if the meeting 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 237 of 254 
 
that Mr Ramatlhodi was talking about, happened early in 
September.  Then you may have – you may be mistaken 
because early in September it would seem he had not 
suspended any licences, he had only suspended them at 
the beginning of August and he says it took two days and 
they were lifted.  But if the meeting took place early in 
August then that point would not count against your 
version because for two days he accepts that there had 
been a stoppage of operations. 
 
But he links the meeting – for what it is worth, he 
10 
says, if I understand him correctly, on the day on which 
you had this meeting the President was going to be leaving 
for a BRICS meeting and he says you said to him you were 
going to brief the President before he could leave.  Yes? 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I did not know anything 
about the President’s departure or any meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   He went to see him purely on the basis 
that power stations were threatened because of inadequate 
coal.  If we exhausted the stockpiles then there will be a 
20 
blackout, which will be a tragic event.  So I do not know 
how this conversation came about because it was not part 
of the discussion.  President – I mean, sorry, Mr Chairman, 
we were working so hard to stop load shedding, how could 
we go and say bring us a blackout because if we made 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 238 of 254 
 
such a request, that is what would have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says he had an earlier meeting with 
Brian Molefe who had made a similar request on his own 
before the meeting which involved you.  And when I look at 
what was happening at the time, between Eskom and 
Glencoe and Tegeta, it appears that that was during a time 
when according to Glencoe – but Mr Ephraim who gave 
evidence here, Mr Brian Molefe was – had become very 
inflexible in the discussions which Glencoe was trying to 
have with Eskom to say please, the price that we have to 
10 
use to sell the coal to you is not viable, we cannot 
continue like this, we are operating at a loss, let us have 
an increase and he was saying, Mr Ephraim, in his 
evidence here, on his statement, he said just before Mr 
Brian Molefe arrived at Eskom they had made a lot of 
progress with various personnel at Eskom discussing the 
need for a revision of the price of coal in terms of their 
agreement 
with 
Eskom 
and 
actually 
there 
was 
a 
recommendation that was placed before the board on the 
basis that management was happy to say let the board 
20 
decide and otherwise they had no problem.  But at that 
meeting where the board was supposed to look at this 
proposal, it was three days after Brian Molefe had arrived, 
he says the board referred this proposal to Brian Molefe 
and Mr Ephraim says then the attitude changed completely, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 239 of 254 
 
there was rigidity, inflexibility from the part of Mr Molefe, 
their whole spirit led to and characterised our discussions 
with 
various 
people 
within 
Eskom, 
before 
he 
came 
changed. 
 
We 
were 
being 
squeezed 
and 
he 
– 
the 
impression one got – and it may be a wrong impression 
because one has not heard everybody, but the impression 
one got from the way he was putting things, it was as if Mr 
Molefe may have been helping Tegeta or may have been 
helping those who wanted to buy – to take over by making 
it difficult for them so that when an offer is made to say we 
10 
buy your company or your shares, they must realise that it 
is not viable to continue like this, we may as well sell.  
That impression may be wrong when one has had a chance 
to hear everybody but that is the impression that seems to 
be created. 
 
So it is possible that somebody might say well, if 
Brian Molefe asked Mr Ramatlhodi to suspend Glencoe’s 
licences and if Dr Ngubane also asked him to do that, it 
may well be that the idea was to put Glencoe in a position 
where they would take whatever offer was being made by 
20 
those who wanted to take over.  That is an impression that 
might be wrong when one has heard all the evidence.  I am 
just saying there is that impression which one gets from 
the side of Glencoe who have given evidence. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, Chairperson, I am sorry to say this.  I 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 240 of 254 
 
get an impression that someone is out to lynch me because 
I only had one meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   With Mr Ramatlhodi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And it was - you know, the penalty issue, 
I am not in the primary energy division. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   So I get information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
DR NGUBANE:   The information I get is that from about 
2010/2012 
the 
price 
of 
export 
coal 
almost 
trebled.  
Glencoe started washing coal to export great and giving 
Eskom [indistinct - speaking African language] whatever 
remains. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
DR NGUBANE:   And that is when the issue of penalties 
started coming in because the volumes and the quality 
were wrong and other companies starting doing this type of 
thing.  The explosion at Duvha Power Station was ascribed 
20 
to inferior coal being burnt there and not therefore getting 
proper combustion and so on and with that pressured.   
 
So who agree we should get people from Primary 
Energy to come and explain this.  I come in because Brian 
himself tell me we are in a very precarious situation.  If 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 241 of 254 
 
this suspension continues, we will lose power from – not 
just Hendrina but other stations supplied by the Glencoe 
mine.   
Then I panicked myself, I say let us go and see the 
Minister because this cannot happen, we cannot work so 
hard and then the end this happens.  And then I come with 
a long discussion paper which I spell all the risks and all 
that and then later, I cannot remember now how many 
weeks or whatever, he reinstates the licences, you know?   
So if we had said stop supplying – I mean, stop the 
10 
mining licences of these companies, then we should go to 
a mental asylum because we will be mad, Chairperson, 
there is no way which we can run electricity supply to the 
country without these mines that were threatened.  So 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Want to say Ramontja says in his – 
about the meeting, he says he attended the meeting. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think in your affidavit you do not 
remember that there was anybody other than the three of 
20 
you but he says he had been called by Minister Ramatlhodi 
to be present at the meeting together with the Deputy DG.  
He says: 
“Around September 2015 I was called by the former 
Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi to attend a meeting 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 242 of 254 
 
with Eskom officials at the office of the Minister.  
The attendees of the meeting were myself, as the 
then Director General of the department, the former 
Ngoako Ramatlhodi, Mr Joel Rafella, Dr Baldwin 
Ben Ngubane, former Chairperson of Eskom, and Mr 
Brian Molefe.  The deliberations at the meeting 
were 
primarily 
between 
the 
former 
Minister 
Ramatlhodi and Dr Ngubane.” 
And then he says: 
“I was provided with the affidavit of the former 
10 
Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi signed and dated 11 
June 2020 for the purpose of commenting on the 
contents of paragraph 21.  I concur with the 
contents of the paragraph save to mention that to 
the best of knowledge and belief, I cannot vividly 
recall 
the 
following 
points 
and 
behaviour 
as 
mentioned in a statement. 
1. Whether Dr Ngubane did mention that he did not 
think 
that 
this 
was 
an 
issue 
and 
he 
was 
comfortable 
that 
Eskom 
would 
negate 
any 
20 
shortfall of coal.” 
So, in other words, in his affidavit Mr Ramatlhodi had said 
– this is part of what you said.  So Mr Ramontja says 
although I agree with what Mr Ramatlhodi says happened 
at that meeting, there are two points that I do not 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 243 of 254 
 
remember happening.  Once of them, he says he does not 
remember that Dr Ngubane said he did not think this was 
an issue and that he was comfortable that Eskom would 
negate any shortfall of coal.   
And then says, the second point he does not recall, 
is that Dr Ngubane became impatient in the form of 
behaviour.  He says he does not recall that because I think 
Mr Ramatlhodi in his affidavit said you became impatient.  
So he says he does not recall that. 
But what he does say, he says, however, he did 
10 
advise the Minister that he will brief the President on the 
outcome of the meeting.  So I am just giving you that 
somebody else who says he was present at the meeting 
has put this version.  You might not wish to say anything 
but just so that you understand what evidence has been 
put up. 
DR NGUBANE:   Well, I had on my side Mr Molefe, I do not 
know what he has said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, actually let me go there so that – 
what page is it, Mr Seleka?  Oh, I have got I, page 796 is 
20 
where his affidavit starts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is at Eskom bundle 09(B). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 796.  Let me show the relevant 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 244 of 254 
 
part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I seem to have a different page 
reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Dan Molefe’s affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, has he many affidavits?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have it, it is page 536. 
CHAIRPERSON:   536? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us – well certainly the one that 
10 
I am talking about is… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the relevant paragraphs 
which Ramontja is referring to, appear on page 560. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, his one – Molefe’s one is what 
page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   560.  No, Eskom 09(B) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that must be under A here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   B, 09(B) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is under B? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, page – the affidavit starts on 
20 
page 536. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The relevant passage is – I am on 
page 560. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, have you got it, Dr Ngubane? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 245 of 254 
 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think it is just from paragraph 96.  
He says – that if Mr Brian Molefe: 
“On the 5 August 2015 the Department of Minerals 
announced that Glencoe’s mining licences have 
been suspended.” 
I think that date coincides with the date that Mr Ramatlhodi 
gives 
although 
he 
does 
not 
say 
the 
licences 
were 
suspended.  He says it was the stoppage of operations, I 
think.  And then he says: 
10 
“The reason for the suspension was that Glencoe 
had not followed due process in the proposed 
retrenchments of their workers.” 
That is the same as what Mr Ramatlhodi says.  
“The effect of the suspension of the mining licences 
would 
be 
to 
suspension 
of 
coal 
supplies 
by 
Optimum to Hendrina.  Dr Ngubane and I had a 
meeting 
with 
Minister 
Ramatlhodi 
where 
Dr 
Ngubane asked him to reconsider the decision to 
suspend the licence of Glencoe because of our 
20 
concern about the negative impact on the security 
of supply of coal to Hendrina power station and 
possible 
impact 
on 
load 
shedding. 
 
We 
were 
relieved when a few days later the suspension of 
the licences was withdrawn.  I was dumbfounded 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 246 of 254 
 
when in May 2017 former Minister Ramatlhodi 
claimed that the Eskom Chairman Dr Ngubane and I 
met with him to ask him to suspend Glencoe’s 
licence and that he refused because it would result 
in more load shedding.  He seemed to have 
forgotten that he had in fact suspended the licences 
at the time.” 
And then he talks about 20 August.  That is something 
else.  So his version is in line with what you say, he puts 
there.  It seems that the big problem might be exactly when 
10 
this meeting happened because Mr Ramatlhodi puts it in 
early September whereas Mr Molefe puts it early August 
but Mr Ramatlhodi says early August is the stoppage of 
operations.  So there was stoppage of operations because 
there was no compliance with retrenchment procedures.  
But he says this meeting happens at another time, 
unconnected with that, whereas Mr Molefe says no, it was 
connected with that. 
DR NGUBANE:   Chairperson, I only had one meeting with 
Minister Ramatlhodi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   So I do not know where he gets this 
meeting in September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No I think he also does not 
say he had two or more meetings with you, the person in 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 247 of 254 
 
respect of whom he mentions two meetings is Brian Molefe 
because he said he met with him alone and then later, I 
think the following day, he met with him plus with yourself 
and then other officials of his department, on his version.   
 
But I think you have put your version, they have put 
their version.  I think the investigator will continue to 
check.  I think a lot depends on exactly when it happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have a question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Before you close it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I said before you close it, Chair, I have 
a question myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja, ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane, the other point of 
difference appears from your own affidavit which is on 
page 49 of bundle A, Eskom bundle 09(B). 
DR NGUBANE:   Sorry, what is the number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A, I beg your pardon, page 49. 
DR NGUBANE:   Page 49? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under A. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Under A, ja.  Paragraph 11.18. 
DR NGUBANE:   Okay, thank you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you see that paragraph where you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 248 of 254 
 
state: 
“These were the concerns that drove Mr Molefe and 
I to request a meeting with Minister Ramatlhodi who 
then was the Minister of Mineral Resources, to 
apprise of the consequences of suspension of the 
coal mining licence.  The meeting took place at 
Minister Ramatlhodi’s offices in Pretoria.  The 
meeting was arranged by Mr Molefe, I cannot 
remember the date of the meeting. Luckily Mr 
Ramatlhodi reinstated the mining licence on 11 
10 
November 2015.” 
So you do not recall the date of the meeting but you recall 
the date of the reinstatement.  
DR 
NGUBANE: 
 
 
Because 
I 
must 
have 
read 
this 
somewhere. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now if you go back to A – well do not 
have to go – I will read it for you.  Dr Ramontja says that 
the suspension was on the 5 August and the reinstatement 
was on the 7 August and it attaches media article of the 
same date 7 August 2015 which reads: 
20 
 
“Glencoe to resume South Africa mining.” 
That is Financial Times, dated 7 August 2015. 
“Glencoe 
is 
said 
to 
resume 
operations 
at 
its 
Optimum 
Coal 
mine 
after 
the 
South 
African 
government lifted its suspension of the mine’s 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 249 of 254 
 
licence.” 
So 11 November 2015 is at odds with 7 August 2015. 
DR NGUBANE:   No, I must have read this date in some 
document.  My …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:    What is you recollection as to how long 
it took Mr Ramatlhodi to reinstate the licences after the 
meeting that you had with him? 
DR NGUBANE:   It was not very long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And few days or months or weeks? 
DR NGUBANE:   Few days or weeks.  Probably two weeks, 
10 
I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because, you see, in your own affidavit 
you do say in paragraph 11.15 at page 48 that the 
suspension of the licences was effected on the 3 r d.  You 
say the 3 August, if I am not mistaken.  Ja, I think whether 
it was the 3 r d or 5 t h, but early in August. 
DR NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if the date of 11 November 2015, 
which is when you say the mining licences were reinstated 
were to be correct, it would mean that the suspension took 
20 
about what, three, four months? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No a little over two months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A little over two months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, August, September, October.  No, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 250 of 254 
 
it is 11 November, it is over three months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if the suspension of licences 
happened on the 3 r d or 5 t h August, that is like – by end of 
August that is a whole month. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then September, the suspension is still 
on, that is the second month.  October, the whole of 
October, 
that 
is 
another 
month 
and 
then 
they 
only 
reinstated on the 11 November.  That is close to three and 
10 
a half months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that would be quite a long time. 
DR NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the impact and the consequences 
maybe would have been quite devastating.  I do not know, 
what do you think? 
DR NGUBANE:   It would have been, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   I must – I do not know, I must have been 
20 
checking different publications about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR NGUBANE:   And confused it with some other date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja.  Okay, Mr Seleka?  Well we 
actually we moved past five, past six.  No, I think we have 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 251 of 254 
 
to stop.  Fortunately, I understand that arrangements have 
been made in any event that Dr Ngubane was coming to 
come back to deal with other issues in regard to other 
Eskom matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe what we should have in mind 
is that whatever you might still have needed to deal with 
under secondment and suspensions, you can deal with 
when he comes back to give evidence on other Eskom 
issues, start with that, put it aside and then deal with the 
10 
other matters.  That is what I think should happen, Dr 
Ngubane, is that fine with you? 
DR NGUBANE:   I asked my representative to intercede 
with the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the evidence leaders. 
DR NGUBANE:   I need to plant some maize. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, look, arrangements will be 
made, I am sure you will get time to plant some maize.  
Arrangements will be made but I want to thank everybody 
for all the cooperation to work even beyond normal time in 
20 
order to try and cover as much as we have.  We were 
hoping that we would finish at least on the suspensions of 
executives and secondment, we did not finish but I think 
whatever is left is not much, so when you come back then 
we will try and finalise everything, but thank you to you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 266 
 
Page 252 of 254 
 
and thank you to your legal representatives, arrangements 
will be made and you will then come back. 
DR NGUBANE:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much we ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   Excuse me Chair, may I add one further note 
just on cooperation and it is something that has not been 
brought to the attention of my learned friend.  Chair you 
raised a question about obtaining recordings from Eskom 
10 
of the missing March meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.    
COUNSEL:   Chairperson I can confirm from my attorneys 
that they have made further inquiries this afternoon and 
have shared electronic copies of those recordings with the 
Commission’s team, just to confirm that Chair it includes 
particularly the now notorious recordings of the 9 March 
meeting.
