Page 4 of 369 
 
help me God. 
MR KOKO:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  He is represented as before I 
assume? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Thank you.  Okay continue. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I have a question of clarity if I can? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Ask before we go into the detail. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I read in the website that the President of the 
Republic will be coming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  I made statement in December 2020 and I put 
it – and I said that Mr Ramaphosa interfered and instructed 
the board of Eskom that was yet to meet to dismiss me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And I have mentioned the names of the former 
Deputy Minister and former acting DG and I – I just want to 
20 
find out if Mr Ramaphosa has been served with a 3.3 
Notice like all of us who has been served because I really 
want to know why did Mr Ramaphosa interfere in the affairs 
of Eskom by instructing the board of Eskom that was yet to 
meet to dismiss me and the instruction that the Labour 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 5 of 369 
 
Court found to be unlawful.   
And the consequences of that was in the CSIR 
Report that just after I left for – between 2018 and 2020 
R266 billion was lost as a result of load shedding that 
occurred after I left.  So I really want to know and if the 
public do not – are not interested in knowing I really want 
to know.   
I will not rest peacefully until I know why did the 
Deputy President of the Republic interfere in the affairs of 
Eskom to instruct the board that was yet to meet to dismiss 
10 
me. I now know based on the affidavit and the testimony of 
Mr – of Ms Brown that three of those board members were 
not even vetted as they should be vetted.   
So I look forward to Mr Ramaphosa coming here.  I 
hope you have served him with 3.3 Notices.  I looked at the 
documents that were sent to me last night and they were 
voluminous.   
I did not see a statement from the former Deputy 
Minister that I have mentioned.  I am not sure if he has 
been served with 3.3 Notice as yet.  I have not seen the 
20 
statement of – 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Deputy Minister you meant 
Deputy President of Deputy Minister? 
MR KOKO:  I have seen the statement of a Deputy Minister 
who phoned me and told me that the President. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 6 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOKO:  Will be – I thought that will be of interest to 
the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  I also thought that it will be of interest to the 
commission that the DG who called me and told me that the 
President will be dismissing me.  I did not see that 
statement.  I did not see the statement of the Deputy 
President and I thought I humbly seek clarity from you on 
what is going to happen. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No I can tell you – I cannot tell you 
for sure whether your statement implicating or to the effect 
that the current President issued an instruction whether it 
was served but Mr Seleka will be able to say that but I can 
assure you that I too am interested in what the President 
has to say about your evidence in that regard. 
 
And he certainly should be questioned on that.  The 
legal team is preparing on – on such matters but Mr Seleka 
should be able to respond to whether or not a Rule 3.3 
Notice was issued and the issue of a statement from the 
20 
Deputy Minister as well as from the DG you are right those 
would be important. 
 
Of course if the President were to admit that he 
made the statement or issued or made the statement that 
you attribute to him based on what you were told then the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 7 of 369 
 
need for their statements would fall away.  But there is no 
reason why attempts should not be made to obtain 
affidavits from the Deputy Minister and from the DG or 
acting DG. 
MR KOKO:  Thank you very much Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you.  Mr Seleka do you want to 
say something? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Part of the transcript of Mr Koko 
was given to the – to the President when we provided him 
with the equivalent of a Rule 3.3 which is the request for 
10 
information and we gave him documentation from Mr 
Molefe’s testimony and from Mr Koko.  Because I think in 
the case of Mr Koko that averment was made orally but not 
in the affidavit as I recall that he had instructed somebody 
to – to have you suspended. 
MR KOKO:  Chair my – my statement its very detail in it all 
what I did not do in the statement was to mention his 
name. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you – you had mentioned his 
20 
name in your Labour Court application papers is it not? 
MR KOKO:  We have mentioned the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you did not mention it you just said 
Presidency. 
MR KOKO:  We just said the Presidency. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 8 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  But we have provided the transcript and 
the President or the Presidency is preparing an affidavit Mr 
Koko.  They – they have undertaken to provide the 
commission with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  On the Deputy Minister and the DG I do 
not have recollection so I think you will have to help me 
with the names. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Deputy Minister Martins and the DGG is 
Mokgokolo – Mokgokolo.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to just give the spelling for the 
purposes of transcript for the DGG? 
MR KOKO:  Chair I will do it – I cannot spell it now I will 
do it during break time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  Otherwise I am going to make errors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Is it … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do ever say Deputy Minister Martins 
is that the one who was Minister of Transport at some 
stage? 
MR KOKO:  Correct DG I think it is either Martin Dikobe – 
Dikobe.. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 9 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no, no that would be somebody. 
MR KOKO:  It is either… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but they can check ja. 
MR KOKO:  Dikobe Martins I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Yes but he was the Minister of Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage okay. 
MR KOKO:  He was a Minister of Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay the spelling for the DG if it is 
10 
Mokgokolo I have it as M-o-k-g-o-k-o-l-o. 
MR KOKO:  That sounds right Mr Seleka – that sounds 
right yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  I – I always confuse them with Martins that is 
why I do not what to .. 
MR SELEKA SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright let us continue then. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  We can start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko let us start where we ended so 
that we can close that part and that is the part regarding 
the emails to infoportal which you find in Eskom Bundle 18.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 10 of 369 
 
Eskom Bundle 18(b).  So we hope to cover or to finalise on 
that. 
MR KOKO:  Which is  
MR 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
So 
Chairperson 
just 
by 
way 
of 
introduction we hope to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  To finalise on this very aspect and then 
we go into the transactions which involved McKinsey 
Trillian.  I think we will start there before we go to Tegeta 
transactions if we – if we manage to get that far.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay well. 
MR KOKO:  I have got it Sir. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you.  Page 1018. 
MR KOKO:  10? 
MR SELEKA SC:  1018.  So it there is those emails you 
sent to infoportal on the 20 t h July 2015 on page 1018. 
MR KOKO:  I have got it Chair. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then page 1088.  Remember your 
explanation to the Chairperson was that every time you 
sent these emails you would have a meeting with Dr 
20 
Ngubane and Ms Daniels to talk about what – talk about 
the document attached to the email.   
Now Ms Daniels has denied orally in – during her 
testimony having given you this email address as the email 
address of Dr Ngubane and also denied in her last 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 11 of 369 
 
appearance further that she had meetings with you and Dr 
Ngubane after the exchange of – or in relation to the 
documentation exchanged in these emails. 
And you had also indicated that you will have – you 
would like to have an opportunity to explain to the 
Chairperson each of these documents. 
My question to you is can you explain to the 
Chairperson insofar as you refer to meetings with Dr 
Ngubane.   
Let us start with the first email which is internal 
10 
consulting 
directive 
and 
the 
documentation 
follows 
thereafter.  What meeting would you have had with Dr 
Ngubane and what is it that you would have discussed with 
him in regard to the document attached here? 
MR KOKO:  Excellent.  So Chair the document and the first 
document is on page 1019.  Am I – is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
MR KOKO:  Right. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1019 ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:  So – so Chair this is quite an interesting part 
and I am glad we are going through it.  The National 
Treasury has got a directive on the use of consultants.  Not 
only does it have a directive on the use and how you 
appoint the consultants but it also prescribes the fees for 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 12 of 369 
 
the consultants. 
 
The document you see on 1019 gives effect to the 
National Treasury directive an internal Eskom document.  
The – what Eskom wanted to do in my absence while I was 
on leave was to contract with McKinsey on the risk based – 
on a risk basis that was wrong. 
 
National director – National Treasury does not allow 
that and the document you see there that gives effect 
clearly says so.  And the only way that the board of Eskom 
could do that on the basis of a resolution they took while I 
10 
was on suspension on the 6 t h of July 2015 was to go to 
National Treasury and to ask National Treasury for a 
deviation.  But it could not proceed as if there was not 
National Energy – National Treasury directive and as if 
there no internal Eskom procedure that gives effect to that. 
 
And that discussion I had with both Ms Daniels and 
both Dr Ngubane.  I have read the supplementary affidavit 
of Dr Ngubane on that and I have a lot to say about it and 
if I am allowed I will do that. 
 
But that is the basis of this discussion.  The board 
20 
of Eskom could not on the 26 t h of – on the 6 t h of July have 
approved a sole source motivation that is not consistent 
with the National Treasury Regulations that is not giving – 
that is – that has a document internally to Eskom that 
gives effect to it. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 13 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this may be quite an important part 
of your explanation about these discussions with Dr 
Ngubane and Ms Daniels about these emails.  So I just 
want you to take it step by step. 
 
First you say in the document at page 1019 is what?  
Is a directive? 
MR KOKO:  No it is not a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Eskom? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On – a directive for the implementation of 
10 
the National Treasury cost containment instruction and 
government gazette.   
 
Now on page 1019 we have got the document 
identifier 
alternative 
reference, 
area 
of 
responsibility 
Eskom – oh area of applicability Eskom Group, functional 
area finance division 1, total of pages 13.  Next review 
date July 2016 disclosure classification. 
 
And then there is compiler and functional risk 
responsibility and authorised by at the end. 
 
Now the actual directive is it the document that 
20 
starts at page 1020? 
MR KOKO:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay does it have 13 pages?  I just want 
to see whether… 
MR KOKO:  It has got 13 pages. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 14 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  13?  13? 
MR KOKO:  13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay so that is – that is in line with 
what is reflected at page 1019. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is to say the – so – and this particular 
document is an Eskom document? 
MR KOKO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is an Eskom document that seeks 
to give effect to a National Treasury instruction, is that 
10 
right? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the National Treasury instruction 
was to what effect? 
MR KOKO:  That National Treasury instruction – first 
National Treasury had the view which had the – that the 
state owned enterprises should not unnecessarily rely on 
consultants when they can do the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And you will see if we go into the detail at that 
20 
point Eskom was spending close to a R1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On consultants. 
MR KOKO:  On consultants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite a high amount. 
MR KOKO:  Right so the National Treasury scheme 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 15 of 369 
 
framework was make it a bit difficult for state owned 
companies to arbitrarily appoint … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There had to be good reasons. 
MR KOKO:  There had to be good reasons that is one.  But 
not -  2 is that whenever you appoint consultants for good 
reasons there has to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A process. 
MR KOKO:  A – first a process and that process must 
include internal capacitation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  For future? 
10 
MR KOKO:  For future.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  For future work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  But thirdly it was very prescriptive on how 
you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go about. 
MR KOKO:  How to compensate on the fees that these 
consultants must be paid.  That is pretty much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now do we have that National 
20 
instruction – the National Treasury instruction in the 
bundle or do we not have? 
MR KOKO:  We – I have not seen it I do not think we have 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not seen it yet.  Do we have it 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 16 of 369 
 
Mr Seleka? 
MR SELEKA SC:  I do not think we have that specific one 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I do not think you have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I do not think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it would be good to have it.  I assume 
if it is a big document we can extract just the relevant 
pages. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes the relevant portions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  If arrangements can be made for us to 
find that.  So I guess part of the point you are making is 
that the type of issue that this related to because the – the 
email at page 1018 suggests that if your evidence is 
correct suggests that you sent this document to Dr 
Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the point you are making is the type 
of issue that you wanted to raise would be the type of 
issue that is legitimate to raise with the Chairperson of the 
board? 
MR KOKO:  Most certainly. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 17 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And it – and there is a step forward to it and if 
there is a third party who stands to get a competitive 
advantage this document will not send serve that purpose.  
Because this document will say to the third party you stand 
no chance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  But you – I do not know 
whether you had completed your explanation. 
MR KOKO:  But I – I have completed my explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:  On this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Mr Koko you also 
mentioned… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that – I guess that you have 
completed your explanation up to a certain point what one 
– what would remain is to say tell us about the content of 
the discussion at the meeting where this document was 
discussed involved in the discussion involving you, Dr 
Ngubane and Ms Daniels. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Most certainly.  There is two explanations I 
still need to add to this yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Yes two explanations and – I still need to give. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 18 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  One is exactly that.  I – I made averments 
previously that Dr Ngubane when it comes to processes 
was at the diversion of Dr – of Zola – Mr Tsotsi.  Most 
often than not Mr Ngubane would act out of ignorance but 
once you put the facts on the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You advised him. 
MR KOKO:  Whilst you advise him and you put the facts on 
the table I can tell you he even becomes stubborn because 
he now knows.  That is the – that is the Dr Ngubane I 
know.  Dr – Zola Tsotsi is different.  When you tell him the 
10 
facts he put a trip – he wants to kill you.  So that is the 
difference.  So Mr Ngubane had a posture he sits and he 
does not talk too much in the meeting and once he sees it 
and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – once he sees the point you 
making? 
MR KOKO:  Once he sees the point you making he in a 
very curious fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Says okay I understand that is what we are 
20 
doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No further discussion. 
MR KOKO:  No further discussion.  That is how he – he 
does not (talking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he listened – he would listed to hear 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 19 of 369 
 
what somebody else who might think differently has to say. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR KOKO:  And he can talk very quickly and Mr Ngubane – 
and those who know Dr Ngubane both at the board 
meetings and one on one all his meetings are virtual.  So 
he understood my point.  He took my point and I remember 
in – Dr Ngubane telling me – Ms Daniels and this is what I 
want to go back to this statement saying you must never 
make a mistake of going ahead without National Treasury 
10 
deviation or we do not do this.  That was his last words.  I 
remember them very clearly. 
 
I was very happy because this was going to break – 
this transaction was going to break the relationship 
between me and him and the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Koko what is it that 
you were talking about with Mr Ngubane in regard to this 
20 
document?  What did you say you were talking about? 
MR KOKO:  The board took a resolution in my absence for 
a rates – for a risk based decision.  That decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to McKinsey. 
MR KOKO:  In relation to McKinsey we called it Top 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 20 of 369 
 
Engineers 
Program. 
 
That 
decision 
was 
not 
only 
inconsistent with the National Treasury’s practice note but 
was also against the Eskom directive.  So – so this 
directive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His directive. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So – so ordinarily if properly advised the board 
would said go sort this matter first with the National 
Treasury before you come to us. 
10 
 
The board would not say we give you a mandate to 
negotiate without having assurance that indeed National 
Treasury will indulge and that is the discussion that I had 
with the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you raised this issue what was 
his response and what was Ms Daniels’ response at the 
meeting where you had this document before all the three 
of you? 
MR KOKO:  Like I said Mr Ngubane talks very little, he 
listens a lot and he got the message – he got it quickly and 
20 
his response was okay this is what we doing.  Ms Daniels 
just make sure that we either take a deviation or we do not 
do this at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at the time that you – you sent him 
this document they had not approached – Eskom had not 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 21 of 369 
 
approached National Treasury for a deviation or they had 
already 
done 
so 
but 
the 
outcome 
had 
not 
been 
communicated to them? 
MR KOKO:  They had not done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they had not done it. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had they – had they – had the Eskom 
board said to the management negotiate with McKinsey or 
what had they – what had been said before you raised this 
issue? 
10 
MR KOKO:  Well there was a resolution that was taken and 
– in my absence when I was on suspension.  The 
suspension that I conveniently arranged so that McKinsey 
– they can make this decision.  Now that is how ridiculous 
it is.  The narrative is – the narrative is that my suspension 
was a sham so that certain transactions can happen.   
So McKinsey is one of them so I participated in the 
conspiracy and a sham suspension so that the board of 
Eskom can take a resolution to negotiate with McKinsey on 
a risk basis – on a risk basis and they did not – they did 
20 
that without having been to National Treasury.  And the 
intention was that while you negotiating with McKinsey go 
and talk to the National Treasury – go and talk to National 
Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let us take it step by step.  Do 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 22 of 369 
 
you by any chance recall what date the resolution was? 
MR KOKO:  6 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  6 July 2015. 
MR KOKO:  I cannot forget it Chair because the High Court 
erroneously concluded … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were at work. 
MR KOKO:  That I was in charge of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  And you returned on the 20 t h of 
July is that right? 
MR KOKO:  I returned on the 20 t h. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So – so you – so you – so what you 
are saying is on the 6 t h of July while you were on 
suspension you later found that the board had made a 
resolution 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
the 
executives 
should 
negotiate with McKinsey with a view to – or in regard to the 
Top Engineers Program.  Is that right? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and when you came back you 
realised that this was in breach of not only the National 
Treasury instruction note but also of this directive of 
20 
Eskom and you decided to bring this to the attention of the 
Dr Ngubane? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had a meeting and in that 
meeting where this issue was discussed Dr Ngubane saw 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 23 of 369 
 
your point and instructed Ms Daniels that she should make 
sure that National Treasury was approached for a deviation 
or otherwise if National Treasury did not provide deviation 
the program should not be pursued, is that right? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Koko you would 
recall the evidence… 
MR KOKO:  Chair let me – before you go there.  You will 
see and we will come back to it you will see there this 
10 
transaction comes back again on the 6 t h of October and 
that is a document that I signed to the board which again 
makes a reference to National Treasury Compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Is that the feedback report? 
MR KOKO:  Yes the feedback report. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So while we are here we should – 
we should make a distinction between the Corporate Plan 
and the Master Service Agreement.   
MR KOKO:  That is a very good point Chair.  So – so again 
20 
I guess Mr Seleka will take – will lead evidence on the 
Master Service – on the business plan.  And the business 
plan is often confused with a services level agreement and 
my name gets dragged into that and I get corrupted in 
between and I think that is what the judges of the High 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 24 of 369 
 
Court did as well.  So – so when the need arose 00:29:31 
went to a NERSA decision of the 29 t h of June – mark that 
date Chair we are going to come back to it.  On the 29 t h of 
June and we needed a financial plan and the business plan 
that is based on what we call a cost – a design to cost as 
opposed to  a cost reflective business plan.  I listened to 
the testimony of Mr Singh and I do not know why he did not 
explain this simple concept to you.  All along, the business 
plan of Eskom was based on a cost reflective tariff.  So we 
had a wishful list.  That wishful list leads to a cost and we 
10 
then take that cost, we put in a business plan and then we 
go to the consumer, we have covered the cost.   
 
The decision of NERSA on the.... what we call 
Multi Year Price Determination 3.  We call it – in short we 
call it MYPD3.  We applied for one – just over a trillion 
revenue for five years and they gave us R 883 billion.  We 
were short R 225 billion.  So the business plan that was 
there on the table that the very competent Eskom’s 
Executive allegedly put together was R 225 billion short.   
 
So we needed to restructure our operations and 
20 
have a business plan that is based on the cost that we 
have, so designed cost.  And Mr Singh and I agreed that 
we must approach McKinsey to put a business plan that 
will be – that was based on the cost that we have, not on 
the wishful idea that one day NERSA would change their 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 25 of 369 
 
minds and give us R 225 billion that we do not have.   
 
So we approached McKinsey.  McKinsey had 
been historically working on a design-to-cost model.  The 
reason why I took a decision and trust my decision not to 
use the MSA was because the... 
 
And you will see that a lot of emails when I sent 
it to the teams what is the feedback on the negotiations 
with McKinsey, and one thing came – that continuously 
clam out, even though they did not even say it expressly 
because I think they realised, in my view in hindsight, 
10 
there was trouble brewing, is that National Treasury is not 
going to give them a leeway to contract on a risk based 
approached. 
 
So I took a decision that the scope for the 
business 
plan 
that 
I 
authorised 
from 
the 
29 t h of September 2015 will not be based on risk base.  It 
will be based on the fee that is approved by National 
Treasury.  So that is the difference.  And it is quite a 
simple concept and I do not understand why both Mr Singh 
and Mr Seleka struggled to explain this to you. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I...  Ja.  Chair, I do not want to be 
personal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I do not have to explain anything 
to the Chairperson.  You, as witnesses, have to give 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 26 of 369 
 
evidence to the Chairperson.   
MR KOKO:   I am here to do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So your explanation relates to the 
Corporate Plan.  Is that right?  The explanation you have 
just given to the Chairperson? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you and Mr Singh, you say, agreed 
to approach McKinsey in order for McKinsey to provide 
services in respect of what you say is the Business Plan? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  And the Business Plan... just 
complete the sentence, sir.  The Business Plan and the...  
Financial Plan, that will be based on the design-to-cost, 
not a cost – a cost reflective. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, and you are referring to the date of 
the 29 t h of September 2015?  I think that is the date when 
you signed, what, the letter of acceptance? 
MR KOKO:   That is the date that I signed...  And Chair, 
while we are on this.  That is the date that I did not only 
sign the letter of notification for the Business Plan but I 
20 
put the contract into effect.  Now one of the things that I 
am struggling with is that...  Or let me put it this way.  
Chair, 
Eskom 
operates 
within 
a 
framework 
and 
that 
framework is the Constitution of the Republic.   
 
It is the PFMA, the Public Finance Management 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 27 of 369 
 
Act that gives effect to the Constitution.  It is the 
Delegations of Authority and it is a document which we 
refer to as 1032, the Procurement and Finance Authority 
Procedure.  I am going to spend a lot of time on it today.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a document different from the one 
that Mr Singh was telling us about? 
MR KOKO:   It is the same document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely, ten...  But I think he was saying 
1034.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
10 
MR KOKO:   1034. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is right, you are wrong? 
MR KOKO:   I am wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR KOKO:   32-1034.  And then what we call a Materiality 
Framework.  So it is a PFMA, Delegation of Authority, 1032 
materially from work.  There are procedures.  In my case, I 
will mention another one on Information Security because 
we are dealing with emails.   
 
Chairman, if you do not like the taste of that 
20 
framework, do not criticise(?) me.  I have listened to many 
submissions and I get a feeling that you may not like that 
framework.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You must use this opportunity to make it 
me like it.  [laughs]   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 28 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  So all what I am saying is, there is a 
framework in Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And I am consistently going to tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   That I operated within that framework in 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   And I made prudent decisions that are in the 
interest of Eskom. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And you can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Based on that framework? 
MR KOKO:   Based on that framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   And if you construed that there was state 
capture at Eskom.  The difficulty you will have is that since 
2002, I was told this before and I will tell you again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   The results in my time were the best. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   So...so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I just want to say that even though 
I am saying to you, you must use the opportunity to make 
me like it, but I am actually not meaning that in a serious 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 29 of 369 
 
way.  Whatever framework was there, one has got to look 
at it and it is not a question of whether I like it or not.  I 
am just see what it means, understand how it works.   
 
I am not running Eskom and I was not running 
Eskom.  Those who put it together, rightly or wrongly, may 
have thought that it was appropriate to put in place.  So, 
obviously, if there are issues that I think arise or questions 
that I have about it, obviously, I would raise those.  But 
just on a serious note.  It is neither here nor there whether 
I like it not. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you must make sure that you feel 
free to put your case properly. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, thank you very much.  And after I have 
done that, you may still not like it but it is within your 
scope to make a recommendation to the President to say 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But I would not just whether I like it 
or not.  [laughs]   
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is fine Chair.  What I am saying, my 
20 
signature of the letter of notification and acceptance by 
McKinsey on the 29 t h of September 2015, put the contract 
in place whether the contract was signed or not.  That is 
the framework of Eskom.  And while we are there, Chair, I 
would like to take you to that document. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 30 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us see what Mr Seleka’s plan is 
because he may have intended that you – to deal with it 
later.  I do not want us to upset his plans.  Is it fine that he 
goes to it now or...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is still fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will help us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Maybe it will help us expedite 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.   
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR KOKO:   Let us go to MK-49. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I see Mr Barrie, your 
...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   ...reference to you, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, sure. 
MR KOKO:   It has got ...[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE:   It is Eskom Bundle 15. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV BARRIE:   At page 594. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  I think you can then switch 
off that mic, Mr Barrie. 
ADV BARRIE:   [No audible reply]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 31 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You can then switch off that 
mic. 
ADV BARRIE:   [No audible reply]  
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I am going to take you to – and we 
will come – we will come back more often to this document, 
678. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am at 594.  Should I go to 
another place? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Please go to Bundle 15, 678. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, there is a – it talks – there is a 
chapter 
that 
talks 
about 
Administration 
of 
Awarded 
Contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  I just want to 
make sure if we are on the same page.  Now when we 
come to this document, what are we – what is the topic 
that you are talking – dealing with?  Mr Seleka?  Mr Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, because I thought Mr Koko 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Can I explain to you? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   I signed the contract, the Letter of Award to 
McKinsey.  The case(?) went to a full board and Chair in 
my statement I say Board Tender Committee.  I have read 
the statement of Mr Anoj Singh and he corrects me that it 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 32 of 369 
 
was actually not the Board Tender Committee, it was a full 
board and I accept that.  I think he is right.  I was 
mistaken.  So the board approved the award for the fixed 
fee basis for R 102 million to McKinsey for the Business 
Plan.  
 
In terms of the Eskom framework, 32-1034, you 
have to notify the supplier who has been – whose contract 
has been approved by the authority.  And that notification 
is binding on Eskom.  This is why I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now notifying them of the fact 
10 
that the fee will be fixed? 
MR KOKO:   No, that is the...  No, that is notifying them 
that a board tender committee in Eskom has approved the 
award of the contract to you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Obviously. 
MR KOKO:   ...under these terms and conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which includes the fixed ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Which include the fixed fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, yes. 
MR KOKO:   And once you notify and they accept it, it is 
20 
binding on Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   It is a contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But remember, at that point, the contract is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 33 of 369 
 
not signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Oh, that is the point that you 
said you thought I did not like? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  [laughs]  Alright.  Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Now Chair, there is a point that you had which 
I will mention.  But Eskom was going to stop functioning if 
that is not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   There are many contract today at Eskom that I 
10 
know of whose contracts have not been signed but the 
Letter of Award has been awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   What you cannot do.  That is the point that I 
thought... was making.  You cannot pay the supplier 
without a signed contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, I think part of the exercise was to 
get the passage in the procedure and that is at page 678, 
20 
15-678, Clause 3.4.8.5.   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, to – you wanted to read that into the 
record? 
MR KOKO:   Can I read it Chair? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 34 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do that, do that. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
“Once approval has been given to the award of 
the contract to the successful supplier, the 
procurement 
practitioner 
notifies 
the 
successful supplier of the acceptance of his 
tender. 
The procurement practitioner must ensure that 
10 
this notification is received by the successful 
supplier because notification of acceptance 
will become legally binding upon Eskom...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And that is the point I am making.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Just complete the clause and then 
we can talk about it. 
MR KOKO:   Email Notification were the subject to 
Electronic Communication and Transactions Act.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Let us – I think it is important 
20 
that you read – it was important that you referred to this... 
clause.  But let us talk about the issue that you say I did 
not like.  One, not that I did not like it but, two, you may 
have – you may recall that in the context of Mr Singh’s 
evidence.  What he was saying was, in effect.  Look, even 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 35 of 369 
 
though there might not be – there might not have been a 
formal contract or agreement that had been signed by both 
parties, there had been an offer and acceptance.   
 
And he was saying based on his recollection of 
Commercial Law that he did many years ago, that should 
be enough.  Okay?  So what I was saying to him.  Well, 
one, his recollection of the law might be based on many 
years that have lapsed but in principle, he is correct that if 
there is an offer and an acceptance, there is an agreement.  
Okay?  That is a general principle.   
10 
 
But what I was raising with him was whether the 
position is not that in the context of SOE’s there has to be 
a 
formal 
written 
contract 
in 
addition 
to 
whatever 
correspondence may have been exchanged which indicates 
that the parties agree.  That is the point I was making.  
Because I have been made to believe that in the – in 
regard 
to 
various 
SOE’s, 
you 
know, 
you 
might 
get 
notification that you have been awarded the tender but 
until there is a proper formal agreement, they would not 
regard, the two parties, as already having an agreement.   
20 
 
Now if you say to me that was not the position at 
Eskom, that might be different.  So I was simple raising 
something based on what my understanding is of the 
attitude of SOE’s.  So I just wanted you to – I want to make 
sure that you understand the context in which I raised the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 36 of 369 
 
issue.  So it was not whether I like it or not.   
MR KOKO:   Chair, I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But can I also assist you on that part? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because I think this is very, very important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   On the same page, it is a direct – it is an 
instruction that talks to signing of contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Sorry? 
10 
MR KOKO:   On the same page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   ...paragraph 3.4.8.3 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Signing the contracts.  Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It deals with signing of contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   But it does more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It tells you when you can assume.  You can – 
it tells you when you can resume work ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I would like to read into the record too. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  But I must 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 37 of 369 
 
say to you that you are right to point out Clause 3.4.8.1 
because as you said, it specifically says: 
“...the procurement... numbers ensure that this 
notification... 
by 
the 
successful 
supplier 
because notification of acceptance will become 
binding upon Eskom...” 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words, it has got legal 
consequences. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So did you say that you want to 
deal with 3.4.8.3 as well? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
And 
that 
notwithstanding, 
Eskom 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Still expects that there would be a 
contract? 
MR KOKO:   Eskom still expects that there will be a 
contract and that contract must happen, preferable, before 
20 
the work starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
MR KOKO:   That is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is the position, as you understand 
it, that preferable the formal contract must be concluded 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 38 of 369 
 
before the work starts but if, for whatever reason, work 
were to start without the formal contract being concluded, 
as far as you know, Eskom would regard the parties as 
contractually bound in a contract? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is the point you make.  Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, exactly.  And what we will do.  What we 
will do in that case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
We 
will 
discipline 
the 
procurement 
10 
practitioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But as far as the third party, the 
supplier ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   We will not interfere with third parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No, no.  That is important to – 
that explanation is important.  As I say, my understanding 
in terms of evidence that I have heard in regards to other – 
some SOE’s, I should not – it might not be all of them, is 
different.  But maybe that is different but what you are 
telling me here about is what happened in Eskom, what the 
20 
document say and what the practise was.   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And this procedure goes a step further Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 39 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   It says once you have notified the successful 
supplier of the award and he has accepted it and there is a 
binding contract.  It is binding but there is no contract as 
yet. 
 And 
you 
want 
to 
start 
working 
now 
because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or urgency. 
MR KOKO:   ...or urgency.  The general 
manager 
procurement must authorise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  I assume that in a case where 
you have complied with Clause 3.4.8.1 and you comply with 
10 
Clause 
3.4.8.3, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
formal 
contract 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the terms of conditions that find their 
way into the formal contract would be contained already in 
the exchanges that have happened before. 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that in other words, from the time 
you are sending notification, contemplated in Clause 
3.4.8.1 to the time of the conclusion of the formal contract, 
20 
there are not going to be negotiations of terms because 
when you accept it, the terms were settled. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, once I give you the Letter of Award 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 40 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   ...and the terms and conditions that comes 
with it, your wishes are complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   So.  And Eskom use – and this is another term 
that – this is another part that I thought you have got a 
misunderstanding about Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   Eskom uses standard conditions of contracts.  
In other words, it is allowed to deviate.  If you want a best 
spoke contract, you have to be specific, contract difficult 
10 
process that has go through commercial.  And we will also 
go through the delegation of authority.  So the Letter of 
Award 
will 
say 
standard 
contracts, 
standard 
terms 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Apply. 
MR KOKO:   ...apply.  And it will also add additional 
conditions that were not approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   That is it.  No more negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say?  This 
20 
procedure at Eskom which you are telling me about, which 
includes Clause 3.4.8.1 and Clause 3.4.8.3, actually means 
that the conclusion of the formal contract is really for 
convenience so that you have all the terms in one 
document? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 41 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise, the contract, the terms and 
conditions have already been agreed and settled when the 
notice of acceptance is send to the supplier? 
MR KOKO:   Of course, Chair.  And it will be a disaster if 
that is not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because then the board does not know what 
they are approving. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Then the cost is not fixed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, no, no.  I understand. 
MR KOKO:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Okay.  I think it was 
not particularly a good idea to concede to take this route 
but... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you are saying mister...  If you 
20 
are saying Mr Koko that – if you are saying that you did not 
know why Mr Seleka did not explain this, he is not Eskom.  
[laughs]  So you need somebody from Eskom to know what 
the practise was.  But Mr Singh, I would have thought, you 
know, would have explained it but maybe he was still going 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 42 of 369 
 
to explain it.   
MR KOKO:   There is another part, Chair, that we will come 
to 
you 
and 
I 
will 
let 
Mr 
Seleke(sic) 
deal 
with 
it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Seleka. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka.  I sincerely apologise.  Deal with it 
at the right time when he is ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because the issue that the contract was not 
signed by my but I was the delegated person. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
That 
is 
another 
part 
that 
I 
really 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Want to explain. 
MR KOKO:   ...explain.  And I said to my counsel, if I get 
under pressure and forget it, he must ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Remind you. 
MR KOKO:   ...he must remind me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Mr Koko, let us jus finalise on 
20 
this very aspect where you referred us to page 678 in your 
– in Eskom Bundle 15. 
MR KOKO:   Do you want me to go back there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let us just finalise on that. 
MR KOKO:   678? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 43 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  We are dealing with – and I want 
us to be clear.  We are dealing here with the Corporate 
Plan.  Is that right? 
MR KOKO:   It is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With the letter that you – this is the 
Letter of Acceptance on the 29 t h of September 2015. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now just to make ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka.  You spoke about 
the Business Plan. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the Business Plan part of the 
Corporate Plan? 
MR KOKO:   So the Corporate Plan, Business Plan 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is one and the same thing. 
MR KOKO:   ...is one and the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  I just wanted to make 
20 
sure because if we use different terms ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whoever reads my papers, may think it 
is different matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 44 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka, I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there, yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I did not quite get your explanation 
but I thought the paragraphs 3.4.8.2, you could also have 
drawn it to the Chairperson’s attention because the second 
paragraph after the first one who says:   
“Procurement practitioner is responsible for 
compilation and administration and finalisation 
10 
of the contract / or...   
 
The next one says:   
“If 
a 
contract, 
NEC, 
has 
been 
used 
the 
procurement 
practitioner 
together 
with 
the 
cross-functional 
team 
ensures 
that 
the 
contract documents are correct and complete 
with 
all 
drawings 
and 
specifications 
and 
included as part of the contract...”   
 
Now I thought you would also explain that part to 
the Chairperson.  And it goes on.  The last sentence in that 
20 
paragraph says: 
“The procurement practitioner arranges for the 
printing 
of 
the 
contract 
for 
purposes 
of 
signature...” 
 
Let me go on to the next item, 3.4.8.3 which is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 45 of 369 
 
signing the contract.  It says: 
“Once the contract is printed, the procurement 
practitioner takes the contract to the official 
and authorise Eskom signatory as nominated 
by the delegated approval authority to sign the 
contract on Eskom’s behalf. 
The nomination is done in terms of Eskom’s 
delegation of signing authority as set out in 
Appendix B. 
It is the responsibility of the procurement 
10 
practitioner to ensure that the contract is 
signed by the duly authorised delegates of 
Eskom 
and 
the 
supplier 
before 
order 
placement against the contract. 
In other words, orders cannot be executed 
against a contract where the contract has not 
been signed by the parties and any orders 
placed against the contract in the absence of 
contract signature, may place Eskom at legal 
risk in the even of breach of contract. 
20 
A claim against the contract or dispute with the 
supplier to the extent that orders may have to 
be placed before contract signature consent 
must be obtained in writing from the relevant 
GM... [break in audio recording]... or his or her 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 46 of 369 
 
nominated representative or the DE Primary 
Energy 
or 
his 
or 
her 
nominated 
representative...” 
 
Now until thereto ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you making point different from the 
point he made?  Because my understanding – I am not 
understanding this to be ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Ja, Chair, I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he has read from what he says 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is the same point I made earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is exactly – it is exact the same 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it exactly the same? 
MR KOKO:   ...the point I made. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...which is:  There must be a signing of 
a contract. 
MR KOKO:   No, I said to you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us make sure so that we only spend 
time on it if there is confusion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Are 
you 
suggesting 
that 
your 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 47 of 369 
 
understanding is that the notification must happen after the 
contract has been signed, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No.  Ja, because his evidence is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There comes a time in the process 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...where notification has to be done 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...under Clause 3.4.8.1.  And he says 
that notification happens at a time when there is no formal 
contract yet.  But he says when that notification happens, 
then in law, I know he did not say law but it amounts to 
saying that, in law there is a contract between Eskom and 
the supplier and all the terms and conditions have been 
sorted out, otherwise, there will be no approval and no 
notification.   
 
But he says, nevertheless, there must still be a 
20 
formal contract and that formal contract – the conclusion of 
that formal contract and its signing comes later.  And he 
says, in response to my question, the terms and conditions 
that will be in that formal contract are the terms and 
conditions that had already be placed and agreed at the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 48 of 369 
 
time of notification of – in terms of that.   
 
And he says no work is supposed to be done by 
the supplier until the formal contract has been concluded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if there are reasons of urgency that 
make it necessary that work be done before the formal 
contract is concluded, there is a process to be followed 
and authorisation to be obtained.  That is the sum total of 
his evidence. 
MR KOKO:   I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree? 
MR KOKO:   I agree fully, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Which must be in writing as the 
paragraph says there, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “To the extent that the orders may 
have to be placed before contract signature, consent must 
be obtained in writing”.  And they specify...  Okay.  So, 
Mr Koko, I know you are dealing with the Corporate Plan as 
20 
you had watched ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we done for now with this Bundle 15 
or will we need it later or I must still have this? 
ADV BARRIE:   Chairman ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 49 of 369 
 
ADV BARRIE:   ...but maybe it is relevant in this context to 
record 
where 
that 
acceptance 
document 
is. 
 
The 
acceptance 
document 
of 
29 
September 
because 
my 
recollection and I... cannot find it right now is that it was 
accompanied by a contract... 
[Speaker is not clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE:   It was signed on behalf of McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE:   It was only much later signed, I think by 
10 
Mabelane on behalf of... 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is quite ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   The contract had, in fact, been finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Let us leave it to 
Mr Seleka as to when he wants to deal with that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the most important part was for 
Mr 
Koko 
to 
explain 
what 
he 
has 
explained 
and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...so what I am asking now is whether 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I am done with this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are done with this? 
MR KOKO:   I will come back to it later. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 50 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   For now, we can remove it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka, you agree? 
MR KOKO:   Unless Mr Seleka wants to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  What Mr Koko 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at quarter past eleven.  
Maybe, let us take the tea adjournment.  And then when we 
come back we can then continue. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.  We will resume at half-past 
eleven.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, we were 
busy dealing then with the corporate plan, let us see 
whether we can finish that so that we can go back to the 
emails to Infoportal.  I would like us to go to Eskom bundle 
20 
14(c), page 877.82.1. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Mr Chairman, we received a bundle 
electronically on Saturday, or yesterday, but that only goes 
to page 678, not to 817.  It appears that there are 
annexures to this affidavit that we were not supplied with.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 51 of 369 
 
Possibly before my learned friend goes in that direction, 
seek to have that supplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be something you want to deal 
with now or later, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, if my learned friend could indicate 
which affidavit is he referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Switch on your mic, Mr Barrie. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   There is an affidavit of Mr Singh, I 
think it is a supplementary affidavit at page 768, that is the 
last page in our bundle. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is not the bundle I am referring 
to. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   You said bundle 14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes (c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, just before you proceed, 
Mr Seleka.  Mr Koko, I just want to have some confirmation 
from you of something that I believe you said about the 
clauses in that document that we were looking at earlier.  
Do you remember which clauses I am talking about? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Did you say that what Eskom would 
not be permitted to do in the absence of a formal contract 
is payment but the actual work can be done provided the 
relevant 
authorisations 
have 
been 
obtained 
and 
the 
notification has been given? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 52 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  So – and this is very 
important, Chair, because I think we are going to come 
back to the invoicing and the payment and we – I grew up 
in Eskom, I keep on saying Eskom is – my blood is blue, 
my association with Eskom is over 33 years.  I may look 
young.  There is a course we did and we do everywhere, it 
is called Managing Contracts in SAP..  It tells you exactly 
what to do to make a payment.   
So the contract manager will sign off what we call a 
completion certificate and the completion certificate will 
10 
either say goods have been received or work has been 
done, services has been done and I, the contracts 
manager, authorises that the job is done.   
 
Then there is an invoice.  The invoice goes to the 
contracts manager.  The only people who pay supplies in 
Eskom is not Mr Singh, it is not contracts manager, it is 
shared services.  So the invoice will – the shared services 
will receive the invoice.  The first thing the finance person 
does, firstly what he does is that he checks if there is an 
order number.  So if there is an invoice that is not 
20 
accompanied by an order and we loosely call it in 
colloquial term at Eskom a 45 number, so a contract.  If 
you see the contract we discussed, is 460052909, I think, a 
46 number.  You do not pay on a 46 number, you have to 
create a 45 number.  So the invoice come, the financial 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 53 of 369 
 
person checks if there is a 45 number.   
In a loose language in Eskom when I say where is 
the 45 number I am asking you the question is the order 
placed, is the order signed, so there is a 45 number.  One, 
there is a 45 number, so there is an invoice with a 45 
number, then there must be what we call a goods received 
or services received in SAP and services received is done 
by the contract manager.  We call it three way matching.  
So you cannot do a payment without a three way matching, 
you are matching the invoice, you are matching the order 
10 
and whether the job has been done and one of the 
frustrations that I have with this when I am sitting at home 
is to see the focus on Koko, the focus for Mr Singh, I call it 
Koko Hunt because the focus must be on the process.  The 
process says there must be an order number.  Was the 
order placed?  And if the order is not placed, who did not 
place the order?  Was the work done?  Who signed the 
goods received, Chair?  Somebody, somebody signs a 
completion certificate, somebody put his neck on the block 
that the work was done. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Who is that guy?  That is a process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And then somebody paid.  We call that three 
matching. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 54 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I think that must be 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   That must be – unless the person who did a 
completion certificate, the person who did goods received, 
the person who did payments comes to you and say 
actually I was given an instruction by the orders above. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To go against the normal… 
MR KOKO:   To go against the normal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Then it will make sense. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a different thing. 
MR KOKO:   That is a different thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not see affidavits or statements 
of the people in the process that says I was given 
instructions to do this unlawful thing.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no – no, what you say is 
important.  You see, Mr Singh is still going to come back, 
he has not finished but what I was hoping he was still 
going to do and I do not know if I said he should do it, is 
not to just speak in general terms to say at Eskom there 
20 
are processes and procedures but to say here are the 
documents that outline who has the responsibility to do 
what in regard to payments.  Here is a document that says 
this is the journey that leads to the actual payment and 
during this journey the following people have got the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 55 of 369 
 
following roles.  He has not done that but he has  
mentioned in general but I certainly will be interested in a 
document that indicates that – and it may well be that Mr 
Seleka knows that document is in one of these big bundles 
but I am interested in whether at Eskom, as I would expect, 
there was a document that says before payment is done, so 
and so should do this, so and so should do that, so and so 
should do that and if one of these things have not been 
done, payment should not be made and who the person is 
who must see to it that they have been done, I assume that 
10 
the person who authorises payment must satisfy himself or 
herself that all of that has been done.  So that kind of 
document I am interested in. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, that will help a great deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It help you get to the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And stop the gossip.  Can I summarise?  In 
Eskom you do not pay an invoice without an order, without 
an order, can only come from a 45 number.  Somebody has 
20 
to do good received and somebody – shared services do 
the payment.  I had to ask him too many questions, that 
the CFO may pay, must authorise a billion rand payment, it 
is not there at Eskom.  But, Chair, please.  Please, Chair, 
the document you are looking for is called managing 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 56 of 369 
 
contracts in SAP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   That is the document you are looking for.  It 
has got all the details of who must do what and when. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And if that has not happened, that is a 
misconduct.  If somebody comes to you and say it was a 
misconduct because the order above said I must override 
this, then you can hunt me or you can hunt somebody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  No, that is important.  If we do 
10 
not have that document, we should have, but it may well be 
that Mr Singh was still to get it and give it to us because 
certainly for his version, it is quite important and it may 
well be that it is important for your version as well, I am 
sure, but certainly for is.  Okay, alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Koko, I have referred to this 
bundle but I am reminded that you say – I am sorry, I just 
need to get this out of the way because otherwise I forget 
it.  You say you and Mr Singh agreed to approach 
McKinsey in regard to the business plan.  When Mr Singh 
20 
was here he testified that when he did not – when he was 
not satisfied with the funding plan that was prepared by Mr 
Andre Pillay, he approached Eric Wood, Mr Eric Wood or Dr 
Eric Wood to assist with that funding plan.  Were you 
aware of that? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 57 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   No.  No, Chair, again, I am terribly sorry I 
have to do this, the document that we took to the board 
was signed by Mr Anoj Singh.  There is a reason why he 
signs it, that reason is not arbitrary, he signs it because he 
is the user.  The user in Eskom is a defined term and he is 
defining Eskom procedures.  To answer Mr Seleka’s 
answer, can I take you to the user, why does he sign and 
pay for it, once again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, the same bundle that we have in 
front of us? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 15. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko’s bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I am sorry, I am going to frustrate 
you with documents and references but a lot of noise 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, then …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:  …is going to disappear because …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is important subject to 
20 
simply saying that Mr Seleka must indicate where to do 
that at a particular time might disorganise his plans but at 
some stage those things must be done particularly when 
people who were affected feel that they are important in 
order to put into the right perspective the points they want 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 58 of 369 
 
to make.  What page did you say, Mr…? 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15, page 677. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just one second.  So, Mr Seleka, 
you will indicate if you would like a particular point to be 
deal with later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But otherwise, if Mr Koko wishes to deal 
with a certain point at a certain time that seems to be 
important I would let him do it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise we can always arrange that it 
be dealt with at a later stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, thank you, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   Except that he has asked me a question so I 
am just answering it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I am now talking in general, 
for the future, I am just simply saying when you wish to 
make a certain point and refer to certain documents, I 
would allow you unless he indicates that he would like that 
to be dealt with later.  Okay, I am there, Mr Koko. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 3.4.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I will read into the record: 
“Since the transactions are based on an end user ’s 
…[intervenes] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 59 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, sorry, did you say 3.4.7? 
MR KOKO:   Certainly, 3.4.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, you did not say you are 
skipping the first sentence so I was – you were saying 
“since and I was looking at “once”. 
MR KOKO:   My apologies, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright  Second paragraph, so 
to speak. 
MR KOKO:   Second paragraph yes. 
““Since the transactions are based on an end user ’s 
10 
request and are page 4 by the end user ’s cost 
centre 
or 
project, 
the 
end 
user 
has 
the 
responsibility 
and 
authority 
to 
determine 
that 
Eskom’s 
needs 
will 
be 
met 
before 
the 
recommendation is made to a delegated authority or 
before an order/contract is placed by providing his 
written 
consent 
through 
sign-off 
of 
the 
recommendations 
being 
presented 
to 
the 
procurement practitioner prior presented to the 
delegated authority.” 
20 
Now the delegated authority this time was the board.  The 
user is Mr Singh, is a finance director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the user or the term user refer to 
the head under whom the project falls, for example, this 
one? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 60 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, so the user refers to – Eskom has got 
cost centres. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And cost centre is delegated a budget and a 
scope.  He needs the work done but he cannot procure 
because 
procurement 
is 
a 
delegated 
function 
of 
procurement so he then goes to commercial and say I have 
these need, the need is a business plan, the need is a 
corporate plan that must comply to the design to cost 
strategy and later on I will take you to the board minutes of 
10 
the 22 n d of 2015, my counsel has that document and you 
will see where the need arose.  In implementing that need, 
we then approached McKinsey but the scope can only be 
signed off by the person who is going to pay because that 
person authorises that I have the money, the money is 
budgeted for, the delegation of authority enjoins that you 
do not do any project that is not budgeted for, it is a 
requirement of the PFMA.  But also, the scope, only the 
user knows that and this procedure says the user consents 
by signing the documents that goes to the delegated 
20 
authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the user the head of the relevant cost 
centre? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Singh would have been the head 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 61 of 369 
 
of the relevant cost centre in this case? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   So the cost centre that was used for the 
business plan would be Mr Singh’s cost centre. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So he is the user. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   He decides the scope.  He decides which 
professional he uses, who he approaches.  I do not know 
10 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now when – we are talking here about 
the corporate plan which led to all – or will lead to the 
MSA, is that right? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
MR KOKO:   And this is where the problem I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   There is a very concerted approach  to want 
to link the two. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the two are completely …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are separate. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, are completely …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, he is the head of the cost centre 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 62 of 369 
 
insofar as the corporate plan relates to his centre. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka, I just to 
make sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is absolutely fine because it 
has been clear in our minds even with Mr Singh that the 
two are different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But, okay, I think your answer to my 
question, Mr Koko, because the question was Mr Singh, 
when he was here, he said he approach Dr Eric Wood to 
assist with the funding plan but you are saying you and him 
agreed to approach McKinsey.  So I am just drawing to you 
the distinction between your version and his version but 
your answer is you do not know – in regard to his version 
you do not know. 
MR KOKO:   I do not know who he approached.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I do not know who he approached, I just know 
that – and I can tell you, Chair, that Mr Singh and I – and I 
think Mr Mabelane, I am not sure, but I think he was there, 
we briefed – we had a meeting with McKinsey and we 
briefed them on our request. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 63 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the corporate plan. 
MR KOKO:   About the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And is your understanding that that was 
the first entity that was approached about the corporate 
plan?  And when I say entity, somebody outside of Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   In my view it was the only entity that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was the only entity. 
MR KOKO:   That I approached. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   That me and him approached.  The rest, I… 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is his story. 
MR KOKO:   I have no… 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not anything about it, the other 
things.  Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it not that when you – sorry, 
because these issues …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka, I am sorry, it might be 
20 
important to establish when it was, if it is possible, that 
that approach in which Mr Koko was present when they 
briefed McKinsey, when it was, because then one can 
check when it was that Mr Singh talks about approaching 
Trillian or Regiments. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 64 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then we can see which one happened 
first. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I can assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Barrie, do you want to give the Chair the 
board minutes of the 22 July? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which year? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what we can do …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   So can get that date …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can mention them and then I can get 
them later if necessary. 
MR KOKO:   The date must have been between the 22 n d of 
– after the 22 July to the 1 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, somewhere during that time. 
MR KOKO:   During that time and the reason for that is 
because the need was triggered – for the business plan 
was triggered in the meeting of the board of the 22 July 
2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   But the first proposal I got from McKinsey is 
dated the 1 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   I have those board minutes available, 
supplied by my client.  I have four copies of it. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 65 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I do not need to see them now but 
arrangements can be made for them to be …[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes, I just do not know whether Mr 
Koko wants to refer to documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or wanted – ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   For my purposes what he has told me is 
enough for now. 
MR KOKO:   So it is just for – I wanted – I wanted – they 
help me with the dates. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   We will come back to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   At one point you will have to see them 
because one of the things that pains me is people coming 
to you to lie to you to make me look bad and I will show 
you in those minutes how that happens.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But the date you are looking for, Chair, is 
between the 22 July. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the 1 August. 
MR KOKO:   And the 1 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes, we will return to that later then, 
ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 66 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think I will – let me just follow my 
sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, please turn to Eskom bundle 
14(c), the one I sought to refer to just before the tea 
adjustment. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, 877. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I did not get 877 point? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 82.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   877. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there.  I am sure you will 
recognise the document. 
MR KOKO:   I do recognise the document, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   877, Chair, point 82.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  877.2? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   82.1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I have 877 but I do not have point 
something.   Is it bundle 15? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   14, Chair, sorry.  Bundle 14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we are moving another bundle, I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 67 of 369 
 
beg your pardon, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   877.82? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 82. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 1.  Acceptance letter on Eskom… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, so Mr Koko let us – this is 
the letter I think signed by you, that is the letter you were 
referring to earlier. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Acceptance letter in respect of the 
Koko plan, it is dated 29 September 2015 and it is 
addressed Dr Alexander Weiss, Vikas Sagar: 
“Notification of acceptance for the provision of 
consulting services.  We accept your proposal for 
the provision of consulting services on a fixed basis 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
specified.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  Mr Barrie, I want 
to try and regularise properly what happens when you wish 
20 
to say something so that you do not just stand and start 
talking.  Now one way in which it could be done is that if 
you switch on your mic, I realise that it is red, I would 
know you would like to say something and then I would let 
you say so. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 68 of 369 
 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Are you able to see that it is...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is the point I am raising 
because where you are I will not see it easily, I wonder 
whether it is possible for you to sit where I will see it 
easily. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Mr Chairman, it is the question of the 
acoustics in this place.  I have to sit here to be able to 
hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay, so if you are going 
to remain there – well, I am trying to see whether if you 
10 
were to be …[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:    Because I missed - for instance, when 
my learned friend refers to bundle 16, I heard bundle 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, I think maybe what we do is 
…[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:   But I will do whatever you want me to 
do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. No, no, that is fine.  Let us say you 
will stand up but wait for me to say you can speak. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Very well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And then the scope 
of work.  Then you have a paragraph called Contract, the 
heading Contract, below that is the terms and conditions of 
the NEC: 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 69 of 369 
 
“Professional services contract will apply.  Contract 
conditions, 
additional 
SD 
and 
L 
requirement.  
Subcontracting of 30% of the contract value to a 
black owned supplier will apply. 
Then you have the fees.  Turn the page please?  There is a 
table to rates and under that there is documentation and it 
reads: 
“The contract documents will be available for your 
signature 
and 
acceptance 
within 
one 
week 
of 
receiving the notification of acceptance or within 
10 
any longer period agreed between Eskom and 
McKinsey and Company.” 
Then there is confirmation: 
“We confirm that a contract will exist between 
Eskom and McKinsey and Company on the above 
basis. 
 
Please 
indicate 
your 
acknowledgment 
thereof 
by 
signing 
below 
and 
deliver 
to 
the 
undersigned.” 
Now those I would like you to explain to the Chairperson 
how should one understand this.  On the first page, which 
20 
refers to the terms and conditions of NEC.  It says: 
“Contract. 
 
Terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
NEC, 
professional services will apply.” 
And on the next page it says: 
“The contract documents will be available for your 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 70 of 369 
 
signature 
and 
acceptance 
within 
one 
week 
of 
receiving the notification of acceptance or within 
any longer period agreed.” 
Could you explain to the Chairperson what should – how 
should this be understood in the light of the conclusion of 
the contract and the provisions that you referred to in that. 
MR KOKO:   Excellent, Chair, and it ties back to the 
discussions that we had. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I see that that last paragraph on 
10 
confirmation speaks to what you were saying. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely the contracts exists once there 
has been that acceptance. 
MR KOKO:   Yes but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And formal contract comes later. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But the issue here, Chair, is that this point 
there cannot be uncertainty about the terms and conditions 
20 
of the contract, there cannot be.  So at this point, the 
terms and conditions of the contract are done and in this 
case we are using NEC contract, standard contract, no 
deviations from the standard contract.  So everybody in 
Eskom, 
it 
is 
like 
a 
militarised 
environment. 
 
NEC 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 71 of 369 
 
conditions, you are not allowed to charge, cut and paste, 
that is what is going to work. 
 
Then the next question will be are there any 
additional conditions that are authorised by the board?  
And the answer is yes, additional conditions authorised by 
the board is a 30% - if you read it, subcontracting 30% of 
the contract value to a black owned supplier will apply.  
That is authorised by the board.  That is additional on 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not in the normal issues. 
10 
MR KOKO:   That is not in the normal issues, that is why it 
is written specifically.  Then the next one is the fees.  Now 
you see – and this is the difference between MSA and this 
one.  The fees are National Treasury’s fees, fixed, not risk-
based. 
 
Now – except the understanding in Eskom, Chair, is 
that once this letter is signed by those parties, it is binding 
and soon thereafter the contract will be signed.  Now – 
yes, that is – so Eskom procedure is that if you want to do 
work before the contract is signed, the GM commercial 
20 
advise you in writing.  So I have no doubt ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, I think that you have 
explained sufficiently, I think Mr Seleka must just be more 
specific in terms of what it is that he would like you to 
...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 72 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  And these letters are standard Chair and the 
fact that it says contract will, it is neither here nor there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Mr Seleka, do you want to be 
more specific as to what you wanted him to explain. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, yes, correct Chair.  The – that 
procurement and supply management procedure Mr Koko 
was saying – it was saying if a contract NEC has been 
used then the obligations of the procurement practitioner 
to ensure that the contract is completed is correct and 
complete with all the drawings, there they use drawings.  
10 
 
And here the letter specifically says contract and it 
says the terms and conditions of the NEC professional’s 
services contract will apply but that is one.  And if you turn 
the page, it says the contract documents will be available 
for your signature and acceptance and it tells them within 
one week or within such longer period as the parties may 
agree.  
So, I wanted you to explain to the Chairperson in 
the light of what is stated in this matter.  When does the 
contract become concluded, when you look at those 
20 
provisions?  And I want to read just before you answer, 
that last sentence which the Chairperson raised. The last 
sentence confirmation says: 
“We confirm that a contract will exist between 
Eskom and McKinsey on the above basis.” 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 73 of 369 
 
Now, Chair it does not say upon your acceptance, but it 
says 
on 
the 
above 
basis, 
which 
basis 
includes 
the 
documentation to be provided for signature and that the 
NEC professional services contract will apply.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but let me maybe ask this question 
that maybe they will, the answers will automatically answer 
that or we will see if there is a need.  Some of these 
questions 
your counsel will be thinking this is law but we just want 
your understanding, because you obviously have been at 
10 
Eskom for many years you were up there.   
So, 
you 
know 
how 
things 
were, 
is 
your 
understanding that when you send the notification of 
acceptance, the contracts is concluded when the supplier 
receives that or when the contract, when the supplier 
receives that and signs, signs it and sends it back to 
Eskom.  Are you are able to assist there in terms of, at 
what point Eskom would regard the contract as having 
been concluded? 
MR KOKO:  Chair, I can assist.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  I have seen many of these things.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:  And part of what you will have to make to 
determine this is the practice and in what you can do with 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 74 of 369 
 
the document.  In Eskom terms once a letter of award is 
signed it is a contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is signed by Eskom or by Eskom 
and the supplier? 
MR KOKO:  Eskom and the supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:  Once the letter of award is signed by both 
Eskom and supplier it is a contract.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
MR KOKO:  What Eskom does not want Chair, is that you 
10 
start doing the work before the actual contract is signed.  
Eskom frowns at that it discourages that but you can do 
that under emergency, if you have…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have good reasons. 
MR KOKO:  Ja, good reasons to do that and the GM of 
procurement must authorise that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I hope that helps but if it does not 
help you can - as I understand it, to the extent that the 
letter of acceptance or maybe speaking about documents 
that on the face of it the supplier, maybe it is still to 
20 
receive, obviously the supplier must see those documents 
before it signs because once it has signed, it will be taking 
have 
to 
have 
been 
accepted, 
that 
would 
be 
my 
understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes to – you mean once it signs the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 75 of 369 
 
acceptance letter Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The acceptance letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yeah, Chair I do not think it is the case 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay I mean you can take it – I am 
just sharing with you my understanding of Mr Koko’s 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Mr Koko, you see on that 
10 
understanding your letter, you signed it on the 29 t h of 
September 2015.  It was counter signed also on the same 
date 29 September 2015 and, on the face of it, I am saying 
on the face of it, it envisages that a contract must be 
signed as the procurement policy contemplates.   
Which is if you use a NEC contract, then the 
procurement practitioner must ensure that the documents 
are correct and complete and there should be a signature 
of the agreement of the contract before services are 
rendered. But did you understand what I am saying, I am 
20 
saying on the face of it, it envisages the signing of the 
agreement.  
MR KOKO:  Chair, Eskom procurement manual is very 
clear. The letter of award is binding and the contract is 
always signed later.  All Eskom letter of award…[intervene] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 76 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but before you answer, Mr Koko, just 
for me to understand the basis of Mr Seleka’s question, or 
what is the basis for that suggestion Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That the letter envisages the conclusion 
of an agreement, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the letter may well envisage the 
conclusion of a contract because the contract will be a 
formal contract would always, according to Mr Koko would 
always come later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I understand you to be making a 
different point namely, the contract must be signed before 
this acceptance is signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, what is the point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before the work is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but that is the point he has made to 
that before the work is done the formal contract must be 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there are circumstances where work 
can be done before the formal contract is concluded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But in that case, you need special 
authorisation from somebody. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 77 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From the GM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and process it, that is his evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so Chair but then, if we take it 
further than Mr Koko if we take it further, because this 
paper, let me take it further Mr Koko.   
The NEC was then exchanged between the parties, 
which is the next, it is on the next pages.  Yes, and two 
things because you will have to explain to the Chairperson 
here we understand that work was done, work was done 
prior to the NEC being signed.  
10 
And you will have to explain to the Chairperson, if 
that was so whether there was a permission in writing, for 
work to be done prior to the NEC being concluded.  But 
then, if you go to the NEC, which is you go further to the 
NEC, you see there that the documentation is not fully 
completed, on the face of which a conclusion could be 
made, that the NEC, if not fully completed, did not come 
into existence. 
So just explain the first one to the Chairperson.  If 
work was done, without the contract being signed, was 
20 
there written permission to do so? 
MR KOKO:  Ja, so Chair I think we have levelled it up on 
the process, now it is about application.  So there would be 
nothing untoward if the work is done without the contract 
signing 
for 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
authorised. 
 There 
is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 78 of 369 
 
nothing…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the right person? 
MR KOKO:  By the right person, there is absolutely nothing 
wrong with that and this is where my frustration is.  If you 
follow the Eskom processes, then you will get to this point 
that says, work was done, we needed a general manager 
sourcing to authorise it, and the general manager sourcing 
in this case happens to have been the project manager of 
this contract Mr Govender. 
So then your line of investigation is targeting the 
10 
right people, then you going to go back and say Mr General 
Manager, procurement, who happens to be the procurement 
manager there is evidence before us, the NEC contract was 
not concluded in fact, the evidence before the Commission 
said it was signed much later - I want to deal with it too, 
because it affects me.  
Did you authorise that the work gets done in writing 
and where is it?  Then you are talking to the right person.  
I am not in a position to assist you with that but if you 
follow the Eskom process, you then would be able to hold 
20 
the right person accountable.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Seleka, where does it say – oh 
this is the terms and conditions of the NEC professional 
service contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 79 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I take that to mean - I do not 
take that to necessarily mean those, the supplier must sign 
those terms.  I take it to mean as long as the supplier 
knows that those are the terms as long - if he has signed, 
or if he has signed the acceptance letter, that is in order.  
But it may well be that somewhere, there is a 
document that says the NEC professional service contract 
must 
be 
signed, 
because 
this 
letter 
notification 
of 
acceptance does not say that the NEC professional service 
contract must be signed, it simply say its terms and 
10 
conditions will apply.  
So for me, if the supplier is aware what those terms 
are, even if they have not signed, that is enough but 
obviously, if there is a requirement somewhere that 
knowledge thereof is not enough, but you must sign then 
that is a different thing.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair, you must read with - read it with 
the – go to the next page Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Under documentation, because that to 
20 
must be read with the policy Mr Koko has referred us to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “The contract documents will be available  
for a signature and acceptance within one week of 
receiving the notification of acceptance or within 
any longer period.” 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 80 of 369 
 
Ja, well I – the contract documents, I guess would include 
the NEC professional services contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For signing and acceptance, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether - I do not know 
how much point you want to make of it, but you must make 
whatever point you would like to make, let us hear what Mr 
Barrie has to say? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  It is regard to the basic principle of 
understanding contracts or documents being that one reads 
the documents within a context of the document as a 
10 
whole, as well as the context of what would have been a 
dependent on the party's intention at the time.  
What is relevant here is, Mr Chairman, is that 
indeed 
as 
my 
learned 
friend 
pointed 
out, 
and 
the 
documentation 
and 
the 
contract 
documents 
will 
be 
available for your signature and acceptance within a week 
of 
receiving 
the 
notification 
of 
acceptance. 
 
That 
acceptance, of course, is right at the very outset of this 
document.  
But what then further occurs is that on page 
20 
877.82.3 there is the following: 
“We acknowledge receipt of your notification of 
acceptance dated 29.” 
This is now filled in now by Dr Weiss here.: 
“Confirming that the contract will exist between 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 81 of 369 
 
Eskom and McKinsey and company from 1 October 
2015, or soon thereafter.” 
So, that is now the acceptance of the contract.  You will 
find 
that 
on 
page 
877.82.3 
and 
then 
furthermore…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no but Mr Barrie, you might be 
addressing a different point.  I think my issue was simply 
whether it is necessary to sign the NEC professional 
services contract but if Mr Seleka says it is and wants to 
pursue that, that is fine.  
10 
I just wanted to say, I was not sure that if the NEC 
professional services contract is not signed but the letter 
of acceptance is signed, I was not sure that, that there 
would be no contracts, in that case, ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Okay, that is the issue that I am 
addressing, because that is confirmation of what we talking 
about and in that regard, further, you will find in other 
words, that that documents contract will exist in from a 
certain date and signed and then in fact…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to say where you were 
20 
reading from so that…[intervene] 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I referred you to two pages further on 
than where you we were page 877.82.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  You will find there an acknowledgement 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 82 of 369 
 
by Mr Weiss, I think it is Dr Weiss on behalf of McKinsey 
completed 
in 
his 
handwriting 
on 
the 
same 
day 
29 
September 2015, his signature as there, are you their sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I am there, ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  So that is then the concluding of the 
contract and the documents that would be available for 
signature within a week they are also here and that you 
will find from the next page, page 877.82.4 and in fact 
these documents were also signed on the same day by 
McKinsey and that you will find on page 877.82.6 where Dr 
10 
Weiss’s 
signature 
again 
appear 
dated 
the 
29 t h 
of 
September 2015.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair, that NEC contract to 
extent that the letter refers to it Chair.  You will see the 
policy under paragraph 3.4. 8 this is two paragraphs.  One 
is that acceptance of the award or notification of award 
and then you have a step dealing with the contract.   
And 
there 
the 
step 
dealing 
with 
the 
contract 
specifically says: 
20 
“If a contract [NEC] is used then the procurement 
practitioner has the steps to do.” 
But let us do this Chair.  Let me ask Mr Koko this question, 
because in the second paragraph signing of the contract is 
explicitly required in that policy.  Let me ask then Mr Koko 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 83 of 369 
 
this, Mr Koko if you saying the letter of acceptance creates 
a contract between the parties because the policy only 
says it is legally binding on Eskom it does not say it 
creates the contract because the contract is dealt with in 
the next paragraph.  If that letter creates a contract, what 
is the need to send the NEC which you say should be 
signed?  
MR KOKO:  Chair, we are dealing with practice here and I 
cannot undo the practice.  It is how Eskom worked all 
along.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is how it worked.  You signed the letter for 
work, the contract with without fail get signed later.  In 
many cases, in a lot of cases, contracts do not get signed 
for years actually…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is wrong. 
MR KOKO:  And Eskom gets embarrassed afterwards, after 
Eskom gets embarrassed afterwards, but that is why the 
contract, the third paragraph I read it is very clear, it says 
first the letter is binding and it creates a contract Chair 
20 
and if you reach a different conclusion, you will create a 
revolution in Eskom, it is okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But no, I do want to ask Mr Seleka what 
it can mean if it says legally binding, if it does not mean a 
contract comes into being, so that I can understand his 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 84 of 369 
 
thinking. 
MR KOKO:  Eskom is 90 years old Chair, binding in Eskom 
terms for Eskom practitioners we have always understood 
it to be creating a contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  You hear my question 
Mr Seleka?  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I heard your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that I can follow if - because, for me, 
coming from the general principle of that an offer an 
acceptance creates a contracts and then you have a 
10 
situation where now an acceptance is contemplated and 
the documents says it is a legally binding, I cannot think of 
any legal consequences other than contract for legal 
consequences. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair when you read it in the 
context of the policy, where they say: 
“Notification of an acceptance of the award will be 
legally binding on Eskom.” 
So that means you have accepted as Eskom the offer made 
by the supplier.  But the policy goes further Chair, it does 
20 
not stop there.  It says: 
“If an NEC agreement or contract is used, then 
ensure that it is signed.” 
And it tells the procurement practitioner what to do all the 
documentation must be in place.  And if I may say the law, 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 85 of 369 
 
the law says: 
“If the parties envisage a written contract to be in 
place, the contract does not come into place until it 
is signed.” 
And that is the reason why I was asking Mr Koko.  If they 
contemplated the NEC terms will apply.  The next page is 
saying: 
“The contract documentation will be given to you for 
signing and acceptance.” 
Why did they send the NEC to the supplier if it is sufficient 
10 
to simply have a letter of acceptance, which created a – 
but he has answered that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because the letter of acceptance 
says depends in the NEC will apply therefore, before the 
supplier signs, the supplier must satisfy itself that it is 
happy with the terms and conditions of the NEC will apply.   
But if the supplier chooses not to wait for the terms 
and conditions of the NEC before it signs, the acceptance 
letter, it seems to me that once they have signed they are 
deemed to know those terms, and they cannot complain - 
20 
on the face of it that is what seems to be the position, as I 
see it.  
But what I am saying is, if you have a different 
understanding, I am not saying do not pursue it but I want 
you to have the benefit of what I make of it.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 86 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yeah, I think Chair and I are slightly on 
different points.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes, 
is 
your 
point 
- 
is 
your 
understanding, just articulate your understanding in terms 
of the substance of what all of this means? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair because my - what is it?  
What I am putting to Mr Koko arises from even from the 
policy itself.  One, and then from their own practice, which 
is what Mr Koko is referring to, one is they have done the 
first step in terms of the policy, they exchange the letter of 
10 
awards or the letter of acceptance.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Number two, is the next step in the 
policy which they also do, which is to exchange the NEC 
for signing and acceptance.  Now, my question to him is, if 
the letter of acceptance creates a binding agreement, what 
is the need for the second state, which the policy 
contemplates and which is also executed by them, by him 
in this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is there something that says the NEC 
20 
document must be sent to the supplier after the supplier 
has signed the acceptance letter? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and that is where I think Chair are, 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, on your understanding? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 87 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not, because if it does not - if 
your understanding, if it is not your understanding that the 
NEC documents must be sent to the supplier after they 
have 
signed 
the 
letter 
of 
acceptance 
and 
if 
your 
understanding is that is to be sent or at the same time as 
the acceptance letter, I do not see a problem.  But I will 
see a problem - I will see your problem, if you say the 
policy and the documents contemplates that the sending of 
the NEC document should happen after the supplier has 
10 
signed the acceptance letter.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, when you read the policy Chair, 
and when you look at the steps taken, because this I think 
Mr Koko’s letter is in accordance with that policy.  So the 
acceptance between the offer…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us read the policy, just read the 
relevant policy so that we do not speculate about what it 
says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, it says first is: 
“Notification of award.” 
20 
So once approval has been given to the award of the 
contract with to the successful supplier.  
“The procurement practitioner notifies the supplier 
of the acceptance of his tender.  The procurement 
practitioner must ensure that this notification is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 88 of 369 
 
received 
by 
the 
successful 
supplier 
because 
notification 
of 
acceptance 
will 
become 
legally 
binding upon Eskom.  Emailed notification will be 
subject 
to 
electronic, 
the 
Act, 
the 
Electronic 
Communications and Transitions Act.” 
That is point 1.  So they do the acceptance, here is we 
accept 
your 
awards, 
and 
they 
would 
sign 
– 
of 
my 
understanding is they would then sign that acceptance 
letter both Eskom and the supplier.  Then you have point 
2…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why do - obviously Eskom would 
have signed the letter of acceptance before it sends it to 
the supplier.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why do you say that before there is 
step 2, the supplier would have signed was the basis for 
saying that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, I am not necessarily saying 
that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Step 1, might consist of only Eskom 
20 
sending the notification without necessarily the supplier 
signing this, isn’t it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that is one scenario we accept that 
okay, then what is supposed to come after that? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 89 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then 2, is compiling the order/contract. 
It says: 
“The 
procurement 
officer 
responsible 
for 
the 
compilation administration and finalisation of the 
contract/order.  If a contract [NEC/FIDIC] has been 
used the procurement practitioner together with the 
cross functional team ensures that the contract 
documents 
are 
correct 
and 
complete 
with 
all 
drawings and specifications and included as part of 
the 
contract, 
and 
the 
procurement 
practitioner 
10 
arranges 
for 
the 
printing 
of 
the 
contract 
for 
purposes of signature.” 
And then you have Step 3, which is signing the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us talk about step 2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On my understanding.  There is nothing 
inconsistent with Mr Koko’s evidence about step 2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay let us go to step 3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you will see the point I am trying 
20 
for Mr Koko to explain is, if step 1 creates a contract 
Chair, what is the need for step 2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If - remember that, on your approach, 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 90 of 369 
 
step 1 consists of the sending of the notification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, Mr Koko as I understand his 
evidence, did not say that upon the sending of the 
notification a contract is created he said the supplier must 
sign. 
MR SELEKA SC:  He was reading that legally binding Chair 
from step 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – it was clarified you remember I 
asked him a question later on. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he said it has got to be signed by – by 
the supplier.  Mr Koko am I putting words in your mouth? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So -  so his evidence is the contract 
will come into being after the – will not come into being 
before the supplier signs. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean I did not take it a step further with 
might be legal whether after the supplier has signed the fact 
of the signature that they have signed must come to the 
attention of Eskom.  You know that is – I thought it is enough 
for him – for his purposes that he has said the contract will 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 91 of 369 
 
come – will come into being after the supplier has signed.  
So – so and that part the signature of the supplier need not 
be on the same day as when the – when Eskom signs the 
acceptance letters.  But it could be  
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it could be a day later, it could be a 
week later or whatever. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON: Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  If – ja let us accept that Chair – let 
10 
us accept that.  The question is the signing of the contract is 
envisaged in the policy not only in the policy – well in the 
policy and hence I think they may have done so in this letter 
Mr Koko is saying we will send the documentation to you for 
signing and acceptance. 
 
And I think that is where my question lies which is if 
then we accept the notification is out and it has been 
accepted and it has been accepted because that three year 
is signing the contract in terms of the policy which is also 
what is envisaged in the letter. 
20 
 
Why do we need that if the acceptance… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you need what? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Why do we need the signing of the 
contract when the letter one signed by the supplier creates 
the contract? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 92 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you remember I think I said to him it 
may well be that for purposes of having all – all terms and 
conditions in one document that might be necessary – 
convenience that is what I said.  Mr Koko you may have 
dealt with this but do you want to respond to that?   
 
The question is, if there is already a contract after 
the supplier has signed the letter of acceptance why is there 
a need for a contract to be 00:02:50 to get later? 
MR KOKO:  Chairman I – I have got two answers to that.  
Besides saying – besides telling you that it is – it is 
10 
precedent and it is a culture we found it working that way but 
in my day to day life I find – I found a signed contract that 
clarifies a lot of issues.   
 
So – so we – I have always been better off … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes with a contract. 
MR KOKO:  With a contract than with a letter of award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Than different pieces of documents. 
MR KOKO:  Than different pieces – it takes away grey 
areas.  But Chair I need to say the second thing that the – 
the 32 10  34 contemplates any form of contract.  I has got 
20 
its – no – I think we are overemphasising NEC whether it is 
Fedic or NEC or Bespoke the – the design of the 1032 
document is that one is viewed as a letter of award.  The 
procurement 
practitioner 
must 
put 
together 
contract 
documents and it is his or her responsibility to make sure 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 93 of 369 
 
that it is signed by a person who is duly delegated by the 
Board and Tender Committee. 
 
So whether it is NEC or not it is irrelevant.  Whether 
it is Fedic it is irrelevant.  Whether it is Bespoke it is 
irrelevant.  But all put together they must be 00:04:27 and be 
signed by a person who is duly authorised by the Board 
Tender 
Committee 
and 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
procurement practitioner that he or she does that (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja thank you Chair.  So if it is the offer 
10 
and acceptance stage creates a legal and binding agreement 
on the face of that very letter with minimal details can you 
imagine SOE’s contracting on millions like they did there 
R101 million on the basis of that letter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see Mr Seleka as far as the law is 
concerned we all know the general principle that if there is 
an offer and an acceptance as a general principle that is a 
contract.  Okay.  Obviously the offer and acceptance must 
include all the necessary terms and conditions if they are not 
included and it is not valid contract. 
20 
MR KOKO:  And in this case they were included. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the general principle of law.  
Now of course it is possible that in a certain sector or 
scenario there could be legislation or there could be a policy 
of an entity that says until there is a formal contract signed 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 94 of 369 
 
nothing is binding that the parties may have exchanged.  You 
know.    
But if you do not have anything either by way of 
legislation or by way of the regulations and rules or policies 
of an entity that deviate from that general principle one 
would expect that that general principle would apply as long 
as all those terms and conditions are there.  But if Eskom 
has maybe there is legislation that says well when you deal 
with Eskom you will not have that contract just because of 
exchanges of emails and whatever and discussions there 
10 
must be a formal contract then that is different. 
 
So as I understand it in this case nobody has said to 
me that there was such legislation or rules or regulations but 
you have made a certain point with regard to the policies but 
I do not know whether to go that far. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair can I say this because the – 
maybe that will close it and that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  The offer and acceptance principle does 
not stop there Chair.  If the parties envisage that they should 
20 
sign a contract which is what is contemplated here – 
contemplated in that letter.  Then the contract comes into 
existence as contemplated by the parties upon them signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is… 
MR SELEKA SC:  And that is to the extent I am taking it. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 95 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that – that is in order as a principle 
to say. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the parties say for a certain period we 
will negotiating. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And during the negotiations certain things 
might be said to each other but we do not want to argue 
about whether why we were – while the one party thought we 
were still negotiating the other one thought we have already 
10 
had a contract. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore there will be no contract until 
there is a formal contract that is – that position can apply.  
So if you say this is – this what you believe here is the 
position here.  Then it is a question of going to the basis for 
that and that to happen. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Hm.  Yes I think I – Mr Koko I think I have 
traversed it with you because from the policy I see the policy 
being staggered in terms of process.  One of notification of 
20 
award, the next is what the practitioner should do in terms of 
preparing the documentation for the contract and the third 
step is the signing of the contract itself.  And I see you letter 
being consistent with that process.   
MR KOKO:  Chairman I have – I have said my say I cannot 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 96 of 369 
 
take this further. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  A letter – a letter of award and acceptance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  To Eskom terms is legally binding put a contract 
with 00:09:21. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  That is different parties but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Let me – let me say it another issue Chair.  I 
appreciate the risk that is raised by Mr Seleka that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  About SMNE’s? 
MR KOKO:  Not about SMNE’s about doing the work without 
a contract with a letter of award. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And the policy is very clear as well.  If you read 
it is very clear. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  It says it does not – it does not take kindly to 
20 
work starting without a signed contract.  It is very clear.  
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  But it does say also there are circumstances 
that may … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would equate to may render it acceptable. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 97 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  That may render it acceptable – except that it be 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And what I am trying to put it to you is that – 
and I am not saying so I am saying there may well have been 
but if the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Such a case. 
MR KOKO:  But if the – there may have been such a case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And if you are not targeting – if you are not a – 
10 
if you are not a Koko hunt you may get to a decent answer to 
that. And if there is no decent answer to that then you are 
zooming into the right person.  I am simply asking you Chair 
stop the Koko hunt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not doing a Koko hunt Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:  But they – if they… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko you – you  
MR KOKO:  If they follow the procedures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did say you cannot help with the 
question of whether work was or was not done before the 
20 
contract was concluded. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you did say the person who would 
know about that I think it is Mr 00:11:00. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 98 of 369 
 
MR SELEKA SC:  And whether or not if work was done 
before the contract was concluded whether the requirement 
of the policy for that to happen were met. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be him. 
MR KOKO:  Correct.  What I need to help you with Chair and 
here it is again following the process.  The – when Mr Singh 
was here previously it was put to him that the contract – this 
contract we are looking at was actually signed by Mr 
Mabelane and not by Mr Koko who was delegating. 
10 
 
This question arise again in the High Court.  Eskom 
makes a case that says we cannot find a delegation of 
authority that Mr Mabelane relied on to sign this contract 
because the delegation was to Mr Koko. 
 
I have a duty to assist you there. 
MR SELEKA SC:  And may I assist Chair. 
MR KOKO:  And if I can I will do that now. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Yes may I assist because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  I did not ask the question why Mr 
20 
Mabelane signed.  That was a piggy back from Mr Singh’s 
answer that he does not why Mr Mabelane signed because 
the delegation was given to Mr Koko.  And then I said to him 
oh but does it mean Mr Mabelane then did not have authority 
to sign in which event even if he had signed properly the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 99 of 369 
 
contract would not have come into – into existence.   
 
Then he said no, no, no he cannot recall whether the 
delegation was given to the person or to the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the position. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So I did not put – Mr Koko is burning 
to deal with that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  But it is – I have seen that point. 
MR KOKO:  And I have to Chair because the following day 
the headlines were Mr Singh throws Mr Koko under the bus 
10 
because Mr Koko did not sign as authorised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So – so my name has been dragged in the mud I 
have to correct it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  It is personal issue because that is five year old 
– my five year old comes to me with a newspaper clip, Daddy 
what is going on here?  So I have to correct that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  No that is fine.  And you know then Mr 
Koko just to close off on this that we have to put to Mr Singh 
something that we can also put to you that the NEC contract 
that was contemplated to be signed was in fact not signed 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 100 of 369 
 
properly by Mr Mabelane.  You aware of that? 
MR KOKO:  Chair I – and this is what I want – I want to be 
allowed to deal with Chair.  So I am going to give you a set 
of documents – a document that answers that I have to.  I 
have to do it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am sorry I did not hear the question – 
what is the question? 
MR SELEKA SC:  What I am putting to him Chair is that the 
NEC contract that was envisaged to be signed it is in the 
bundles also in Mr Singh’s bundle is not signed properly or 
10 
completely by Mr Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So were you asking him whether he was 
aware of that or not? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Whether he was aware of that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he would like to deal with that? 
MR KOKO:  Yes I want to deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  And my straight with – my straight answer to 
20 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And I will answer you straight and I will show 
you the documents. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 101 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  I did – I do not know, I did not know, I could not 
have known.  I was not in a position to know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  No but I want to show you the documents 
because this question it is going to come back again when 
you deal with Mr – with Ms Mothepu’s argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let us see this document. 
MR KOKO:  I want to deal with it now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him to refer to the documents Mr 
10 
Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Do you want to go the documents? 
MR KOKO:  Yes I want to do that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  The NEC  
MR KOKO:  No, no, no. 
MR SELEKA SC:  The NEC 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I – last night … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The document signed by Mr Mabelane. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one you are looking for. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  No, no I have it 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  I am just 00:15:06 I am just having this file here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay tell us once you know which bundle 
we must look at. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 102 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  Ja it is not in the bundle.  It is not in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  But after Mr Singh’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I went to dig but I have got the documents here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they are not part of the bundle. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay why – why do we not do it this way 
because we are close to lunch time?  Why do we you not 
share the documents with Mr Seleka and I can be given 
10 
those and then when we come back you can deal with them? 
MR KOKO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us do it that way. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Chair maybe the witness must first just 
specify what document he is referring to because I believe 
that it might be in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  No Mr Barrie you do not – do not have it 
because I picked it up last night it is not in our bundle.  So I 
have that now. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay alright.  Alright let us – let us  
MR SELEKA SC:  Adjourn 00:15:55. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we are to – but when he deals with 
them it is better that I have a copy and you have a copy. We 
can do one of two things because there is still ten minutes.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 103 of 369 
 
Mr Koko you can deal with this issue when we come back. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if Mr Seleka can use the last ten 
minutes – next ten minutes to ask other questions let us do 
that? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I read it?  Thanks.  Chair I want 
us – Mr Koko I want us to go back to those emails – Bundle 
18 – Eskom Bundle 18.  And – ja.  Eskom Bundle 18 page 
1018. 
MR KOKO:  My apologies Mr Seleka.   
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  (b).  That is the one we were using – we 
started off with this morning.   
MR KOKO:  Yes I must find it. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
MR KOKO:  I have got it Chair. 
MR SELEKA SC:  You have got it thanks.  And – and Mr 
Koko I want to expedite the issue of the emails.  You 
mentioned – yes because we gave you Dr Ngubane’s 
affidavit you mentioned that affidavit. Before I get to the 
affidavit you have said every time you exchanged these 
20 
emails with infoportal you would have a meeting with Dr 
Ngubane and Ms Daniels.  Correct? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  The email regarding the visas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry can I just check this?  When you 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 104 of 369 
 
received an email from infoportal would you have meeting – 
a meeting with the two or would you only have a meeting 
with them if or when you had sent something to infoportal or 
both? 
MR KOKO:  Chairman what I would normally do or I will have 
a discussion if it is Tuesday with Ms Daniels and I will tell 
her what is coming.  And then I will send the documents.  
Then she will arrange a meeting.  And then she will print the 
documents and then we will have a discussion with Dr 
Ngubane. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I am asking is whether you 
are saying irrespective of whether you would have sent a 
document to infoportal or whether you would have received a 
document from infoportal from an email there would be such 
a meeting or whether you are saying there would only be 
such a meeting if you were – you had sent or were about to 
send? 
MR KOKO:  Chairman I have – I have received one or two 
emails from infoportal address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  And most of the time you sent. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Most of the time I sent 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And the first one – the first one that I received I 
was in Indonesia and I was not even aware that it came from 
infoportal – ja that was the visa one.  The second one is the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 105 of 369 
 
one I sent – I forwarded to Ms Daniels on the 10 t h of 
December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Which I also followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Up with her to say do we need a meeting and he 
says no we do not a meeting we have it – she has got it in – 
under control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  So – so most of the time… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So most of the time it was when you 
were… 
MR KOKO:  Most of the time it is when I sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  When I have a consistent to the briefing that I 
got when I first came back that when you have an issue that 
you think you are not seeing eye to eye with the chair or with 
the board make it available to the chair and let us discuss it 
before the board really meets and deals with it and you clear 
the air on that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Hm.  Please turn to page 1078.  1078.   
MR KOKO:  Ja.  I am there. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So this is again an email from you 
Wednesday 30 September 2015 to infoportal and it says:  Re 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 106 of 369 
 
attached to this is this letter on the next page which is Dr 
Ngubane’s letter to Minister Brown. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So why on – on your version of this being 
Dr Ngubane’s email address why would you send his letter to 
himself? 
MR KOKO:  Ja so – so Chair this – this is the most – what is 
the right – I must choose – I must choose the right word.  
This was the most horrendous letter that was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You choose a very strong word. 
10 
MR KOKO:  I am – I could have chosen the worst word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  That Ms Daniels made available to me to 
implement.  I was at that point the Chief Procurement Officer 
for Eskom.  The board of Eskom regularly and unlawfully 
takes a decision to boycott Mail and Guardian, City Press 
and Sunday Times for whatever reason.  And then it comes 
to me to implement.  It is an unlawful instruction Chair.  I 
cannot implement it.  And it was never implemented.   
And again we – we discussed it with Dr Ngubane, we 
20 
discussed it with Ms Daniels.  It was never implemented and 
I was never in trouble.  If I decided not to send it back to Mr 
Ngubane for discussion and I did not implement it I would 
have ended up same work ended up with 00:22:53.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now just for the sake of completeness the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 107 of 369 
 
attachment to the email that Mr Seleka is asking you about is 
a letter signed by Dr Ngubane on the 30t h September 2015 
and it is addressed to the Minister of Public Enterprises and 
Ms Lynne Brown and says: 
“Dear Minister Brown.  And the subject is 
Suspension 
of 
Contacts 
in 
any 
form 
whatsoever and or commercial relationship 
with the Mail and Guardian, City Press and 
Sunday Times and the letter reads: 
The 
above 
matter 
has 
reference 
and 
10 
Minister’s correspondence of 28 September 
2015.  The board has deliberated on the 
issues and found that Eskom is experiencing 
a similar trend as the Transnet for example.  
Accordingly the board has resolved that 
Eskom “Eskom shall suspend any dealings 
be it the placement of the advertising or any 
other commercial relationship with the Mail 
and Guardian, Sunday Times and City Press 
pending the resolution of the complaints that 
20 
the state owned entities have against the 
three newspapers “.  Mr Anoj Singh has 
abstained due to a conflict of interest as he 
was the subject of one of their articles 
published. 
 
This 
decision 
has 
been 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 108 of 369 
 
communicated to the Group Chief Executive 
to implement with immediate effect. I trust 
that the Minister will find this in accordance.” 
Yes that is it – so that is the – are you therefore 
saying that this letter which was – seems to have been sent 
to 
the 
Minister 
was 
given 
to 
you 
for 
purposes 
of 
implementing the resolution? 
MR KOKO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The resolution. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you believe that the instruction was 
unlawful and you then wanted to discuss it with Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:  Chairman I do not believe it is an unlawful 
instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  But you then wanted to discuss 
it with Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You say that is your explanation for 
your email at page 1078? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Well that paragraph Mr 
Koko says the decision has been communicated to the Group 
Chief Executive.  Were you the Group Chief Executive since 
September 2015? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 109 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  No. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So why you placing yourself in the Koko 
hunt? 
MR KOKO:  Because I am the Group Commercial Officer.  I 
am the Chief Procurement Officer.  The Chief Executive does 
not execute a procurement decision.  It – the delegations for 
procurement is with the – with me since my office.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that the letter or the 
resolution of the board according to this letter said that the 
Group – or not the resolution but the letter to the extent that 
10 
it said the decision had been communicated to the Group 
Chief Executive to implement with immediate effect.  The 
point you are making is that the GCEO would actually in 
order to ensure that the decision was implemented would 
require you to implement that decision. 
MR KOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were raising the issue because in 
the end you were going to be the implementer. 
MR KOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka it is one o’clock.  
20 
Let us take the lunch break we will resume at 2.  We 
adjourn. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 110 of 369 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson, we were in Eskom 
Bundle 18 on that page 1079, dealing with the letter from 
Dr Ngubane to Minister Lynne Brown, which Mr Koko 
attaches to that email.  If I may, I would like to expedite 
this by referring Mr Koko to the affidavit of Dr Ngubane.  
Mr Koko, you will have a bundle with that affidavit.  Eskom 
Bundle 9.  Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before you proceed with 
your questioning Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...with reference to Dr Ngubane’s 
supplementary affidavit ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...let me raise something with Mr Koko.  
I think one of the points you made about this letter, 
Mr Koko, at page 1079(?) is in effect that it would have 
made no sense for you to send it to a supplier, I think.  Is 
that correct?  It would have been no use to them or 
something.  You made a point along those lines.  And I 
20 
understood that to be saying.   
 
To the extent that anybody suggests that I was 
communicating 
with 
Mr 
Salim 
Essa 
and 
that 
I 
was 
knowingly – I knowingly sent this letter to Mr Salim Essa 
the infoportal email address, it was his or was being used 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 111 of 369 
 
by him.  That would not make sense but it would make 
sense if I was sending it to Dr Ngubane in order to raise 
the issue that I wanted to raise.  Did I understand you 
correctly? 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly.  Or any other third party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  What I want to raise with 
you is that.  If, of course, the position were that indeed the 
infoportal address was Mr Salim Essa’s address or that 
whatever came from that email address came from him and 
whatever was sent to it was being sent to him, whether 
10 
intentionally or not, but it would end with him.   
 
The position would be that, if I recall correctly, 
the documents or there is a letter, there are documents or 
emails that came from the infoportal address which were 
raising the same subject, namely, which were, if I recall 
correctly, to the effect that the board should take a 
decision that Eskom should not have any interactions or 
should terminate whatever relationship they might have 
with these three newspapers, the Mail & Guardian, The 
City Press and, I think, the Sunday Times.   
20 
 
Now when Dr Ngubane was giving evidence, 
reference was made to such a document and that it was 
given to him and he said he took it to the board and the 
board made a resolution that was in line with what was 
being requested in the documents or emails that came from 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 112 of 369 
 
the infoportal address.   
 
So if that is the true and if it was to be said that 
you were sending this to Mr Salim Essa or to whoever had 
sent those documents.  Then what it would – what it could 
mean is that you were sending this letter to show that the 
board had taken the decision that they had wanted.  So I 
am saying that that is a possible line of looking at the 
matter, if your evidence is not true.   
 
If the other evidence is that – if the evidence is 
or if the suggestion is made that you knew you were 
10 
sending – you knew you were not sending it to Dr Ngubane.  
You knew you were sending it to Mr Salim Essa, for 
example.  What do you say to that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is – if my memory serves me well 
because I listened to the evidence of Dr Ngubane.  That 
attachment was in one of the infoportal email addresses 
that went to Mr Ngubane.  I do not think I am mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, I think you are right there. 
MR KOKO:   Secondly.  It is one of the documents whose 
properties showed that it was originated by Mr Dan 
20 
Mantsha and Eddy by Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I also do not think I am mistaken there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, I do not remember any 
reference to Mr Mantsha or also about the ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 113 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   I can tell you know that is what Mr Seleka put 
to one of the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And let us just carry on, on that line because 
that suggests that we are doing the bidding for Mr Essa or 
his associate.  When it comes to me and I am part of the 
club, I am part of the scheme, I would not stop it.  I would 
religiously instruct my teams and create reasons why my 
teams’ work were executed but I did the opposite.  I 
stopped it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer to what I – what I was 
putting to you is.  Well, I hears what might be said. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at a practical level, I stopped this. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And stopping it is not consistent with me 
doing Mr Salim Essa’s bidding and so on? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And you will find, and we are going to go into 
20 
this more often.  All these transactions that I am accused 
of doing the bidding for Mr Essa.  Guess who stopped 
them?  Me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   It is the opposite.  If I was doing the bidding 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 114 of 369 
 
for Mr Essa, I would have found the reason to pay the 
R 30 million invoice that Ms Goodson came to talk about.  
If I was doing the bidding for Mr Essa, when Ms Daniels 
came to me with a motivation for the payment of the 
R 460 million to McKinsey, part of it ended up with Trillian, 
I would have found a reason to sign it but I stopped it.  
That cannot be the characteristic consistent with a person 
who is doing the bidding for Mr Essa.  That cannot be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  I just wanted you to get a 
chance to deal with that possible line of thinking. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  But you...  
Well, you would have seen from Dr Ngubane’s affidavit that 
he denies that the email address, firstly is his.  Secondly, 
which is more important for your purposes, that he had 
meetings with you pursuant to the documentation here 
attached to this email you sent to infoportal.  Your 
comment on that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I – Dr Ngubane makes sense to me 
20 
when he says – when he suggested that he does not know 
the infoportal or not.  It does not make sense.  No, he does 
not make sense.  It does not make sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He does not – he says it is not his 
email address. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 115 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Ja-no, he says it is not his.  So I may find that 
reasonable.  But let me tell you the difficulty that 
Dr Ngubane is faced with and it is a similar difficulty, we 
will deal with in more detail when we get into Ms Daniels.  
Dr Ngubane came here and told you that the only time he 
came – he interacted or he came across the infoportal 
address was August 2016, okay?  That is what he told you.  
It is in his affidavit.  And he says at that point he was told 
that it belongs to Mr Seleke.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Richard Seleke. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Mr Richard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   When you and Mr Seleka did the probing and 
you put the affidavit of Ms Matsietsi to him.  What actually 
Ms Matsietsi says, she was the one acting as the DG at 
that point.  Mr Seleke was not in the employ of the 
department.  And this email that you said you came across 
it, could not belong to Mr Seleke.  So you cannot be right.  
As a matter of fact, you used this email address in 
September 2016.   
20 
 
It is – you are not being truthful.  That is not 
what you told him you are more decent than that.  You 
cannot be truth – it cannot be truthful that you only knew 
about it in September 2016.  You have actually used it in 
August 2016.  You have actually used in September 2017 – 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 116 of 369 
 
in September 2016.   
 
And in September 2016, Ms Matsietsi was the 
acting Chair ...[indistinct] was not in the department.  So 
your version is not right.  I remember his...  Oh, well.  Oh, 
well.  That is all what he said.  He said nothing further than 
that.  He has a difficulty, Chair.   
 
He is intended in this infoportal address and he 
is trying to distance himself.  He has been dishonest with 
you on this email address.  I am shocked that he denies 
the meeting that he had the meeting with me and Ms 
10 
Daniels.  Ms Daniels denies that.  It can only be the 
characteristics of people who have come to you, lied to you 
to save their skin.   
 
I cannot phantom the reason why he denied it.  I 
cannot explain to you...  I mean, my counsel takes me task 
on many occasions:  But Mr Koko, why would these people 
lie about you?  Why?  And I said:  Mr Barrie, but I do not 
know.  Here is Dr Ngubane who came to lie to you about 
the August 2016 email.  Why did he lie?  I do not know.  
We do not know.   
20 
 
That is common cause that he was not truthful.  
It is common cause.  Why?  I do not know.  He is trying to 
distance himself from the entanglement he finds himself in.  
That is the only explanation I can give.  And it is 
disappointing.  Dr Ngubane’s interactions with me has been 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 117 of 369 
 
– the interaction with a father and son interaction.   
 
And I would never have thought that on – at one 
stage, on a single day, he will deny the type of interactions 
that he had with me, which is in those meetings, he made 
the right decisions.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say about the fact that 
Ms Daniels also denies those interactions? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, Ms Daniels is worse.  You have got a 
worse problem there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR KOKO:   So.  And to answer you there.  And please, 
Chair, I want to take – I want you to go to Bundle 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   No, no.  First, let us go to her last affidavit.  
The latest affidavit that you sent me last night.  Have you 
got it?  Ms Daniels’ affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you are able to say what you 
need to say without us going back, do that.   
MR KOKO:   No...  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is important, then we can 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I will do it Chair.  But my experience now with 
the Commission is that I have to show you the documents, 
otherwise you forget.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 118 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   And let me tell you, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Let me go and say this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Ms Daniels says to me.  To distance herself 
from the infoportal address, she says to you that actually 
Mr Koko was my supervisor on the 20 t h of July 2015.  He 
had no reason to take an email from me and say it is for 
Ms Daniels.  It is for the chairman.  It could not have been 
a reason for that because he was my supervisor.  I was not 
10 
in the chairman’s office.   
 
That is what she said.  I told you then that she is 
lying to you but when I left it worried me and I went to dig 
up documents to show you that she is lying.  For a start.  
The bundle that I want to take you to, it is her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can go there. 
MR KOKO:   It is her affidavit.  Can you go to her 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
20 
MR KOKO:   You can go to Ms Daniels’ latest affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And you...  Chair, I cannot tell you why would 
Ms Daniels come and lie to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 119 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   I cannot just come and tell you that but she is 
doing it.  And the only reasons she is doing it is to make 
me look bad and hopefully she thinks I would not have the 
documentary evidence to show you that she is indeed 
lying.  That is the only reason.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka, if you can guide me to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did state what bundle it is, hey? 
MR KOKO:   I think is Bundle 8. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 8. 
MR KOKO:   Am I right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That is right, Chair.  I think it is in 
8(b).  Is that right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 8(b)? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Let 
us 
see. 
 At 
page 
1079 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it Bundle 8(b). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am guessing Chair now but I wanted 
to see whether ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, find out where it is first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it not – has it not been 
...[indistinct]  
MR KOKO:   No, you sent it to me last night.

CHAIRPERSON:   ...put in the same place? 
MR KOKO:   It is the bundle that you have sent me last 
night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, has it not been put into the bundle? 
MR KOKO:   No, it is in the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it is in the bundle Chair.  Just help 
Mr Koko there. 
JUNIOR COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
your 
junior 
will 
remember, 
Mr Seleka, exactly where it is. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, page 1079. 
MR KOKO:   I do not have ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have it in Eskom Bundle 8(b).  That is 
the very last affidavit.  Ja, that is the one, Chair, you have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got Bundle 8(b) and page 
1079 is the certificate of authentication and page 108 is 
the beginning of the affidavit.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the one Chair.   
MR KOKO:   Somewhere in here, Mr Seleka, you will find.  
She says:  Mr Koko was my supervisor in 2015. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you want that first? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 11, Chair, page 1082.  I am going 
to read into the record. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 121 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it.  Ja, do that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
“I met with Mr Koko shortly after his meeting 
with Mr Bester. 
At this time, I still held the position of Senior 
Manager in the Office of the Group Executive 
Technology. 
Thus Mr Koko was my direct supervisor...” 
 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There, in that paragraph, is she talking 
10 
about what followed after, what she refers to in paragraph 
10, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
20 t h of July 2015? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when she says shortly after his 
meeting, is she talking about the meeting on the 20 t h? 
MR KOKO:   The meeting on the 20 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes, continue. 
MR KOKO:   Now, Chair...  Mr Barrie, what is the bundle on 
the 11 t h of April 2015? 
20 
ADV BARRIE:   Oh, what the witness refers to is earlier in 
this very same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BARRIE:   I will just find it.  I think it is page 6. 
MR KOKO:   It is Bundle 8, page 6.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 122 of 369 
 
ADV BARRIE:   [Indistinct]  [Speaker is not clear – not 
close to microphone.]  Ja, even ...[indistinct], paragraph 8 
on page 6.  I am just trying to...  Eskom 08-0006.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess it must be Bundle 8(a), not 8(b). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Most probably. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  If it is page 6, it would be Bundle 
8(a).  Yes, that is Bundle 8(a).  I see that paragraph 9 of 
page 6 of Bundle 8(a), she says: 
10 
“I was appointed by Group Company Secretary 
on 1 October ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, that is actually paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 8? 
ADV BARRIE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
“Subsequently, I was transferred to the Office 
of the Chairman on 11 April 2015...” 
 
And then paragraph 9: 
“I was appointed Group Company Secretary on 
20 
1 October 2015 and held this position until 
27 July 2017 when the current Interim Board of 
Eskom accepted my resignation as Company 
Secretary. 
The duties of the Company Secretary are set 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 123 of 369 
 
out in Section 8(8)(?) of the Companies Act...” 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I also have brought in the minutes 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   ...of the board ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   ...of the 22 n d of July 2015, two days after I 
came back.  You have to look at them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But let...   
MR KOKO:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to make whatever point you 
want to make with regard these two? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  That minute – those minutes adds up to 
that lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I guess your point must be that she 
did not hold the position that she says she held at that 
20 
time? 
MR KOKO:   She...  The only reason she comes to you and 
say:  Mr Koko was my supervisor on... is because she tried 
to create a distance.  She is trying to say that I was not in 
the chairman’s office.  I could not have given Mr Koko an 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 124 of 369 
 
email address of Dr Ngubane and I could not have had 
access to it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   That is all what she is trying to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say she was still in the Office of 
the Chair ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, I want you to look at the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Barrie, can you give the Chair the minutes, 
please? 
10 
ADV 
BARRIE: 
 
 
I 
have 
three, 
four 
copies 
here, 
Mr Chairman, of the minutes of the Special Eskom Board 
Meeting held on 22 n d July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  The registrar will take those.  We 
do not have them in the bundles? 
ADV BARRIE:   Not as far as I am aware, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Give us - another copy too 
to Mr Seleka.   
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, what you have in front of you is the 
20 
minutes of the board two days after I returned to Eskom 
after my suspension.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Dated 22 n d July 2015.  And the first page is 
people who attended the meeting.  At the top is the board 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 125 of 369 
 
members, in the middle is the officials.  You will see at that 
point Mr Phukubje was the Company Secretary and at the 
bottom are the people in attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   You will see Ms Daniels’ name is there as the 
Office of the Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   So she has come to you to lie to you.  Why 
did she come to you to lie?  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I cannot explain why she came to lie to you.  
And so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying when you go to 
Bundle 8(a), page 6, paragraph 8, she says she was 
transferred to the Office of the Chairman on 11 April 2015.   
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then on paragraph 9, she says she 
was appointed as Company Secretary on 1 October 2015, 
which suggests an acceptance that in July 2015, she was 
still in the Office of the Chairperson. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are saying the minutes of the 
meeting of the board of the 22 n d of July 2015, reflects her 
as her having been in attendance as somebody from the 
Chairperson’s Office. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 126 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, to the extent that she says in 
July 2015, you were her direct supervisor.  You say that 
cannot be true? 
MR KOKO:   I am saying it is false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Now the question is why?  Why?  I do not 
know  The only reason she does, I can – I – you – the 
last(?)... proposition...  The only proposition I can think 
that she wants to make – to come across as a star witness 
10 
to you and present it to me in a bad light.  And the only 
way, Chairman, the only way Ms Susanne Daniels has been 
caught with this lie is when I present documentary 
evidence.  That is the only time.   
 
If I did not have the documentary evidence, I 
would be the one looking like a lie.  The very existence of 
the infoportal address, I was the first one to link her to it.  
I said to my lawyers:  You know, what Mr Barrie?  This is – 
this I got it from Ms Daniels.  She denied it until Eskom 
went to check its computers.  So she lied.  Why, I do not 
20 
know.  She... 
 
So I am saying to you, she is also lying when 
she says she did not print the document to have meetings 
with Dr Ngubane.  She is lying.  Why is she lying?  She is 
just intended in trying to get rid of it and create an 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 127 of 369 
 
impression that I am a bad person and she is a good 
person.  And she did not know at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say, as long as she was in the 
Office of the Chairperson, then it is clearly understandable 
why 
she 
would 
perform 
the 
duty 
of 
printing 
those 
documents and giving them to Dr Ngubane? 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, I might 
come back to Ms Susanne Daniels in due course but let me 
10 
try to exhaust the issue of Dr Ngubane.  Dr Ngubane has 
denied your version.  You have commented on his version 
but you have commented, not in relation to his version, you 
have commented in relation to him saying the emails – the 
email, infoportal was of Richard Seleke.  But you have not 
said anything about his denial that that email is his 
because even the version that it is an email of Richard 
Seleke, shows that it is not his email.  So what is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask you not to forget your 
20 
question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please, do not forget it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I want to say.  Was Dr Ngubane 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 128 of 369 
 
asked the question?  If he accepted, when he was on the 
witness stand, that in August or September, when he used 
that infoportal address, because that is my understanding.  
If Mr Richard Seleke was not the DG of the Department of 
Public Enterprises at that time, who would he have been 
intending to communicate with?  Because on his version, it 
could not have been Mr Seleke as DG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it may well be that it may have been 
Mr Seleke in another capacity but it could not have been 
10 
him as DG.  But the only connection he made with 
Mr Seleka was that he believed he was DG and that was 
shown not to be true. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that canvassed?  And if so, what 
was his understanding, his response? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, we did put to him what the 
disciplinary – what was found at the disciplinary hearing,  
that most probably the email belongs to – the email 
address ...[intervenes]  
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson, we were in Eskom 
Bundle 18 on that page 1079, dealing with the letter from 
Dr Ngubane to Minister Lynne Brown, which Mr Koko 
attaches to that email.  If I may, I would like to expedite 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 129 of 369 
 
this by referring Mr Koko to the affidavit of Dr Ngubane.  
Mr Koko, you will have a bundle with that affidavit.  Eskom 
Bundle 9.  Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before you proceed with 
your questioning Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...with reference to Dr Ngubane’s 
supplementary affidavit ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...let me raise something with Mr Koko.  
10 
I think one of the points you made about this letter, 
Mr Koko, at page 1079(?) is in effect that it would have 
made no sense for you to send it to a supplier, I think.  Is 
that correct?  It would have been no use to them or 
something.  You made a point along those lines.  And I 
understood that to be saying.   
 
To the extent that anybody suggests that I was 
communicating 
with 
Mr 
Salim 
Essa 
and 
that 
I 
was 
knowingly – I knowingly sent this letter to Mr Salim Essa 
the infoportal email address, it was his or was being used 
20 
by him.  That would not make sense but it would make 
sense if I was sending it to Dr Ngubane in order to raise 
the issue that I wanted to raise.  Did I understand you 
correctly? 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly.  Or any other third party. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 130 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  What I want to raise with 
you is that.  If, of course, the position were that indeed the 
infoportal address was Mr Salim Essa’s address or that 
whatever came from that email address came from him and 
whatever was sent to it was being sent to him, whether 
intentionally or not, but it would end with him.   
 
The position would be that, if I recall correctly, 
the documents or there is a letter, there are documents or 
emails that came from the infoportal address which were 
raising the same subject, namely, which were, if I recall 
10 
correctly, to the effect that the board should take a 
decision that Eskom should not have any interactions or 
should terminate whatever relationship they might have 
with these three newspapers, the Mail & Guardian, The 
City Press and, I think, the Sunday Times.   
 
Now when Dr Ngubane was giving evidence, 
reference was made to such a document and that it was 
given to him and he said he took it to the board and the 
board made a resolution that was in line with what was 
being requested in the documents or emails that came from 
20 
the infoportal address.   
 
So if that is the true and if it was to be said that 
you were sending this to Mr Salim Essa or to whoever had 
sent those documents.  Then what it would – what it could 
mean is that you were sending this letter to show that the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 131 of 369 
 
board had taken the decision that they had wanted.  So I 
am saying that that is a possible line of looking at the 
matter, if your evidence is not true.   
 
If the other evidence is that – if the evidence is 
or if the suggestion is made that you knew you were 
sending – you knew you were not sending it to Dr Ngubane.  
You knew you were sending it to Mr Salim Essa, for 
example.  What do you say to that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is – if my memory serves me well 
because I listened to the evidence of Dr Ngubane.  That 
10 
attachment was in one of the infoportal email addresses 
that went to Mr Ngubane.  I do not think I am mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, I think you are right there. 
MR KOKO:   Secondly.  It is one of the documents whose 
properties showed that it was originated by Mr Dan 
Mantsha and Eddy by Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I also do not think I am mistaken there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, I do not remember any 
reference to Mr Mantsha or also about the ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   I can tell you know that is what Mr Seleka put 
to one of the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And let us just carry on, on that line because 
that suggests that we are doing the bidding for Mr Essa or 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 132 of 369 
 
his associate.  When it comes to me and I am part of the 
club, I am part of the scheme, I would not stop it.  I would 
religiously instruct my teams and create reasons why my 
teams’ work were executed but I did the opposite.  I 
stopped it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer to what I – what I was 
putting to you is.  Well, I hears what might be said. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at a practical level, I stopped this. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And stopping it is not consistent with me 
doing Mr Salim Essa’s bidding and so on? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And you will find, and we are going to go into 
this more often.  All these transactions that I am accused 
of doing the bidding for Mr Essa.  Guess who stopped 
them?  Me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   It is the opposite.  If I was doing the bidding 
20 
for Mr Essa, I would have found the reason to pay the 
R 30 million invoice that Ms Goodson came to talk about.  
If I was doing the bidding for Mr Essa, when Ms Daniels 
came to me with a motivation for the payment of the 
R 460 million to McKinsey, part of it ended up with Trillian, 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 133 of 369 
 
I would have found a reason to sign it but I stopped it.  
That cannot be the characteristic consistent with a person 
who is doing the bidding for Mr Essa.  That cannot be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  I just wanted you to get a 
chance to deal with that possible line of thinking. 
MR KOKO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  But you...  
Well, you would have seen from Dr Ngubane’s affidavit that 
he denies that the email address, firstly is his.  Secondly, 
10 
which is more important for your purposes, that he had 
meetings with you pursuant to the documentation here 
attached to this email you sent to infoportal.  Your 
comment on that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I – Dr Ngubane makes sense to me 
when he says – when he suggested that he does not know 
the infoportal or not.  It does not make sense.  No, he does 
not make sense.  It does not make sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He does not – he says it is not his 
email address. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Ja-no, he says it is not his.  So I may find that 
reasonable.  But let me tell you the difficulty that 
Dr Ngubane is faced with and it is a similar difficulty, we 
will deal with in more detail when we get into Ms Daniels.  
Dr Ngubane came here and told you that the only time he 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 134 of 369 
 
came – he interacted or he came across the infoportal 
address was August 2016, okay?  That is what he told you.  
It is in his affidavit.  And he says at that point he was told 
that it belongs to Mr Seleke.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Richard Seleke. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Richard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   When you and Mr Seleka did the probing and 
you put the affidavit of Ms Matsietsi to him.  What actually 
Ms Matsietsi says, she was the one acting as the DG at 
10 
that point.  Mr Seleke was not in the employ of the 
department.  And this email that you said you came across 
it, could not belong to Mr Seleke.  So you cannot be right.  
As a matter of fact, you used this email address in 
September 2016.   
 
It is – you are not being truthful.  That is not 
what you told him you are more decent than that.  You 
cannot be truth – it cannot be truthful that you only knew 
about it in September 2016.  You have actually used it in 
August 2016.  You have actually used in September 2017 – 
20 
in September 2016.   
 
And in September 2016, Ms Matsietsi was the 
acting Chair ...[indistinct] was not in the department.  So 
your version is not right.  I remember his...  Oh, well.  Oh, 
well.  That is all what he said.  He said nothing further than 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 135 of 369 
 
that.  He has a difficulty, Chair.   
 
He is intended in this infoportal address and he 
is trying to distance himself.  He has been dishonest with 
you on this email address.  I am shocked that he denies 
the meeting that he had the meeting with me and Ms 
Daniels.  Ms Daniels denies that.  It can only be the 
characteristics of people who have come to you, lied to you 
to save their skin.   
 
I cannot phantom the reason why he denied it.  I 
cannot explain to you...  I mean, my counsel takes me task 
10 
on many occasions:  But Mr Koko, why would these people 
lie about you?  Why?  And I said:  Mr Barrie, but I do not 
know.  Here is Dr Ngubane who came to lie to you about 
the August 2016 email.  Why did he lie?  I do not know.  
We do not know.   
 
That is common cause that he was not truthful.  
It is common cause.  Why?  I do not know.  He is trying to 
distance himself from the entanglement he finds himself in.  
That is the only explanation I can give.  And it is 
disappointing.  Dr Ngubane’s interactions with me has been 
20 
– the interaction with a father and son interaction.   
 
And I would never have thought that on – at one 
stage, on a single day, he will deny the type of interactions 
that he had with me, which is in those meetings, he made 
the right decisions.  Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 136 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say about the fact that 
Ms Daniels also denies those interactions? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, Ms Daniels is worse.  You have got a 
worse problem there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   So.  And to answer you there.  And please, 
Chair, I want to take – I want you to go to Bundle 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   No, no.  First, let us go to her last affidavit.  
The latest affidavit that you sent me last night.  Have you 
10 
got it?  Ms Daniels’ affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you are able to say what you 
need to say without us going back, do that.   
MR KOKO:   No...  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is important, then we can 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I will do it Chair.  But my experience now with 
the Commission is that I have to show you the documents, 
otherwise you forget.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
20 
MR KOKO:   And let me tell you, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Let me go and say this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Ms Daniels says to me.  To distance herself 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 137 of 369 
 
from the infoportal address, she says to you that actually 
Mr Koko was my supervisor on the 20 t h of July 2015.  He 
had no reason to take an email from me and say it is for 
Ms Daniels.  It is for the chairman.  It could not have been 
a reason for that because he was my supervisor.  I was not 
in the chairman’s office.   
 
That is what she said.  I told you then that she is 
lying to you but when I left it worried me and I went to dig 
up documents to show you that she is lying.  For a start.  
The bundle that I want to take you to, it is her affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can go there. 
MR KOKO:   It is her affidavit.  Can you go to her 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   You can go to Ms Daniels’ latest affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And you...  Chair, I cannot tell you why would 
Ms Daniels come and lie to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I cannot just come and tell you that but she is 
doing it.  And the only reasons she is doing it is to make 
me look bad and hopefully she thinks I would not have the 
documentary evidence to show you that she is indeed 
lying.  That is the only reason.

CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka, if you can guide me to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did state what bundle it is, hey? 
MR KOKO:   I think is Bundle 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 8. 
MR KOKO:   Am I right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That is right, Chair.  I think it is in 
8(b).  Is that right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 8(b)? 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Let 
us 
see. 
 At 
page 
1079 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it Bundle 8(b). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am guessing Chair now but I wanted 
to see whether ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, find out where it is first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it not – has it not been 
...[indistinct]  
MR KOKO:   No, you sent it to me last night. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...put in the same place? 
MR KOKO:   It is the bundle that you have sent me last 
night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, has it not been put into the bundle? 
MR KOKO:   No, it is in the bundle. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 139 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it is in the bundle Chair.  Just help 
Mr Koko there. 
JUNIOR COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
your 
junior 
will 
remember, 
Mr Seleka, exactly where it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, page 1079. 
MR KOKO:   I do not have ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have it in Eskom Bundle 8(b).  That is 
the very last affidavit.  Ja, that is the one, Chair, you have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got Bundle 8(b) and page 
10 
1079 is the certificate of authentication and page 108 is 
the beginning of the affidavit.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the one Chair.   
MR KOKO:   Somewhere in here, Mr Seleka, you will find.  
She says:  Mr Koko was my supervisor in 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you want that first? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 11, Chair, page 1082.  I am going 
to read into the record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it.  Ja, do that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
“I met with Mr Koko shortly after his meeting 
with Mr Bester. 
At this time, I still held the position of Senior 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 140 of 369 
 
Manager in the Office of the Group Executive 
Technology. 
Thus Mr Koko was my direct supervisor...” 
 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There, in that paragraph, is she talking 
about what followed after, what she refers to in paragraph 
10, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
20 t h of July 2015? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when she says shortly after his 
10 
meeting, is she talking about the meeting on the 20 t h? 
MR KOKO:   The meeting on the 20 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes, continue. 
MR KOKO:   Now, Chair...  Mr Barrie, what is the bundle on 
the 11 t h of April 2015? 
ADV BARRIE:   Oh, what the witness refers to is earlier in 
this very same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BARRIE:   I will just find it.  I think it is page 6. 
MR KOKO:   It is Bundle 8, page 6.   
20 
ADV BARRIE:   [Indistinct]  [Speaker is not clear – not 
close to microphone.]  Ja, even ...[indistinct], paragraph 8 
on page 6.  I am just trying to...  Eskom 08-0006.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess it must be Bundle 8(a), not 8(b). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Most probably. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 141 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  If it is page 6, it would be Bundle 
8(a).  Yes, that is Bundle 8(a).  I see that paragraph 9 of 
page 6 of Bundle 8(a), she says: 
“I was appointed by Group Company Secretary 
on 1 October ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, that is actually paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 8? 
ADV BARRIE:   [No audible reply]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
“Subsequently, I was transferred to the Office 
of the Chairman on 11 April 2015...” 
 
And then paragraph 9: 
“I was appointed Group Company Secretary on 
1 October 2015 and held this position until 
27 July 2017 when the current Interim Board of 
Eskom accepted my resignation as Company 
Secretary. 
The duties of the Company Secretary are set 
20 
out in Section 8(8)(?) of the Companies Act...” 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I also have brought in the minutes 
...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 142 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   ...of the board ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   ...of the 22 n d of July 2015, two days after I 
came back.  You have to look at them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But let...   
MR KOKO:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to make whatever point you 
want to make with regard these two? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  That minute – those minutes adds up to 
10 
that lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I guess your point must be that she 
did not hold the position that she says she held at that 
time? 
MR KOKO:   She...  The only reason she comes to you and 
say:  Mr Koko was my supervisor on... is because she tried 
to create a distance.  She is trying to say that I was not in 
the chairman’s office.  I could not have given Mr Koko an 
20 
email address of Dr Ngubane and I could not have had 
access to it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   That is all what she is trying to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say she was still in the Office of 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 143 of 369 
 
the Chair ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, I want you to look at the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Barrie, can you give the Chair the minutes, 
please? 
ADV 
BARRIE: 
 
 
I 
have 
three, 
four 
copies 
here, 
Mr Chairman, of the minutes of the Special Eskom Board 
Meeting held on 22 n d July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  The registrar will take those.  We 
do not have them in the bundles? 
10 
ADV BARRIE:   Not as far as I am aware, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Give us - another copy too 
to Mr Seleka.   
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, what you have in front of you is the 
minutes of the board two days after I returned to Eskom 
after my suspension.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Dated 22 n d July 2015.  And the first page is 
people who attended the meeting.  At the top is the board 
20 
members, in the middle is the officials.  You will see at that 
point Mr Phukubje was the Company Secretary and at the 
bottom are the people in attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   You will see Ms Daniels’ name is there as the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 144 of 369 
 
Office of the Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   So she has come to you to lie to you.  Why 
did she come to you to lie?  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I cannot explain why she came to lie to you.  
And so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying when you go to 
Bundle 8(a), page 6, paragraph 8, she says she was 
transferred to the Office of the Chairman on 11 April 2015.   
10 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then on paragraph 9, she says she 
was appointed as Company Secretary on 1 October 2015, 
which suggests an acceptance that in July 2015, she was 
still in the Office of the Chairperson. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are saying the minutes of the 
meeting of the board of the 22 n d of July 2015, reflects her 
as her having been in attendance as somebody from the 
Chairperson’s Office. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, to the extent that she says in 
July 2015, you were her direct supervisor.  You say that 
cannot be true? 
MR KOKO:   I am saying it is false. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 145 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Now the question is why?  Why?  I do not 
know  The only reason she does, I can – I – you – the 
last(?)... proposition...  The only proposition I can think 
that she wants to make – to come across as a star witness 
to you and present it to me in a bad light.  And the only 
way, Chairman, the only way Ms Susanne Daniels has been 
caught with this lie is when I present documentary 
evidence.  That is the only time.   
 
If I did not have the documentary evidence, I 
10 
would be the one looking like a lie.  The very existence of 
the infoportal address, I was the first one to link her to it.  
I said to my lawyers:  You know, what Mr Barrie?  This is – 
this I got it from Ms Daniels.  She denied it until Eskom 
went to check its computers.  So she lied.  Why, I do not 
know.  She... 
 
So I am saying to you, she is also lying when 
she says she did not print the document to have meetings 
with Dr Ngubane.  She is lying.  Why is she lying?  She is 
just intended in trying to get rid of it and create an 
20 
impression that I am a bad person and she is a good 
person.  And she did not know at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say, as long as she was in the 
Office of the Chairperson, then it is clearly understandable 
why 
she 
would 
perform 
the 
duty 
of 
printing 
those 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 146 of 369 
 
documents and giving them to Dr Ngubane? 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, I might 
come back to Ms Susanne Daniels in due course but let me 
try to exhaust the issue of Dr Ngubane.  Dr Ngubane has 
denied your version.  You have commented on his version 
but you have commented, not in relation to his version, you 
have commented in relation to him saying the emails – the 
email, infoportal was of Richard Seleke.  But you have not 
10 
said anything about his denial that that email is his 
because even the version that it is an email of Richard 
Seleke, shows that it is not his email.  So what is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask you not to forget your 
question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please, do not forget it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I want to say.  Was Dr Ngubane 
20 
asked the question?  If he accepted, when he was on the 
witness stand, that in August or September, when he used 
that infoportal address, because that is my understanding.  
If Mr Richard Seleke was not the DG of the Department of 
Public Enterprises at that time, who would he have been 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 147 of 369 
 
intending to communicate with?  Because on his version, it 
could not have been Mr Seleke as DG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it may well be that it may have been 
Mr Seleke in another capacity but it could not have been 
him as DG.  But the only connection he made with 
Mr Seleka was that he believed he was DG and that was 
shown not to be true. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that canvassed?  And if so, what 
10 
was his understanding, his response? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, we did put to him what the 
disciplinary – what was found at the disciplinary hearing,  
that most probably the email belongs to – the email 
address belongs to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he said he did not do what, inquiry 
or research, so he just accepted... 
MR KOKO:   That is all what he did.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   He just left it like that. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I watched it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Because 
there 
must 
have 
been 
somebody intended to communicate with him. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 148 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it could not have been Mr Seleka as 
DG and if he had intended to communicate with Mr Seleka 
as an individual he would have told me so then.  So the 
question would still remain, who were you intending to 
communicate with because it could not be Mr Seleka as the 
first DG.  So it may well be that he needs to be asked 
further questions around that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we could do that, Chair, but if you 
pull the transcript you will see we actually canvassed quite 
10 
extensively. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if it was canvassed, it is fine, you 
must just draw my attention to exactly… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I am interested in finding out 
what his final answer was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
know, 
if 
he 
says 
I 
was 
communicating with DG, Mr Seleka and show that at that 
time Mr Seleka was not DG. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then he needs to say who was he really 
talking to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 149 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, just another point that I have to 
mention with relation to Ms Daniels.  I gave your legal 
team emails last time where Ms Daniels talks to me in 
emails and blind copies Infoportal address.  Now under 
what conditions do you blind copy somebody?  You blind 
copy somebody because you do not want the primary 
recipient to know that you are talking to him but you also 
blind copy the primary recipient because you know who 
they are talking to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we have those in the bundle? 
10 
MR KOKO:   I gave it to your team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just asking Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  Chair, I am asking – well, I 
personally did not receive the emails so I am asking my 
junior whether he received such emails.  She does not 
have a recollection, Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, will she check and then later this 
afternoon let us get an answer because …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I can tell you my …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   …I am very interested in those emails. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I can tell you my counsel has it, it is his 
prerogative. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, if those – that those can be 
made available later on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 150 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think it is important for your junior 
to check if you have got them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the point that Mr Koko makes 
with regard to Ms Daniels could be very important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright, let us continue. 
MR KOKO:   And here deny on both Dr Ngubane and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Daniels’ part. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Do not cut it.  They are just being dishonest.  
I made a point to you the last time that every time we go 
into Dr Ngubane’s office the documents would have been 
printed and placed there and all what I would say to him, 
that I sent these documents, they are my documents, Ms 
Daniels has printed them.  At no stage do they confront 
with Dr Ngubane that is this your email address?  I have 
never done that, I took Ms Daniels at her word and I had 
no reason to doubt her.  So to the extent that Dr Ngubane 
says it is not her address, it makes sense, I cannot quibble 
20 
with that, because I have not confronted …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You mean it is not his address? 
MR KOKO:   It is not his address, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   But the stuff that I take strong exceptions to 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 151 of 369 
 
is the denial that we had the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those meetings. 
MR KOKO:   Those meetings.  That part I think if there is 
any form of dishonesty on both – two of them, it is exactly 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Sorry? 
ADV BARRIE 
SC:   Mr Chairman, so speaking on 
recollection only, so my learned friend is satisfied, is this 
is contained in the disciplinary proceedings of Ms Daniels 
before Eskom in the bundles that we received from the 
10 
Commission, but I cannot give you the page number right 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean the emails that Mr Koko is 
talking about? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   The emails that Mr Koko is talking 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   That is as far I covered, we received it 
from the Commission but that is my recollection. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is correct, they are in a bundle, a 
20 
disciplinary bundle that I have got from Bowman Gilfillan 
for my hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And if they are not available I can tell you 
before you go to bed tonight your lawyers will have it.  I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 152 of 369 
 
will make you get them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Please, if we do not have 
them ready in the bundles, ask Mr Koko to make sure they 
are sent to you because they may be very important.  
Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, correct, Chair.    
ADV BARRIE SC:   It is SM6 to an affidavit of a Mr Shaun 
Michael Morrow which was filed in the proceedings of Ms 
Daniels and that we received from the – and it is described 
as being an email date 28 August 2016, 17.09 and emailed 
10 
from Suzanne Daniels to Matshela Koko and Ayanda 
Mthetha and Marumo Lekoto: 
“Re: Fourth addendum to the coal supply agreement 
between 
Eskom 
Holdings 
SOC 
Limited 
and 
Koornfontein Mines (Pty) Ltd.” 
Sorry, I missed the most important part which says: 
“And blind copying Infoportal@zoho.com.” 
So… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  You have got the 
references. 
20 
ADV BARRIE SC:   28 August 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I think that will be in Mr 
Mabuza’s file who testified in phase one, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, will somebody check? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will – we will, Chair. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 153 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course everything that happened in 
phase on is relevant. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is important that what is being dealt 
with now gets connected with what may have been testified 
about in phase one.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – ja, thank you.  So Mr 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it might – to the extent that it 
might be convenient if, Mr Koko, you sent them sometime 
10 
this evening, I think do so, just in case it might be 
convenient. 
MR KOKO:   Certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the email explicitly says blind 
copying Infoportal. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you – well, ask her who is this 
Infoportal? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, I got them as part of my 
20 
disciplinary bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MR KOKO:   And to be honest with you, Chair, I did not 
look into those in detail then.  The only time we had a – in 
fact it was not even me, it was my counsel who looked at 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 154 of 369 
 
them, was when we were preparing to come here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So to the extent that Dr Ngubane says 
this is not my email address, you say you cannot quibble 
with him but you say you quibble with him insofar as he 
says you did not have meetings after you had sent the 
email to Infoportal. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Okay, so we bear in mind that we 
have established that Infoportal will be an email address of 
10 
somebody outside of Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I dealt with this topic the last time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And I said given what I know now, I think it is 
beyond …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Doubt. 
MR KOKO:   Doubt that it is not an internal Eskom 
address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, just remind me and Mr Koko 
may also assist because he listens to some of the 
witnesses testifying in regard to Eskom.  Do we have a 
situation with reference to this Infoportal address that Ms 
Daniels said she got it from Dr Ngubane and when Dr 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 155 of 369 
 
Ngubane was asked he said no, it was given to – he was 
told about it by Ms Daniels. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And now Mr Koko also used it.  He says 
it was given to him by Ms Daniels as Dr Ngubane’s email – 
personal email address and Dr Ngubane denies it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   is that what we have? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have exactly that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Dr Ngubane says no, 
given to me by Suzanne Daniels.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Suzanne Daniels says given to me by 
Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And they both say the one told the 
other that is Mr Richard Seleka’s email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  And Richard Seleka was not 
DG. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was not DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Until much – until December in 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   2015, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, I just wanted to try and 
understand where we are with who says what. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 156 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, thank you.  You can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes so insofar as the meetings are 
concerned that is where you say you part ways with him. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Now to the extent – now 
there is a big question mark, because if now we know the 
email address belongs to somebody else and they deny 
having meetings with you, it leaves a big question mark as 
to whether you were in fact having meetings with them 
10 
after exchanging these documents with Infoportal. 
MR KOKO:   Well, there is no question mark, Chair, I had 
meetings with Dr Ngubane and I had meetings in the 
presence of Ms Daniels and to the extent that they deny it, 
they have just been, for the umpteenth time, misleading 
you once again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then lastly because you will see 
again that question mark I am talking about.  If you go to 
page 1087 – well, we did traverse this but I want to just 
finalise this and move on.  Eskom bundle 18, Chairperson, 
20 
(b) back to the emails, page 1087, Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 10..? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1087. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We might have touched on this, but 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 157 of 369 
 
quickly on it again.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think we dealt with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, ja.  So here again, which seems to 
give credence – and I say seems to give credence so that I 
give you the opportunity to deal with it, their denial.  It is 
an email from Businessman to yourself of a two pager 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we definitely dealt with it I think 
quite at length, Mr Seleka, I do not know if you want to 
repeat.  He dealt with it, I remember, and you must tell me, 
10 
Mr Koko, if my recollection is correct.  My recollection is 
that this is the email in respect of which in response to one 
of my questions you said when one looks at the topics or 
the issues that are being dealt with …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Cannot come from the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not the – it could not come from the 
Chairperson. 
MR KOKO:   Cannot come from the Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. Yes, no …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Unless there is something else you 
20 
want to – but we dealt with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Insofar – that is fine, Mr Koko, but just 
in terms of their denials that you forwarded it to Ms 
Daniels.  So you did not send it back to Infoportal, you 
sent it to Ms Daniels which seems to suggest that you 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 158 of 369 
 
understand the distinction between Infoportal and Ms 
Suzanne Daniels. 
MR KOKO:   Not at all, I think Mr Seleka is mistaken.  
Chair …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do not be personal, Sir, because I do 
not want to be personal with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am sorry, what did you say, Mr 
Koko? 
MR KOKO:   I think it is a mistaken view. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says Mr Seleka is mistaken, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  No, but if he says you are 
mistaken, it cannot be personal. 
MR KOKO:   I am surprised, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But it is surprising. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I do not do that with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not do that with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, no …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I apologise, Mr Seleka. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But hang on, I want to understand 
because if there is something he said which he should not 
say I would like to know and if you say something that he 
has a problem with I would like to know.  So he said you 
are mistaken. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 159 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you did not think that was the right 
thing to say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, because all I am saying to 
him is he does not reply to Infoportal, he forwards the 
email to Ms Daniels.  That is on the face of the email 
exchange. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so he can comment on it without 
saying I am mistaken.  What is my mistake? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know but I would think he 
must be saying that the proposition you are putting to 
him… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that is where you are maybe making a 
mistake in terms of what you say. 
MR KOKO:   That is what I am saying, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, you may be suggesting 
something to him and he is saying you are making a 
20 
mistake in making that suggestion on the basis that there 
is 
not 
a 
proper 
basis 
for 
it. 
 
That 
would 
be 
my 
understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 160 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The proposition I put to him is that it 
suggests on the face of this that he understands there is a 
distinction between Infoportal and Ms Daniels.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you want to say why you say it 
makes that suggestion? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to indicate to him what the 
basis is for saying that it suggests that he knows the 
distinction between Ms Daniels and Infoportal? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that when he responds he can deal 
the basis as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I have laid it, Chair, which is, if 
Ms Daniels is Businessman and is the one sending this 
email to him then you reply to Ms Daniels.  You do not 
forward it to Ms Daniels, which is a different email 
address.  That is the basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko? 
20 
MR KOKO:   So here is why I am saying the proposition is 
mistaken, I have said at all material times that this email 
address was given to me by Ms Daniels for the purpose of 
communicating to the Chairman.  So I am communicating to 
the Chairman.  I received this email from the Chairman and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 161 of 369 
 
I forwarded it to Ms Daniels. 
 
But secondly – and we will get to this Chair, and I 
hope we will do so today when we get to the guarantee.  
Contrary to what people may want to suggest to you, the 
motivation for the guarantee was put together by the 
Eskom Treasurer who is the delegated person to do so.  It 
was not done by the third party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us hold on – oh, it does refer to 
the guarantee, that is why you refer to the guarantee. 
MR KOKO:   It is a guarantee document. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Does that answer your question, Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, my question is not 
answered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have not answered the question, 
Mr Koko, on the basis that I put to you, that you did not 
reply to Infoportal or Businessman saying what is this 
about?  You forwarded the email to a different email 
address, to a different person, Ms Suzanne Daniels, which 
20 
suggests that you would have known the distinction 
between Infoportal and Ms Daniels.  What do you say about 
that? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I really do not understand because 
at no stage did I say in the records of this Commission that 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 162 of 369 
 
Infoportal address belongs to Ms Daniels.  So from day one 
there has been a distinction between Ms Daniels and 
Infoportal address.  So I do not know what else can I say.  
I cannot say anything further than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your version is that Ms Daniels gave 
you this Infoportal email address and said it is Dr 
Ngubane’s personal email address. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may communicate with him. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that on the face of that 
version whatever document or email you received from 
Infoportal, as far as you were concerned you thought it 
came from Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And your version is that you 
would send the documents to Dr Ngubane for discussion 
afterwards. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the question that may arise is 
whether you would send the documents directly to Dr 
Ngubane or whether you would send them to Ms Daniels to 
pass on to Dr Ngubane. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 163 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair, so the testimony of Ms Daniels in 
this Commission is that she had access to private emails 
address of Dr Ngubane and not the official Eskom email 
address of Dr Ngubane, so I knew.  That is why when you 
see my emails I say pin this, give this to the boss because 
I know who is printing them, who is having access to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson, this is exactly where 
I am going with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because Mr Koko’s version has been 
very elastic on this and very hard to comprehend.  So you 
have said to us, Mr Koko, firstly – at 7.02 you said  
Businessman is Ms Daniels, that is what you said. 
 
Number two, you have said Ms Daniels have access 
to these emails and she will print out the documents before 
meetings with the Chairperson.  Now I am asking you, if 
that is the version you have put, why not reply to 
Businessman because Businessman, Ms Suzanne Daniels 
or Dr Ngubane will get the document.  Why forward it to 
20 
Suzanne Daniels? 
MR KOKO:   Because I knew there was a difference with 
Ms Daniels and the owner of the Infoportal address whom I 
identified as the Chair.  So that is the only reason.  I knew 
who is Infoportal and I knew who is Ms Daniels. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 164 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course on your version you did not 
know who Infoportal was or who was behind the email 
address but you believed what you had been told. 
MR KOKO:   Oh, yes, I… 
CHAIRPERSON:   You believed, which you now accept was 
not true. 
MR KOKO:   You are correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But still would the question arise, 
Mr Koko, that to the extent that at any one time where you 
could be dealing with a document which you had received 
10 
from Businessman from the Infoportal address, you would 
not sent it back to Infoportal address, you would, if you 
wanted to discuss it, you would just send an email to say 
let us discuss that document.  You would send only 
documents which come from you or documents that you 
believed Dr Ngubane did not have. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct and that is not what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not correct, ja. 
MR KOKO:    And that is not what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I think I have asked the 
question, I want to move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To a different... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine, you can move on.  Your 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 165 of 369 
 
demeanour is that of somebody who is not …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hundred percent... 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you want to – it is up to you, you can 
deal with it later if you want to but if there is still 
something you want to explore you can explore. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, well... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you can move on and if need be, 
come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Koko, I would like us to – I 
will move on because I know we will not take a lot of time.  
10 
Let us look at the McKinsey …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are moving away I think from the 
emails, is that right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be exactly that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Of course, Mr Koko, if you look at 
the email or emails on page 1088, in the page after the one 
we were dealing with, you have there on 3 January 2016 an 
email from you to reception@benstonebarley.com and then 
20 
you have an email below that one from Businessman, the 
Infoportal address, on the 3 January 2016 and the subject 
is Visa for Travel.  I would imagine – and maybe we did ask 
you this before and maybe I have forgotten, I would 
imagine that Dr Ngubane would have nothing to do with 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 166 of 369 
 
these arrangements for your visas and your family’s visas? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, it was very strange later when I 
realised about this.  Then I just looked at the visa and I 
printed it.  I did testify here the last time, if you check my 
transcript, that when I came back I discussed it with Ms 
Daniels, I said but it is strange that my visas came from Dr 
Ngubane and all what she said – and maybe it was my fault 
at that time I did not dig deeper, but it was for convenient, 
that is what she told me.  That I remember.  I did not ask 
her further, maybe it is my fault that I did not ask her 
10 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka?  I just thought I would 
raise that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we did discuss it last time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Chair, I should point out we have 
shared the affidavit of the travel agent which we received 
recently with Mr Koko.  I think I have in mind the intention 
to give him the opportunity to have a look at that and he 
can tell me if he is willing to answer questions relevant to 
20 
that travel agent’s affidavit which is now obtained by the 
Commission as opposed to the one which was given to the 
Commission by the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 167 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It deals with this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, that the Chairperson asking 
this question, I thought I could complete my question on 
the email of the 10 December 2015 with the guarantee.  On 
your version you would have had a meeting again with Dr 
Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:   Come again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On your version you would have had a 
10 
meeting again with Dr Ngubane and Ms Suzanne Daniels 
after this meeting, after this email, I beg your pardon, 10 
December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the email at page 1087? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am going to invite Mr Seleka to go 
back to the transcripts.  We have discussed this before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And we did not have a meeting with Dr 
Ngubane after this.  What I have told you the last time is 
20 
that I, when I received this in the morning, I phoned Ms 
Daniels, I said I have – I see there is a document from the 
Chairman dealing with prepayment, I am going to send it to 
you shortly and you will see, if you check my telephone 
records and the time when they correspond, look at it and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 168 of 369 
 
tell me if we need to see the Chairman about it.  At 
lunchtime I met Ms Daniels and we discussed this again 
and she said no, do not worry, we do not need to see the 
Chairman, it is has been dealt with, it is in hand.  That is 
my testimony.  It is not my version that we have met with 
Dr Ngubane after this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   We have discussed this in detail the last time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because Dr Ngubane is on record as 
saying that the board did not even know about a guarantee 
because it did not come back to the board. 
MR KOKO:   I accept the version of the board when they 
say they did not know about the guarantee.  It is my 
version too and it makes sense looking at the documents 
how the guarantee came about, that the board would not 
have known. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But does this email not indicate 
knowledge on your part of …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe, Mr Seleka, ask this question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say you accept that the board 
did not know, I seem to think that you exclude Dr Ngubane 
from there. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 169 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or when you say the board do you 
include him? 
MR KOKO:   I include Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   No, I am including Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  But of course, if this came 
from him, as far as you were concerned …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   He should have known. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then he should know. 
10 
MR KOKO:   He should know, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is why I expected you to say 
when I say I accept that the board did not know I am 
excluding Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, Chairman, I have the benefit of 
the evidence that has been led here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   I cannot be that stupid. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, also so okay, alright, so you go 
back to basically I think what you mean is knowing now 
that this email address was not Dr Ngubane’s one in terms 
of now you accept that this did not come from him, but at 
that time you thought it came from him. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 170 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   But Chair we have dealt with this and I also 
said to you the level of detail in this email it’s unlikely to 
have come from Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you did say that ja, you did say that 
Mr Seleka? 
MR KOKO:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Doesn’t it also indicate that you would 
have become aware of the steps taken to bring about a 
10 
guarantee of R1.68billion? 
MR KOKO:   No, not at all, I did not apply my mind to it, I 
did not read it, I forwarded it to Ms Daniels and that’s all.  
The prepayment, Chair, once again was done, and if you 
want me to take you to the document, I will do so, was 
done by Ms Caroline Henry as a Treasurer, I have never 
spoken with Ms Caroline Henry of Eskom unless it is a 
suggestion of people out there that Ms Caroline Henry who 
was the Eskom Treasurer was also captured but it’s not 
what I’m hearing. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I was asking a different questions, 
that doesn’t this email, upon you receiving it and looking at 
it, calling Ms Daniels about it because you would call her 
about something you have read, doesn’t it show knowledge 
on 
your 
part, 
of 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
guarantee 
of 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 171 of 369 
 
R1.68billion? 
MR KOKO:   No, no it doesn’t I don’t know the genesis of 
the R1.6billion, the email I forwarded to – I do not even 
know the content of it Chair, other than to read a pre-
payment into it, that’s all.  When I saw this email, I read a 
pre-payment into it, that’s all, I saw pre-payment.  As a 
matter of fact, and I may sound stupid, I could not even – 
even today, well today I can because I read the documents, 
distinguish – see I could not even think that it is clever to 
be a guarantee than a pre-payment.  If I thought it’s clever 
10 
to do a pre-payment – a guarantee I would have done a 
guarantee but in hindsight I look back I says – I actually 
wanted to give the supplier R1.6billion upfront, you know, 
it does not sound clever I could have just given the man 
guarantee that Eskom doesn’t pre-pay the money, I did not 
even make that connection, but it makes sense why.  
Because within Eskom the guarantee is the domain and 
authority of Treasury and Finance, not on operations and 
engineering.  If you ask me more details about how this – 
even now when I read this document, I get lost, I just read 
20 
and stop looking at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I’ll will tell you, your transcript Mr 
Koko, my recollection of your evidence in part was that you 
were wondering why the guarantee because the Board had 
agreed on a pre-payment…[intervenes]. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 172 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   That’s correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes – so, but now you want to explain 
it in such a way that you express surprise and non-
knowledge of the guarantee? 
MR KOKO:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is some distinction there from 
your previous evidence from the one you now seek to 
make. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, all I’m saying to you in my affidavit 
is that – remember now I’m taking you back to the user 
10 
story.  In this case I am the user, in this case I need to 
lock coal of 12 months supply and I want to enable it with a 
pre-payment and so I am the user and I go to the Board 
and I motivate to the Board and the Board see my 
reasoning, they agree on a pre-payment.  At no stage did I 
talk to the Board about guarantee, I was out of depth 
there, it’s out of my space, I can’t even pretend that I know 
what’s going on there.  The CFO – the FD delegated to 
execute, and his team looks at it and says, but Mr Koko is 
mad, instead of paying the money, let us do a guarantee 
20 
but at no stage did the Board see a document that I’ve 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
as 
a 
user 
talking 
about 
a 
guarantee, they did not, and we can’t pretend they’ve done 
that they did not.  The guarantee arose out of Eskom 
Treasury and FD and the mine to protect Eskom and in 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 173 of 369 
 
hindsight and reading what I read, I feel stupid that I 
almost got Eskom to pay R1.6billion upfront but I’m glad 
that the FD of Eskom and the Eskom Treasurer had the 
presence of mind to realise that guarantee is far better 
than R1.6billion and I’m grateful to them and I’m thankful.  
If I meet them one day, I’ll thank them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we’ll come to the reasons why the 
pre-payment was even a suggestion, but I just want to 
follow this line.  If you may go to – turn to the McKinsey, 
just turn attention to McKinsey.  I have a question arising 
10 
from – and we’ll go to the files, just a question arising from 
what you said this morning that there was – now I’m talking 
the Master Service Agreement, service level agreement, 
that it was wrong to appoint McKinsey on a risk basis. 
MR KOKO:   That’s right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was wrong to appoint McKinsey on a 
risk basis. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They needed Treasury approval. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And they didn’t get it. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, we can park that aside, the MSA, I 
don’t have to go into the details of it? 
MR KOKO:   Oh, no I for once agree with the evidence 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 174 of 369 
 
leader. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we’re taking away three hours of 
time Chair. 
MR KOKO:   For once I – there was no approval from 
Treasury for the deviations.  The only problem, Chair, is 
that I  will not move from this and of course your word is 
final and accepted, is the evidence of Ms Mothepu.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, ja I can ask you about that. 
MR KOKO:   The evidence of Ms Mothepu we have to deal 
with it because if left undiscussed, it’s not damaging to me 
10 
and yet it’s false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it will be discussed.  It’s important 
that you get the opportunity to deal with all evidence that 
may be put to you in a light that you say is not correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Ja, Mr Mothepu 
– well just before I move to Ms Mothepu, so the Executives 
who took part in the steps towards the conclusion of that 
MSA, what do you say about their conduct?  Well, I’m 
asking that because you are one of them. 
MR KOKO:   What was my conduct about the MSA, Chair? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 2 n d of September 2015, Mr 
Prish Govender sends an email to you. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he has a draft in which he 
specifies that the PFMA requirement is required. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 175 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but before that you had sent an 
email asking for an update, what are the – we must get the 
email. 
MR KOKO:   “What is the update colleagues”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were asking…[intervenes]. 
MR KOKO:   “What is the progress colleagues”, I think I 
used. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja something like that, and what needs 
to be tied up.  What things needs to be tied up in that 
10 
email, but you’ll recall that email I’ll get it now. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, lease get it, but I know that email, I think 
it was sent on the 3 r d of September, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so the – Mr Koko’s email. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, the email will probably say -what is the 
thing there, colleagues, the one-liner? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But what it shows, Mr Koko, and I want 
to take you in due course, when I deal with Ms Mothepu’s 
evidence to a whole range of emails exchanged with you 
from McKinsey.  So, I just want to know, and you will know 
20 
the level to which you were involved in this.  The question 
is, what is your view about the conduct of the Executives 
who 
were 
ensuring 
that 
this 
agreement 
gets 
to 
be 
concluded and it gets to be concluded without a PFMA 
requirement, when that aspect was drawn to their attention 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 176 of 369 
 
prior to the conclusion of the agreement? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I will not comment about the 
conduct of the Executives and there’s a simple reason for 
that, it’s because I don’t believe that the Commission 
investigators have done their job and I’m saying this 
straight in your face, in the investigations in this.  I think 
they’ve been chasing people where they’re chasing people 
but what I can tell you now is that it was not right for 
Eskom to contract or even sign a letter of award on the 
17 t h 
of 
December 
2015 
without 
National 
Treasury’s 
10 
approval, that part, is not right.  What is my comment on 
the conduct of people, I don’t have the investigations all 
that I’ve seen is the focus on me?  I’ve not seen 
documents dealing with investigations about who did what 
and why so I cannot…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want you to hold on there because I 
didn’t hear Mr Seleka’s question and that’s not his fault 
because my mind is ill with the emails that we have dealt 
with and I want to go back to them because if I don’t, I’m 
going to forget, Mr Koko, so I’m just going back to the 
20 
emails then maybe after that, then you can repeat your 
question, then I can follow.  I wanted to say, Mr Koko, with 
regard to these two emails that we were discussing earlier, 
the one of 10 December 2015 from Businessman to you 
and then you forwarded that to Ms Daniels and the one of 3 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 177 of 369 
 
January 2016 from Businessman to you.  This one of 10 
December 2015, the one with issues that you would expect 
the Chairperson to deal with, did you ever raise that issue 
with the Chairperson to say, why do I receive this email 
from you, Chairperson, because you will not deal with 
these types of issues? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, you remember I said to you 
previously, that I did not read the email there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I remember that I mean later. 
MR KOKO:   So, I did not appreciate the level of detail that 
10 
went into this email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Only now I’m reflecting of the level of detail 
and I had no other opportunity to meet Dr Ngubane, and 
this is true, since he left Eskom.  I’ve never met him, I 
came to know about this email after he left Eskom, so I 
never knew about it before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   The one that I knew of – that I came to know 
of was the …[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 3 January…[intervenes]. 
MR KOKO:   The 3 January which I talked to Ms Daniels 
about and that’s when I – that’s where I say, maybe I 
should have asked deeper, probed deeper or even gone 
and talked to the Chairman. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 178 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And I didn’t do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja because that part is a little 
concerning to me because at some stage I take it, you 
would have become aware of these issues that are in this 
one of the 10 t h of December even if you didn’t look at them 
closely upon receiving it but I would have thought that, at 
some stage you would have become aware in which case at 
that stage, one would expect you to say, no this can’t be 
coming from the Chairperson, let me find out what’s going 
10 
on. 
MR KOKO:   Actually, no Chair, the only time I became to 
appreciate the issues that arose out of this email was in 
February 2018, after Dr Ngubane had left and I’ve never 
met him since. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would have been about three years 
later? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And before that, you would not have had 
occasion to go back to these issues? 
20 
MR KOKO:   No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m and then the one of 3 January – but 
you accept that if you had become aware…[intervenes]. 
MR KOKO:   Of course, of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be expected of you to approach 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 179 of 369 
 
him and say…[intervenes]. 
MR KOKO:   Of course, of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what’s going on? 
MR KOKO:   Of course, and if I was aware and I didn’t do 
it that would be irrational. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the one of 3 January you 
accept that – I think when you came back from the trip you 
say you approached, Ms Daniels? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
and 
she 
just 
talked 
about 
10 
convenience. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you left it at that. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you accept that you should have 
gone deeper to say but you told me that this email is that 
of Dr Ngubane, Dr Ngubane would have nothing to do with 
my – this was for my family, what is going on? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, most certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly, I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m okay, alright, Mr Seleka what was 
your 
question 
that 
was 
causing 
Mr 
Koko 
to 
say…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I remember it Chair. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 180 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what was the question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The – it’s just that as you ask these 
questions, Chair, there’s questions arising from your 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so I’m the cause. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we still using – are we still using 
Bundle 18B? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, if we move away from those emails 
we will have to go to a different bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, I mean, your question that we are 
talking about, does it arise from this Bundle, 18B? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, will relate to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, just repeat the question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And – Mr Koko there is another email 
here about online vending which we see in that list that 
you said – that Ms Daniels talks about, on the 20 t h of July  
she photocopied from your office.  So, yes, by the 
way…[intervenes]. 
MR KOKO:   She did not photocopy from my office Chair, it 
20 
was her document, she took it with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, let’s go to the email first, the one 
about online vending, where it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, that’s on page 1056, 
Eskom Bundle 18. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 181 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   1056? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1056. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the email is from Matshela Koko, 
Kokomm@eskom.co.za 
and 
it 
is 
addressed 
to 
infoportal@zoho.com it says, 
“The subject, online vending and says, we did not 
finish our discussions about this transaction.  We 
did discuss it last time, I see I made a note here, 
Mr Koko insisted he had this discussion with Dr 
Ngubane despite the fact that he accepted the info 
10 
portal address belonged to an external party”. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair we, Mr Ngubane and Ms Daniels, 
before the email I sent, we had a discussion about this and 
this is the email, this is the transaction that is mostly 
misunderstood and I hope – and I will follow Mr Seleka’s 
tune here and I hope that this is an opportunity to deal with 
it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay what was your question about 
it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the question is, simply this, one, 
20 
you don’t deny having a meeting with Ms Daniels in the 
morning of 20 July 2015, is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   Chair on the morning of the 2015 I have 
meetings with almost all my direct reports so I will not deny 
that I met Ms Daniels on that day, I will not deny, I met – I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 182 of 369 
 
made a point that I meet all my direct – and by the way, Ms 
Daniels was not my direct report on that day, but I will not 
deny having met her, she was very important to my work, 
that I will not deny having met her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you have said you got that list, 
I’m talking about, with the transactions, McKinsey being 
one of them, online vending being one of them, Duvha, 
three with the amounts you say you got it from her? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She said it was your list. 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, I got it from her and I can tell you 
now it was – even if I met Suzanne, and I don’t deny 
meeting her on that day, in fact I’ll be very surprised that I 
did not meet her on that day so for all intents and purposes 
you can proceed on the basis that I met, it’s unlikely that I 
could not have met her, I just – so let’s proceed on that 
basis, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   That one pager that we’re talking about, never 
arose on that day, that one pager arose in the second half 
20 
of October when I was about to leave my job as a Group 
Procurement Officer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and you know that she has given 
evidence by way of a supplementary submission, to the 
Parliament Portfolio Committee on this very aspect? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 183 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, and her version was, you said the 
list is of transactions that your principals say you must 
focus on. 
MR KOKO:   She said that at the Parliament, I think she 
said it here too. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And your comment on that? 
MR KOKO:   It’s nonsense Chair, that I can tell you that’s 
blatant nonsense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you have admitted that the 
10 
handwriting on that list is yours? 
MR KOKO:   That’s correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When she was here, last time around, 
she mentioned that….[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Seleka, you took us to the 
email at 1056 on online vending. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you’re now asking him about another 
document, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes that’s – which relates to that email 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It relates to this email? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is that document, I remember 
from the discussion we had with, both Mr Koko last time 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 184 of 369 
 
and Ms Daniels. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, sorry I see what 
Chair is saying, Chair we will have to go back to that 
Eskom Bundle 8 where we found that affidavit of Ms 
Daniels, I think it’s (B), and go directly to page 1084. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve got Bundle 8 page 1084, and that’s 
Bundle 8 (B). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other one is (A). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the Chair on the right page? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1084, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I was getting – okay page 1084, 
I’ve got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, there is a string short their Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see it, don’t we have that 
document enlarges as per – I seem to remember we saw it 
enlarged somewhere. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We do have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be – yes okay, continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we’ll find it, it must be in 8(A), I 
think.  So, online vending, there you find it, I’m counting 
from the bottom, Comati, Laptop, Desktop, online vending, 
…[indistinct] is there.  Duvha 3 which is at the top, might 
also become relevant, so – but this online vending Mr 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 185 of 369 
 
Koko, appears on this list which on….[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I’m 
struggling 
to 
see 
it 
on 
this 
screenshot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We’ll get there – I was reading from 
the bottom of the list Chair, first time around, comati 
replacement, laptop, desktop, and then online vending. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, ja, maybe your junior can find 
where we have the whole document because this is not 
10 
easy to – but you can continue on it if she gets it in the 
meantime then we use the bigger one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so, Mr Koko just to give you the 
opportunity to respond to this, one is, there is this list with 
these transactions and the amounts.  On Mr Daniels’ 
version, you had the list on her version you said, your 
principals had said you should focus on these transactions 
and that is 20 July 2015 on 8 August…[intervenes]. 
MR KOKO:   That is, allegedly 20 July. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, on her version, you will respond of 
20 
course and then on the 8 t h of August 2015, we see an 
exchange between you and info portal on one of the 
transactions on the list, which is online vending PDF and 
then you say, 
“We did not finish our discussions about this 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 186 of 369 
 
transaction, this is what is going to Board of 8 
August”, 
 
And if you look at the common cause fact now, that 
info portal would have been a third party outside of Eskom, 
even most probably Mr Salim Essa.  A conclusion could be 
made from those allegations, one, from the established 
fact of info portal being an outside person even, most 
probably, Mr Essa that you are communicating with that 
external person in regard to one of the transactions which, 
on Ms Daniels’ version is one of those, your principals said 
10 
you should focus on, your comment? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you know this is very interesting, and it 
is a fact of an example of which I gave you two examples, 
three examples, this is a fourth example.  So, what was 
proposed in a meeting before the 18 t h of April, what’s this.  
Eskom must – and Ms Mothepu said it so you should go 
into – for once I agree with her but- I agree with here only 
on that.  Eskom must appoint a master vendor and the 
other 9 vendors must sub-contact to the master vendor, a 
master vendor must pay Eskom money up front and then go 
20 
and collect.  That is what the board wanted when I came in 
there.  And if you then assume according to the narrative of 
Mr Seleka it is what Mr Salim Essa wanted then I would have 
made sure it happens.   
I would have used my influence, my power, my 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 187 of 369 
 
everything to make sure that Eskom appoints a master 
vendor.  The only reason Eskom did not appoint a master 
vendor then go to the Eskom they will tell you Mr Koko never 
wanted master vendor.  I objected to it.  I did not want – 
there was simple reason why I objected – simple one reason.  
Eskom put together in line with 1032 – 1032. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1034  
MR KOKO:  1034 – yes 1034 I – I – thank you for correcting 
me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:  1034 obliges Eskom to do a market analysis.  
Once you do a market analysis then you put a procurement 
strategy.  Once you put a – once a procurement strategy is 
approved by the board then you put a specification then you 
have a bid specification committee that put a specification in 
line with the board approval strategy.   
Once the bid adjudication – the bid specification 
committee approves the specification that has been in line 
with the specification that has approved by the board you 
then issue it in the market on an open tender.  You can no 
20 
longer change the specifications once in the – once it is out 
in the market because you level your playing fields there; 
suppliers come in then you have got a bid adjudication 
committee 
that 
adjudicates 
the 
bids 
based 
on 
the 
specification that went out.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 188 of 369 
 
Then 
the 
bid 
adjudication 
committee 
appoints 
successful suppliers and there were ten of them.  And all 
what the board had to do was to approve it.  You cannot put 
the rules and when you put the rules you must accept our 
consequences of the rules.  You cannot put the rules and 
then when the consequences come and then you are – you 
are 00:02:32.   
This transaction Chair went to the board committee to 
the EXCO and the board about four/five times and has been 
kicked out of the board because there was a new strategy to 
10 
appoint Blue Label as the master vendor.  Now only now 
through the proceeding of the commission I learnt that Mr 
Mark Pamensky was a director or CEO of Blue Label.  I am 
not suggesting any impropriety that I do not know how it 
arose that the board wanted to change a strategy to a master 
– to master vendor.  It was wrong.  It was wrong I was never 
going to support it and I made it known to the chairman, I 
made it known to everybody; it never happened in my time.  
If I was doing the bidding for Mr Salim Essa I could have 
pushed that it happened but it is the fourth example that I 
20 
am mentioning to you.  You know we talked about the – the 
suspending Sunday Times and I objected to it.   
We talked about invoices for McKinsey on two 
occasions I objected to it.  If you go to Eskom now they will 
tell you the person who insisted that the board sticks to its 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 189 of 369 
 
rules and what is approved Mr Koko.  Mr Koko objected to 
the change of 00:04:11 of appointing Blue label as a master 
vendor.  It never happened in my time.   
I heard Mothepu saying it happened two years later 
after I had left.  I do not know what happens after I have left.  
I do not know what happens after I have left.  But it was 
never going to happen in my time.  So this story of Blue 
Label is being thrown around wrongfully so measure me on 
what I have done.  I have objected to the strategy that the 
board wanted.  I insisted to the board you have set the rules.  
10 
You have set the strategy it has been to the market; you 
have got winners here; appoint them.  You cannot – and by 
the way I was not even part of the adjudication committee.   
It was not even my space I was just a procurement 
person; there was a user.  They have done their job with 
your approval; they acted according to you mandate.  You 
cannot change.  You cannot – the rules are there. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Mr Koko I just need to say also for the 
benefit of the Chairperson that obviously your version on 
that letter Dr Ngubane had written to the Minister and why 
20 
you would have emailed it to him is – is new to us in the 
sense that we did not have it before.   
So the letter specifically says a decision is given to 
the Chief Executive Officer to implement and not to you.  So 
we will have to go and find out with Dr Ngubane whether 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 190 of 369 
 
your version is correct.   
MR KOKO:  By all means.  By all means.  I did take… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess that Dr Ngubane may or may 
not know whether Mr Koko was the person to implement it – 
that faxed the implementation.  The one person who would 
definitely know is the person who was Group Executive at 
the time that is apart from any documents within Eskom that 
would say the person to implement such and such a decision 
would be the person occupying this position.  So – so – so I 
am saying you can check with Dr Ngubane but you might find 
10 
that with – if you check with the person who was Group CEO 
at the time that person ought to know but apart from that 
documents within Eskom. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would say who implements what. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would also be able to indicate. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not sure that there is – that 
should be easier to establish.  
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes, no correct Chair.  Because in addition 
is 
what 
Mr 
Koko 
is 
saying 
that 
he 
stopped 
the 
implementation of that decision.  So the board would have 
had to be made aware that their decision had… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja … 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 191 of 369 
 
MR SELEKA SC:  Been stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so – so the board – I mean you 
certainly can check with Dr Ngubane as much as you can but 
certainly the question of – as far as the board is concerned 
who does it – who did it know to be the person to stop – that 
would be fine ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Chair all what I am saying to you.  Judge me on 
what I have done and the evidence of what I have done is 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  The transactions that I am accused of evidence 
will show you that it is me who insisted on compliance and 
on doing the right – on doing the right thing.  And the people 
who accused me do not show 00:05:12.  The people who 
accused you – accused me do not tell you that actually this 
letter from the Minister on quoting Sunday Times never 
20 
actually was implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  They do not tell you that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually you now remind me I saw when we 
were looking at that letter from Dr Ngubane to the Minister. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 192 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we were talking about that he referred 
to a letter from the Minister and I did not remember having 
seeing such a letter and I would be interested in seeing that 
letter. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  All what I am saying is the people who say 
– who will show you that Sunday Times letter will not tell you 
that actually it was Mr Koko who stopped it.  Actually it never 
happened.  The people who accused me of paying Trillian do 
not actually tell you – in fact with all due respect Ms 
10 
Goodson said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr who – Goodson? 
MR KOKO:  Ms Goodson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  But none of these people accusing you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Do not tell you that Mr Koko is the one who 
objected to the R460 million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  None of them told you that.  And this is all what 
I am saying and now it is online vending.  You are not being 
told that the person who objected to the online vending and 
the appointment of a master vendor of Blue Label it is me. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 193 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you know … 
MR KOKO:  You are told too many people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko it is – it shows how important it is 
to hear from everybody because assume that you did not 
come to testify and participate maybe nobody would have 
highlighted the things that you consider important to be 
highlighted and they are legitimate things to be highlighted.  
So it is good that you are here; you are participating; you are 
highlighting what should be highlighted; you are putting your 
version.  It is important.  Yes – that letter do have it Mr 
10 
Seleka from the Minister? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Not – ja I have seen it – I have reference 
to it we do not have the letter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  We will have to get the letter (talking over 
one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that I wonder what it was saying. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because from the fact that the – that Dr 
Ngubane refers to it suggest – that fact suggest that the 
20 
Minister may have written to the board about the same 
subject matter of those newspapers. 
MR KOKO:  Chairman let me tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  How damaging that letter is and it is in this 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 194 of 369 
 
context that I need you to see the evidence of Dr Ngubane 
when he denies that I have met with him.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR KOKO:  It is extremely damaging letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And you have got a copy by any 
chance? 
MR KOKO:  No I read – I read the transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  That letter was never produced.  So this letter 
says. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  On this email from infoportal address attached 
to it was a letter from the Minister.  So Dr Ngubane 
suggesting to you that he received an e – a letter from the 
infoportal – an email from the infoportal address with an 
attachment of a letter signed by the Minister.  You realise 
how damaging that is.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see it becomes all the more 
important because I heard evidence well certainly the 
Minister Ms Brown who was – who gave evidence last week 
20 
said if I recall correctly she had never met – she has never 
met Mr Salim Essa. If I recall correctly.   
Or she might have met once or whatever I am not 
sure but I thought she said he had not met him and certainly 
not in her house or official residence.  She said the person 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 195 of 369 
 
that she had dealt with was Mr Ajay Gupta.   
But 
of 
course 
there 
is 
Mr 
Tsotsi’s 
evidence 
suggesting that had there may have been some interactions 
between the Minister and Mr Salim Essa because she said 
he had been called to the Minister’s residence and he found 
the Minister in the company of Mr Salim Essa.  And Mr 
00:12:49 if I am not mistaken. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so that letter may well be important to 
look at for more than one reason. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MR KOKO:  Well Chair after the denial by Dr Ngubane I think 
that letter is even more important to show the kind of person 
you are dealing with.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes so if we do not have it attempts 
must be made for us to obtain a copy and I take it that the 
Ministry might still have it.  I do not know if Eskom might 
have it but let attempts be made. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
MR SELEKA SC:  We will.  Mr Koko that online vending in 
the email on the list… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your junior has not found the page which 
has got that… 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 196 of 369 
 
MR SELEKA SC:  I have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I will find that much more easier 
to look at than the screenshot. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Is the – Eskom Bundle 8(a) page 
87.88.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Mr 
Koko 
you 
were 
accusing 
the 
investigators of the commission of not having done their job 
in certain respects.  If you do not mind I would like a 
document in which you specify what it is that you think was 
important for them to have looked at which you believe they 
10 
have not looked at.  If I could get that via your – your 
lawyers who would send it to the legal team and give it to 
me.  I would like to have a look at that. 
MR KOKO:  But Chair we have done that.  We have sent you 
a letter.  My counsel sent you a letter on issues that the 
investigating team ought to have looked at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the document you are talking 
about? 
MR KOKO:  I have sent it to – we have sent it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no what I am asking.. 
20 
MR KOKO:  You can – we can augment it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no what I am asking is, is your 
answer that the issues on which you rely make that 
accusation are issues contained in correspondence that has 
been sent already? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 197 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  No Chair the question Mr Seleka asked me is 
that I must comment on the people that effected the master 
service agreement.  And my response to him is that I cannot 
do that because your investigative – investigators said not to 
investigate it.  The players in what they should be doing 
have not done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you see Mr Koko if you are making 
that accusation in good faith I am saying I am interested in 
looking at that. 
MR KOKO:  I am happy to do that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if you say that information is already in 
correspondence that has been given I am happy to go back 
and look at that.  I am just – I just want to make sure that I 
satisfy myself what is going on with regard to those issues. 
MR KOKO:  Chair – Chair I am satisfied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  That you have before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  From my lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Why I say the investigators have not applied 
themselves in a manner that they should have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka I would like to see the 
correspondence that I – I guess that that might be 
correspondence that your counsel handed up here on one of 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 198 of 369 
 
the days when you were appearing. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and my Registrar is hearing.  I would 
like to look at that but I would be – I would like to look at 
that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if – if I think I understand it then I will 
take it from there but if there is something that I do not 
understand I will – we – I will raise it.   
But I am interested because there should not be any 
10 
matter that should be investigated that has not been 
investigated. 
 
Except 
for 
situations 
where 
the 
time 
constraints have made it impossible.   
But if somebody make it – makes an accusation such 
as that we should be able to look at the accusation on its 
merits and if indeed there are matters that have not been 
investigated should be – should have been investigated we 
should be able to say yes it is so and this is the estimation.  
Or no this is the position and this so and so.  So my interest 
is just in making sure that the accusation is not brushed 
20 
aside. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it can be looked at properly. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
MR KOKO:  You do have a document that you get from my 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 199 of 369 
 
lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Chair if I may just – if I may just refer to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Barrie – Mr Barrie if you can tell me if 
possible what date the letter is in particular. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  We provided the letter on the 3rd of 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Barrie hang on.  Wait for me to 
10 
finish and then you can speak because otherwise I do not 
hear you and you will not hear me.   
So my question is – my – what I am saying is I would 
very much like you to give me the date of the letter that has 
got the information that he is talking about then we look at it 
– I will look at it.  If you are able to tell me now that is fine; 
if you would only be able to tell me later that would be fine. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I  - we handed the letter up to you I 
believe it was the 3rd of December but I am under correction.  
Your response to that was that the – put that on affidavit and 
20 
the letter was then addressed in a supplementary affidavit of 
Mr Koko.  I believe what you have put to Mr Koko now goes 
wider than that insofar as – as you say that is there anything 
else that Mr Koko says should have been 00:19:28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No – ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 200 of 369 
 
ADV BARRIE SC:  But those have been substantiated and 
have been dealt with in supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  But if there is anything else we will 
address that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  Yes it is so.  If there is 
anything else other than what is in the correspondence 
already that can be added but I will have a look at it.  Let me 
say that my understanding – my understanding was that that 
correspondence related largely to information that you were 
10 
looking for and I was under the impression that the reason 
why there has been no complaints afterwards is because the 
information was provided and I know Mr Seleka did tell me at 
a certain that the – he had either responded or asked the 
secretary to respond and furnish certain information.  So  
1. We were going to meet – we are going to have a – I 
was going to have a meeting on a certain Saturday and 
the Friday before the Saturday somebody working 
closely to me was tested – tested positive for Covid-19 
which made it necessary for me to go on self-isolation. 
20 
As a result of that no such meeting could take place 
that week and subsequently I did I think ask Mr Seleka 
to address the issue of the information that was being 
sought and he indicated to me that at some stage that 
the – he sent correspondence dealing with – with those 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 201 of 369 
 
matters. 
So I just want to place on record my understanding in regard 
to that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka is there something that I 
misunderstood? 
MR SELEKA SC:  No your – your understanding is correct 
Chair.  We just need to make a distinction between that 
information the last part you talking about where there is a 
request for information relative to telephone records that 
10 
was made available to Mr Koko and his team.  The first part 
you talked about with Mr Koko which is areas which he 
thought the commission should pursue an investigation on 
that letter is there but it was also responded to.  So we did 
in one hearing deal with that aspect to some extent and you 
will see Chairperson when you read the correspondence it 
should – it should refresh your memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MR SELEKA SC:  I can recall from the – I can recall off the 
cuff that there were two aspects that Mr Koko thought we 
20 
should investigate. One was how Glencore was treated I 
think it was about the unfair – un – not the fair treatment or 
special treatment given to Glencore and then the Simotomo 
issue. There might have been another one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Daniels – Ms Daniels. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 202 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  We do corruption at Medupi and Kusile. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR SELEKA SC:  So we did respond to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  But we will make that available to the 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja make that available. 
10 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  What – what then Mr Koko I think was 
trying to draw to your attention Chair is his response to my 
question about commenting on the role players.  So I do not 
know whether... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MR SELEKA SC:  Your question was in relation to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me say two things.  With regard to 
allegations of corruption at Medupi – Medupi that I can tell 
you Mr Koko was the subject of deliberation as to whether 
we should embark on that and the legal team and the 
20 
investigators – or I was approached at a certain stage last 
year I cannot remember when it was but when it – when I 
was approached I made the decision that we would not.  And 
the reason was simply that that – by that time I had taken 
the decision that if we – if the commission was going to 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 203 of 369 
 
complete its work within the time given by the High Court we 
had to try and focus.   
There would not be enough time to start and finish 
something that appeared to be quite big. So as far – that is 
as far as that part is concerned.  But I certainly am going to 
look at the correspondence so that at least if there is 
anything that I think the investigators should have done that 
they did not do and if I do not get a proper explanation I can 
see what needs to be done.   
So I just wanted to make sure that no impression is 
10 
created that you have brought to the attention of the 
commission certain matters of concern with regard to the 
investigation by the investigators and that is being swept 
under the carpet. 
MR KOKO:  Chairman let me tell you what I have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I have done engaging with the commission in 
particular with Glencore and we will deal with the issues of 
Glencore.  I went to the Public Protector and opened a case 
with the Public Protector.  I went to the police station and 
20 
opened a case with Glencore.  I do not think I should have 
done that.   
I think this is a matter that this commission should be 
dealing with because Glencore has contrary to many beliefs 
and I will spend today showing you that it has taken Eskom 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 204 of 369 
 
for a ride. And I am – I you know I am beginning to be of the 
view that you are actually – this commission or the – the 
reason this commission exists and this commission is – is 
caught up in between the business interests of the current 
President of the Republic and the former President of the 
Republic and the previous Public Protector actually took 
sides without looking into the evidence and the only thing 
that makes me comfortable now is that you are guiding your 
team to look at the evidence and I am confident that once 
you have looked at the evidence that the conclusion would 
10 
be far better than Professor Thuli Madonsella.   
I have written an opinion piece actually saying – 
actually Professor Thuli Madonsella who is as an apol – I 
mean an apology because she was caught up between the 
conflicting interest of associates of the current President of 
the Republic and associates of the former President of the 
Republic and the 00:26:55 but Chair we are going to go to 
that and I will have my opportunity to tell you why I am 
saying what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  But I – I am going to 
20 
repeat a point that I did mention to you some time in the past 
Mr Koko.  Some of the people who have – who have had 
information may be bringing us the relevant and important 
information at the tail end of the work of the commission.  
Despite the fact that from 2018 I made announcements and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 205 of 369 
 
said please if you have got information of matters that fall 
within the Terms of Reference of the commission bring them 
to us and when I made those announcements I did not say 
this group of people must do that but that group must not do 
that it was an open invitation to everybody.   
Of course some people brought information as soon 
as possible and then others brought it at some stage and I 
am sure now there might be other who have not even 
brought it but yet it is relevant, it is important and it falls 
within the Terms of Reference of the commission.   
10 
So – so we may have a situation where if we get 
information that is relevant, that is important it happens at 
the time when there is just no time.  But we would have 
loved to have received it much earlier and if we had received 
it much earlier we could have done something about it. 
MR KOKO:  I accept Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  I am just eagerly waiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And I cannot wait to deal with the legal opinion 
20 
with the three legal opinions from CDH. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Just to show you how you have been taken for a 
ride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is alright.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 206 of 369 
 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at four o’clock.  Let us take the 
normal ten minute break but before we do that let us have a 
discussion so that we have a common understanding of the 
way forward.  From my side I am expecting that we should be 
able to go into the evening as long as we have not finished.  
That is point 1.   
 
Point 2 which probably may not have been known to 
Mr Koko and Mr Barrie is that there is a possibility that 
tomorrow may be available in case you are available Mr 
10 
Koko and Mr Barrie your legal team but let us first talk about 
going into the evening.  You are all – we all accept that we 
go into evening.  Mr Barrie. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I am very definitely not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I was not talking about the evening – 
this evening. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Oh the evening is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This evening is fine but tomorrow you are 
not available?  Okay alright.  I guess Mr Koko it does not 
help if you – even if you are available. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If your counsel is not available. 
MR KOKO:  Chair we can work all night. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright so that is fine let us adjourn 
for ten minutes and then we will come back and continue.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 207 of 369 
 
We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ja, still on the 
Online Vending, Mr Koko, then.  So we have gone to the 
list.  We have gone to the email.  And I wish to add to that 
Ms Matshepo’s version, talking about negotiations between 
Eskom and McKinsey for the conclusion of the MSA.  She 
says that...  Chair, I am just going to read from her 
10 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Will you...  Do I need to go there or 
you... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not?  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, you also do not need to. 
MR KOKO:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let me just... you.  I wanted to 
read from October 2015 but she simply says: 
“Messrs Matshela Koko and Anoj Singh added 
initiatives 
that 
were 
originally 
on 
the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 208 of 369 
 
proposal...” 
 
That is the proposal by McKinsey/Regiments. 
“These 
were 
Online 
Vending 
Duvha 
3 
Insurance, Hugo(?) 3 Insurance claim...” 
 
And she adds: 
“Build Hitachi Insurance settlement...” 
 
But for present purposes, Online Vending and 
the Duvha 3 insurance, which she alleges, you and 
Mr Singh added to the proposal.  You want to comment on 
that/ 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, you have a timeline that 
stands like this.  Mr Koko participates in a conspiracy and 
a sham suspension on the 30 t h of March 2015 so that on 
the 26 t h of July 2015, in his absence, the board approves a 
mandate to negotiate with McKinsey.  The negotiations with 
McKinsey, and the board approves the Negotiating Team.   
 
In my affidavit, I list the Negotiation Team that 
the board appointed.  You will find it on the BTC document 
dated the 6 t h of October 20...  No, you will find the 
document dated – it was approved on the 6 t h of July and 
20 
you will also find it on the document dated 6 October 2015.   
 
In that document, it is titled Feedback to the 
Negotiations.  The Negotiating Teams says:  We have been 
mandated by the Board Tender Committee to do the 
negotiations.  The negotiating members are the following.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 209 of 369 
 
The negotiations started on the 28 t h of July 2015 to the 
29 t h of September 2015, I think.   
 
My second date could be correction but I think it 
is the 29 t h of September 2015.  And this is what has been 
negotiated.  We have stepped outside the board mandate 
and for that we ask for a condonation and the board 
rectifies that.  And the board then says:  Go and conclude.  
So.  And that is all in October.   
 
On the 23 r d of October, I get a new assignment.  
It is a document I wanted to have discussions with you 
10 
during break and I still want us to go back to it because it 
explains all this.  And I completely moved out of the 
situation of McKinsey on the 23 r d of October.  Of course, 
now that I have seen the documents that I have brought to 
you today, I understand why Ms Matshepo continues to 
send me emails to my email address and I have not 
responded to any of them.   
 
I could not have negotiated the contract in 
November because the evidence before you in writing tells 
you when the negotiations started, when the negotiations 
20 
ended.  And it tells you in names who did the negotiations.  
One of the things I am saying I am not happy with the 
investigations is that the people who did the negotiations 
are there.  I have mentioned the names.   
 
It would be very easy for your investigators to go 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 210 of 369 
 
to them and say this document says you have negotiated it.  
Did you negotiate and what was Mr Koko’s role?  That has 
not happened.  But somebody throws my name that I have 
negotiated.  I did not.  Evidence before you...  Again, Mr 
Chair, I keep on saying, let us follow the evidence.  What 
is the evidence in writing as meant, it says.   
 
It does not say Mr Koko and Mr Singh were the 
negotiators.  The Negotiating Team is listed.  I have never 
responded to any of the emails Ms Matshepo sent me.  I 
had nothing to do with it.  I had no reason to respond.  
10 
With my counsel kept on asking me but why would she 
continue to send you this?  And I said, the only explanation 
I could give is because I concluded via a Letter of Award, 
the Business Plan transaction.   
 
Then 
she 
probably 
thought 
that 
I 
am 
still 
involved.  But now that I see a letter that – and at the right 
time I would like to discuss it with you Chair.  You will see, 
why I think she continued to do that, but I was not in the 
picture.  The delegations is to the office.  If you are the 
Deputy Chief Justice, you have got delegation of authority.  
20 
If we move you to another – to be the Justice President of 
Pretoria or North, you have got a different authority.  And 
that is all what happened.   
 
I just do not understand why it is so complexed 
for people to say the PFMA and the Eskom delegations, 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 211 of 369 
 
you delegate to the office.  And once the person moves out 
of the office...  We can quibble about when did you leave 
the office, like we did with Ms Daniels.  But once left the 
office, you leave the delegation in that office.  The person 
who is left in that office is the one then that must deals 
with it.   
 
It then makes sense to me, in hindsight, why I 
insisted Mr Mabelane is in the meetings that I am called in, 
that relates to things that I am not involved because he 
had the delegation.  So I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I really think, Chair, you need to zoom into 
this with a fine comb.  Forget the gossips.  Because 
Ms Matshepo had never given you anything, other than to 
simply say:  Trust me.  Trust me, Chair.  Trust me as 
Ms Matshepo.  Mr Koko and Mr Singh negotiated this.  It is 
all what she told you.  Besides that, she gave you nothing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And by the way, she told a big lie about the 
Indian chap in my office she was communicating to, who 
20 
happened to be my personal assistant who is black and 
African.  And when you pushed her she said:  Oh, I 
remember.  That part of her transcripts, blue lie.  Now 
again, why would Ms Matshepo come here and tell you a 
blue lie and stand by it?  I do not know?   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 212 of 369 
 
 
I just do not know why would she come here and 
lie about it but I would like you to ask her.  But this is a lie.  
Why did you lie?  What interest you further to lie about Mr 
Koko?  Because now I know, it is common cause that it is a 
lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Mr Koko, you did not comment 
on my question.  She says you and Mr Anoj Singh 
expanded a scope of the original proposal by adding other 
initiatives which included the Online Vending.  What is your 
10 
comment? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, my comment is.  I could not do that.  I 
had no authority to do that.  I could not.  But..  I could not 
Chair.  That is my comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Okay ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I had no authority to do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   But I want...  Another piece of evidence that 
you must – that you need to consider.  If you look at all the 
transactions that Ms Matshepo lists including Duvha 3 
20 
Insurance, are all in the delegations of the financial or the 
Finance Department, not in the scope of the role I was 
playing at the time, which is Group Executive Generation 
and Technology.   
 
If she was saying it was a technical matter and I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 213 of 369 
 
added it, maybe.  All of them, without...  I mean, I heard 
Ms Daniels saying the same.  I mean, when Ms Daniels 
was dealing with this document, she tried to make you 
believe all these things are in Mr Koko’s space.  She said 
that.  But let me tell you.  Duvha 3, for example, if you go 
to Eskom today, everybody will tell you:  Duvha 3 is 
reconstruction.  Is building a new boiler.  It is Group 
Capital.  It would have been under Masango’s space.  It 
had nothing to do with Mr Koko.   
 
So it is a lie again.  And why would they play like 
10 
that?  The Eskom’s delegation...  You know, if you go to 
Eskom now and say:  Who is responsible for Group 
Capital?  Mr Koko was never ever in his 23-year life at 
Eskom responsible for Group Capital.  Mr Masango was 
really involved, was responsible for Group Capital for 9 
years of his 22... 24-year life in Eskom.   
 
Why do people come here to lie to you like that?  
And we tolerate and we do not press them out.  We do not 
say:  Show us the evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Koko, you bring – you come 
20 
here, you do affidavits, you put annexures precisely for 
that point so that once there is evidence that shows that 
they may not be telling the truth, then they can be 
confronted with that.  So everybody is being asked to make 
their input, who has personal knowledge, who knows 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 214 of 369 
 
something so that at the end, where it looks like somebody 
should be confronted with a document or a version from 
somebody else, that is done.   
 
That is why, even with you, Mr Seleka is putting 
to you versions that come from other people.  Even with 
them, he would be doing so, to say Mr Koko says this 
about them.  Those who have testified already, it does not 
mean they cannot be called back if something props up 
that was not there before to say:  What do you say about 
this?  So all of that ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR KOKO:   I would like Ms Matshepo to be confronted 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...with the evidence that...  But she must be 
confronted in person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   She is a mere secretary.  She could not have 
been assigned to you as a secretary to deal with high-level 
financial stuff that are not in Mr Koko’s area.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR KOKO:   One.  Two.  The Duvha 3 and all others are to 
in the scope of Mr Koko.  Three.  The negotiations with 
McKinsey were completed on the 29 t h of September and 
were presented to the Board of Eskom in a document of the 
6 t h of October.  Four.  Five.  The Negotiating Team 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 215 of 369 
 
members are listed by the Board of Eskom.  That is the 
evidence that is before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But also Mr Koko.  Apart from the 
fact that the Commission has to probe certain matters 
when a witness gives evidence, the rules also give a 
person such as you if a witness has said something that 
implicates you, the right to apply to the Commission for 
leave to cross-examine them and challenge their version.  
So, in other words, it is not just the Commission.   
 
From your side, if they have implicated you and 
10 
said something about you that is not true, that seeks to put 
you into allegations of state capture or corruption, you are 
free to make that application ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And so they will be challenged and 
confront them with all of that. 
MR KOKO:   And in most cases, I have been invited to do 
so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I accept. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
MR KOKO:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, do not keep that doc – keep 
that report you are referring to.  I know you know it Chair.  
I could refer the page reference to you.  It was to Exco

Koko.   
MR KOKO:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you reading from now?  Hang 
on mister ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you reading from? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did say I can give you the page 
reference, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I did not hear that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What, Bundle 8?  Bundle 8(a)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  [laughs]  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Have you left me behind? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes...  No.  It is just that Mr Koko 
20 
referred to it.  It is in Bundle 14, Chair.  14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Do I need to go there or I can...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is just...  I want to just 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay just read. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 217 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...read to Mr Koko ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on a second.  Mr Barrie, your 
issue has fallen away? 
ADV BARRIE:   Ja, it was the information I wanted... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja, Mr Koko, I think follows – he 
mentions ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I ...[intervenes] [Speaker not clear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you referring to the document that 
gives the names of the Negotiating Team? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says it does. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, it does. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you will show me Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   I am going to show you Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go to then the Eskom Bundle.  If 
you give me that 14(c). 
20 
MR KOKO:   If you give me that opportunity, I will do so.  I 
think it is quite important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, on the second last page, the 
names are there. 
MR KOKO:   Okay.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 218 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR KOKO:   And my point is, Chair.  If the names 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Hang 
on 
one 
second 
Mr 
Koko.  
Mr Seleka, my space is limited here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have Bundle 18 and Bundle 8, 8(b).  
Which one should I keep for the moment and which one 
could I let – send away until – when you need to use it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Chairperson is going to need 8(a) 
10 
for that list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So 8(b) can be removed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   8(b) can be removed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And Bundle 18 can remain? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bundle 18, remove it for now Chair.  
You can remove it for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me not remove it because I can 
keep it until you come back to it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What page on Bundle 14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is page 829.36.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got Bundle 14, 829.36. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Point 36 of that report. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 219 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the document that is supposed to 
have the list of the negotiators? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   The...  You will find the list, Mr Koko, 
you will correct me, on page 829.43. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you will not only find the names in that 
document but you will also find the negotiated outcome.  
And my counsel has got the minutes of the board that 
approves and condones the deviations from the board’s 
10 
mandate.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that will be important to have also.  
But in the meantime, this document... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This document is written Feedback 
Report.  It is addressed to the chairperson of – Chairman, 
Exco Procurement Sub-Committee, Board of Directors and 
the Tender Committee.  It is dated – there is the date of 
8 October 2015 next to the chairman.  And then the date of 
22 October 2015 next to the Board of Directors.  And it is – 
20 
the compiler is reflected as Dongi Zodwa Mokwatle.  The 
business is Commodity Sourcing.  And unit and name of 
end-user 
is 
reflected 
as 
Matshela 
Koko. 
 
And 
the 
description is about: 
“Feedback on negotiated on outcome with 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 220 of 369 
 
McKinsey & Company to develop the current 
Top Engineers Programme Internal Consultant 
Unit that can provide world-class management 
consulting 
services 
capable 
of 
resolving 
emerging company wide risks by unlocking 
cash without prior rendering...” 
 
Yes.  Now we know, and Mr Seleka, you said the 
list of the Negotiating Team appears at page ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, I am sorry to interrupt.  I am...  Are 
we on Bundle 8, page 29.36? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at Bundle 14. 
ADV BARRIE:   Bundle 14? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But the page is 829.36 and I have 
just moved to page 829.43 of that document.  And the 
names of the Negotiating Team is given there as Prish 
Govender, 
Dongi 
Zodwa 
Mokathle, 
Donston 
Maku, 
Raydene(?) 
Doll(?), 
Schneholeger(?) 
Ngra(?), 
Mandla 
Kobinza.  [00:21:11]  You said there is the negotiating 
outcome as well, Mr Koko?  Do you want to draw my 
attention to that? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Can I put it just behind you?  Just give me the 
page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   829.43, it is where the list of the 
Negotiating Team appears.  829.44 is the last page of the 
document, I think.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 221 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I have the document in front of me 
but it is ... bundle.  But if I can take you to paragraph – 
Section 2 of the same document? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Section 2 of...? 
MR KOKO:   The same document.  The first document you 
just were on.  You will see number 1 is introduction.  Am I 
correct Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, where is says:  Approved Mandate, 
Parameters and Negotiation Results? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  You say...  So that is where 
the – the results of the negotiation are to be found under 
that heading? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
MR KOKO:   You can see on the left-hand side is the 
approved mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR KOKO:   And on the right-hand side is the results. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The results achieved. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Achieved.  And the result achieved and the 
mandate, not all of them are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The same. 
MR KOKO:   ...the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 222 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   That is why the board had to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ratify? 
MR KOKO:   Ratify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Mr 
Seleka, 
I 
guess 
now 
we 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Koko, quickly because we are 
dealing 
with the – 
Ms 
Matshepo’s 
version that you 
amended the scope of the original proposal, you and 
10 
Mr Singh but I think you have taken it a step further to the 
negotiations, whether or not you were involved in the 
negotiations.  So.   
 
Well, we will deal with – you have answered the 
first, which is, you could not have done that.  You could not 
have amended the originals.  But let us see the original 
proposal.  Let see it at this document.  The feedback report 
was signed by you.  You are the last signatory on the 6 t h of 
October 2015. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, if you need the page 
reference, you will let me know.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I just wanted to say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That document at page 829.43. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 223 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from listing the names of – 
members of the approved Negotiating Team. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also has in another column a list where 
it says Negotiation Team participants.  And I see that it list 
under that the same names, if I am not mistaken.  No, no.  
There are more names.  It list certain names.  Some of 
those names appear under the approved Negotiation Team 
but others do not appear but it says those are the 
10 
Negotiation Team participants. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As opposed to the approved Negotiation 
Team.  And maybe to state the obvious.  Mr Koko does not 
appear...  Mr Koko’s name does not appear on any of the 
two lists. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  So what we do Chair and the board 
insist on that for transparency because most of these 
20 
projects take long and people are not always – they do not 
stay in the same positions for long.  So the board approves 
a Negotiation Team and for some reason there are 
movements and the team leader pulls in new people that 
were not approved by the board.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 224 of 369 
 
 
The requirement of 1034 is that you have to be 
transparent to the board about who participated in the 
negotiations, who were not originally on the list.  And that 
is why you have got a before and after.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So the point of these two lists – 
the point you are making, Mr Koko, just now, the point you 
are 
making 
now 
is 
that 
there 
is 
an 
approved 
list 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of members of the Negotiation Team? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is a list of participants in the 
negotiations? 
MR KOKO:   Correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Which might include people who were 
not participating. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But those are people who, as a matter of 
fact, participated. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other is a list of those who were 
approved? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 225 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koki, then 
– did they give you the right file? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, they have.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Please turn to page 829.37.  I 
just want you to explain to the Chairperson... 
MR KOKO:   829... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 37. 
MR KOKO:   I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Paragraph 1.4, I would like you 
to explain to the Chairperson, which reads: 
10 
“That the Negotiating Team that will also serve 
as a Steering Committee for the development 
of Eskom’s Top Engineers Consulting Unit be 
authorised 
under 
the 
chairmanship 
of 
the 
Group Executive Technology and Commercial 
to 
develop, 
negotiate 
and 
implement 
the 
above, 
subject 
to 
Eskom’s 
delegation 
of 
authority...” 
 
Is that Group Executive of Technology and 
Commercial yourself at the time? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how do we – how should we 
understand this which includes, not only to develop and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 226 of 369 
 
implement, but also to negotiate?   
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   As the chairperson – so then the 
Negotiating Team will serve as a Steering Committee under 
the chairmanship of yourself.   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To do, amongst others, negotiation.  
So how do we – how should that be understood? 
MR KOKO:   Well, it is self-explanatory, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m? 
10 
MR KOKO:   It is as it is.  The only issue that I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not sure that it is self-
explanatory Mr Koko.  You said you were not – you did not 
negotiate this.  There was a Negotiating Team, there was a 
document made and give a list which we have looked at.  
That is true, you name is not there.  Mr Koko is saying:  
Here is clause or paragraph 1.4 which says:   
“The Negotiating Team will also serve as a 
Steering Committee for the development of 
20 
Eskom’s Top Engineers Consulting Units... 
 
And it says: 
“...under 
the 
chairmanship 
of 
the 
Group 
Executive 
Technology 
and 
Commercial 
to 
develop, negotiate and implement the above, 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 227 of 369 
 
subject to Eskom’s delegation of authority...” 
 
As I understand it and not having...  It refers to 
above.  I have not gone back to see the above.   
 
And I have not looked to – I have looked at the 
Negotiation of Authority Process which also says subject to 
the Delegation of Authority.  But on the face of it, as I 
understand it, it seems to say there is a Negotiating Team 
and that Negotiating Team, for certain purposes, will be 
taken to the Steering Committee.   
 
So maybe under circumstances you do not call it 
10 
a Negotiating Team.  You call it a Steering Committee.   
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they say, when it is a Steering 
Committee, it will be checked by the Group Executive 
Technology and Commercial. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it says what they should then 
do as the steering committee chaired by the Group 
Executive Technology and Commercial. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says they must develop, negotiate and 
implement the above.  Now the above I suspect is this top 
engineers programme, I assume. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct?  Ja.  So Mr Seleka’s 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 228 of 369 
 
question therefore is in the light of paragraph 1.4 and your 
answer that you were not involved in negotiations still 
stands. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Because this is post BTC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Post board approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Which happened on the 22 October. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And on the 23 October I started a new job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now this document, as I said, it has got 
two dates.  One is 8 October 2015, another one is 22 
October 2015.  I am not sure whether it is intended to say 
it was given or sent to the Chairman on the 8 October and 
it was sent or given to the board of directors on the 22 n d. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, can I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I remember you said there was a 
meeting of the board on the 22 n d. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Can I explain it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, explain, yes. 
MR KOKO:   Before a transaction sits at the board tender 
committee it must serve at the executive tender committee, 
so the executives must approve it before it goes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 229 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And that happened on the 8 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because or one more of them must take 
it to the tender committee. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And that happened on the 8 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   8 October? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   And then on the 22 October the board tender 
committee met. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So this board of directors which on 
the face of it or which might give one the impression that 
this 22 October is directed at board of directors it might 
simply be there – it might be there to simply say this was a 
committee which is a subcommittee of the board of 
directors. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, the way it says – you see, it says 
board of directors tender committee. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Of the meeting of the 22 October 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but that is the point I am making 
that I should not think it is talking about the board. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 230 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something about the tender committee 
of the board. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  So …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And subcommittee of the board tender 
committee resolved as per 1.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   So that is futuristic. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   We resolve that in the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, so …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   This must be implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying that this document, as 
I say it – okay, I see that in terms of signatures it signed in 
October, three of the people signed it, signed it on the 2 
October 2015 and then you signed it on the 6 October 
2015.  So the document was – but if it was signed so early 
in October how can it have 22 October – how can it refer to 
20 
a meeting that took place after? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, it is signed on the 6 October and the 
meeting is on the 22 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So it is after – the meeting is after. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 231 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought that it seeks to record what 
had happened already by the time those who signed it 
signed it. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, what you see here has happened 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the 22 n d has not happened. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, the negotiations happens before the 
meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   Based on the mandate that was given in July.  
The negotiations are done but you cannot implement until 
you go to the authority that gave you the mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Which is the board tender committee.  The 
board tender committee sits on the 22 October and this 
document is prepared for that purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, as I understand you, at 
least earlier on, you were saying that date of 22 October 
20 
2015 reflects the meeting that took place on that date. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the tender committee. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am putting to you is that on 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 232 of 369 
 
the 6 October when you signed this document you could 
not say there was a meeting on the 22 n d that had happened 
because it had not happened. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair, that is how the process is set up, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So when there is a future meeting documents 
are prepared three weeks in advance.  You sign them 
through – it is Eskom law, three weeks in advance 
documents must be ready, 14 days in advance the board 
10 
members must receive them and then 14 days later the 
meeting sits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – no, no, what you are saying, that I 
understand but you agreed earlier on when I said it 
seemed to me to reflect a meeting that had happened and 
yet it had not yet happened. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, Chair, if I said yes, I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   This is the meeting that had not happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it was a future meeting. 
20 
MR KOKO:   It was a future meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   It was a future meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But then I hope that the document does 
not anywhere purport to reflect what happened at a 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 233 of 369 
 
meeting that had not taken place. 
MR KOKO:   No, it has not, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has not, okay. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in this Commission we have heard 
such situations. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, no, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MR KOKO:   All what this document said, on the 6 t h, this is 
what is happening, this is what has happened, we must go 
10 
and inform and get a new mandate from the board, that is 
in the future.  And the date of the future – all the 
documents, you will see they always have a future date.  
So when I sign it, oh, I know, the next board meeting is on 
the – when I was signing it on the 6 t h, this document tells 
me actually I am signing this thing on the 6 t h for the board 
meeting of the 22 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I understand when you say that 
but one would have expected that the document would say 
something like next meeting of the committee, 22 October. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this is what that is supposed mean in 
the first stage, I accept …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I accept that you say that is how is 
understood that is what – but I would have expected that it 
would say like next meeting, just to alert everybody the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 234 of 369 
 
next meeting where this document is supposed to be 
presented at date …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I accept your point there, Chair, as long as we 
understand what it means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   I accept your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, let us see – let us go to the 
first page of this feedback report …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us complete this point, Mr Seleka 
10 
and Mr Koko, I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, Mr Koko, you – is your point or part 
of your point this, that as the 6 October, which is when you 
signed this document, the idea was that the person 
occupying your position, whether it was you or whoever, 
should be the Chairperson of the steering committee? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you say the tender committee 
sat on the 22 October and approved this. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But on the 23 October you moved out of 
this position. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 235 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore you could not play any 
role – you could not chair the steering committee anymore. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, I was trying to 
do exactly that finalisation, Chair.  If we go to page 1, Mr 
Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I took that away from you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will deal with it differently, I see 
10 
where the Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   829.36, Mr Koko, the introduction and 
– because I am trying to understand this in the light of your 
explanation to the Chairperson.  Paragraph 1 says: 
“Introduction. 
 
In 
accordance 
with 
a 
mandate 
approved by BTC…” 
board tender committee. 
“…via round robin on 6 July 2015 to negotiate with 
McKinsey 
and 
Co 
to 
develop 
the 
current 
top 
20 
engineers programme into an internal consulting 
unit that can provide world class management 
consulting services capable of resolving emerging 
company 
wide 
risks 
are 
driving 
savings 
and 
unlocking cash, this report reflects the results of 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 236 of 369 
 
thereof and requests ratification of the negotiation 
feedback.” 
Then it says: 
“The mandate provided was as follows.” 
Now that is the mandate provided on 6 July 2015. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
“The mandate to negotiate with McKinsey and Co to 
develop the current Top Engineers programme into 
an internal consulting unit that can provide world 
10 
class management consulting services capable of 
resolving emerging company-wide risks by driving 
savings and unlocking cash is hereby approved 
subject to the following.” 
So Chair, this is a restatement of what was decided on the 
6 July 2015 by BTC.  Then you have, 1.1, it gives you the 
points that was decided, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and then 1.4 because 
I am trying to …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Ja, I agree with you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I am trying to have the 
20 
Chairperson and us be on the same page.  No, Chair, that 
is fine, just keep it there.  Then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you agree with him, Mr Koko, 
okay, on the 6 July you were still on suspension, is that 
right? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 237 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   On July I was still on suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Well, if you agree with him 
then the question would be between the 6 July and the 20 
July obviously because you are still on suspension you 
would not have chaired the steering committee, maybe it 
was chaired by whoever was acting in your position but 
when you came back on the 20 July, between the 20 July 
and the 23 October you have already said you never 
formed part of the negotiations. 
MR KOKO:   Certainly, Chair, I never did that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you know whether anybody did 
take your place, you did chair the steering committee when 
you were back? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, to the best of my knowledge and I 
am certain that I am not wrong at all, was never a steering 
committee.  A steering committee was never set up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, well I guess there was no need to 
set up the steering committee because 1.4 says the 
negotiating team has just put on a different cap. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The steering committee, there would 
only 
be 
on 
addition, 
the 
Chairperson 
would 
be 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so the structure was there by virtue 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 238 of 369 
 
of the agreement. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of this document. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the only question is whether the 
Chairperson 
ever 
called 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
steering 
committee. 
MR KOKO:   There was never a meeting, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now before you came back from your 
suspension do you know whether there was somebody who 
10 
chaired such steering committee? 
MR KOKO:   I have no knowledge of that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you never had.  Ja but you say when 
you were back you …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   There was never a steering committee.  All 
what happened in September, once we decided that we 
need a corporate plan, I sent an email to the team for an 
update, guys, how far are you with the negotiations you are 
doing with McKinsey and that is a document that Mr Seleka 
was referring to, that they gave me the feedback on.  That 
20 
is the only thing that they said. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
seeing 
that 
you 
signed 
this 
document on the 6 July and you would have seen this 
clause 1.4 for signing it, how did it come about that you did 
not give effect to it because you were the person who 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 239 of 369 
 
should have given effect to it once you were back. 
MR KOKO:   Because the negotiations were complete by 
the time I signed it on the 6 t h, there was nothing 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were completed before you came 
or…? 
MR KOKO:   Before the 6 t h, there was nothing to do before 
the 6 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, before the 6 October. 
MR KOKO:   On the 6 t h when I signed this document… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they had been completed. 
MR KOKO:   They had been completed there was nothing 
more to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And from 20 July to that time you were 
not aware that you were supposed to chair this committee. 
MR KOKO:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR KOKO:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And nobody told you about it. 
MR KOKO:   And nobody told me about it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   All what I knew as a commercial executive is 
that there is this transaction on the engineers and it was 
on this basis and that is why I had a meeting with the 
Chairman but this resolution never came to me at all.  In 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 240 of 369 
 
fact the first time I saw this resolution was when I signed 
this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A couple of things arising for there, Mr 
Koko, let me clear one.  There was a steering committee, 
Mr Anoj Singh was here, testified, he was the Chairperson 
of this steering committee. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And there are minutes of that steering 
committee. 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him finish, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I managed to finish as he was 
interrupting, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, Mr Koko, response? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, again it is case of mistaken identity.  
The steering committee that Mr Singh was talking about 
started to the best of my knowledge in January 2016 for 
the …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Corporate plan. 
MR KOKO:   Not for the corporate plan for the MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Then Mr Singh had his own steering 
committee for the corporate plan for the contract that I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 241 of 369 
 
signed on the 29 September.  It was a financial transaction 
for the purpose of the business plan.  So and this is why I 
said, you know, people intend to combine these two which 
are different.  Mr Singh was running a project to draft a 
business plan that must be ready in February.  He 
managed it, he ran it, I was – I do not even remember 
being in those meetings, it was a financial thing that he ran 
and if businesses had to contribute there were people that 
were part of that but that is not a standing committee that 
is envisaged here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I am no way, Mr Koko, confusing 
corporate plan, business plan with the Top Engineers 
programme.  The Top Engineers programme became part of 
the MSA, the steering committee was formed, it was 
chaired by Mr Singh.  We have minutes of that meeting.  I 
do not have those minutes, Chair, and I do not know, I 
cannot talk to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I was not part of it, I do not know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying, Mr Seleka, that the 
steering committee that Mr Singh chaired is the steering 
committee contemplated in paragraph 1.2 – 1.4? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 242 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I was not to explain – I have heard 
the Chairperson interpret that paragraph 1.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I want us to go back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that we can understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because you see, Chair, the BTC when 
it sat on the 6 July 2015, the resolution actually says the 
Acting Group Executive Technology and Commercial is 
10 
authorised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is?  Is authorised? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says that: 
“Resolved that a negotiating team that will also 
serve as a steering committee for the development 
of 
Eskom 
Top 
Engineers 
consulting 
unit 
be 
authorised under the Chairmanship of the Acting 
Group 
Executive 
Technology, 
Commercial 
to 
develop, negotiate and implement above strategy 
subject to Eskom delegation of authority.” 
20 
So the paragraph reads the same except that in the 
resolution the word “acting” is inserted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, where is the resolution? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The resolution is on page, the same 
bundle, page 829.14.  So that is Eskom bundle 14(c) page 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 243 of 369 
 
829.14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got it: 
“It is resolved that…” 
1, 1.1 and then 1.4. 
“That a negotiating team that will also serve as a 
steering committee for the development of Eskom 
Top Engineers consulting unit be authorised under 
the Chairmanship of the Acting Group Executive 
Technology and Commercial to develop, negotiate 
and implement above strategy subject to Eskom 
10 
delegation of authority.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that the inclusion of “acting” 
would make sense because at that time whoever was in 
that position was acting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We know who it was, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko will also know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was it Mr Mabelane? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  But of course Mr – I do not 
know whether Mr Koko is going to say well, that was 
specific to the acting person or not. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, I had nothing to say, actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 244 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   I had no knowledge of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It was [indistinct].   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   You know in my language we have something 
called [speaking vernacular] and Mr Seleka, I do not know 
if you understand that.  You are putting things to me that I 
had no knowledge of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Seleka, continue and put the 
point you wanted to put. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But one of the things you were saying or 
you were I think suggesting is that you may have a certain 
interpretation of clause – of paragraph 1.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1.4. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
That 
might 
different 
from 
the 
interpretation I have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is separate from the acting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, that is separate from the 
20 
acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  What is that interpretation? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And maybe we should go to it when it 
is decided on the 6 July 2015, Chair, because it will make 
sense. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 245 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe start before I go there so I 
can – simply looking at 1.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that interpretation? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where is the Chairperson now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am at 829.37.  I am sorry, Mr Barrie? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Mr Chairman, it is with some 
trepidation that I would now wish to just assist.  If – and 
again coming back to the point.  If one tries to attribute 
meaning to a document then one has to read it in context 
10 
in the whole. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no …[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:   To read that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that might be the reason why Mr 
Seleka wants us to go to the other clause. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   No, no, I understand that but that is the 
very point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   If you read the document as it stands 
there and you will read the same wording on the 6 July no 
20 
doubt.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   If you read it in context it is clear that 
the negotiation of the initial agreement is covered by 1.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No but let me get his interpretation 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 246 of 369 
 
first. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes but now – and just read the whole 
thing and then it is very clear that 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, but let me hear his version and 
then we can go further. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 deal with the 
implementation phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine, Mr Barry, I am 
saying for now I just want to hear it. 
10 
ADV BARRIE SC:   All I am saying is please – no, I am 
sorry, please just read the whole document …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Barrie, no Mr Barrie, no Barrie 
…[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:   In terms of the prescripts of law of law 
– [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] interrupting me, in 
terms of the prescripts of law regarding interpretation of 
written matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Barrie, no, no, no, Mr Barrie.  Mr 
Barrie please sit down. Please sit down.  I do not want to 
20 
happen 
again, 
Mr 
Barrie, 
it 
has 
happened 
before 
…[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair, chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am chairing here …[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE SC:   What I am saying is …[intervenes] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 247 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   When I say sit down, sit down.  Please. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Please just …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are continuing to speak, Mr Barrie. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
of the prescripts of law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Barrie, I said to you sit down. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Barrie, sit down.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not going to tolerate this anymore. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair, I stood up, I said with some 
trepidation [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, when I say sit down, sit down until I 
am finished what I am saying.  If you ask to speak after I 
have spoken, indicate that you would like to speak and if I 
permit you, you speak.  If I do not permit you do not speak. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   If you interrupt me should I just 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will interrupt you when you do not want 
to listen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Barrie, please sit down. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   As you – sorry? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will interrupt you when you do not want 
to listen to me. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   I thought that I was suggesting to you 
how [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sit down now, Mr Barrie.  Sit down Mr 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 248 of 369 
 
Barrie.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me hear your interpretation please. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  So the paragraph reads 
and I think the timing, if you look at 6 July 2015 it makes 
sense.  It says that: 
“That a negotiating team…” 
Then you have this addition: 
“…that will also serve as a steering committee be 
authorised under the Chairmanship of the Acting 
10 
Group Executive Technology and Commercial…” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To do certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not reading 1.4 now, you are 
reading the resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am reading the resolution which is 
also 1.4, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I wanted you to read 1.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the feedback report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As is because I understood you say my 
20 
interpretation of 1.4 or yours is different from mine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if you say it is different from mine 
because you read it together with something else that 
appears somewhere, that is fine. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 249 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you say it is different reading it as 
it is, then I want you to tell me what that interpretation is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Reading 1.4 as is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The interpretation is, Chair, the 
negotiating team, it is being authorised, the negotiating 
team, 
under 
the 
Chairmanship 
of 
the 
Acting 
Group 
Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, now you put acting whereas 
10 
1.4 does not have acting on page 829. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay, that is because – no, no, it 
does not matter, Chair, let me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us leave out acting for now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then we later on go to it if we need to 
go to it, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay, let me go to where the 
Chairperson is because it still reads the same even without 
the word acting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so it says: 
“That a negotiating team…” 
Because they are reproducing what was resolved by the 
BTC, that a negotiating team that will also serve as a 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 250 of 369 
 
steering 
committee 
for 
the 
Eskom’s 
Top 
Engineers 
consulting unit be authorised.  So the authorisation is to 
that negotiating team, under the Chairmanship of the 
Group Executive Technology and Commercial to do certain 
things, to develop, to negotiate and implement the above.  
So I know that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then just indicate what the difference is 
between my interpretation and yours. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  What the Chairperson was 
saying, 
was 
saying 
that 
when 
the 
negotiating 
team 
becomes the steering committee …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I was saying it could be different 
hats. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is right.  You were saying 
when it becomes, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you were saying – your interpretation 
does not  - does your interpretation contemplate that the 
negotiating team could wear different hats as steering 
20 
committee? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that, I agree with you on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But where we seem to have different 
interpretation, Chair, is on this.  My interpretation is the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 251 of 369 
 
steering committee, when the board, the BTC, makes this 
resolution, it gets to be authorised under the Chairmanship 
of the GE Commercial and Technology to develop and 
negotiate.  So it does not wait when it becomes a steering 
committee, it is already under the Chairmanship of the GE 
Commercial and Technology.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so what you are saying is, the 
Group Executive Technology and Commercial chairs the 
negotiating team and not necessarily chairs primarily the 
negotiating team but that negotiating team can also sit as 
10 
a steering committee and when it sits as a steering 
committee it is still chaired by the same person namely the 
Group Executive, is that what you are saying? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see, the second part is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That second part, Chair, is not here 
from the – from the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one of the Group Executive 
Technology 
and 
Commercial 
chairing 
the 
steering 
committee? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one you say that part is not 
here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is not clear, yes, from the reading 
…[intervenes] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 252 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
your 
interpretation 
that 
the 
negotiating team becomes – runs a steering committee, 
without the Group Executive, which has it when it is the 
Steering Committee? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No I am saying – I am just saying it is 
not clear from this Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says the negotiating team that will 
also serve ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
...as 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...for the development of the Top 
Engineers Consulting Unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...be authorised, so it seems to me 
that the reading of this paragraph could be made without 
reading - you could read it without, that will also serve.  
And when you do that, I think you come to what I am 
20 
saying.  It could read that a negotiating team be authorised 
under the Chairmanship of the Group Executive technology 
and commercial to develop, negotiate and implement.  You 
see what I am saying, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So, you are saying there 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 253 of 369 
 
are two possible interpretations maybe more than two and 
you choose a particular one.  The one is that the 
negotiating team exists without the Chairmanship of the 
Group Executive, in one scenario and in another scenario, 
it exists under the Chairmanship of the Group Executive 
technology and commercial. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the scenario, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say, this latter scenario is the 
one that you believe 1.4 is dealing with.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that you say the Group Executive 
technology and commercial is contemplated to be the 
person 
who 
is 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes 
is 
the 
Chairperson of the negotiators.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then where it says that will also 
serve as a steering committee for the development of 
Eskom’s Engineers Consulting Unit, you say that might be 
the negotiating team acting without the Group Executive 
chairing it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair because we can discern 
from this paragraph, who is contemplated as to be the 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay that may be one of these may 
be the correct interpretation, but now I understand it, and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 254 of 369 
 
then we say Acting Group Executive when we go to the 
resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay just now I understand it ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I think that interpretation is given 
credence by the fact that the BTC at the time since July 
2015, was opening a door for negotiations.  So it is saying, 
we are establishing this negotiating team under the 
Chairpersonship of Mr X.  This negotiating team in the 
future it will become a steering committee. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But now, it is established under the 
Chairmanship of Mr X. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright now I understand, okay 
continue, what do you put Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   And then, Mr Koko, you come back on the 20 t h 
of July 2015.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Now, 
you 
have 
said 
to 
the 
Chairperson, well, let me ask you, what do you do?  
20 
Because then you are, you are coming back to your 
position on the 20 t h of July 2015.  Mr Mabelane who was 
acting would give way to you. Did you assume your role as 
the GE Commercial and Technology? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 255 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you then much later in October, 
well, before we reach October, the feedback report says 
the negotiation started on 28 t h July 2015.  That is when 
you were back eight days ago.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is what the document says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, tell the Chairperson, insofar as 
that 
is 
concerned. 
 
Did 
you 
play 
any 
role 
in 
the 
negotiations?  
MR KOKO:   I played no role, zero.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You said no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Mr Mabelane report to you when you 
came back any activities in which he had been involved as 
Chairman of this committee, of this team or not? 
MR KOKO:  Chairman, you can be persuaded to adopt a 
particular position and you will be wrong, this is what 
happened.  The Board Tender Committee appointed a 
negotiating team, Mr Govender was the lead negotiator and 
he negotiated the contract, that is it.  I got back the 
outcome of the negotiating on the 6 t h of October, so on the 
3 r d of October - on the 3 r d of September, I wrote a note to a 
20 
couple of them asking for progress.  That is exactly what 
happened. The rest is gossips and people trying to – what 
has happened Chair is exactly that, the Board…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that may be what happened 
factually…[intervene] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 256 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   That is what happened factually. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what is written here on 1.4 is 
not…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   I have never had sight of what is happening in 
1.4 because I conveniently suspended myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I conveniently participated in a suspension 
scam so that I do not have sight of document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, but the document is reproduced 
10 
in your feedback report of October 2015, talking about 
negotiations that started on the 28 t h of July 2015.  
MR KOKO:   What is wrong with that Chair?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, you know, you say you distance 
yourself from this document, you would have had sight of it 
to reproduce what is there in your feedback report.  
MR KOKO:   No, I signed it, I cannot distance it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko let Mr Seleka finish first before 
you respond. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you signed it so you would have 
20 
had sight of the BTC Resolution that that we have just 
gone through. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, on your 6 t h of October. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So was there any handover report that 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 257 of 369 
 
Mr Mabelane gave to you when you came back? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there was in my view, a detailed 
discussion about the handover.  It was detailed enough for 
me to think that I need to go and talk to the Chairman 
hence the email I sent.  What Mr Mabelane did not give 
me, whether it may be an omission on his side and that is 
the part that you must put to him, I cannot speak for him, 
is to bring to my attention that there is a steering 
committee that I have to Chair.  Mr – and let me tell you 
Chair…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us get this out of the way.  There 
was no written handover report? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair there was no written handover 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright continue. 
MR KOKO:   But I need to, I need to continue Chair.  I can 
tell you now, in spite of what Mr Seleka wants you to 
believe, there were no steering committee, and he says his 
got minutes of it that were chaired by Mr Singh, I would 
like to have sight it, I know nothing of that sought.   
20 
I can tell you now and I do not think I am wrong. 
There were no steering committee on the McKinsey MSA.  
The steering committee that I know of, is the steering 
committee of business Act of the contract that I signed on 
the 29 t h of September, and the one on January 2016, on 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 258 of 369 
 
the MSA. 
I know of no other steering committee it is not 
common in Eskom who have steering committees during 
negotiations that are Chaired by the Group Executive, it is 
not there.  So I invite you to ask for Mr Seleka to let you 
have sight of the minutes that he says he has for that 
steering committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you are saying means if it is 
true, is that the negotiating team that negotiated was not 
composed in the manner in which paragraph 1.4 or the 
10 
resolution may have intended because as I understand it, 
Mr 
Govender 
led 
the 
negotiations 
and 
concluded 
everything. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct Chair and this is what you see 
on page 8.29.43, that is what you see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  
MR KOKO:    But Chair, I am really interested in this 
minutes of the steering committee, I want to see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Chair, may I tell 
Mr Koko I am not trying to persuade the Chairperson one 
way or the other.  I have put to you the version of Mr 
Singh, he has produced the minutes, he deals with the 
minutes in his affidavit, he Chaired that minute, it is not me 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 259 of 369 
 
who is producing that evidence it is him.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am still interested in those minutes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Chair, you will recall he testified 
before you now Mr Koko says there was no steering 
committee for the SLA.  
MR KOKO:    No, Chair there was a steering committee for 
the SLA that started in January 2016.  There was no 
minutes for the negotiations of the SLA in 2015.  No, there 
was no steering committee for the negotiations of the SLA 
in 2015. I know nothing of that sort, Mr Seleka says it is 
10 
there, there was a steering committee in 2015 and there 
were minutes.  I am simply saying, can I see them? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would like to see them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, sir do not misunderstand me.  The 
negotiating team is one thing, the steering committee I am 
talking about is in respect of the SLA, which is I have said 
Mr Anoj Singh was the Chairperson of and has produced 
the minutes.  He has said in his affidavit the dates – I 
mean stated the dates of the steering committee in regard 
to the MSA February, March, June, July and he mentioned 
20 
August as well.   
So that is the steering committee I am talking about 
if you understood me differently that is an incorrect 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the steering committee that is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 260 of 369 
 
related to what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the MSA Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the MSA? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, which is what is contemplated, I 
have said to the Chairperson, is that steering committee 
contemplated in this resolution we have been looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, may - there was no steering committee 
10 
in 2015 during the negotiations of the MSA, there was no 
such. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Chair, I am not even suggesting 
that because that is the negotiating team in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now let us get clarity on where 
there are difference is in terms of understanding.  The 
steering committee that Mr Seleka you say Mr Anoj Singh 
has testified about that relates to the MSA.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he say that sat for some months in 
20 
2016?  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Correct, 
Chair 
they 
started 
on…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not in 2015?] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 261 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, here we are talking about 
2015…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …in this resolution. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this resolution talks about the 
steering committee, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Firstly, the negotiating team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The negotiating team and it refers to a 
steering committee. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko says, there was no steering 
committee in 2015.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct?  
MR KOKO:   That is what I am saying, there was no 
steering committee in 2015 that was Chaired by or 
supposed 
to 
be 
Chaired 
by 
the 
Group 
Executive 
Technology and Commercial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so…[intervene] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am not saying anything different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying anything on this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did not say that. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 262 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay, so I think we are on 
the same - so the minutes of the steering committee that 
you were talking about are those minutes of meetings of 
the steering committee of that happened in 2016?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and Mr Koko, you say nothing about 
that, either or do you? 
MR KOKO:   No, no I agree, the was a steering committee 
in 2016 that started in January.  I participated in some of 
those. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   All I was correcting Chair, is a 
statement that there was no steering committee in respect 
of the SLA but I think Mr Koko has now clarified.  He is 
saying there was no steering committee in 2015, I am 
saying I never said there was one in 2015.  It was 
established 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
MSA 
but 
it 
started 
in…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, the fact what we must lose it is why we 
are here.  We are here because Ms Mothepu makes an 
allegation that I have changed the scope with respect to 
master services agreement and the order sales contract.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 263 of 369 
 
I have showed you the negotiating team, I have 
showed you the negotiating outcomes, I have showed you 
the delegations of authority.  I could not have done that 
purely on paper.  
And Ms Mothepu has told you and has given you 
nothing to support her allegations, other than to simply 
say, trust me, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, well let us take it 
step by step, Mr Koko because I think what you are trying -  
10 
what you are at pains to seek to show or say to the 
Chairperson, 
is 
that 
you 
were 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
negotiations for the MSA.  
MR KOKO:   I am not at pains Chair; I am simply taking 
you through the evidence.  I am simply taking you through 
the paperwork and I just want you to conclude not on what 
I am telling you, but on the evidence before you.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but you are telling the Chairperson 
that you were not involved in the negotiations.  
MR KOKO:   I am not saying Chairman all what I have told 
20 
you is to go to page 829, you will find the negotiating team 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No the answer Mr Koko is yes, that is 
what I am saying and it is supported by the documents, 
that is what you should say. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 264 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, okay Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, now, let us see, this emails that 
are amongst other people sent to yourself.  Let us turn to 
page still on Eskom bundle 14 Chairperson page 811.113. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what page again?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   811. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eight, zero, eleven? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eight, eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, eight, one, one? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, point one, one, three.  Now Mr 
Koko there is a couple of this emails and with patience, we 
will go through them and I would like you to explain to the 
Chairperson, what is going on there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you on that page? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I am there Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this is an email from the gentleman 
at McKinsey sent on Friday 24  July 2015.  You are certainly 
back from suspension and you are the first person to whom 
- whose email address appears on the email and you are 
20 
also the first person to whom the email is addressed.  
So the subject is draft LOI for Eskom Tops Program. 
Can you confirm that the top engineering program we have 
been talking about?  
MR KOKO:   Yes, I do.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 265 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is an attachment there, it says: 
“Dear Matshella, Edwin and Trish. 
Please 
find 
enclosed 
a 
draft 
for 
an 
LOI 
for 
immediate commencement of our work.  It has been 
aligned with our legal department, let me know what 
you think or put us directly in touch with your legal 
people.  
Have a good day. 
Lawrence.” 
Please tell the Chairperson what this is about? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have nothing to say about this Chair, 
the negotiating team that is dealing with it and the 
negotiating team leader is cooperating and he deals with it. 
I do not get involved in it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is the email includes 
you…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I cannot stop…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How would it include you if you were not 
involved? 
MR KOKO:   I cannot stop – I have never discussed with 
20 
Lawrence, two days after I came back to work.  He knows I 
am back cause it is published, so he sends me a note. I do 
not command him, I do not instruct him and I have never 
negotiated with him.  In my daily life as a Group Executive, 
people think I am that important and they send to me and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 266 of 369 
 
for me, for as long as the right person is involved who is 
allocated he is dealing with it, that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you by any chance respond to it? 
MR KOKO:   No, I did not.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not? 
MR KOKO:   No, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, now, Mr Koko can 
you - well, let me let me simply – let us look at the 
attachment because he said please find enclosed the draft 
10 
for an LOI for immediate commencement of our work. It has 
been 
aligned 
with 
our 
legal 
department. 
 
Now 
the 
attachment is on the next page, it is a draft letter which is 
intended to be addressed to McKinsey and specifically 
addressing Mr Saga.  Is it correct that this draft letter was 
a draft emanating from Eskom? 
MR KOKO:   I do not know, I have not – I have never seen 
this thing, I have not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it will help if you assist the 
Commission Mr Koko because you are the first person 
20 
addressed in this email. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, you see Chair this is the conspiracy and I 
know he is going to be upset and I am going to be upset to 
because my name is there I must know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if there is a letter that is addressed 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 267 of 369 
 
to you, one would expect you to know unless you say I 
have never…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   But why do you say this letter is attached to 
me, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it says Dear Matshella, Edwin and 
Trish. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is attached to three people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let me make sure that I – did you re 
receive it all as an email? 
MR KOKO:   No, I do not even remember this email. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But even if I have received it Chair let me tell 
you what happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   My PA would open my emails and action my 
items and my PA would have known that the Board has 
delegated Mr Govender to deal with this, so the right 
person will deal with this, so the right delegated person by 
the Board would deal with this, in fact…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you mean she or he would not even 
20 
let you see it and then get the instruction from you to pass 
it on to other people? 
MR KOKO:   She will do if she is unsure, if she is unsure 
she will ask.  If she is sure she knows it she will action it 
to the right person but there was no ambiguity or lack of 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 268 of 369 
 
clarity about who the Board delegated to deal with this and 
the fact that my name appears to it, on it should not - in 
fact the way Eskom works Chair it would be irregular for 
me to intervene and deal with issues that the Board have 
not delegated to me because then I could be accused of 
influence. 
It has happened many times so what I do when this 
thing comes I ask and you will see in some documents, 
who is delegated to deal with this, this one is so let him 
deal with it, I am not in getting involved.  I should not get 
10 
involved legally so, the Board has deemed it prudent a 
delegated person interferes, I should not interfere with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but it is very clear Mr Koko from 
the documentation we have gone through that Mr Edwin 
Mabelane was only delegated insofar as he was acting and 
for as long as he was acting.  Now you are back 20 July 
2015 this is four days later. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, when I take exception the 
Commission should be presented with Mr Mabelane’s 
evidence, Mr Mabelane must tell his version about what 
20 
was happening at the time because I cannot…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Seleka is entitled to say to you, 
to probe why it would be sent to you and you would not 
deal with it in circumstances where you are back at work, 
number one, number two the resolution contemplated that 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 269 of 369 
 
Mr Mabelane would only deal with it insofar as he was 
acting now he was not acting so one would expect that now 
that the incumbent was back, one would expect the 
incumbent would take over. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, this is where I am trying to assist 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I told you what factually happened not the 
hearsay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   The Board appointed a negotiating team, you 
saw the names of the negotiating people, you saw the 
names of the people who participated.  It is not a hearsay 
you saw them these were the people who were mandated 
by the Board to negotiate. 
The other people participated, they were also there.  
In that context I would have been - improper to interfere 
with the team, I would have been extremely improper for 
me to interfere with the team.  The Board has decided in 
its own prudence that these team of people must negotiate 
20 
this contract.   
So whatever comes to me I do not respond to it or I 
forward it or I leave it to the person who is in charge of 
that negotiating team.  I cannot stop people from sending 
me anything but when it comes to me, only this team that 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 270 of 369 
 
is approved by the Board must deal with it.  
If I interfere with the team, it would be improper.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, and the position is 
even made clearer in your feedback report, which you 
signed, you removed the word acting, and now you put GE 
Technology and Commercial.  
MR KOKO:   Is that Mr Seleka’s evidence that I have 
removed the word acting?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the people who drafted and 
10 
signed that document, the feedback report.  When I say 
you I am saying the collective. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, Mr Seleka just said you removed the 
acting, is it his evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he says he is not talking about 
you, as an individual says, the group of people who signed 
it, which includes you.  You know English says you, and 
the singular, you know. 
MR KOKO:   No, I need to know Mr Seleka is presenting 
his own evidence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he is suggesting to you that - as I 
understand what he is saying to you, that the people who 
signed that report are the authors of the report.  And when 
they wrote that report, they did not talk about an Acting 
Group Executive.  The fact that the resolution talks about 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 271 of 369 
 
an Acting Group Executive, so that is what he is saying. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, let me tell you why that is wrong.  
The Board delegates to a position not to an acting position. 
So it was not right from day one, that there was an acting 
position.  The resolution from day one on the 6 t h of July 
2015 should have said from day one, Group Executive, 
Technology and Commercial not acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not - I am not sure that you 
are right about that…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:    I am right, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko because when the position 
might remain the same, but the person could be permanent 
or acting, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you are wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no the person when he or she is not 
the permanently appointed person would be the acting, that 
is why if the President is out of the country, they will be an 
Acting President but the powers and the duties would 
usually be the same for both the incumbent and the acting 
person. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chairperson, Eskom delegations of authority 
never delegates to an Acting GM or an Acting CE.  
Delegations of Eskom delegates to a CE, I have been in 
Acting CE before, the delegation is to the CE.  The person 
in that office has got those powers. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 272 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The same powers? 
MR KOKO:   They have got the same powers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So it is unusual and improper for a resolution 
to read we delegate to an acting an Acting Group 
Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not sure how much it matters, 
because the fact of the matter is, the resolution says 
Acting Group Executive...[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   …rightly or wrongly. 
MR KOKO:   But that is why – let me tell you where it 
matters because now I am accused of changing it from 
acting to not acting.  It is an accusation, it is an allegation 
that I take exception to, if the resolution came in and said 
acting and then I would have said but why acting there is 
nothing like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the fact of the matter is, the 
resolution talks about Acting Group Executive. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The report, that report talks about Group 
Executive. 
MR KOKO:   Which is the correct way of doing it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the two are not the same. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but you cannot cast especially because I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 273 of 369 
 
have done the right thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess Mr Koko you have said 
what you want to say about this, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Mr Chair to the extent 
- well, Mr Koko to the extent you have said we should ask 
Mr Mabelane.  Chair let us go to page 702 in the same 
bundle point 60. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Seven, zero, two point six zero?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair.  So the affidavit 
start on page 702.38.  Now that is the affidavit of Mr Edwin 
10 
Pupane Mabelane, are you at the relevant page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at page 702.60. 
MR SELEKA SC:  That is right.  We will give Mr – paragraph 
1.3. Chairperson you see under the heading The McKinsey 
MSA Contract under paragraph 12 but we will give Mr Koko a 
chance to get there.  You – oh so you are at it.   
 
So there he deals with the McKinsey contract and I 
am skipping paragraph 12.1, 12.2 let us go to 12.3 
Chairperson he says: 
“When negotiations with McKinsey started Mr 
20 
Koko had returned from his suspension and 
my acting period had ended.  I handed over 
all commercial functions back to him and 
returned 
to 
Group 
Technology. 
 
The 
negotiations took place over a three month 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 274 of 369 
 
period and culminated in a submission to the 
Board Tender Committee for the approval of 
the 
negotiating 
outcome 
on 
22 
October 
2015.” 
And he goes on to talk about other things.  So Mr Koko you 
too – you went back into your position.  He handed over he 
says all commercial functions back. 
MR KOKO:  It is – it is not – it is common cause Chair that I 
came back on the 22 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 20t h not 20t h? 
10 
MR KOKO:  22n d – 20t h of July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And came into my position of Group Executive 
Technology and Technology and Commercial and assumed all 
the powers of the office.  It is common cause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  What he said in that paragraph Mr 
Seleka as well. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes I wanted to go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you wanted to continue.  Okay 
continue. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  I wanted to go there but he says the SO 
8t h October 
“Key to the approval was the format of the 
contract being a SMA instead of MEC as to 
the mandate.  The SMA format of contract 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 275 of 369 
 
was proposed by the Project team lead by 
Prish Govender and supported by Eskom 
internal legal department.  I was not directly 
involved 
with 
the 
preparations 
for 
an 
execution of the negotiations.  However I 
continued to interact with members of the 
negotiating team to provide clarity where 
required which included discussions with 
Eskom’s 
internal 
legal 
and 
compliance 
departments.” 
10 
 
So he -  you see that email that is also addressed to 
him as the second name there he is going to say he did not 
take part in the negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – before you – Mr Koko 
responds. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I note that in this paragraph Mr Mabelane 
does say the SLA format of contract was proposed by the 
project team led by Prish Govender. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
MR KOKO:  And that is what the board mandated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the – if the – if team there means the 
negotiation team. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it seems to support what Mr Koko 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 276 of 369 
 
was saying that Mr Prish Govender was leading that team. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I am saying factually that is what 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.   
MR KOKO:  That is... 
CHAIRPERSON:  So although- although Mr Mabelane says 
in the first line of paragraph 12.3 that when the negotiations 
with McKinsey started Mr Koko had returned from his 
suspension and his acting period had ended and he say he 
handed over all commercial functions back to him and to 
10 
Group Technology. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He does not in this paragraph say that Mr 
Koko then chaired or led that negotiating team.  He seems to 
say Mr Prish Govender was leading the team.   
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes, no that is – that is correct Chair.  The 
– the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may well be that Mr Mabelane needs to 
be asked about some of these matters in the light of Mr 
Koko’s evidence. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Specifically the – well because we can see 
from the – from the resolution and the feedback report or 
from the feedback report that Mr Prish Govender is already 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 277 of 369 
 
identified as leading the team.  But over and above that you 
have that 1.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Which says under the chairmanship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Of the (speaking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that must be raised with Mr 
Mabelane and whoever else. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see whether they say the factual 
10 
situation is different from the factual situation that Mr Koko… 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Testifies about. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  Chair you still have that Eskom 
Bundle 14 in front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Shall we then go to page 811.119.  .119. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So Mr Koko this is an email again from the 
McKinsey official Dr Alexander Weiss or Weiss Wednesday 
20 
29 July 2015 it is a – the email is addressed to Ngagema at 
Eskom a couple of people are copied there but you are also 
there.  And the subject line is Workshop with Matshela 
Monday afternoon.  And it reads: 
“Hi Thando hope this email finds you well.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 278 of 369 
 
Christina and I today in the morning saw 
Matshela.  Over the discussion Matshela 
suggested to have a workshop on Medupi 
Monday afternoon where he suggested to 
also invite Abram.  Let Matshela and you talk 
and what would be a suitable starting time 
for this workshop?  I will align the troops on 
our side.  Many thanks all the best.” 
Could you explain to the Chairperson what is this about Mr 
Koko? 
10 
MR KOKO:  No Chair.  This is quite a very simple …his is 
quite a very simple .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well I was going to say Mr Seleka is 
your understanding that the workshop related to the matters 
of the negotiating team? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That the issues Chair which were 
being discussed regarding the workshop related to matters of 
the MSA.  So he can… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Clarify it. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Ja Chair I think it – this is what happens when 
you try to connect the dots.  So first you must understand 
that McKinsey has been in Eskom since 2011 – 2007 and 
McKinsey has been working in my affidavit says that has 
been working on the … 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 279 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  A number of matters. 
MR KOKO:  A number of matters.  McKinsey was employed 
at Medupi and Kusile by Group Capital.  So I do not know 
why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say this is not necessarily connected. 
MR KOKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With… 
MR KOKO:  I do not know why Mr Seleka tries to connect 
these dots.  But here is the relevance.  There is the most 
important point. This workshop in fact I think I phoned – I 
10 
may have phoned McKinsey to initiate this and they came to 
see me.  Because it was after the meeting of the 22n d of July 
where the board has endorsed the design to cost strategy 
and you will see part of the scope of work on the 100 – on 
the business plan agreement is Medupi and Kusile costs – 
what we call them?  Cost estimate – the final cost estimates.  
Because we are going to put a business plan now it became 
very important what would be the final number of Medupi and 
Kusile.  And I think I may have called McKinsey saying we 
need to know because you guys are working at Medupi the 
20 
Medupi – McKinsey was resident on McKinsey – on Medupi 
and Kusile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Medupi. 
MR KOKO:  They were based there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 280 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  So I say it is – we need – I will bring my 
engineering team and preferably on the Saturday because I 
will not find time 00:09:34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the week. 
MR KOKO:  Ja let us workshop this thing and get the final 
cost of Medupi and Kusile because the cost as they stand 
now cannot be accommodated in the NERSA determination.  
They cannot be so we need a very deep cut in costs and we 
need the right people on site to workshop what we cut at 
Medupi and Kusile. And that can only happen if the top 
10 
engineers and the McKinsey team that has always been on 
site since 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So Mr Koko you are 
saying to the Chairperson that the issue regarding Medupi 
did not relate to the MSA? 
MR KOKO:  This issue did not relate to the MSA.   
MR SELEKA SC:  This issue? 
MR KOKO:  This issue did not relate to the MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says this workshop did not relate to the 
20 
matters that were being dealt with by the negotiation team. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it did – it related to Medupi. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I put it correct Mr Koko? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 281 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Was there an issue regarding Medupi 
that would have fallen under the MSA? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay which one is that? 
MR KOKO:  Yes because what – what is in the MSA was 
claims management.  The Eskom claims were running away.  
So part of the scope of the MSA is claims management.  How 
do we remove -  reduce… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is claims against Eskom? 
MR KOKO:  The claims against Eskom on Medupi and 
Kusile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  They were horrendous and those were part of 
the MSA.  They were there.  But this workshop here on 
Medupi and Kusile was meant to fit into the business plan in 
February 2016 that was meant to be designed to cost 
strategy.  But the guys were there we did not have to employ 
them.  They were employed already.  They had a running 
20 
contract.   
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So the emails on page 811 the 
following pages basically.  811.120 and 811.121 you will give 
the same response? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 282 of 369 
 
MR SELEKA SC:  That this does not relate to the MSA? 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  He is connecting the dots very wrongly.  It 
is a bad connection of the dots.   
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Now let me get your response to 
this – on page 811.125 or – no let me go page by page.  Let 
me go page by page.  Page 811.122.  Can you explain to us 
what is this email about? 
MR KOKO:  I do not remember this email and I can tell you 
now I do not think this meeting took place.  
MR SELEKA SC:  It says update on the negotiations. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Update on the negotiations yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  So this one you do not remember? 
MR KOKO:  No, no I am saying to you that even if I 
remember for your sake I would not have had this meeting.   
MR SELEKA SC:  This is a meeting request.   
MR KOKO:  This is a meeting request. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Is it because it relates to the MSA 
negotiations? 
MR KOKO:  No, no, no I do not – I would have used an 
offensive term but I will not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko is the document or – at page 
811.123 an attachment to the one at page 811.122? 
MR KOKO:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Mr Seleka whoever can assist? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Chair. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 283 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The document at page 811.123 was it an 
attachment to the document at page 811.122? 
MR SELEKA SC:  No Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No okay.  Alright.  So the update on the 
negotiations that was said to be attached. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Attachment where is it? 
MR SELEKA SC:  No Mr Koko says it is a meeting request.  
Is it a meeting request? 
MR KOKO:  This would be a meeting request and I would not 
10 
take the – such a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Seleka you referred us to that email 
is the position that the update is not – was not – is not 
available?  The update on the negotiations.  You see that 
document. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Oh there… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 881.122. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Says 
attachments 
update 
on 
the 
negotiations.  And I was trying to see where – where is that 
20 
update on the negotiations. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Oh.  The investigator says it will be at – a 
calendar – because it is a meeting request it will be a 
calendar with the date for the meeting indicator Chair.  I do 
not think they have printed it out here.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 284 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR KOKO:  Chair not necessarily.  Not necessarily because 
this – I do not even see the – where is attachment? 
MR SELEKA SC:  Where is what? 
MR KOKO:  Where is attachment on this email? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what I have been putting. 
MR SELEKA SC:  That is what the Chairperson is asking we 
do not have the attachment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  No I cannot comment on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I cannot – I just cannot comment on this. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But Chair I was asking Mr Koko is it 
because this is an update on negotiations in regard to the 
MSA. 
MR KOKO:  Ja but Chair I am saying to you I would not take 
an update on anybody about negotiations that the board has 
delegated to somebody else and are led to somebody else.  I 
20 
would not do that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay so the answer to my question is yes. 
MR KOKO:  Yes to what? 
MR SELEKA SC:  That this is negotiations on the MSA? 
MR KOKO:  I do not know. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 285 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think he says he does not know 
because … 
MR KOKO:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the document is not even there. 
MR KOKO:  I do not even have the attachment. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair he says he will not take an 
update but from the person. 
MR KOKO:  No Mr Seleka is being unreasonable.  He must 
put the update – the attachment to the document.  Let me 
look at the document.  On the basis of the total package I 
10 
can try to jog my memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  You cannot give me half stories and try to zoom 
in 00:17:09 in saying (inaudible) then I must be able to 
comment.  Give me the whole inside documents then I can 
comment.  This is not an inside document.  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no the – the attachment is not 
there that is for sure. 
MR SELEKA SC:  We will find it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR SELEKA SC:  My investigator is here he will print it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Let us go to the next page.  811.123.  
It is another email from a McKinsey official.  Wednesday 12, 
August 2015.  Okay that is the same date as the previous 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 286 of 369 
 
email the time is at 14:50 it is addressed to you directly.  
The subject line is For your perusal – for your personal use 
only.   
“Strategy online for 10 for 10 program.  Fine 
Matshela as discussed please find enclosed 
the preliminary slides for the turnaround 
strategy.  Please keep this confidential.  
Lawrence.” 
So explain to the Chairperson what is this email? 
MR KOKO:  You know Chair you know I am – it is really 
10 
frustrating to see how things get twisted.  So I have .. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Chair – sorry can I ask who is twisting 
what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Who is twisting what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko who is twisting what? 
MR KOKO:  This information is being twisted for the purpose 
of this commission Chair.  I cannot be intimidated by Mr 
Seleka.  I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
20 
MR KOKO:  This information is being twisted for the purpose 
of this commission and Mr Seleka is not going to intimidate 
me.  I will not allow him to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Mr Koko.  Mr Koko Mr Seleka is 
entitled to say when you say this information is twisted. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 287 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  No but he is being intimidating me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
MR KOKO:  All along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
MR KOKO:  I will not tolerate that Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Mr Koko no, no, no.  Mr Seleka has 
not intimidated you. You said – he asked you a question 
about this document.  You said this document or information 
is being twisted.  He was entitled to want to find out what is 
being twisted and who is twisting it? 
10 
MR KOKO:  Chair let me explain to you why I said this 
information is being twisted.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but clarify first who is – who do 
you say is twisting it? 
MR KOKO:  I am going to explain to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Why this information is being twisted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is twisting it? 
MR KOKO:  I am going to explain to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:  So Chairman McKinsey has been in Eskom since 
2007. McKinsey has got – had developed a program for us 
for what we call a Top Engineers Program.  We had close to 
30 of them on the job.  They worked under the tutelage of 
McKinsey.  They were permanently at Eskom.  They had a 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 288 of 369 
 
permanent office.  Lawrence was a team leader for McKinsey 
for the Top Engineers full time and they will write strategy 
documents for me with the Top Engineers and this one will 
be one of it.  This will be a strategy document that the Top 
Engineers and McKinsey sit with me and we say what is the 
landscape at Eskom?  What is going on in Eskom?  Where 
are the levers?  How do we fix Eskom done?  It will be done 
together with the Top Engineers.  This had nothing to do with 
the MSA.  It had everything to do with the Top consulting 
Engineers that sat on the second floor that met every day.  I 
10 
met them every Tuesday.  And every Tuesday they will take 
me through the strategy documents between McKinsey and 
Eskom.  Now that is the twisting I am talking about.  That 
simple – I mean the first thing is – was McKinsey at Medupi 
and Kusile.  You twisted to say – to want to link with MSA.  
Now you have got Top Consulting Engineers document and 
program you want to twist it and force it to – to MSA.  It 
cannot be right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But who are you saying is twisting it? 
MR KOKO:  Mr Seleka is doing it.  This is Mr Seleka putting 
20 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How – how is he doing it? 
MR KOKO:  Because he is taking a document that has 
nothing to do with the MSA – with the MSA and he trying to 
force it on the MSA.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 289 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Koko you must understand Mr 
Seleka’s role.  Mr Seleka is the evidence leader.  He was not 
at Eskom.  He was not employed at Eskom.  He does not 
have personal knowledge of how things happened at Eskom.  
He is – he relies on what information is given to the 
commission.  When he relies on that and you give evidence 
he is entitled to probe what you say and he is doing nothing 
more than probing.  You are entitled to say you remember 
when he was taking objection – exception when you said he 
was mistaken and I said I did not see anything wrong with 
10 
that.  You are entitled to say you are mistaken in connecting 
these two. This is the position because you know what the 
position was and he is giving you a chance to say to her 
what you know.  That is the position.  He is not trying to twist 
anything but he is just entitled to test whether it could be 
that this information means a or it could mean b without 
necessarily saying a is correct or b is correct but to test 
what you say. 
MR KOKO:  Chairman there was McKinsey at Eskom before 
the MSA.  There was a McKinsey at Eskom before MSA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  People are feeding Mr Seleka with documents 
that come before the PFMA – MSA and they are trying to 
force 
them 
on 
the 
MSA. 
 
Alternatively 
Mr 
Seleka’s 
investigator going into my former emails and looking for 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 290 of 369 
 
anything that is McKinsey and trying to force it and twist it – 
I will repeat twist it into MSA.  It is not acceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Seleka. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  As far as I remember 
Chair I gave Mr Koko the opportunity to explain the email I 
did not put any version to it.  But Mr Koko the – this email 
has an attachment for turnaround strategy please keep this 
confidential. And the document follows after that on the next 
page.  The document is titled Eskom Turnaround changing 
the game.  Discussion document 3 August 2015.  There is an 
10 
executive summary there.  And I would like you to explain 
because I see some of the issues they discussed the second 
– it says: 
“Eskom’s proposed path – path forward as 
understood 
from 
the 
recent 
management 
discussion is untenable.  The forecast growth 
in operating primary and capital costs create 
a funding hole of R2.23 trillion over the next 
fifteen years with the approved tariff project 
fee of 8% per annum.” 
20 
Then you have the next bullet point which says: 
“It is time for a more creative response one 
that delivers a long term sustainable tariff 
project fee of 10% per annum in line with 
00:25:00 and reinstates Eskom as a catalyst 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 291 of 369 
 
for growth and not a stumbling block to it.  
Four pillars are necessary to deliver.  This 
design to cost led turnaround (the cost 
reflective tariffs led approach).” 
And then you have the sub-bullet points there. 
“Generation excellence, 00:25:36 rocks no 
excuses 
new 
built 
and 
capital 
delivery, 
delivery of Kusile, Medupi, Ngula with P50 
targets (including claims management).” 
Are you saying to the Chairperson this turnaround strategy 
10 
as they refer to does not relate to the MSA? 
MR KOKO:  No Chair.  Chair I am going to ask – I am really 
going to beg you.  I am really, really going to beg you.  
There was a McKinsey before Eskom – before MSA.  It 
worked with the Top Engineers.  This is the scope of the Top 
Engineers.  McKinsey was a resident in that office.  I am 
going to ask you Eskom in their own – when they were on 
the real hunt they went to tell people that there was no such 
a thing called the Top Engineers.  It never existed.  The poor 
engineers were crying, coming to me and crying.  They says 
20 
we were sitting in front of the Chairman who was telling the 
media we do not exist.  I am going to ask you Chair to go 
back to Eskom and ask for an affidavit from the Top 
Engineers.  They are there.  And this is the scope document 
that they have reported – it was their job.  Some of them 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 292 of 369 
 
were sitting at Petro SA we seconded them to Petro SA to 
play a similar turnaround work of Petro SA.  Mr Seleka 
knows this has nothing to do with MSA.   
MR SELEKA SC:  Did you just attribute some knowledge on 
my part there? 
MR KOKO:  I beg your pardon. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Did you just attribute knowledge on my 
part? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think I heard anything like that. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I have answered the question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Is he not saying Mr Seleka knows? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I did not hear that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Oh.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  Because you McKinsey 
has spoken about a turnaround program which relates to the 
MSA in their affidavits before the commission.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what… 
MR KOKO:  It makes sense Chair.  It will make sense Chair 
why McKinsey will do that. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Because what we were trying to do into the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 293 of 369 
 
future was to bring the Top Engineers and McKinsey and 
blend them and have one program. It would make perfect 
sense so the – the turnaround in the scope that was 
envisaged in the MSA into the future.  It makes sense to talk 
about turnaround.  There is no other way it can because all 
that we are doing was to turnaround Eskom. 
MR SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Chairperson I thought you wanted 
to give some indication of when we should stop? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we can still go on.  I know Mr Koko 
said we can go into the midnight.  So I think we can go on.  
10 
We might just need to take a ten minutes break.  You know 
after every two hours it might not be a bad idea to take a 
short break.  As far as I am concerned we can after the 
break go on and then we can review the situation at eight or 
thereabout.  I know that when I say that I must be alive to 
the fact that you have been standing from morning.  So you 
are – you are free to indicate when you – when continuing 
beyond a certain time would be unfair to you because you 
are the only one standing.  Is that alright? 
MR SELEKA SC:  That is fine Chair.  That is fine.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SELEKA SC:  I am more – I am more worried about the 
support staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well. The commission support staff 
they – they – I mean we do beyond six quite often but if 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 294 of 369 
 
there has been a problem whenever we have gone beyond 
six o’clock as far as the support staff is concerned but it has 
not been brought to my attention then it should be brought to 
my attention.  So if there is a problem maybe it could be 
brought to my attention during adjournment but I do want to 
say as I normally say I very much appreciate everybody’s 
cooperation with regard to these evening sessions.  I know 
that it may be quite inconvenient but I think the support that 
everybody gives is based on the realisation that nobody 
would be wanting to work during the day and in the evening 
10 
unless it was really necessary and we are trying to make the 
best we can of the time available.  So we will take that – a 
short adjournment. If there will be a problem if we go up to 
eight and review the situation at eight in terms of the support 
staff let me be 00:01:21 during the adjournment.   
MR SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will take a ten minutes 
adjournment.  Well it is about twelve minutes – thirteen 
minutes past six let us resume at twenty five past. 
MR KOKO:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  I would like...  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 295 of 369 
 
Mr Koko, ask you to go to page – the same bundle, page 
702.  So we are going back to Mr Mabelane’ s affidavit.  
702.58.   
MR KOKO:   Seven, o... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   702. 
CHAIRPERSON:   702.158? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   58. 
CHAIRPERSON:   58? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, Mr Koko, I think this relates to 
the answer you gave about McKinsey being present there 
10 
in regard to the Top Engineers Programme.   
[Break in recording] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...158? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   58. 
CHAIRPERSON:   58? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But..  Well, Mr Koko, I think this 
relates to the answer you gave about McKinsey being 
present there in regard to the Top Engineers Programme 
before 
2015. 
 
 
Mr 
Mabelane 
here 
deals 
with 
the 
background, 
the 
McKinsey 
involvement 
with 
the 
Top 
20 
Engineers Programme.  He talks about it from 2010, 2011.   
 
In 
2011, 
he 
then 
appointed 
as 
the 
Senior 
General Manager, motivated for McKinsey retention to 
assist the outreach management function.  Then it goes to 
11.5.  11.5 says: 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 296 of 369 
 
“The training programme named Top Engineers 
Programme stated in earnest in February 2013 
and 
was 
housed 
in 
the 
Engineering 
Department 
of 
the 
Group 
Technology 
Division...” 
 
Now I am going to read only those portions that I 
wish you to comment on.  And then 11.6, and you are 
welcome to go to more than – beyond what I am reading.  
11.6 then reads: 
“During the 2014 financial year, Eskom was 
10 
experiencing cost challenges and restrictions 
on the use of consultants came into effect. 
I believe this was also in response to Treasury 
instruction note 2013/2014 and the Business 
Productivity Programme was implemented in 
response to a lower tariff determination and to 
fulfil a condition for governance, the whole 
package. 
The Top Engineers Programme stopped due to 
drying up of consulting work from McKinsey 
20 
and 
a 
team 
working 
with 
the 
Divisional 
Executive 
secured 
an 
Exco 
approval 
for 
Business 
Case 
for 
the 
creation 
for 
a 
permanent Top Engineers Programme that will 
help to deliver and accelerate critical business 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 297 of 369 
 
projects for Eskom whilst reducing reliance on 
external 
consultants 
and 
continue 
the 
development of top engineers beyond the 
foundational year currently on the offer in 
March 2014...” 
 
Then 11.7 says: 
“Although both approvals were granted, they 
could not be implemented due to funding 
challenges. 
The Engineering Department did not have the 
10 
adequate manpower budget to absorb the top 
engineers and Group Technology did not have 
funds to implement the required Top Engineers 
Programme. 
All attempts to secure funding proved fruitless 
as Eskom was itself faced with challenges. 
The top engineers were deployed to support 
individual 
executives 
in 
their 
day 
to 
day 
functions as well as supporting the CFO, the 
then FD on the business activity. 
20 
These undertakings were executed without 
McKinsey’s support...” 
 
11.8 says: 
“Various funding avenues were explored for 
almost eight months until the proposal for the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 298 of 369 
 
master services agreement was developed and 
supported by the newly appointed acting CE, 
Mr Brian Molefe. 
At the time, I had undertaken custodianship of 
the programme as my role as acting Group 
Executive, Group Technology and Commercial. 
The team of McKinsey introduced me to the 
various unsolicited proposals that have been 
shared 
with 
various 
stakeholders 
and 
in 
particular Mr Koko...” 
10 
 
Now, having read this, I want, this time around, 
to put what I think I see from these paragraphs and then 
you can comment.  One is that, there was a point when 
McKinsey’s involvement came to an end because there was 
no funding for its involvement.  And this, it would appear to 
have been during 2014.  Let me stop there and hear what 
you have to say.   
MR KOKO:   That is false, Chair.  That is definitely false.  
McKinsey was involved at Medupi and Kosile for certain.  
What is true is that the scope of McKinsey shrunk 
20 
significantly at Eskom in 2014.  But it is false to say 
McKinsey’s work came to a stop at Eskom in 2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when Mr Mabelane says the 
undertakings were executed without McKinsey’s support, 
now how do you understand that statement? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 299 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  So.  And this is one thing that makes me 
proud Chair and I am not credited for it and I get criticised 
for it.  When I started with the Top Engineers Programme, I 
wanted to have hundred top engineers and when we – the 
ten top is a descriptive term.  It is not a arbitrary term.  We 
had in my group 3 000 engineers and I wanted the very top 
and the top was not defined at that point.  We would even 
go back to the highest school and keep the aggregate(?) of 
the highest school matric.  And I had a simple rule.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in order to arrive at the 
10 
understanding whether a particular individual could be 
classified as top? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  And everybody will tell you, including 
McKinsey, I had simple one – I had one mandate for 
McKinsey.  I said to McKinsey, I want you to create a 
McKinsey in Eskom and you walk away.  That was my 
objective.  And I had a discussion to the highest people at 
McKinsey that you are going to do the recruitment of the 
20 
top engineers for me.   
 
I have got a pool of engineers and this pool of 
engineers you are going to recruit them as if they are 
going to work for McKinsey.  You are going to train them as 
if they work for McKinsey.  And I want to see them 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 300 of 369 
 
performing at the same level as McKinsey.  Therefore, 
Chairman, I must declare upfront.  I had a lot of admiration 
for McKinsey.   
 
If somebody go sits and tells you that, then you 
must know it is true.  I had a lot of admiration for 
individuals at McKinsey.  So I wanted to produce(?) 
McKinsey and I had a number.  I said I want to have a 
hundred top engineers.  We later changed them to top 
consulting – top consultants that will do the work.   
 
I think we had close to 30, just over 30 when the 
10 
National Treasury Practice Note came in that we talked 
about that discouraged the work of McKinsey and the 
McKinsey work dropped.  Now it dropped at the right time 
Chair because I had 13 McKinsey people that are Eskom 
people, if you know what I mean. 
 
And it are these people that Mr Mabelane is 
talking about, that when the McKinsey numbers dropped, 
we had 30 people.  And let me tell you Chair.  And one of 
the pains I had is parting contract with those young men 
and women because they are the ones who had the 
20 
brainpower to tell me and advise me what to do to stop 
load-shedding and Mr Molefe. 
 
So Mr Mabelane is right when he says work 
continued with Eskom’s Top Consulting Programme but he 
is not correct to say there was no McKinsey footprint in 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 301 of 369 
 
Eskom because they were there at Medupi, they were there 
at Kusile.   
 
And 
when 
we 
funded 
the 
Top 
Engineers 
Programme, is that we had said to McKinsey we are going 
to give you a contract to work at Medupi and Kusile and in 
return we had what we call an SDNL(?) obligation to train 
us for the Top Engineers Programme but we will not pay 
you for that.  We will only pay for – if you take these top 
engineers, we will take them to Lufthansa, for example, we 
will pay for that because you are training them. 
10 
 
If you take these top engineers – so what – the 
agreement we had with McKinsey is that, if you get jobs in 
other state-owned companies as part of the training, these 
top engineers will be part of your call to go and work there.  
So it worked well. 
 
And I am ...[indistinct] Mr Mabelane raised it 
here.  Did they do – they did the work.  I wanted hundred.  
But he is not correct to say there was no footprint of 
McKinsey at Eskom.  And every time there is a footprint of 
McKinsey at Eskom, it ties into the top engineers because 
20 
the understanding was, you do not work on your own.   
 
You work with the top engineers and we want to 
increase from – I mean, we started from zero, we had 30 
and we wanted to take it to a hundred.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then in paragraph 11.8, he 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 302 of 369 
 
carries on to say: 
“Various avenues were explored for almost 
eight months until the proposal for the master 
services 
agreement 
was 
developed 
and 
supported by the newly appointed acting CE, 
Mr Brian Molefe...” 
 
Ja, let me stop there.  In that paragraph: 
“The team from McKinsey introduced me to the 
various unsolicited proposals that have been 
shared 
with 
various 
stakeholders 
and 
in 
10 
particular Mr Koko...” 
 
Your comment on that paragraph? 
MR KOKO:   I can confirm that I had various proposals 
form McKinsey.  I can confirm that.  I can also confirm to 
you that the intervention by National Treasury on the use 
of consultants was having the desired effect because you 
see here now, we are struggling to increase the scope of 
McKinsey.   
 
And the only reason we were struggling is 
because we complying to that practice note of National 
20 
Treasury.  So Mr Mabelane is right when he says the 
various funding models, avenues were then explored to 
deal with the requirements of National Treasury.   
 
But here is what is interesting Chair, and I do 
not know why many people will miss it.  If I was captured 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 303 of 369 
 
and doing the bidding for McKinsey who would later come 
with Trillian.  At this point, it is when I get suspended.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this roundabout 11 March? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of 2015? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR KOKO:   And this is the part I am saying, we should 
stop 
connecting 
the 
dots 
and 
look 
at 
exactly 
what 
happened.  McKinsey – Mr Mabelane replaced me in my 
10 
office. 
 
Then 
McKinsey 
continued 
working 
with 
Mr Mabelane and says we – the man that is suspended, 
this is what we were discussing with him. 
 
So if I was part of this ploy.  Remember, I gave 
the board an opportunity to not suspend me on the 
11 t h of March in the evening when I fought back.  They 
would have said but this is our man.  Leave him to do our 
bidding for us.  Leave him to get McKinsey for us.  The 
evidence just does not tie up Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Koko, we are talking about that 
20 
but we know that you were the only executive that came 
back at Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I did not bring myself back.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   It is the board members who brought me back.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 304 of 369 
 
They have to be held to account. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I think they were irrational to suspend me in 
the first place and give Mr Govender who ran Generations 
for seven years and run it into the ground and they left him 
there.  They left Mr Tshokolo there who was running 
General to the ground.  And when for somebody who has 
nothing to do with Generation.  I think they were irrational 
from day one.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I wanted to complete by saying, 
10 
which turn of events happens to be – I do not know 
whether it happens to be or turned out to be, according to 
the evidence of Ms Daniels in regard to the meeting of the 
10 t h of March 2015.  That is what I wanted to complete 
there and ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am glad Mr Seleka has brought this 
topic again. It is one of the topics I wanted to tell – I told 
my counsel that if it does not come, we must raise it.  I say 
the fascination in the committee about the balcony at 
Melrose Arch. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   It is such a fascination.  Chair, and here I am 
going to get(?) you and I will be very disappointed if you 
say no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 305 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   But I am going to ask you to go to 
Ms Goodson’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, mister ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know, we are going to put that 
version to Mr Masango.   
MR KOKO:   Mr Barrie, if you can go to mister – if you can 
help me with Ms Goodson’s affidavit, please?  18.3.  The 
paragraph 18.3. 
ADV BARRIE:   [No audible reply]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And what I want to tell you Chair is this. 
ADV BARRIE:   [Indistinct]  
MR KOKO:   The Commission, and I do not think I am 
wrong, is labouring on the basis that Mr Masango went to 
Melrose Arch once. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is what he said. 
MR KOKO:   That...  Yes, that is what I told him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   So when you are taking pictures on 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV BARRIE:   Ja, I see just – I am just looking at the 
index.  I see Ms Goodson’s affidavit at page 423 of Bundle 
14 but I have electronic numbering.  So I have difficulty 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 306 of 369 
 
getting this.  But I think Mr Koko ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV BARRIE:   ...asks for a...  reference to this affidavit. 
[Speaker not clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Well, maybe Mr Koko you 
can tell me first what it says, the part that you want to take 
us through. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  So when you ask Mr Masango – when 
Mr Seleka asked Mr Masango:  Did you meet – did you go – 
did you ever go back to Melrose Arch?  He says:  I cannot 
10 
remember.  And that is what she(?) says.  When Mr Seleka 
asked him again:  Have you ever met Mr Essa again?  He 
says:  Mr Koko tried to asked me to go and meet him and I 
refused.  And I do not know if my other colleagues but I 
refused.   
 
That is his – that is what is in the transcripts.  
What I want to show you here is that the evidence of Ms 
Goodson says in December 2015 Mr Essa introduced her to 
Mr Masango in her office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do recall that there is a witness and it 
20 
may well be that it is Ms Goodson who says in his or her 
affidavit that, if I recall correctly, he found Mr Masango in 
Mr Salim Essa’s office or Trillian’s office ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   That is Ms Goodson 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I know that there is such 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 307 of 369 
 
evidence and it caught my attention because Mr Masango, 
as far as I could recall, had said he had never been... 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He had never gone there. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I need you to go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There will be a need to put that to him 
and test it. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So either Ms Goodson is not telling the truth 
or Mr Masango is not telling the truth but both of them 
cannot be right.  But in the event that Ms Goodson is 
telling you the truth.  You do not need to send people to 
Melrose Arch to take pictures.  You can even do that on 
Google 
Map. 
 
But 
Mr 
Masango 
has 
been 
there 
in 
December.  So he will know there is a balcony.  And that 
balcony had nothing to do with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was not that December 15? 
20 
MR KOKO:   It was December 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   So why would you not remember?  If you were 
there on December 15, you will know there is a balcony...  
Yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 308 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Well, he said...  No, he said 
when he testified here he said when he was going to the 
meeting with you, because he had said you had called him, 
he said when he was close, you – he saw you on the 
balcony and he was talking to you over the phone. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, he probably saw Salim.  We were going to 
visit Salim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   He probably saw Salim on the balcony when 
he went to visit Salim. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So what I am saying is.  He did say 
that – he did talk about the balcony when he gave evidence 
here.  He was talking about the balcony in relation to the 
10 t h of March.   
MR KOKO:   Ja, but I am saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I am saying Chair.  All what he had to do was 
to be at Melrose Arch to see the balcony.  And according to 
his version – according to Ms Goodson’s version, he has 
been to Salim Essa’s office on the 10 t h of December.  So 
20 
he will know there is a balcony. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No.  But if Ms Goodson is talking about 
December 2015, when she, according to her version, met 
Mr Masango in Mr Salim Essa’s office at Melrose Arch.  
December 2015 happened after March.  So he could not 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 309 of 369 
 
say...  If Ms Goodson was saying:  Actually, December 
2014 I had met him there.  And then Mr Masango gave 
evidence as if on the 10 t h of March 2015 it was the first 
time, then I would understand what you are saying. 
MR KOKO:   But Chairman maybe I am not explaining 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Let me be direct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Masango is recreating an event.  And the 
10 
balcony story, he did not see it on the 10 t h because he was 
not there on the 10 t h.  He saw it on the other day and the 
only other day I can point to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...is December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  But...  Ja.  
Mr Koko, I hope you can deal with the issues that pertain 
to yourself.   
MR KOKO:   I am dealing with the issues that pertain to 
20 
myself but I am showing you the type of witnesses you are 
dealing with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja because ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   The implicating. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because we can address the version 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 310 of 369 
 
they have to answer to them. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko is right ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to point out...  Mr Koko.   
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko is right to point out what, in his 
view, 
maybe 
inconsistent 
or 
are 
in 
conflict 
with 
10 
Mr Masango’s evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he is right to say:  This witness said 
to you he only went to Mr Salim Essa’s office or to Melrose 
Arch on the 10 t h and he never went back there.  So if 
Mr Koko gets to know that another witness says she met 
him in that same office in December 2015, he is right to 
raise that, to say:  This person is not telling the truth when 
he says he never went back to Mr Salim Essa’s office.  
Okay ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, may I just ... just for purposes of the 
record to refer to the relevant page in this bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to what? 
ADV BARRIE:   In regard to what Mr Koko has just testified 
so that you just have it in the same place in the record. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 311 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I know it.  I do not need...  As I 
have said, I have read it and I have noticed it.  I will know 
how – where to find it.  It is fine. 
ADV BARRIE:   Very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Before I forget 
Chair.  We printed out what is the calendar attachment to 
that email that Mr Koko was saying is a meeting invite.  So 
what you see there, the attachment, it is like a calendar 
with a highlighted date.  And if I can hand it up? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, have you got a copy for everybody? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Copies for everybody? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat, what is this again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This was an email on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it an attachment to the email that had 
not attachment that we referred to earlier where the 
20 
subject was:  Update on Negotiations? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson.  That is what it 
is.  
MR KOKO:   And Chair, and this is the part that I said is 
the ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 312 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Request for a meeting? 
MR KOKO:   Is a request for a meeting.  And I feel 
disadvantaged because this is a type of thing I have to 
comment on that because there was a request for a 
meeting, then there must have been a meeting.  I think it is 
just unfortunate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Nobody...  You said it is a 
request for a meeting. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so I said I want to see the 
10 
attachment if it is available.  Mr Seleka has now made it 
available.  So I am not sure what your complaint is. 
MR KOKO:   No, I am – I am not complaining Chair.  I am 
simply showing you what I have go through because this is 
rather a very unfortunate proposition to use, to say 
because 
of 
this, 
therefore 
you 
are 
involved 
in 
the 
negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Koko, I think just wait because 
we did not have the attachment to that email.  We now 
have it.  Mr Seleka has not said, now that he sees the 
20 
attachment, what he would like to put to you 
MR KOKO:   Understood Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is because then I could ask you 
Mr Koko whether did the meeting take place as it appears 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 313 of 369 
 
to be indicated on the attachment?  The attachment says:  
Wednesday, 12 August 2015.  And the indicated time is 
13:00, 13:15.  Location:  Matshela’s office. 
MR KOKO:   The attachment is noted Chair.  [Speaker not 
clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going to have to – I have slotted 
this document behind that email and then paginate it 
appropriately. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will come in, Chair, if I may indicate 
it now for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is page 811.122.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the top page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 And 
then 
the 
next 
page 
will 
be 
811.122.2. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And that was bundle what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Eskom Bundle 14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  And just to 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 314 of 369 
 
finalise Mr Koko and Mr Mabelane’s affidavit.  The 
proposals that he refers to, because he specifically says in 
paragraph 11.8 that: 
“Various funding avenues were explored for 
almost eight months until the proposal for the 
master services agreement was developed and 
supported by the newly appointed acting CE, 
Mr Brian Molefe...” 
 
And in the same, he says: 
“At the time, I had undertaken custodianship of 
10 
the programme as my role as acting Group 
Executive...” 
 
That is your position? 
MR KOKO:   My apologies, Mr Seleka.  You have lost me a 
bit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay we are back ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   11.8? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
MR KOKO:   You are at 11.8? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   11.8, yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Sorry, I could not hear. 
MR KOKO:   I am here now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka, please do not 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 315 of 369 
 
forget the question you want to put to Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want to go back to something 
you said Mr Koko about paragraph 11.8.  You said that this 
is the time when you got suspended.  Is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   All of these proposals ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...were happened before and just prior to my 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what I wanted to point out is that 
10 
either there is something inaccurate in what you are saying 
or there may be something inaccurate that Mr Mabelane 
says in his affidavit, because when you got suspended on 
the 11 t h of March 2015, Mr Molefe had not arrived at Eskom 
yet.  
 
He only arrived around the 20 t h of April.  So when 
he arrived you were on suspension. 
MR KOKO:  When Mr Molefe arrived, I was on suspension.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is just that you see, in paragraph 
11.8, Mr Mabelane says: 
20 
 
“Various funding avenues were sought for 
almost eight months until the proposal for the 
master services agreement was developed and 
supported by the newly appointed acting CE, 
Mr Brian Molefe.” 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 316 of 369 
 
 
And when you said this is the time that I got 
suspended, so when I look at it, I say but it cannot be 
because you were suspended before Mr Brian Molefe 
arrived.  
MR KOKO:  Ja, so what Mr Mabelane is saying here and as 
I understand it and maybe just because I am too involved 
in the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:  So I know what was happening.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
10 
MR KOKO:  In 2014 the consulting work, not only for 
McKinsey, for the whole of Eskom took a dip and that was 
the consequences of the directive that we have put in 
place.  To put it simply.   
CHAIRPERSON:  National treasury directive.  
MR KOKO:  Yes, yes.  To put it simply, national treasury 
made, took the arbitory nature of Eskom to, I could not 
decide and management could not decide.  You had to 
justify yourself.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
It 
made 
it 
more 
difficult 
to 
use 
20 
consultants.  
MR KOKO:  It made it more difficult ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  To use consultants, that even when you need 
them ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 317 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  It becomes very difficult.  So we explored 
different ways to, to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  To find a way of using them.  
MR KOKO:  To find a way in using them, and then I was 
suspended.  Now this is why Mr Mabelane says in 
paragraph 11.9, that the most feasible proposal was based 
on a self-funding principle and so the team after I left 
thought if we cannot, if it is difficult on a fixed rates basis 
to employ consultants, maybe we can introduce a risk fee 
10 
to the consultants and say to them you will only be paid on 
the value that you create in the business.  
 
There were two problems with that, always.  One is 
that measuring value is always difficult and it, you fight in 
between.  Two, national treasury was clear and emphatic in 
their directive of 2012, that you can do it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you Chair.  Mr Koko, I hear 
you say the proposals were made prior and after your 
suspension.   
20 
MR KOKO:  Chair, I cannot talk about what happened in 
my, 
during 
my 
suspension. 
 
I 
cannot, 
I 
was 
not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you say prior and after.   
MR KOKO:  I ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 318 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know you referred to before.  
MR KOKO:  I apologise sir, prior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  That is what I meant.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:  Not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not after you had come back. 
MR KOKO:  Not after, yes.  I apologise.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Mr ... I thought the Chairperson was 
going to this point, which is that you would have, well he 
10 
says the team for McKinsey introduced me to the various 
unsolicited proposals that had been shared with various 
stake holders and in particular Mr Koko.   
 
So those proposals is Mr Mabelane correct here 
that they had been shared with you? 
MR KOKO:  Yes Chair, before my suspension McKinsey 
had different options about how to progress the top 
engineers program and can be funded.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and that specifically related to the 
master service agreement. 
20 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
Eventually, 
remember 
master 
service 
agreement came after I left, but all those initiatives ended 
up into the master service agreement.  In fact, the original 
document that was shared, it was shared here and it was 
shared at the board.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 319 of 369 
 
 
I think it was presented here by Mr Mabusa.  It is a 
document that was motivated by me to EXCO.  To, on a 
sole source afford McKinsey to progress the top engineers.  
It is dated 2014.  You may remember Chair, it had a lot of 
writing.  
 
You spend a lot of time not seeing what it was 
saying.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I might not remember.  There are 
so many documents that I could not read.  
MR KOKO:  If you go to 2014 documents on top engineers 
10 
program, you will find it is signed by Mr Diamonds, Mr 
Arane, Steve Lennon, Mr Govender and Steve Lennon 
made a comment at the end that he support the program, 
but we must go on an open enquiry.  
 
But Mr Diamonds approved it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  So that was done by me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  And what I think has happened post 2014, 
when I was suspended, was a difficulty of implementing 
20 
that resolution that was approved by then Mr Diamonds and 
meeting it with the national treasury regulations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Instruction notice.  
MR KOKO:  Instruction notice, and if you are a third party 
you will be happy because you will then say ja, national 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 320 of 369 
 
treasury is having effect on Eskom.  So Eskom could not 
take the document that was approved by Mr Diamonds and 
implement it as it is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The instruction note came after it had 
been approved by Mr Diamonds? 
MR KOKO:  No Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It was before? 
MR KOKO:  No Chair.  So what has happened then was 
the, I think the instruction note, I may be wrong Chair but I 
think the instruction note was 2012.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that the document we looked at, 
well the directive of Eskom  ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  The directive of Eskom ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was 2014. 
MR KOKO:  Was 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you say the instruction note was 
much earlier.  
MR KOKO:  Yes, so there were two instruction notes from 
national treasury and maybe I am confusing you.  The first 
instruction note from national treasury was fixed rates.  So 
20 
it did not deal with how you appoint consultants.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not make it difficult other than that 
it is at fixed rates? 
MR KOKO:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 321 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  But I think there was a second one in 2013, 14 
and that one is the one that we followed up ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  With our own directive and that one made it 
very, 
very 
difficult. 
 
So 
once 
Eskom, 
Mr 
Diamonds 
approved the top engineers program, I think from a 
commercial point of view and legal, merging what was 
approved and the new approach from national treasury 
created difficulty and we could not carry on with it.  
 
In fact, if you read the letter that was written by Ms 
10 
Nonkululeke Dlamini Vilethi, relates to the in-fighting within 
Eskom of the internal consulting unit of Eskom in the top 
engineers program and what precipitated that in-fighting, 
and because that in-fighting started in my time, is because 
the internal consulting unit of, in the CFO was pushing 
back on the top engineers program, because of the 
national treasury issue.  
 
So I think the MSA was a fixed be it a bad one, to 
deal with an approved Eskom program but to accommodate 
the national treasury problem.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So to go back to the last 
bit on this exercise regarding the emails exchanged with 
you in regard to the MSA Mr Koko, and I want to go back to 
page ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 322 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  Can I put this 14C away? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it Eskom Bundle 14? 
MR KOKO:  This is 14C. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  14? 
MR KOKO:  C. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  C, no that one.  
MR KOKO:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 811, point 168.   
MR KOKO:  811, point 168. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, point 168.  
10 
MR KOKO:  I am there, Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I think that is the email we touched 
on, well we touched on this morning but without making 
reference to the page number, so the email is dated 31 
August 2015 at 14H45.  It is from yourself to Mr Mabelane 
and Mr Govender.  
 
You copied Mr Singh.  The subject is McKinsey 
contract negotiations.  Then you say: 
 
“Colleagues, 
what 
is 
the 
update 
on 
the 
progress made with McKinsey.  What needs to 
20 
be done to conclude the negotiations and any 
other speaking points.” 
 
Could this be the email you were referring to this 
morning? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 323 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you are saying this email indicates 
that you were not involved in the negotiations.  You wanted 
feedback from them. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  So Chair, look at the people I address it 
to.  These are the people delegated by the board, except 
Mr Mabelane, but the reason Mr Mabelane is copied, is 
because he was in commercial.  Right.  Now the email is 
dated 31 s t August 2018 and the, 2015 and the board has 
already resolved that we must have a business plan 
contract.   
10 
 
Now I, let me get my bearing right.  I said to you 
earlier I met, me and Mr Singh met with McKinsey between 
the 22 n d of July 2015 and the 31 s t of July, and the 3 r d of 
July ... 3 r d of August 2015.  I gave you that window and we 
briefed McKinsey about what we need them to do for us, 
for the business plan of February.  
 
Now the reason I sent this note, is because at the 
back of my mind, I thought why do you recreate the will, 
when there is a contract being negotiated, and this 
contract may have progressed sufficiently for us to use it, 
20 
if it has and I knew the real issue here and all what I 
wanted them to tell me Chair, is that the rate issue is 
resolved.  
 
If they responded to me and said the rates issue is 
resolved, I would have said let us sign so that we can do 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 324 of 369 
 
the business plan.  But I would not send and ask for 
feedback if I according to Ms Motepo’s version I was 
directly involved in the negotiations with Mr Singh.  
 
I would not do that, because I would know I am 
directly involved.  I am the first one to know, so I will not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if you were involved, you would 
have been the leader.  
MR KOKO:  I would have been the leader if I was involved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
10 
MR KOKO:  So I would know, but the leader is Prish 
Govender.  That is why I am sending to him.  Colleagues, 
what is going and I am asking you a further question, what 
bottlenecks do you have.  Can I help you.  Can I help you 
resolve these bottlenecks so that we can move on.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, I could not hear.  You were 
saying what is resolved?  I did not get the word you used? 
MR KOKO:  What bottlenecks ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no earlier.  So that, you were 
20 
saying you needed to know if something is resolved so that 
you can know whether you can deal with them in respect of 
the business plan.   
MR 
KOKO: 
 
The 
only 
sticky 
issue 
with 
the 
MSA 
negotiations was the national treasury.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 325 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  National treasury note? 
MR KOKO:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  That was the only sticky issue.  The rates are 
within our control.  The rates, if they come to me and say 
we have an agreement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the rest.  
MR KOKO:  On the rates, you know what I would have 
done?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I think that is what Mr Seleka 
10 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, that is what I just wanted to know.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is on the rest.  
MR KOKO:   On the rates.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the rates.  
MR KOKO:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, the rates are resolved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
MR KOKO:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes, that is what I wanted.  
20 
MR KOKO:  They came to me Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  Let me tell you what I would have done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, if they said the rates are sorted out.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 326 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:  You know what I would have done, I would 
have said to you cancel everything you are doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sign. 
MR KOKO:  Sign.  Cancel whatever you are doing, just 
cancel, sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  But I could not do that if the rates are not 
resolved, because the rates are outside our control.   
CHAIRPERSON:  They are subject to, well ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:  Outside Eskom’s control. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were not necessarily subject to the 
national 
treasury, 
the 
recent 
national 
treasury 
note 
because that was not just about rates.  It was about the 
actual use of consultants. 
MR KOKO:  Exactly.  So they are outside our control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:  So I cannot push.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay, I understand.  You could 
also explain the second line of the, your email, which says: 
 
“What needs to be done to conclude the 
20 
negotiations and any other sticking points.” 
MR KOKO:  That is what I have just ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were you aware of sticking points other 
than those you wanted to know about in this email? 
MR KOKO:  No, no.  The only sticky points that I was 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 327 of 369 
 
aware of, was national treasury related issues.  That is 
why Chair I am asking what needs to be done to conclude 
the contract.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  The negotiations. 
MR KOKO:  With the negotiations.  I am asking, I am not 
involved but there is a need for this contract.  I want to 
help, I want to expedite but I could not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  What do you think is the reason 
why Ms Motepo would say you were part of the team or the 
persons, 
let 
me 
use 
that. 
 The 
persons 
who 
were 
10 
negotiating and that the two of you, yourself and Mr Anoj 
Singh expanded the scope.  
 
Why would she say that? 
MR KOKO:  Chairman, I this is part of what I have dealt 
with you before, that people come here to tell you different 
versions that are ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you do not know why they tell. 
MR KOKO:  Do not know why they are telling that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  But can I give you a very short example, which 
20 
is very clear.  Which was brought to you and you asked for 
more details.  So I am using this opportunity to tell you my 
view, so that when you get more details you know, one of 
the painful moments experiences at Eskom was on the 2 n d 
of March 2017.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 328 of 369 
 
 
I bumped into Suzette,  I think she came to my 
office and said what is going on.  I said, Ms Daniels I 
apologise.  I said what is going on.  She says we just came 
out of the meeting.  Prepare yourself for the worst.  
Something is not right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was Ms Daniels saying that to you? 
MR KOKO:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:  Says I am just giving you heads up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
10 
MR KOKO:  But prepare for the worst.  I did not know what 
she was talking about and because it was a heads up from 
the board, you do not know what to ask because then you 
are not, soon you will be charged for wanting information 
from the board that does not belong to you. 
 
So I keep a distance.  But it turns out that that 
week I had moved people out of Kosile on the basis of the 
evidence that I had, that they are involved in corrupt 
activities at Kosile.  I had a meeting with Mr Masango.  
Then we were still tight.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the year when also being tight 
ended at some stage, 2017. 
MR KOKO:  No, in fact it ended then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:  That is when it ended up, because I had this 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 329 of 369 
 
evidence that the people at Modupi are involved in corrupt 
activities and they are working with Abraham.  When I 
looked at the evidence these people gave me, which was 
damning I could not directly link Mr Masango to it.  
 
Later I did.  I was given a fine, and then I called 
him.  I said Mark, I am in a very difficult situation and we 
may not be related but I think we have got a position of 
conflict, based on what I know and based on what I know, I 
cannot leave you in the position that you are in.  
 
If I do that, it will be negligent on my part.  I know 
10 
we are friends, but what I know I just do not think it is 
proper for me to leave you in that position.  So I am going 
to move you from your current position to Ms Kraai.   
 
This is counted them.  I am mentioning Ms Kraai 
because she was here.  These people are implicated.  
These ones, remove them immediately.  Do not give them 
option and if you do not, I will do it for you or I will get 
people, these ones you just remove them.  
 
In the same way I am not giving you any option to 
remove you.  Then I am called to a meeting to be 
20 
suspended, 
because 
I 
have 
suspended 
Mr 
Masango, 
because I have moved people from Kosile.  I said to the 
Chairman in that meeting, fortunately I still had that file.  
 
I said Mr Chairman, you are protecting corruption.  
You are, if what you are going to suspend me on is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 330 of 369 
 
because, and Chair the fortunate thing about this, there is 
an audio recording of that meeting.  I have that audio 
recording.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Was 
the 
Chairperson 
still 
Dr 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  Dr Ngobane.  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He said that you have been suspended in 
connection with suspending other people? 
MR KOKO:  Chair, there is an audio.  There is an audio 
recording of that meeting.  I have it.  If the legal team do 
10 
not have it, I will pass it to them in the same way I gave 
them the others.  Every time I listen to that audio I feel like 
crying.  
 
That for doing the right things, Mr Masango lied to 
them and I was suspended.  My counsel asked me but why 
would your friend do this?  You are saying he is Make.  You 
call him Make Loane.  Why would he do this to you?  I said 
Mr Barrie, I do not know.  
 
I cannot explain that to you.  But in hindsight time 
has solved it, because that crowd is now on a three 
20 
hundred thousand bail.  Facing charges of racketeering 
fraud and corruption.  If you asked me the same question 
then, I would have answered you like Mr Barrie asked. 
 
Mr Barrie, this person is my friend.  His son shares 
the same name with me.  I do nothing without him.  That is 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 331 of 369 
 
why on the 10 t h of August, 12 t h of March when I was 
supposed, when I knew I was going to be suspended, the 
first person I called was him.  
 
So I going back to Mr Seleka’s answer, why is Ms 
Motepo ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Questioning.  
MR KOKO:  Questioning.  Why is Ms Motepo saying I was 
directly involved with the negotiations with Trillian when I 
was not, when the evidence shows so.  I do not know.  I 
cannot explain it, but like Mr Masango, over time I think it 
10 
will come out of the wash.  
 
I do not buy the story that you know, he had a very 
acrimonious fall out with Trillian and McKinsey and that 
should not affect me.  I think we are old enough when you 
fight with your Employer you should not drag me in.  So 
other people have said but that is because he is fighting 
with Trillian and McKinsey and Mr Essa and therefore he 
sees you as Essa and that is where it comes from. 
 
She is on the State Capture basting brigade and 
she sees you are still, I do not know.  I do not have an 
20 
answer to that.  All what I am saying to you is look at her 
evidence.  It is glaring at you.  It is false, it is a lie and I 
do not need to spend a lot of time to show you the 
documents that that is a lie.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 332 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that it may be necessary to 
for understanding certain things, that audio if the legal 
team does not have, Mr Koko you can send it through to 
them.  Ja.  
MR KOKO:  In that audio you will hear board members 
saying Mr Koko has gone too far.  He suspended Abraham, 
he must go.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  And then comes the story from Ms Daniels that 
actually Mr Koko did not get  suspended on that day 
10 
because a G brother, I heard him saying a G brother, 
phoned.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:  A G brother phoned and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Mr Ngobeni laughed at it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the same incident? 
MR KOKO:  That is the same incident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and you say you were suspended? 
MR KOKO:  No, I was not suspended.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you were not suspended. 
MR KOKO:  Because I told the board ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:  You know, I was not nice with the board.  In 
the board that day. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 333 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you told them your reasons.  
MR KOKO:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they understood the point.   
MR KOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and you say that is the reason why 
you were not suspended. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
MR KOKO:  It was not the board ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it becomes more important that we 
get the audio. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the light of that.  
MR KOKO:  It was not the board Chair, it was the 
delegation of the board and there were three of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was Dr Ngobeni ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  Dr Ngobene, Ms Klein and Ms Sithembe 
Khoza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
20 
MR KOKO:   In the audio there were supposed to be four, 
and the one that was very vocal about my suspension, said 
I am not going.  I have said my say, you go and that was 
Ms [indistinct] Mabude.  It is a very sad recording Chair, 
and that you go out there to do the right thing and you get 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 334 of 369 
 
suspended for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko, thanks.  I am, in those emails 
but I want to go to Ms Motepo’s emails just to show what 
she has given to the commission, then I will come back to 
this emails.  The same bundle, let us go to Eskom Bundle, 
page 811 point 255.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Bundle 14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The same bundle Chair, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 811.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 255. 
CHAIRPERSON:  255? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now I should say here Mr Koko, I 
know the feedback report says your negotiations were until 
September.  But when you read the affidavit of Mr Amang 
Koah from McKinsey, he says there he went ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said we should go to page 811, 
point 255. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you reading something from there or 
are you making some point ...[intervenes]  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 335 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I wanted to underscore what I am going 
to here, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I just want to make sure I 
follow.  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, okay.  I will underscore it still but 
let us look at this email.  Mr Koko, on your last, your 
previous appearance ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let us first say it is an email from 
Mosele Motepo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dated 30 November 2015 at 15H43 and it 
is addressed to [indistinct] @eskom.co.za and Mr Koko is 
CC’d there and the subject is balance sheet optimisation 
and cash unlocking financial initiative.  Then you can take 
it from there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair and I must also indicate her 
email address is masilom@regiments.co.za.  Mr Koko, you 
dealt with this last time.  Let me just read it quickly.  It 
says: 
 
“Good day Matshela.  I hope this email finds 
20 
you well and it was a pleasure meeting you 
last week.” 
 
If I stop there Mr Koko, is that what she said about 
meeting you last week, correct? 
MR KOKO:  Chair, I had no relationship with Regiments in 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 336 of 369 
 
Eskom.  I have met Ms 
Mothepu several times as 
subcontractor of Trillian – of McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As an employee of Trillian? 
MR KOKO:   No, as a subcontractor to McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean she, an individual or she as 
representing a certain entity? 
MR KOKO:   She as representing a certain entity and she 
was not alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   She had other hangers-on with. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja 
and 
what 
entity 
was 
she 
representing? 
MR KOKO:   Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Regiments? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.   
MR KOKO:   And they worked for McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As subcontractors. 
MR KOKO:   As subcontractors, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, as Regiments subcontractors. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   They worked for McKinsey on the business 
plan project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 337 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   Remember the business plan project has a 
30% outsource. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   So they were part of the 30%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   Outsource. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And I cannot recall this meeting but I can 
confirm that I have met her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a number of occasions.   
10 
MR KOKO:   On a number of occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you – I am not sure that I understood 
the point you sought to make when you said you had no 
relationship with Regiments when you were at Eskom, if 
you did meet her as a representative of Regiments.   
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have a relationship with Trillian 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   With McKinsey. 
MR KOKO:   With McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Now McKinsey had two BEE companies they 
worked with at Eskom.  One was Letsema and the other 
one was Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So I have met Letsema, people I can still 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 338 of 369 
 
recognise them, I can recognise them when I meet them 
and I have met Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so the only point you were making 
is simply that although you did meet with people attached 
to Regiments in particular Ms Mothepu, that does not mean 
that – that did not mean that Eskom had a relationship with 
Regiments. 
MR KOKO:   Eskom had no relationship with Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom had a relationship with McKinsey. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And McKinsey had a relationship with 
Regiments. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But, Chair, let me say this and I will be remiss 
if I do not say it.  The subcontracting part, both on on-
siting and other areas of the business was my passion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So that part – in fact if Mr Seleka came on the 
part that say we were pushing the …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The subcontractors. 
MR KOKO:   The [indistinct] 03.14 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would confess. 
MR KOKO:   I would confess. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 339 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   I, you know, I will give you another example 
that forced me to be out of favour at Eskom which people 
do not know, I insisted that the coal suppliers at Eskom 
must be – must have 50% BEE partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is the only reason, Chair, if you do not 
know, that Anglo American had to disinvest in South Africa 
and sold its assets to Seriti and it is one of the sins I have 
committed but I do not feel bad about it, I get criticised 
left, right and centre.   
10 
So I put a lot of pressure on McKinsey and I told 
you that I had a lot of admiration for McKinsey and I said 
to McKinsey I want to see you creating Top Engineers in 
South Africa but I want to see McKinsey in South Africa 
being 50% owned.   
I was not prescriptive on who they must go to bed 
with.  When they got in Letsema, I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were happy. 
MR KOKO:   I was not only happy, I told them to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, talking of 
your passion for the subcontractors, is that the reason why 
you would have met with Ms Mothepu? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I had a very soft spot for Ms Mothepu 
and I had a very soft spot for Ms Goodson.  You know, one 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 340 of 369 
 
day I want to have coffee with Ms Goodson in particular.  I 
had a very soft spot for them.  
Both of them came across stronger in areas that I 
was not strong in.  They were not engineers, they were 
financial engineers and from the interactions I had with 
them, they had that strength.   
But besides they were black women in – Chair, 
when you find – when you come across a very competent 
black woman who does not need favours from anybody you 
will be stupid an naïve not contact her.   
10 
And that was my approach.  This lady seems to 
know what she is doing, she seems to be competent, let 
the politics of the country not affect here especially where 
you have control.  I had the control.   
So I do not know how I ended up interacting with 
her, I must have volunteered Regiments to her she must 
have  volunteered Regiments to me.  Either way I would 
not deny.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I think my question was more at a 
level of the transaction that was being discussed here, the 
20 
balance 
sheet 
of 
the 
organisation, 
cash 
unlocking, 
financial initiative schemes, not necessarily the meeting 
with him as a person but the meeting with – I mean, with 
her as a person but a meeting with her as the company 
that she represented, your passion for the BEE. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 341 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   So, Chair, I would not have had the reason to 
interact with Ms Mothepu on say a lease back on optic 
fibre, prepaid electricity vending, EFC disposals, Hitachi 
claim, replacement on boilers and Duvha insurance claim 
and let me tell you why.   
They are not in the scope of generation and 
technology which was the position that I had at this point, I 
would not have done it.   
All this are in the financial space.  These are the 
space of the CFO.  So I would not even know how to brief 
10 
them.  The best I can do when they come to me is to way 
go and talk to so and so  space.   
These are the space of the CFO.  So I would not 
even know how to brief them.  The best I can do when they 
come to me is to say go and talk to so and so, go and talk 
to so and so.  I have no knowledge of this.   
I am not trained in insurances issues, I am not 
trained in lease back and EFT disposal.  When you dispose 
an EFT loan book of Eskom you do not need a person 
trained in boiler technology.   
20 
My role, Chair, at Eskom, I was a corporate 
consultant for the boilers, I grew up through the ranks and 
I was recognised as an engineer, not as an EFC assets 
disposal so I would need help with this.  I would not have 
meaningful discussions with them. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 342 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What is the answer to my question? 
MR KOKO:   No, I had no reason to interact with Ms 
Mothepu on this transaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but that was not my question.  My 
question was, was it your passion for BEE that made you 
meet with her, for BEE subcontractors? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I said earlier – if that is – if you say – 
if somebody says to me you approached Ms Mothepu 
because of her BEE credentials or because she was a 
10 
black woman in Eskom, I would not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Deny it. 
MR KOKO:   I would not deny it.  I do not think – I do not 
remember doing that, I do not remember whether she came 
to me or I went to her and I do not remember that.  I think I 
remember going to Ms Goodson, that I think Ms Goodson 
and I have – I am the one who came closer to her and Ms 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your answer that while you do 
remember that you met with Ms Mothepu on a number of 
20 
occasions you cannot remember whether either in part or in 
whole that was driven by your passion for subcontractors 
that had BEE. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, let me tell you what my passion would 
be on, Chair. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 343 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but remember, his asking about 
passion [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you say it did not drive me [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, my passion for BEE will drive 
me towards McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Not towards McKinsey’s subcontractors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   My passion for BEE in transformation will say 
it to the big guys I am doing business with you, I am going 
to contract with you, I need to see change, I need to see 
you 
changing 
at 
both 
operational, 
management 
and 
operational level.  That is what I did with Anglo American 
but I would not go to McKinsey subcontractors.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I would not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position that you have no 
recollection what reason may have brought the two of you 
20 
together over those number of occasions? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The reason I was 
asking you that, Mr Koko, is because of what you said 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 344 of 369 
 
earlier.  But also what you said for the parliamentary 
portfolio committee which seemed to be in line with what 
you were saying earlier.  Remember when you were asked 
about why you went to the offices of Trillian after what you 
said was the workshop? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You also cited your interest in the 
subcontractor service. 
MR KOKO:   Oh, yes, Chair, I paid particular attention to 
subcontractors that are declared to me by the main 
10 
subcontractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That are what to you? 
MR KOKO:   Are declared to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   By main subcontractors and one of the 
discussions I had with Ms Goodson – and I apologise, Mr 
Seleka, for dragging her in because that is the relationship 
I remember the most.   
I remember Ms Mothepu’s relationship, I do not – so 
when we had a discussion one of the first things I asked, I 
20 
said, so you are the subcontractor to McKinsey?  Yes.  I 
have employed McKinsey, tell me what exactly are bringing 
mechanism, list the projects …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you were speaking to whom now? 
MR KOKO:   Ms Goodson. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 345 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Goodson, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Ja.  List the projects that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that meeting where you were asking 
her these questions the meeting at their 
offices or 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, at the boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At Eskom, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Tell me what are you involved in 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the day that she became emotional 
or on another day? 
MR KOKO:   That is the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the day? 
MR KOKO:   That is the day.  What are you working on?  
And I did that, Chair, because I am aware of the rent-a-
black mentality.   
You know, one of the biggest complaints that will 
come to me is that Mr Koko, you forced us into this and 
20 
you forced this guy into this relationship and all what this 
guy is telling us, they sit at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Expect to collect the money? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, just sit at home.  Just come and collect 
the money, we do not need you man, just sit at home and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 346 of 369 
 
my discussions with Ms Goodson at that time was – and I 
was very passionate about that.   
When I meet subcontractors I asked them what are 
you busy with and then when they tell me hundred – 
remember I know what is mission critical and typically 
these people will give these guys tasks that are on the 
periphery and they will do what they think are critical, so if 
I show a sign that this project is critical, they put 
themselves on this project because according to them it is 
mission critical, the others can do other things, so – and 
10 
that is why I always get involved with these people and if 
you talk to Eskom suppliers they will tell you about more 
than ten initiatives of this nature.   
 
You 
know, 
I 
had 
another 
similar 
one 
call 
engineering consulting, purely for the engineers.  The 
same.  I say Mr consulting [indistinct] 15,17, you come 
from the US, this is what I want from you and then I will 
spend time with these BEE guys, what are you doing, what 
are you busy with?  And then they came back and say no, 
this guy just tells me to sit at home.  So that is my context. 
20 
 
And when they call me to their offices, Chair, I 
never said I will not come, I will go.  I just will not go 
alone.  I will go, I will not go alone.  I will listen to them 
and where I can help, I will help.  Where I cannot help, I 
will not help. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 347 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you made an intriguing statement 
about rent-a-black and they complained saying you forced 
us into this person that is making us to sit home, are you 
suggesting that you were forcing Trillian as a subcontractor 
to McKinsey as the main contractor? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, Chair, I did not attribute that 
statement to Trillian, all I am saying is the big white guys, 
they made – I forced them – I forced them into those 
relationships, they do not voluntarily… 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would be the ones who complained 
10 
to you. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The main contractors. 
MR KOKO:   No, I would force the main contractors into 
this partnership.  I would do that.  I forced – and for those 
public that are listening, I forced Anglo American to sell 
50% and they could not do it and they disinvested and I am 
happy they did that because now we have got Seriti which 
is black.  So I would force these big guys – say guys, I am 
not only here to generate electricity, I am here to transform 
20 
Eskom and its supply chain.  That part you are not going to 
negotiate with me.  That part, if you would want to 
negotiate then get around because I am not going to 
entertain. 
 
But these companies, then they go and make 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 348 of 369 
 
partnerships on their own and once they make these 
partnerships, you know, it is like in a marriage, when 
things are nice, you never hear anything.  Once there is a 
fallout then this …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Subcontractors, they come to you and 
complain. 
MR KOKO:   Then they come to me and they will say you 
forced these guys to have a relationship with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR KOKO:   You forced these guys to have a relationship 
10 
with us.  Now these guys just tell us to stay at home and 
come at the end of the month to collect a cheque.  It is not 
what we want, Mr Koko, we want to earn our money, we do 
not want to sit at home to collect the check. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you, Mr Koko, able to comment on 
this?  When Ms Mothepu was here she was asked about 
what relationship Mr Salim Essa had with Regiments and 
she said he was the business development partner, not 
supplier, the business development partner and that she 
was – well, Ms Goodson on the other hand says she is told 
20 
Mr Clive Angel that Mr Essa is the one who makes things 
happen, so he – he makes the deals and that is how 
Regiments would get the deal or at that stage also Trillian.  
What happens in 2014 is that Ms Tsholofelo Molefe gets 
introduced to Mr Salim Essa, specifically in regard to the 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 349 of 369 
 
funding plan for the corporate plan and they are introduced 
– he is introduced to her by Mr Colin Matjila, according to 
her, at Monte Casino as the people who can do this 
balance sheet and cash unlocking initiative and a meeting 
gets arranged for her, they do a presentation at Eskom, Mr 
Eric Wood and others and when they were asked about 
whether they have the capacity to render that service, Ms 
Tsholofelo Molefe says the response was that no, we 
normally contract with McKinsey.   
Well, according to her, the end result was that she 
10 
refused to sign the contract that was presented which was 
supposed to have been a proposal and they did – Eskom 
treasury did the work of the corporate plan and funding 
plan. 
 
Now could it be that Mr Salim Essa was also in this 
case involved to broker the deal for Eskom to give work to 
McKinsey and that Regiments become a subcontractor? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, McKinsey did not meet Mr Essa to get a 
job in Eskom because they were in Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From 2007? 
20 
MR KOKO:   From 2007.  And Chair, I am confident that 
they never tendered for a job in Eskom for the better part 
of the 2007 because the tendering part was forced on me.  
I am probably one of the first persons to force McKinsey 
into a tendering in 2014.  So all along they were getting 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 350 of 369 
 
jobs from a sole source from 2007 and they came at Eskom 
at project Eyethu with Thulani Gcabashe.   
So they did not need Mr Salim Essa to get the 
contract.  But in any event, what is the evidence, Chair?  
The evidence is that McKinsey – the board of Eskom, the 
BTC 
on 
the 
6 
July 
approved 
the 
negotiations 
with 
McKinsey.  So if ever there was a time that Eskom board 
played its hand that they will continue doing business with 
McKinsey was on the 6 July 2015, they did not meet Mr 
Salim Essa.   
10 
 
I am aware, Chair, of the incident that Ms Molefe 
talks about.  At that time I was in commercial.  Ms Molefe 
did not tell me details that you have just mentioned but I 
was aware of it and she had some of the difficulties she 
had with Mr Colin Matjila about – she did not tell me the 
background of the meetings.  She did not tell me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But let me finish my answer this way.  
McKinsey did not meet Salim Essa, Mr Essa to do the 
lobbying for Regiments, the board had played its part, 
20 
McKinsey had not tendered for Eskom’s jobs in 2007, they 
got jobs on a platter and I did not know Salim Essa in 
2015, so I could not know what role he was playing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, shall we go back to this email of 
Ms Mothepu?  I read the first sentence, I will carry on on 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 351 of 369 
 
the second.  So the first one is: 
“We had pleasure meeting you last week. I had a 
chat with Eric Wood regarding additional financial 
initiatives that need to be included as part of our 
balance sheet optimisation and cash unlocking 
financial initiatives stream.  This include the sale 
and lease back on the optic fibre network, prepaid 
electricity vending, EFT disposal, Hitachi claims, 
replacement of boilers, Duvha insurance claim.  We 
are currently compiling a business case for these 
10 
initiatives and require some information from you 
and your team.” 
Why would she address such – an email with such contents 
to you? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you have asked her that question and 
she answered it and she lied. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is what? 
MR KOKO:   Mr Chair answered (sic) Ms Mothepu that 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Asked her the question. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Asked, asked.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it tells you I… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you seem to have a problem, Mr 
Koko, referring to a question as an answer. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 352 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   My engineering qualities have got a worse, 
one of my engineering qualities you have a problem with 
the he and she’s.  Chair, you asked her the same question 
and regrettably she lied to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the answer she gave? 
MR KOKO:   She say – first you asked her why did you 
copy Mr Koko if he was your direct recipient of this email?  
And her answer was, I introduced her to an Indian 
gentleman and this Indian gentleman, I told her that has 
answers for me for this and she, in the following emails, 
10 
she eventually met this Indian gentleman and she was 
giving me feedback of the meetings with the Indian 
gentleman suggesting that Mr Zuma is an Indian gentleman 
and she was like I have a – after that appearance of her 
and after a lot of challenging and difficult times with my 
counsel, the only reason I think she sent me this email is 
because I am the one who signed the September 2009 
contract and she did not realise, I think, that I am out of 
the office, that I am no longer the person who has the line 
of sight of this.   
20 
This email communication continued until December 
when you see in the middle of them then Mr Mabelane 
comes in and they begin to realise that actually there is a 
new guy in the office, we have to be talking to Mr 
Mabelane and eventually in December it disappeared, 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 353 of 369 
 
these emails do not come to me anymore because they 
were not meant for me, they are not my emails, they are all 
financial emails.  I am even inclined to think that they 
would have been done, this project, within the business 
plan project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the way, who was in …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Was my secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I guess probably the reason 
why I asked her that question was because I would have 
expected he had to address the email to you …[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   That is exactly what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rather than copy you. 
MR KOKO:   That is exactly what you asked her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   You asked her exactly that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because if she had addressed it 
your secretary and not copied you but the text was meant 
for you, one could understand that maybe she was meant 
to correspond with your secretary and not directly with you 
or whatever but the fact that she had your email address, 
20 
she copied you and addressed the text to you in terms of 
the salutation but addressed the email to yourself, that it 
was a little unusual. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, Chair, I can tell you, I did action these 
emails.  I did not discuss with her these emails.  Even if I 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 354 of 369 
 
wanted to they are outside my competency.  I regret the 
fact that Ms Daniels has come here to tell you that this are 
in my area.  I think if you take the delegations of authority 
and you bring back Ms Daniels, she will once again 
apologise for not being correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at five to or four minutes to 
eight, so… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can – ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Mr Koko, on this, the part about 
Ms Daniels? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, Ms Daniels’ testimony is that she has 
followed Ms Mothepu’s testimony and she confirms to you 
that 
these 
issues 
are 
all 
– 
were 
in 
my 
area 
of 
responsibility. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, is that what you are saying? 
MR KOKO:   And I am saying if you – in the unlikely event 
that she comes back and you take the delegation of 
20 
authority and you ask her again, she will confess to having 
made a mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, without coming back physically, 
she can be asked to be asked to be available and she can 
be asked.   Ja, okay.  
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 355 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay because we did not put these 
emails to her. 
MR KOKO:   No you did not put this emails to her, but this 
project are in the least somewhere in the Commission, they 
were Ms Daniels the first two, in Ms Mothepu’s affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, tell me is Ms Mothepu not 
sending you this email because of the meeting she had 
with you as she says the week before? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair not at all - I would have very little 
to discuss with Ms Mothepu on this transaction.  So she 
10 
comes in Chair and say, let us discuss the sale of EFC 
Disposal, say so you are going to sell the loan book of 
Eskom.   I do not even know where it sits in Eskom, I 
cannot even spell it in Treasury.  So the best I can tell you 
Ms Mothepu said go to Treasury, there is a person there 
responsible for EFC loan book.   
I do not know it and then it comes to the next one 
and then it says, Hitachi claims.  It says Ms Mothepu 
attached claims are at Medupi and Kusile it is group 
capital.  At best Ms Mothepu going to talk to so and so, I 
20 
cannot help you there.   
I have no soon knowledge of what is going on with 
the Hitachi claims.  Then you go to the next one and say, 
this sale and this back on fibre optic network.  Ms Mothepu 
I have never interacted with that but at best please go and 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 356 of 369 
 
talk to so and so.  That is the best discussion I can have 
with her.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, let me close with this, not that I 
am finishing the topic on this but insofar as you said the 
emails ended in December, please turn to page 811.358. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to say before you go there Mr 
Koko, it does appear that certainly from the reading of this 
email at page 811.255 that she seems to be telling you 
whatever she is telling you in this email that there seems 
to be a follow up on the previous week's meeting that she 
10 
talks about, what do you say to that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I would not have a meeting with her to 
discuss this.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is not the question. 
MR KOKO:   So what I think she may be referring to is the 
meeting that – and I am even supposing Chair, I think I am 
walking on a dangerous ground.  What she may be 
referring to is a meeting that she was in with McKinsey and 
I was there and we may have had a chat and then she 
follows up with a with an email.  Chair I am guessing and I 
20 
do not want to guess. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no but my question is a different 
one. Whether, do you agree that when you read this email, 
you 
get 
the 
impression, 
one 
gets 
the 
impression…[intervene] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 357 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   That there was a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not only that there was a meeting 
because she makes that point clearly. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that she is following up on a 
discussion that happened at that meeting.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the impression one gets. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   But Chair while you are…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you are saying there was no such 
meeting or no, no you did not say there was no such 
meeting you said you had a number of meetings with her 
but you cannot member whether you had a meeting with 
her during that particular week. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is correct but there is another piece 
of information that you have to revisit, is when she – it is 
her testimony to you about this because her testimony to 
you about this throws everything out. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we can wrap up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, for tonight.  
CHAIRPERSON:   For tonight, ja. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 358 of 369 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Yeah, 
because 
that 
last 
paragraph…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   811. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let us stay here a little bit 
because that last paragraph says: 
“We would like to set up time earlier this week with 
yourself and your team to source the information in 
order to complete the business cases by the end of 
the week.” 
I mean she is so specific in her writing about you and your 
10 
team that it is puzzling why she would write like this if this 
is not a follow up to your meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is even strange that Chair my 
team would not have anything to do with this, that is even 
strange.  My team, my entire team put together would have 
nothing to do with every single thing that is put here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any recollection whether 
you did receive this email? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whether if you received it you 
20 
responded? 
MR KOKO:   No, well I can tell you now I did not respond.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you also do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is it, I do not recall seeing it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were saying earlier that your PA 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 359 of 369 
 
would bring an email to your attention, in this case did that 
happen? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Chair I do not remember this but I 
am also saying my entire team put together will not have 
the competency to deal with these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To deal with these matters. 
MR KOKO:   With these matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you think - so what have you got a 
reason why you think she might write to you about matters 
10 
that you neither discussed with nor matters with you and 
your team? 
MR KOKO:   She has answered that question in her 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just remind me what she says? 
MR KOKO:   She says I gave her an Indian gentleman to 
work with who…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To discuss these matters with you. 
MR KOKO:   To discuss these matters with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she thought she was referring to 
20 
your PA? 
MR KOKO:   She was referring to my PA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would not refer to your PA to 
discuss this. 
MR KOKO:   I would not refer her to my PA to discuss this. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 360 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay 
maybe 
that 
might 
be 
…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This last one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The page I was referring you to Mr 
Koko is 811.358. 
CHAIRPERSON:   811? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 358. 
CHAIRPERSON:   358. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   811? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 358.  So this is from her again 
Ms Mosilo Mothepu, MosiloM@regiments, Tuesday the 12 t h 
January 2016 and specifically addressed to you copied by 
Fahiema Bahdat and then the subject is EFC, and we saw 
in that email EFC disposal. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, I mean this is it is even worse I mean why 
would I discuss EFC with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let Mr Seleka finish Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, remember you said to the 
20 
Chairperson this email - the emails to you disappeared in 
December, she no longer sent you emails. 
MR KOKO:   Oh, ja I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what I am saying to you is her are 
emails in January 2016. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 361 of 369 
 
MR KOKO:   No certainly I was not aware of this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you were not aware of this either? 
MR KOKO:   No, no I was not aware of this email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is another one on the 20 t h of 
January on the next page. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I can see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were also not aware of this one? 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but again look at - really Chair I 
mean…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says: 
10 
“Hi, Thando.” 
MR KOKO:   Hi, Thando – I mean really.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   “Thanks for accommodating me this  
afternoon as discussed, Matshela has requested a 
meeting with me on Friday afternoon.  My team is 
available after 14:30.” 
Is this…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   And this one has no title about the meeting, I 
do not call this meeting time, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Subject to meeting with Matshela. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes, meeting with Matshela. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not remember this? 
MR KOKO:   No, and this meeting I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, why would you not think that this 
meeting that she is talking about may be one of those 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 362 of 369 
 
many meetings that you said you did have with her. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is correct Chair yes that is why I am 
saying I do not remember, all that I can confirm is that I 
met with her several times but not to discuss transactions, 
financial issues, no that I would not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair lastly look at the one of the 
12 t h of January, the one you say you do not remember also 
she says: 
“Hi Matshela. 
10 
Compliments 
of 
the 
new 
year, 
as 
discussed 
telephonically I would appreciate it if you can assist 
in facilitating a meeting with Mike Ashley and his 
EFC team to understand the EFC business for the 
ultimate sale from Eskom’s ownership.” 
So here she specifically refers to a telephone conversation 
with you.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, now, this is a very – I am glad we have 
this…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I ask you this question, do you 
20 
admit that part, having the telephone conversation with 
her?  
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is possible, it is not possible I do not 
recall but look at the question is possibly she could call 
but look at the question it says please…[intervene] 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 363 of 369 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please facilitate a meeting with. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, these are people outside my department.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   And it suggests that she is struggling to make 
relationship…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the face of it these email that is 
what, that is the thought I have Mr Seleka on the face of it 
this email may be consistent with Mr Koko’s version of 
saying these matters are not matters I would discuss, I 
would rather refer her to other people that is the sense I 
10 
have.  What do you say Mr Seleka?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, Ms Mothepu has provided us 
this email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To substantiate her version that Mr 
Koko was involved in…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the negotiation. 
MR KOKO:   No, but she cannot say I am involved.  She is 
asking me to connect her to other people.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So let me just add. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let him finish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, also for increasing the scope, 
extending the scope.  
MR KOKO:   I cannot increase the EFC scope, where would 
I start?  It is like saying, a lawyer in Johannesburg comes 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 364 of 369 
 
to increase the scope in the office of the DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has Mr Koko dealt with these emails in 
an affidavit? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair I am seeing this emails for the first 
time today.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no Chair they are – there are some 
of these emails are touched in Ms Mothepu’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but some are new? 
MR KOKO:   Not this one, I can assure you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not the one of the…[intervene] 
10 
MR KOKO:   No not this email I can assure you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not the one of January 2016? 
MR KOKO:   Not the one of the January 2016.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I do not think that one is there, 
Chair. 
MR KOKO:   No Chair, I am telling you it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the others are attached. 
MR KOKO:   The others are. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But did you deal with them? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I have I have put them in bundles and I 
have dealt with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright I think let us stop here for 
the 
evening. 
 
Thank 
you 
to 
everybody, 
for 
all 
the 
cooperation to try and assist the Commission to do as 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 365 of 369 
 
much as it can to finish its work.  We appreciate all the 
sacrifices and I know Mr Koko, you are still ready to go up 
to midnight. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you for everyone's preparedness 
to assist.  Thank you to the staff, the technicians and 
everybody and of course Mr Seleka who has been standing 
since ten, this morning and your team.  
Mr Barrie, thank you, your instructing attorney, Mr 
Koko thank you to all of you for your cooperation.  We will 
10 
adjourn now, tomorrow there will be no hearing or maybe 
we need to start here. What is the position Mr Seleka in 
terms of the witness who was meant to be here anyway 
tomorrow? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the witness has not indicated that 
he is not available so that is Mr Zwane, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so he is still scheduled to be here? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so we should meet you might not just 
not be able to deal with certain matters. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, it is the other two 
witnesses whose availability who I was exploring. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I had thought that you would have 
spoken to him or his lawyers so that he does not come 
here just for one hour. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370 
 
Page 366 of 369 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I can still do that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, try and do that because there is not 
much point to assemble just for one hour and then go away 
for the whole day.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We would have to arrange a day when 
we can cover all the matters that you need to question him 
on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you will need to talk to me after you 
10 
have spoken to him or his lawyer.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will do so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair before - I beg your pardon Chair  
Just before the Chairperson adjourns that item aspect, Mr 
Koko raised this morning about the President. Mr Koko you 
mentioned that you made the point in your statement, but 
during the adjournment I was seeking to draw to your 
attention, that the statement I have seen, does not deal 
with your suspension, vis-a-vis the President.  It deals with 
20 
the allegation of his interest in Glencore.  Maybe you could 
clarify…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   My understanding was that he did not 
dispute that in his statement.  He did not refer to the

fire him.  But he did that only in his oral evidence, but he 
said even in his oral - but I do not know whether he said 
even in his oral evidence – no, no he said in the labour 
court he simply said the VC and not the President.  But in 
his oral evidence he said Deputy President then, is that 
right? 
MR KOKO:   What I just need to correct Mr Seleka is that I 
deal with my suspension in my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I do deal with that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but I am making a point in regard 
to the allegation that it is the President who had given 
instructions for you to be suspended.  
MR KOKO:    I deal with it in my statement Chair, and I am 
saying 
it 
is 
government 
and 
it 
is 
very 
clear 
in 
my…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say government as opposed to the 
President? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is very clear in my statement, I think 
my statement of the 20 t h of November.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have seen that part.  That part I know 
Chair because I did put it to him but if I give the President 
that statement and the President was at that time, not the

President.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
How 
does 
it 
implicate 
him?  
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is why I said, I inquired that I have 
not seen the statement from former Minister Martins, 
Deputy Minister Martins or Ms Mokgekelo because I got 
from the DG…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not want to repeat your evidence 
now because you have said that. 
MR KOKO:   No, no I have so my statement is that I gave 
10 
here is clear.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Koko I think the difference 
between you and Mr Seleka is that Mr Seleka wanted to 
say to you, he did look at your statement and he did not 
find anywhere where you attributed the instruction to the 
Board to the current President.   
And I think your answer is supposed to be as I 
understand it, yes I did not attribute it to the current 
President but I attributed it to government, is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, Chair but I am mentioning, I 
20 
am asking you not to stop there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that - that part I think we dealt 
with it.  I think Mr Seleka just wanted to confirm with you 
that in your statement, you do not attribute it to the current 
President. 
29 MARCH 2021 – DAY 370

MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay no that is fine.  Okay, thank 
you very much we will now adjourn, we adjourn.
