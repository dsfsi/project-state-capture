PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 09 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us start. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Set down for this morning Chair is 
an application to authorise the issue of summons in respect 
of the former President Mr Zuma. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Long heads have been prepared 
and they have been delivered to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have prepared a note for oral 
argument which summarises the major points to be made 
and if I could take a few minutes to put those before you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Notice of this application was given 
by email to Mr Zuma’s attorneys on Friday 18 September 
20 
2020.  That appears at page 781 of the bundle that you 
have.  
 
The 
application 
its 
time 
and 
date 
was 
also 
announced publicly on the 21 September 2020 that appears 
at page 790 of the bundle. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 4 of 55 
 
 
In response to those notices Mr Zuma’s attorneys 
addressed a letter to the Chair giving notice of application 
for the Chair ’s recusal.  That is at page 791 of the bundle. 
 
Paragraph 12 of that letter at page 794 says the 
following: 
“Until this application for your recusal is 
finally determined President Zuma will take 
no further part in this commission and the 
Chairperson is entitled to take any such 
step as he deems lawful and appropriate.  
10 
We 
reiterate 
that 
President 
Zuma 
has 
questioned 
the 
lawfulness 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
this 
commission; 
he 
persists with this issue and reserves all his 
rights in this regard.” 
 
That is clear notice that this application will not be 
opposed at least through any attendance before you Chair. 
 
Chair this application was originally brought in 
January 2020.  It was postponed.  It has now been brought 
and the facts supporting the application have been updated 
20 
to the present time and there is an amended notice of 
application to cater for the new dates. 
 
All these papers have been served on Mr Zuma’s 
attorneys. 
 
At page 715 this may become controversial at a 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 5 of 55 
 
later stage Chair of the bundle before you the terms of the 
postponement of the application in January 2020 appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  715. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see there is a handwritten pagination as 
well as a red pagination with the right numbers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we looking at the red numbers 
today Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 715 I have got.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where you stated as follows from 
10 
line 10. 
“The commission’s legal team will deliver a 
replying affidavit on or before close of 
business Friday 24 January.  That is 1. 
With regard to what is going to happen in 
regard 
to 
this 
application 
that 
is 
the 
application for a summons in January 2020 
Chair and the further appearance before the 
commission of the former President what 
has been agreed in the discussion involving 
20 
myself and counsel on both sides is that 
this application is to be adjourned to a date 
to be arranged and I hasten to say arranged 
does not mean agreed.”   
 
So 
by 
your 
directive 
Chair 
you 
recorded 
an 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 6 of 55 
 
agreement between the legal representatives of both 
parties that the application for a summons would be 
adjourned to a date to be arranged and this is the date so 
arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I must just say also that that 
emphasis there where I say:  
“I hasten to say arranged does not mean 
agreed.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has a context. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the context is that I think on the 
same day if I am not mistaken but at some stage early this 
year when there was appearance for Mr Zuma his counsel 
argued that previously it had been said that dates – he 
would appear – that is Mr Zuma on dates to be arranged 
and they had construed that to mean it would be days that 
would be agreed with them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I made it clear on that occasion when 
20 
they were they appearing that that is not what was meant. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was meant was the dates would be 
arranged within the commission and that I – I decide dates. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 7 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have occasion to look at the transcript 
of that – of that date and counsel for Mr Zuma accepted 
and understood that explanation and had no problem with 
it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He just said that previously they had 
understood 
it 
differently. 
 
So 
the 
question 
of 
this 
commission not agreeing dates with the lawyers and 
witnesses was dealt with at that time.  And it was accepted 
that the commission will fix dates and obviously if Mr Zuma 
10 
has a problem with the particular dates that have been 
fixed he could bring an application and show that he has 
got good reasons not to be available and then if I am 
satisfied obviously I would change the dates.  So that is 
the context. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair and that – that position is 
confirmed in the Rules of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where the rules and the consistent 
practice I might add is that you as Chair determine the 
20 
dates, the order of appearance and in fact who will or will 
not give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So Chair the rules, the record as 
well as the consistent practice are all confirmed by the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 8 of 55 
 
arrangement now that you determine the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the power of the commission 
lest there be any doubt certainly in the public mind to issue 
summons is set out in Section 31 of the Commission’s Act 
which states very clearly that you as the commission have 
the power of a court of law to compel attendance by way of 
summons.  
 
So that is a statutory power that you have and it is 
a power equivalent to that of the High Court.  That section 
10 
is quoted in the long heads before you Chair at Footnote 2. 
 
Chair insofar as there may be any dispute as to 
whether this application for the authorisation for the issue 
of summons can and should be granted it can be resolved 
by reference to legal principle and by reference to what are 
incontrovertible facts. 
 
There are in our submission grounds to issue the 
summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think it is important for you 
to read that section that gives me that power. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the benefit of everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Section 3 of the Commission’s Act 
deals with the commission’s powers as to witnesses.  
Section 3.1 reads: 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 9 of 55 
 
“For the purpose of ascertaining any matter 
relating to the subject of its investigations” 
That is quite a wide remit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“A commission shall in the union now the 
republic have the powers which a Provincial 
Division of the Supreme Court of South 
Africa has within its Province to summons – 
to summon witnesses. To cause an oath or 
10 
affirmation to be administered to them.  To 
examine them and to call for the production 
of books, documents and objects.” 
Section 3.2 reads: 
“A summons for the attendance of a witness 
or the production of any book, document or 
object before a commission shall be signed 
and 
issued 
by 
the 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Commission in a form prescribed by the 
Chairman of the Commission and shall be 
20 
served in the same manner as a summons 
for the attendance of a witness at a criminal 
trial in a Superior Court at the place where 
the attendance or production is to take 
place.” 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 10 of 55 
 
Two points Chair the – that arise out of that for 
present purposes at least is that the issue of a summons 
may in terms of that section be affected for the purpose of 
ascertaining any matter relating to the subject of its 
investigations. 
And that is a matter within your discretion in terms 
of the Act and our submission will be at the end of our 
short address Chair that the issue of summons in this 
matter is a reasonable exercise of that discretion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On – on the wording of that section it 
10 
seems quite clear that as long as a summons – as long as 
there is a summons is issued for the purposes – for the 
purpose of ascertaining a matter relating to the subject of 
the commission’s investigations.  That is enough. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is the qualifying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the only requirement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Requirement yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For example it does not have to be shown 
that the person who is being summoned does not cooperate 
or cooperates.  It is enough if… 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a matter that the commission 
seeks 
to 
ascertain 
that 
relates 
to 
a 
subject 
of 
its 
investigation.  Obviously if a person is not cooperating 
there is even stronger ground. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 11 of 55 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For that.  But it seems that even without 
knowing whether somebody will cooperate or will not 
cooperate if the commission is satisfied that that person 
has information that relates to a matter that is the subject 
of its investigations the commission may summon that 
person. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If there is any issue to be raised. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Or if on a particular date which the 
summons authorises for the appearance a person who is 
subject to such a summons has every right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To deal with those matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Either before you or in a court of 
law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So there is no question of any legal 
infringement of anybody’s rights here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Quite simply Chair you exercise 
your discretion on the qualifying requirements. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 12 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that then authorises the lawful 
issue of a summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS 
SC:  Chair I might add 
that the 
procedural device under Section 3 of the Act is not an 
uncommon recourse for commissions and especially this 
commission.  So this commission has issued over 2500 
summonses and those are summonses 
which include 
summonses 
to 
appear 
and 
summonses 
to 
produce 
10 
documents.  99 summonses have been issued for witnesses 
to appear. 
 
So 
Chair 
it 
is 
not 
an 
uncommon 
procedural 
mechanism. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And in fact it is a necessary 
mechanism for this commission to do its work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Of course if one says, is there 
a matter that this commission seeks to ascertain from Mr 
Zuma that relates to the subject of its investigation we 
20 
have got to deal with that as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Because 
– 
to 
show 
whether 
this 
requirement of the statute is complied with – is present.  
And one way of doing so I guess would be to go to the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 13 of 55 
 
Terms of Reference. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The – we can read the Terms of 
Reference if you wish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have them here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think we should – we should do 
that – you should do that at least those that may appear 
relevant. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  There are two points there 
Chair.  The first is that insofar as Mr Zuma’s evidence is 
subject to the investigation of the commission one could 
have reference to the Terms of Reference themselves but 
also 
to 
the 
witnesses 
who 
have 
come 
before 
the 
commission.  34 witnesses have implicated Mr Zuma. 
 
Now over and above the requirement of the Section 
3.1 and the requirements of the Terms of Reference which 
delineates the mandate on your Chair for your investigation 
there is a duty at common law and it is being emphasised 
20 
in 
a 
number 
of 
recent 
judgments 
that 
obliges 
the 
commission to call Mr Zuma to answer those allegations. 
 
If I may just read one passage of a judgment in the 
matter of Msiza versus Advocate Motau and the Prudential 
Authority of the South African Reserve Bank.  Paragraph 55 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 14 of 55 
 
of that judgment reads: 
“In 
my 
view 
where 
an 
investigator 
of 
forturea a commission knows or is expected 
to foresee that his findings, remarks and 
conclusions will have consequences for the 
party on whose behalf an investigation is 
conducted and for the party against whom 
findings will be made he is obliged to listen 
to both sides and the party who is likely to 
be affected by adverse findings is entitled 
10 
to demand the right to be heard before an 
adverse remark or finding conclusion or 
decision is made against him or her.” 
 
So quite apart from the mandate contained in your 
Terms of Reference Chair and quite apart from the 
Provisions of Section 3 of the Commission’s Act the 
qualifying provisions there is a duty in law to hear the 
other side.  
 
It is not a choice Chair that you have.  You have a 
duty to do so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well of course the passage that you read 
relates to the observance of the Audi Alteram Partum Rule. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one should not take that part too far 
because the Audi Alteram Partum Rule is there for the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 15 of 55 
 
benefit to – for the benefit of the person who may be 
adversely affected by my decision.  He has a right to wave 
that right to say well I do not want to be heard.  That he 
has a right to do and I cannot force him for purposes of 
observing that right but where I can force him as I 
understand the law is where I believe that he has 
information 
that 
may 
assist 
the 
commission 
in 
its 
investigation but then in that case I am forcing him not for 
purposes of hearing his side of the story I am forcing him 
in order to do my work to investigate the issues that I am 
10 
supposed to investigate.  
 
So as I understand the position  
1. I need to observe the Audi Alteram Partum Rule until 
such time that I am satisfied that he is not interested 
in being afforded that opportunity.  But the fact that 
he is not interested in being afforded that opportunity 
does not preclude me from saying come I want to 
know certain issues that you are appear to have 
knowledge about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is in regard to that certain part it 
seems to me where he cannot say leave me alone I am not 
interested in being heard by you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair the – that in our view is 
accurate subject to one qualification which I will come to in 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 16 of 55 
 
a moment.   
 
Of course there is distinction between the duty on 
the commission to give every opportunity to an implicated 
person who states his or her side of the case.  And the 
implicated person then has an election whether to exercise 
that right to speak or not to speak. 
 
The duty of the Chair to investigate arising out of 
the Terms of Reference and that is a duty in respect of 
which the Chair has no discretion.  You must investigate 
and we will come to the grounds upon which we submit 
10 
Chair and you have said that there is a duty on this 
commission to explore those to investigate those issues 
where the former President has evidence or can give 
evidence to inform your findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean there can be no doubt that if on 
information available to me or evidence submitted to the 
commission by other witnesses there can be no doubt that 
if I form a view that a particular person may have 
knowledge or does have knowledge of matters that are 
relevant to what I am investigating I must take steps to get 
20 
that person to come and testify. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I do not do that I would be failing in my 
duty. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair in correspondence and 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 17 of 55 
 
this is the qualification I have to the propositions that have 
been put now.   
 
The former President has asserted that he is 
exercising a right not to participate in the matters of the 
commission and by exercising that right he is in fact 
participating. 
 
There is no right not to respond to a 3.3 Notice 
implicating a witness.  That witness has an election. He 
may say or she may say, I am not going to respond or I am 
going to respond.  But there is no right not to deal at all 
10 
with the matters which are the subject of the commission’s 
Terms of Reference if the commission determines that a 
person must come. 
 
So insofar as there is alleged by Mr Zuma’s legal 
representatives to be a right not to respond that is 
incorrect.  It is not a right not to come to the commission. 
There is no such right. 
 
There is an election not to answer a Rule 3.3 Notice 
to put a version or to cross-examine a witness.  But there 
is no right to say I am not coming to the commission at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems to me that the position is if Mr 
Zuma or anybody who is said to be implicated by a witness, 
a certain witness is served by the commission with a Rule 
3.3. Notice to say here is a statement from a witness who 
seems to implicate you in wrongdoing that the commission 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 18 of 55 
 
is investigating.  I mean that notice in terms of the Rules of 
the Commission advises the recipient of a Rule 3.3 Notice 
that you have a right to apply to the commission for Leave 
to Cross-examine this witness.  You have a right to apply to 
the commission for Leave to give evidence yourself and 
contradict whatever the witness is saying.  You have a right 
to apply to the commission for Leave to call witnesses who 
can corroborate what you say – your story.   
 
It explains all of those things.  But you are not 
forced to make those applications. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are free to say I am not going to 
make that application – those applications.  Those people 
can implicate me as much as they want, that is fine.  But 
once the commission says we are aware that you do not 
think you are implicated; we are aware that you have 
chosen not to apply for Leave to Cross-examine these 
witnesses but nevertheless we want you to come and 
answer questions provided the commission has grounds to 
believe that you may have knowledge of matters that are – 
20 
that it is investigating you cannot refuse lawfully. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously if there is a specific reason 
why you cannot appear on a specific date that is different 
then you put your case before the commission to say, on 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 19 of 55 
 
that date – on that date I have to see a doctor. I am not 
well bla, bla, bla.  If the commission is satisfied that it is a 
genuine reason it will give another date.   
 
But 
of 
course 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
recent 
correspondence from Mr Zuma’s attorneys one of the 
reasons that have been given recently why Mr Zuma was 
not prepared to come to the commission on the 21 to 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  25 September is this one.  It appears in 
he – the letter of his attorneys dated Tuesday September 1 
10 
2020 paragraph 5. 
“Further we wish to point out that President 
Zuma is preparing for his much anticipated 
criminal 
trial 
the 
importance 
of 
which 
cannot be over emphasised.  It is rather 
unfair 
to 
expect 
President 
Zuma 
to 
simultaneously 
consider 
evidence 
and 
affidavits of more than 30 witnesses in 
order to make himself ready to appear 
before 
the 
commission 
on 
21 
to 
25 
20 
September 2020.” 
And then later on in – in the same letter at 
paragraph 2 they say: 
“In the circumstances we are instructed to 
inform the commission as we hereby do that 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 20 of 55 
 
for 
all 
the 
reasons 
mentioned 
above 
President Zuma will not be able to attend 
the proceedings schedules on the dates of 
21 to 25 September 2020.” 
 
In other words one of the reasons that they advance 
as to why Mr Zuma would not be attending – able to attend 
the hearing on 21 to 25 September 2020 is that he was 
busy preparing for his criminal trial.  Is that a good enough 
reason not to appear before the commission? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well in our submission no because 
10 
the – the point about that – that paragraph in that letter is 
that is a situation that will prevail for the life of the 
commission.   
And the commission must conclude its evidence by 
September and one of the reasons procedural reasons for 
the issue of summons is to enable the commission to 
consider 
the 
former 
President’s 
evidence 
before 
the 
commission ends which is in December.  Certainly the 
evidence must end by December to enable you Chair to 
write your report by March next year.   
20 
So in the circumstances – particular circumstances 
of this case our submission is that it is not a good enough 
reason to – to refuse to appear.  But if the former President 
does believe it is you Chair will exercise your discretion in 
terms of your mandate and you will exercise your discretion 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 21 of 55 
 
in terms of the directives that govern your chairing of the 
commission.  If he believes there are grounds not to 
appear on a particular date he is free to – to raise those 
with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well on the information… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But not in those general terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Provided – on the information provided 
this is not a case where he was saying the dates that you 
have given me on which to appear before the commission 
fall – are the same dates when I must – I am supposed to 
10 
appear in the High Court for my criminal trial.  That would 
be different.  That would be different.   
But that is not what the letter was saying.  It was simply 
saying he is busy preparing for his criminal trial.  It does 
not say when the criminal trial is going to happen.  But in 
the end even if the criminal trial was going to happen soon 
he would have to appear before the Commission and then 
apply for more time with the criminal trial and say:  I have 
been busy with the Commission. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am now asking for you to give me more 
time in order to prepare for the trial 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to say:  I am not going to appear 
before the Commission because I am preparing for a criminal 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 22 of 55 
 
trial that is going to come at some stage on some dates that 
maybe have not even been determined. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  Quite frankly, Chair.  
The Commission has a job to do.  It is obliged to do it.  The 
fact that there are other mattes that the former president 
must attend to may or may not be relevant, but it is certainly 
no basis for a blanket refusal to come on those grounds at 
all and frankly on any date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And you see, as I see it, that 
particular statement in the letter means that that is a belief 
10 
that he holds that because he is preparing for this criminal 
trial, he does not have to come to the Commission.   
 
And if that is so, if he has that believe, how can he come 
before 
the 
Commission 
at 
any 
stage 
before 
his 
trial 
happens?   
 
Because the closer the... as he approaches the trial 
dates of the criminal matter, the more time he would want to 
spend preparing for that criminal trial. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question is.  Can that person ever 
20 
come before the Commission voluntarily before his criminal 
trial happens? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not on what is contained in that 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 23 of 55 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So whilst the requirement to appear 
in another forum may be a reason to ask for particular dates 
to be changed, certainly not as it appears there, grounds for 
a blanket refusal to come before the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, the issues that we have 
covered in our written submissions, therefore covered two 
principle contentions.   
 
The first is to say that Mr Zuma’s evidence is both 
necessary and desirable for the work of the Commission.  
10 
That we will establish and have dealt with in detail in the 
written submissions. 
 
The second is why it is necessary that summons be 
issued to secure Mr Zuma’s appearance at the Commission 
to give evidence. 
 
Now Chair, that is an added reason but it is not a 
necessary reason.  In regard to the first issue, if I may refer 
to paragraph 12.1 of the written submissions. 
 
In summary Chair, Mr Zuma’s evidence is a necessary 
part of the Commission’s work for at least the following 
20 
reasons.   
 
Firstly, much if not most of the corruptions, an act which 
might constitute State Capture occurred during his term of 
office as President of the Republic. 
 
Secondly, the Commission’s Terms of Reference refers 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 24 of 55 
 
to Mr Zuma directly in a number of paragraphs.  If I may just 
ask you, Chair, to look at page 808 of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am going to... I was going to go 
straight to the Terms of the Reference. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, they are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, you could read the relevant 
parts that refer to him.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will do that.  The Terms of 
Reference are... they are included in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 1.2 reads: 
“Whether the president... 
 
And that is a reference to the former president. 
“...had any role in the alleged office of cabinet 
positions to Mr Mcebisi Jonas and Ms Mentor by the 
Gupta family as alleged.” 
 
Terms of Reference 1.3: 
“Whether the appointment of any member of the 
National Executive Functionary and/or office bearer 
was disclosed to the Gupta family or any other 
20 
authorised person before such appointments were 
formally made and/or announced and if so, whether 
the President or any member of the National 
Executive is responsible for such conduct.” 
 
Terms of Reference 1.4: 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 25 of 55 
 
“Whether the President or any member of the 
present 
or 
previous 
members 
of 
this 
National 
Executive 
including 
deputy 
ministers 
or 
public 
official 
or 
employer, 
any 
state 
owned 
entities 
breached or violated the Constitution or any relevant 
ethical code or legislation by facilitating the unlawful 
awarding of tenders by SOE’s of any organ of state 
to benefit the Gupta family or any other family, 
individual or corporate entity doing business with 
government of any organ of state.” 
10 
 
Terms of Reference 1.5.  Sorry, 1.9. 
“The nature and the extent, if any, in the awarding of 
corruption, if any, in the awarding of contracts and 
tenders 
to 
companies, 
business 
entities 
or 
organisations by government department, agencies 
and entities. 
In particular, whether any member of the National 
Executive (including the President), public official, 
functionary of any organ of state or influenced the 
awarding of tenders to benefit themselves, their 
20 
families or entities in which they held a personal 
interest.” 
 
Those are direct references to the former President, 
Chair.  Terms of Reference 1.1 and 1.7 contain indirect 
references to the former President.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 26 of 55 
 
 
Terms of Reference 1.7 reads: 
“Whether any member of the National Executive... 
 
Which will include the president. 
“...and including deputy ministers, unlawfully or 
corruptly or improperly intervened in the matter of 
the closing of banking facilities for Gupta owned 
companies.” 
 
And then 1.1: 
“whether and to what extent and by whom attempts 
were made through any form of inducement or for 
10 
any gain of whatsoever nature to influence members 
of the National Executive... 
 
Which would include the former President. 
“...including deputy ministers, office bearers and/or 
functionaries employed by office bearers of any 
state institution or organ of state or directors of 
boards of SOE’s. 
In particular, the Commission must investigate the 
veracity 
of 
allegations 
that 
the 
former 
Deputy 
Minister of Finance, Mr Mcebisi Jonas and Ms 
20 
Mentor were offered cabinet positions by the Gupta 
family.” 
 
Now the offer of cabinet positions is a matter which 
caused directly with the... but all those Terms of Reference, 
obviously, obliged you Chair to investigate matters, related 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 27 of 55 
 
to the conduct directly or the former President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think if you go back to... or maybe I can 
just have a look.  One point one, among others, that is of the 
Terms of Reference: 
“Among 
others, 
requires 
this 
Commission 
to 
investigate the veracity of allegations that former 
Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr Mcebisi Jonas and 
Ms Mentor were offered positions by the Gupta 
family.” 
 
Now, one of the matters on which Mr Zuma may assist 
10 
the Commission is this.  Mr Jonas gave evidence that on the 
23rd of October 2015, he met with one of the Gupta brothers 
and Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane at the Gupta 
residence. 
 
And he said the Gupta brother who appears to have been 
Tony Gupta, told him that Mr Nhlanhla Nene was going to be 
fired as Minister of Finance because he was not working with 
them and they wanted Mr Jonas to agree to the Minister of 
Finance and then if he would work with them.   
 
Six weeks after that, Mr Nhlanhla Nene was fired.  And 
20 
the media statement that was issued by Mr Zuma said that 
Mr Nhlanhla Nene had done a stunning job as the Minister of 
Finance. 
 
And it was said that Mr Nhlanhla Nene was dropped from 
cabinet because he was to be the government’s candidate for 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 28 of 55 
 
a position in the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Brics Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Brics Bank, I think.  But the job never 
happened.  And I have heard evidence from somebody from 
the bank who said that is not how the bank... that bank 
operates.  It has got policies and procedures and Mr Zuma 
had no say, had no power to force the bank to take Mr Jonas.   
 
Mr Jonas himself said the... his position as Minister of 
Finance was higher than the position that Mr Zuma was 
talking about in the bank. 
10 
 
And Mr Nene said, actually, the... Mr Zuma’s reason for 
dropping him, that he was to go to that job, was a 
fabrication.  That is what Mr Nene said before me under oath 
here. 
 
So the question is.  How come somebody from the Gupta 
family knew in advanced that Mr Nene was going to be fired?  
Then Mr Nene gets fired.  The President says:  This man has 
done a stunning job.  But he fires him, nevertheless. 
 
The man goes and stays at home.  The job that has... 
that the President talked about, does not materialise.  And 
20 
Mr Nene said:  He never even phoned me after I had left and 
sitting at home and to check whether anybody had contacted 
me about this job. 
 
And then, when Mr Jonas gave evidence, he said the 
Gupta brother who was in that meeting, among others things, 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 29 of 55 
 
said to him:  If you need advisors or you need support staff 
when you become Minister of Finance, we will provide. 
 
And the replacement of Mr Nene, Mr Van Rooyen - I 
have heard that evidence – comes to National Treasury on 
the first day of his appointment, comes with certain advisors 
and those advisors seem to have connections with the Gupta 
family. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Jonas says, at that meeting, the 
Gupta brother also told him that there are people that they 
10 
work with and he says one of them is Mr Brian Molefe, 
another one is Ms Lynne Brown, Minister of Public Enterprise 
at that time. 
 
And 
when 
Mr 
Gordhan 
gave 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission he said he heard that when he was fired in 2017 
by Mr Zuma, Mr Zuma told the Top Six of the ANC that he 
wanted to replace him with Mr Brian Molefe.  
 
And the Commission subsequently asked some members 
of the Top Six, Mr Gwede Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize and Ms 
Duarte, Jessie Duarte to depose to affidavits to say:  Do you 
20 
know anything about this?   
 
And the Commission has got affidavits from them.  They 
did not give any problems.  They supplied affidavits.   
 
And those affidavits do say, indeed Mr Zuma did suggest 
to the Top Six that he wanted to replace Mr Gordhan with Mr 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 30 of 55 
 
Brian Molefe.  The same Mr Brian Molefe that Mr Jonas says 
he was told by the Gupta brother worked... was working with 
the Gupta’s.   
 
And then of course, we all know, it is in the public 
domain that Mr Brian Molefe resigned from Eskom after the 
Public Protector’s report.   
 
I think he said he wanted to clear his name of whatever 
but later went to parliament.  I think he went to parliament 
about a month or two before Mr Gordhan was fired.  And then 
Mr Gordhan was fired.  Mister...  
10 
 
I think the three members of the ANC Top Six who have 
provided affidavits, said that the Top Six rejected Mr Zuma’s 
suggestion to replace Mr Gordhan with Mr Molefe.   
 
And then what we do know is that Mr Gordhan was then 
succeeded by Mr Gigaba.   
 
And what we do know, it is in the public domain, is that it 
did not take long after that before Brian Molefe resigned from 
parliament. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 And 
Mr 
Zuma 
must 
enlighten 
the 
20 
Commission on all of these matters. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, there are, apart 
from those Terms of Reference, there are other Terms of 
Reference where Mr Zuma’s evidence would be necessary for 
the Commission to complete its investigations adequately.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 31 of 55 
 
 
The 1.6 which talks about government advertising in the 
New Age Newspaper and other undue benefits to the Gupta 
family.   
 
There has been evidence directly implicating the former 
President.  Mr Sundaram’s evidence, for example, where you 
have asked for information from the former President which 
has not been forthcoming.   
 
So there are a number of... there is the evidence, for 
example, of the exchange and the study of the former 
President at his residence in Pretoria, Chair.  Where the 
10 
Gupta’s 
demanded 
“favours” 
from 
the 
then 
Minister 
Shabangu in relation to mining licenses.   
 
All those issues are issues that need to be addressed.  
And the evidence to date is replete with such examples 
where it is necessary for you Chair to investigate these 
matters as a matter of your Terms of Reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I mean, I am hearing evidence these 
days relating to Eskom.  And hearing evidence from Mr Tsotsi 
and from Mr Nick Linnell.  It is to the effect that, Ms Dudu 
Myeni called Mr Linnell to Pretoria and said you... I need you 
20 
to come and meet with the president.  He came.   
 
The president did not meet them then but then he was 
told:  Go to Durban.  They have been meeting at the 
President’s official residence on Sunday the 8t h of March.  
He went there.  Mr Tsotsi was called there.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 32 of 55 
 
 
And a discussion took place which was to the effect that 
there should be an inquiry into the affairs of Eskom and 
certain executives must be suspended.   
 
Ms Lynne Brown, I have read her affidavit that she has 
given to the Commission.  If I understood her evidence in the 
affidavit correctly.  She says she knew nothing about that 
meeting in Durban and yet, she was Minister of Public 
Enterprises.   
 
And both Mr Linnell and Mr Tsotsi say that President 
Zuma took part in that meeting.  I have seen the statement 
10 
by Ms Dudu Myeni who denies that Mr Zuma took part in that 
meeting. 
 
I have heard evidence that in regard to Eskom and a 
board 
meeting 
that 
was 
supposed 
to 
happen 
on 
the 
26t h of February, was cancelled because Mr Zuma called the 
chairperson of the board the night before and called the 
acting DG of the Department of Public Enterprises and said 
that meeting must be cancelled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the acting DG at the time says, when 
20 
the President called her because he said he could not find 
the minister or deputy minister.   
 
When she said:  But we cannot interfere.  Or something 
to that effect.  He says, Mr Zuma said:  Well, that meeting 
must be cancelled and dropped the phone.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 33 of 55 
 
 
Now with regard to Eskom.  The evidence that is 
unfolding and there are more witnesses who will come and 
maybe the picture will change when everybody has given 
evidence.   
 
But at this stage, the evidence that seems to emerge 
suggest that there may well be credence to the proposition 
that certain decisions that were made by the Eskom Board 
were dictated to the Exco Board from outside Eskom.   
 
And certain executives were removed.  And then Mr 
Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh from Transnet were then 
10 
seconded to Eskom to take some of the positions of the 
executives who were suspended and then allowed to leave or 
kicked out.   
 
And I have heard certain evidence about allegations 
relating to Mr Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh of Transnet, who 
were leading evidence of some of the people who the board 
had asked to Mr Brian Molefe and to Mr Anoj Singh when 
they were at Transnet, about money that they say they have 
got from the Gupta’s in the night and so on.   
 
Of course, they will come and give their evidence and 
20 
maybe one will get a different picture and maybe one would 
come to the conclusion that nothing like that ever happened.  
But these, all of these things cannot be ignored. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot ignore these things when I asked 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 34 of 55 
 
the question:  Should I call Mr Zuma to appear?  I cannot 
ignore those if I am going to do my job properly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   H’m, h’m.  And you have been 
cautious to say that no findings have been made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you have evidence before you 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...which requires investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And as night follows day, evidence 
implicating the former President must be examined, including 
through the evidence of the former President himself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There are other examples.  Chair, 
the record is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is replete. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...replete of such evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Direct interference in the activities of 
20 
law enforcement agencies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Appointments and dismissals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The meeting with Gavin Watson 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 35 of 55 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...in relation to the BOSASA 
prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those sorts of issues ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...need to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, there was evidence by some of 
the people who were senior officials within the Intelligence 
10 
community 
that 
their 
departments 
had... 
or 
units 
had 
conducted certain investigations of criminal nature.   
 
And the minister serving under Mr Zuma or State 
Security, Dr Cwele called one of them to a meeting at the 
airport where he told them, according to the evidence placed 
before 
me 
that 
President 
Zuma 
had 
said 
that 
the 
investigation should be stopped.  I need to look to all of 
those things. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How can I ignore those things? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How can I ignore all of those things?  And 
all I am doing, I am doing my job to establish exactly what 
happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 36 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that I can prepare reports that is based 
on evidence that has been presented by cross-section of 
people.  And if he is implicated, I am giving him an 
opportunity to come here and clear his name.   
 
But I want to know what he has to say about those 
things.  He might he does not want to clear his name.  That 
is fine.   
 
But I want to know what he knows about the things that 
have been said.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Chair, in summary then.  In 
10 
evidence before you and to date, and I stress to date, 
because there is more to come.   
 
Mr Zuma has been or may be implicated by the evidence 
of at least 34 witnesses.  That perhaps is enough to qualify, 
certainly under Section 3(1) of the act.   
 
Chair, in relation to the second issue that is why there is 
an added reason that it is necessary and desirable for a 
summons to be issued.  
 
The Commission, quite apart from its mandate, the law, 
but as a practical consideration, requires certainty in regard 
20 
to the fact of Mr Zuma’s appearance and the dates of his 
appearance. 
 
We are simply so close to the end of the Commission’s 
hearings that the proper and efficient functioning of the 
Commission would be rendered impossible unless we have 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 37 of 55 
 
that certainty and you are entitled to take that into account in 
the exercise of your discretion. 
 
The history of Mr Zuma’s cooperation or lack thereof 
with the Commission, is set out in the written submissions.  
Paragraphs 18 and 19, Chair, you during 2018, requested Mr 
Zuma 
through 
his 
legal 
representatives 
to 
provide 
a 
response to the evidence of Ms Mentor and Mr Maseko.  That 
has not been forthcoming. 
 
You 
will 
recall 
the 
well-known 
areas 
of 
interest 
undertaken.  There have been and this... the paragraphs of 
10 
the heads and perhaps, I should just mention one or two. 
 
The most recent undertaken.  Just to put that in its 
context.  At the last appearance of the former President 
where he seized to answer questions, to put it at its lightest. 
 
An arrangement was made and an agreement was 
reached that the legal team would provide a document 
containing areas of interest. 
 
There was an agreement and repeated promises that 
that areas of interest document would be responded to.  It 
has not been responded to.   
20 
 
In his opposing affidavit dated the 13t h of January 2020, 
that is the opposing affidavit to this application, Mr Zuma 
stated: 
“I will be sending the Commission my responses to 
the areas of interest sent to me.  This was already 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 38 of 55 
 
prepared but could not be completed when I fell ill.” 
 
Now we are ten months later Chair.  That document still 
has not been forthcoming. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in terms of the agreement that was 
reached on the 19t h of July, when he was before the 
Commission, you were... the legal team of the Commission 
were required to furnish his lawyers within, I think, two 
weeks with a document that would indicate the areas of 
interest in the various affidavits that he had to focus on and 
responding.  
10 
 
And the agreement was that, as far as I can recall, once 
you had furnished his lawyers with such a document, which 
you did around, I think, on the 30t h of July. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was slightly later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was in the first week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or first week, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of the following month. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Once you had done that... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am told it was the 30 t h, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think it was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But there were some administrative 
hiccup. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think a lot of ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In any event, it was delivered. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 39 of 55 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Once you had done that, you and Mr 
Zuma’s counsel were supposed to agree a date by when they 
would file his affidavit or affidavits.   
 
And if the two of you did not agree, the arrangement was 
that you would then bring that issue to me and I will decide 
the timeframe.   
 
Now from what I read, one, they did not file affidavits.  
Two, they did not... they do not seem to have reached any 
agreement with you.   
 
And they promised at some stage, I think from what I 
10 
read in the correspondence exchanged between yourself and 
them, that Mr Zuma’s affidavit or affidavits would be filed on 
the 13t h of September, last year.  That did not happen.   
 
Subsequently, they kept on promising that they would be 
filed.  They have never been filed.   
 
And no condonation application has been filed and no 
explanation, as far as I recall, has been proffered to say 
what is the difficulty to the extent that he may be saying in 
his affidavit, at a certain stage he fell ill and that impacted 
the preparation.   
20 
 
It seems that that was long after the deadline had 
happened.  And there was simply nothing coming from them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Chair there were repeated 
undertakings.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 40 of 55 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On 12t h September 2019, Mr Zuma’s 
attorneys confirmed that he would provide his answers to the 
areas of interest document previously provided to him.  And 
then Chair, on the 30t h of September, Mr Zuma’s attorneys 
requested a “indulgence” to provide the Commission with 
the answers to the areas of interest by 20 October 2019 
and simply after that nothing has been forthcoming.   
 
Even in January this year, in opposition to the 
application it said the document is ready, I just cannot 
finalise it.  Ten months later we still do not have the 
10 
document here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the import, let alone the 
implications of that are clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, Mr Zuma’s might not be here 
today 
but 
they 
had 
filed 
his 
affidavit 
opposing 
this 
application.  One of the issues that arises is this, when I 
invited Mr Zuma last year to appear before the Commission 
from the 15 to the 19 July, they criticised me for inviting 
him saying that that is not provided any rule saying in 
20 
terms of what rule are you inviting our client, you know?  
And when it was – you know, it was just a courtesy, you 
know, to say let us not issue a summons because he has 
promised to cooperate with the Commission, they seemed 
to have an objection to say why are you not acting in terms 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 41 of 55 
 
of the rules …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of which led to summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the legal time has now applied that 
I should authorise a summons, then they oppose that and 
say you make it as if he is not cooperating.  So when you 
act and show courtesy and say come and appear before the 
Commission without issuing a summons, you are criticised.  
When you say okay, let us issue a summons, then you are 
criticised. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then you not being polite. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, there are many people who have 
been requested by the Commission to appear before the 
Commission and they have never had any hesitation.  We 
have told, you know, Mr Zuma’s attorneys before – I was 
looking at the correspondence here, that I told the 
President, current President that before the Commission 
finishes its work it would be important that he comes and 
gives evidence before the Commission because the matters 
that 
the 
Commissioner 
is 
looking 
at, 
state 
capture, 
happened at a time when he was Mr Zuma’s deputy.  The 
20 
current President had no hesitation, he said you are right, I 
am going to come.  You tell me when I must come and I will 
come and I said the ANC must also come and I was told the 
ANC has no hesitation to come.  
 
The Commission has approached other leaders of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 42 of 55 
 
the ANC, Mr Mantashe, and asked them to file affidavits 
without compelling them and they responded by filing 
affidavits.  Mr Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize, Ms Jessie 
Duarte, the President himself was asked, without being 
compelled, to file an affidavit about whether had had any 
interactions with the Guptas.  He filed his affidavit, he did 
not have to be compelled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not complain that there was no 
rule for making such a request. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Chair, I must stress that the 
application by the legal team has not been prompted by the 
notion, which is a preposterous notion, frankly, that you are 
not allowed to issue polite invitations because the law does 
not expressly say, you know, you may do so.  There are 
good legal and factual grounds quite apart from that.  But 
the proposition that you are not entitled by law to issue a 
polite 
invitation 
to 
witnesses 
to 
come 
before 
the 
Commission to give evidence voluntarily cannot stand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I mean, all it seems is I am not 
20 
supposed to ask him to come, I am not supposed to 
authorise a summons to be issues to compel him to come, 
so …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But when you do… 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess I am supposed to just fold my 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 43 of 55 
 
hands and not do anything. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The test, of course, is 
you have a duty, you have a discretion, you have a 
mandate and you have the power and that must be 
exercised reasonably in terms of discretion and all the 
facts that are incontrovertible, Chair, and I will deal with 
some more now and make it certainly beyond, in our 
submission, any doubt that that discretion would be 
reasonably exercised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the one question that I think you 
10 
will need to deal with is to the – it is two questions, one is 
whether 
when 
the 
point 
Section 
3.1 
says 
that 
the 
Commission has got power to summon witnesses, we know 
that this Act is a 1947 Act, it is very old, at that time there 
was only one way of summoning that could happen.  One 
question is whether that summoning in this day and age 
would include summoning a witness to appear and give 
evidence by video link or in any other way that may be 
done with technology.  I raise that because you will 
remember that in his attorney’s letters one of the things 
20 
they say is that because of his age and Covid-19 his 
doctors have advised him to limit his movement. 
 
So the normal way of – when a summons is issued 
in any court to be served on somebody to appear before 
that court, it means that that person must physically come 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 44 of 55 
 
to the court. 
 
Now 
the 
question 
of 
Covid-19 
may 
well 
be 
something that needs to be looked at.  I do not have a 
problem if – I will not have a problem if he were to say for 
Covid-19 reasons I would prefer to give evidence via video 
link.  As long as he does so within the borders of the 
Republic and not from outside, I would not have a problem, 
I have indeed authorised the giving of evidence by some 
witnesses via video link.  I think one of them was Mr 
Mkhwanazi who asked when – I do not know which level, at 
10 
level we were in, said for Covid-19 reasons he was 
reluctant to travel and he asked if he could give evidence 
via video link, I authorised that, it happened.  So I could do 
the same with Mr Zuma if he has a legitimate reason that 
because of his age. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but the question is whether 
summon witnesses as used in Section 3.1 is wide enough 
to encompass that meaning.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course maybe if it does not, if it not 
wide enough to encompass that meaning, it may be that the 
summons might include something to which we will say if 
he wishes to give evidence via video link and he advises 
the 
Commission 
timeously 
on 
those 
dates 
then 
his 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 45 of 55 
 
appearance, 
via 
video 
link, 
will 
be 
deemed 
to 
be 
compliance with the summons.  I am not sure.  What do you 
say about that issue? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The section has a 
timeless 
element 
to 
it 
because 
it 
says 
you, 
as 
a 
Commissioner, have the powers that the High Court has 
and that power has been interpreted and applied over time.  
In fact the legal team has done an opinion on this which we 
can let you have, obviously, but I do think it is somewhere 
in your own archives as well, the many files that you have.   
10 
I am told that there is no sound, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps it is important that there 
should be sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is important. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Purely coincidental, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I should adjourn while they 
are attending to it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  We will adjourn for a few minutes.  
20 
Hopefully they can sort out the sound quickly.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand the sound is back. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes thank you Chair.  Chair we 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 46 of 55 
 
were dealing with the import and meaning in today’s 
technological age of the provisions of Section 31 of 1947 
Commission’s Act.  The powers of the Court ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius, I just wanted to 
say – I just wanted to say that the regulations of this 
Commission, which were promulgated by Mr Zuma when he 
was President include Regulation 10[6] and Regulation 
10[6] says: 
“For the purposes of conducting an investigation the 
Chairperson may direct any person to submit an 
10 
affidavit or affirmed declaration or to appear before 
the Commission to give evidence or to produce any 
document in his or her possession or under his or 
her control, each has a bearing on the matter being 
investigated and may examine such person.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair and those regulations 
have been promulgated under the amended 1947 Act, which 
says that the President may issue regulations to expand 
the powers of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair the 1947 Act, which gives 
powers to the Commission which are equivalent to the 
powers of the High Court is instructed, because the powers 
of the High Court have been developed over time through 
the application of the summons provisions and the giving of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 47 of 55 
 
evidence provisions to take account of technology.  There 
is the judgment of Satchwell, J, the technology of the video 
link is now accepted both in other jurisdictions and South 
Africa as an efficient and effective way of providing oral 
evidence both in chief and in cross-examination and that 
this is simply another tool for securing effective access to 
justice.    
 
We have the example of children giving evidence 
via 
video 
link, 
we 
have 
the 
example 
of 
in 
camera 
witnesses, or witnesses who don’t give evidence directly 
10 
but over video and sound links, so there is no reason why a 
person whose immunity is threatened by Covid conditions 
shouldn’t 
also 
be 
catered 
for 
under 
the 
expanded 
technological rubric of the giving of evidence. 
 
Of course you make the qualification which is 
important that the witness must be within the jurisdiction of 
the Court, so that the evidence that is given can be 
accounted for in terms of the law within the borders of the 
country.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the one approach may be to take 
20 
the summoning to be wide enough to include a video link, 
another approach might be what I said earlier on to have 
the summoning as it would be in a summons but to have 
something that says either maybe in the summons that 
says if the witness, if Mr Zuma through arrangements with 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 48 of 55 
 
the Commission appears via video link on the days that are 
specified that will be deemed to be compliance with the 
summons. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair.  In fact I think that has 
been provided for in other cases specifically in camera 
witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because then it gives him an 
opportunity that if he has no problem giving evidence but 
he has a problem because of his age and Covid 19 then 
that is taken care of, it can’t be advance as a reason for 
10 
not appearing whereas if that is not done he might say the 
Covid situation is a good enough reason for me not to 
appear so but if one – if that is dealt with that way then he 
can’t advance that, that reason. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, yes.   And the powers that 
you have are based in statute as well as in regulations 
which have been empowered by statute expressly, as well 
as the general power that during the charge of the 
procedures, and this is essentially given the authority is a 
procedural matter. 
20 
 
Chair if I may just finish the list of issues where the 
former President has been requested to assist you in your 
investigations.   
 
You requested the President to respond to the 
application 
made 
by 
Ms 
Reddy 
Tlabe, 
that 
was 
an 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 49 of 55 
 
application made by her to give evidence and to cross-
examine the former President, arising out of his own 
evidence and in that respect a request was made and there 
has been no response to that.  
 
You have issued at least two 10.6 directives, the 
provision to which you have just referred Chair, requiring 
him to respond, and this is more than an invitation Chair, 
this is an exercise of the compulsory power, to respond to 
the evidence of Messrs Tsotsi, Linnell and Matona and to 
respond to the evidence of Mr Popo Molefe in the Eskom 
10 
and in the PRASA matters respectively.  Those have not 
been complied with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well one of those, I forget which one, 
was I signed the regulation 10.6 directive, I think on the 
28 t h of August.  That may have been the one relating to the 
affidavit of Mr Tsotsi and so on, or it may have been the 
one relating to Mr Popo Molefe’s affidavit in evidence about 
PRASA issues and subsequently I signed another directive 
requiring Mr Zuma to file affidavits.   
 
So this is different, in the past there was a request 
20 
in 2018, that request has never been complied with, there 
was an undertaking that the he would file an affidavit 
dealing with responding to General Maseku’s evidence and 
Ms Mentoor ’s evidence.  That has never been filed. 
 
Then last year when he 
appeared before the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 50 of 55 
 
Commission there was an agreement, you referred to it 
...[intervenes]  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 Yes 
followed 
up 
by 
several 
promises. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and agreement that was concluded 
with him through his lawyers, and which I announced 
publically and I remember after announcing the terms of 
that agreement I called upon you and his counsel to 
confirm that I had correctly recorded the terms and both of 
you confirmed and he had agreed through his lawyers to 
10 
file 
an 
affidavit, 
or 
affidavits 
responding 
to 
various 
affidavits of witnesses who ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The areas of interest documents? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that affidavit, those affidavits have 
never been furnished, so whether you request him to file an 
affidavit you request him nicely, you don’t get an affidavit.  
Whether there is an agreement with his lawyers or an 
affidavit he will file affidavits, you don’t get those affidavits 
and 
now 
when 
you 
issue 
a 
directive, 
because 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which came as a criminal sanction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The directive now carries a 
criminal sanction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now the last time I heard was that 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 51 of 55 
 
the directive that I issued on the 28 t h of August compelling 
him to file an affidavit I cannot remember whether it was in 
regard to the Eskom matter and the Durban meeting or 
whether it was in regard to PRASA, but the deadline which 
had been given the last time I had it had come and gone 
and he had not filed any affidavit and in regard to another 
one I suspect that the deadline has come and gone, but I 
don’t – I haven’t been told whether he has filed an 
affidavit. 
 
So whether you make a request nicely he won’t file 
10 
an affidavit.  Whether you reach an agreement with him 
and he undertakes to file an affidavit he won’t file it.  When 
I issue a directive in terms of the regulations, at least in 
regard to one he did not file an affidavit within the time 
that was given and to my knowledge he did not file an 
application to request an extension of time and in terms of 
the regulations as amended failure to comply with a 
directive issued by the Chairperson in terms of Regulation 
10[6] failing to comply with it without sufficient cause is a 
criminal offence. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.  Chair there were two 
further invites of a less formal nature to respond to Mr 
Human’s 
affidavit 
dealing 
with 
the 
evidence 
of 
Mr 
Sunderam and an invitation to respond to the affidavits of 
Mr Megwe and Ms Pillay also dealing with the evidence of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 52 of 55 
 
Mr Sunderam, those have not been complied with either. 
 
Importantly for the question of an appearance Chair 
you have set aside at least five separate weeks in the 
calendar of the Commission for the appearance of Mr 
Zuma, which have not been adhered to and what you 
directed Chair was that if he wasn’t to appear or had good 
reason not to appear he should make formal application, 
that hasn’t been received either. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was never done. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There has never been a formal 
10 
application, we have always had to deal with allegations 
and correspondence, and of course that is more than just a 
formal 
requirement 
because 
if 
Mr 
Zuma’s 
legal 
representatives were to come before you to make an 
application not to appear in any one of those five weeks 
you would have the opportunity of interrogating that.   If it 
is just simply sent to you in a letter you don’t have that 
opportunity at all, so it is more than just a procedural 
requirement it is a substantive requirement.  
 
So Chair in summary then, unless there is any 
20 
further issue you want to raise the two questions really 
before you are would it be a reasonable exercise of the 
power 
that 
you 
have 
to 
issue 
summons 
in 
these 
circumstances, given the terms of reference, given your 
duties, given the provisions of Section 31, given the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 53 of 55 
 
provisions of Section 10[6] that must be answered in the 
affirmative.  There are the added considerations that we 
have just outlined that make it practically necessary for 
summons to be issued and we therefore ask for an order in 
terms of the amended Notice of Application. 
ORDER 
Having read the affidavits placed before me and having 
listened to submissions made by counsel representing the  
Commission’s legal team I am satisfied that this is a matter 
in which I should grant the application.    
10 
 
I am satisfied that a proper case has been made out for an 
order authorising that the Secretary of the Commission 
should sign and issue a summons against Mr Jacob 
Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, former President of the Republic of 
South Africa to appear before the Commission at ten 
o’clock on the 16 t h to the 20 t h of November 2020 in this 
venue on each one of those days, therefore I am going to 
make the following order: 
 
20 
1. The Secretary of the Commission is hereby authorised 
and directed to sign and issue a summons in terms of 
Section 3 [1] read with [2] of the Commissions Act H 
of 1947 requiring Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, 
former President of the Republic of South Africa to 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 54 of 55 
 
appear before the Commission at ten o’clock on the 
16 t h to the 20 t h of November 2020, both days inclusive 
for 
purposes 
of 
giving 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission 
and 
being 
questioned 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain certain matters relating to the subject of the 
investigations of the Commission. 
 
2. Should 
Mr 
Jacob 
Gedleyihlekisa 
Zuma 
make 
appropriate arrangements with the Commission prior 
to the dates referred to above to give evidence via 
10 
video link and he subsequently gives evidence on 
those days via video link that will be deemed to be 
sufficient compliance with the summons, and the 
Secretary of the Commission should include advice or 
words to this effect in the summons so that Mr Zuma 
will know that such appearance will be deemed to be 
sufficient compliance with the summons. 
 
Is there something that I am ...[intervenes]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No Chair that is – we will assist the 
20 
Secretary in the drafting of the summons in accordance 
with your order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  That is the order I am making. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.   May we be 
excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are excused.  We will take a 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 55 of 55 
 
short adjournment and once the witness here for today is 
ready then I will be called. 
 
We adjourn.
