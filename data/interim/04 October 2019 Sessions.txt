PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE 4 OCTOBER 2019  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are starting late because of partly me, partly 
matters of the commission.  Okay let us – are you ready?  Let us start 
if you are ready. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are ready DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  DCJ I thought I should just place on 
10 
record that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  After your enquiry yesterday regarding 
local dairy companies and the contact that was made with them our 
investigators have tried to work on that overnight.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And have been able to find two 
documents.  One appears to be a report – a feasibility study.  As soon 
as that comes to hand – a hard copy comes to hand I will make sure 
that my colleague Mr Buthelezi gets a copy.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that Mr Thabethe can look at it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 3 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The second one is I think are a couple of 
affidavits that deal with the same issue that appeared to be in the 
bundle that the NPA had. Again as soon as those documents are to 
hand we will give Mr Buthelezi a copy again so that Mr Thabethe can 
deal with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As I understand matters Mr Thabethe has  
in any event requested that he prepares a supplementary affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He may wish to deal with those matters.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And whatever else in that affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In relation to the questions Mr Thabethe 
good morning again. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Good morning. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We were yesterday going through your 
annexures.  The annexures to your 2017 affidavit.  Those are to be 
20 
found in Exhibit HH10 Volume B.  And that is the volume that starts with 
your 2017 affidavit and then has tabs where all the annexures ought to 
be. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you good with that?  Thank you.  The 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 4 of 203 
 
DCJ will have to hear whether you are comfortable with what I have 
said or not. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair I wanted just to interject.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If the Chair would allow me to make a 
statement regarding the discussion we had yesterday.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair thank you very much.  
Maybe Chair I need to come back and maybe the statement that I made 
might not have been appropriate regarding the issue of the media.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am aware we made a debate 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Regarding the media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Stopping the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja what I am saying maybe it might 
not have been appropriate to say it is the media that stopped the 
20 
project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I think what is correct is that af ter the 
media article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 5 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then there were a lot of enquiries 
that were made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And during that period maybe two 
things that happened.  The one which I have referred yesterd ay which 
led to treasury doing an investigation. And the second one which was 
the media enquiry that was also made to Paras which also made them 
to – to be very reluctant to proceed because of the – of the status of 
the project because Paras was – is a multinational company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So they get worried about the – the 
media.  So that is the issue not necessarily meaning that it is the media 
that stopped the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I think that is what I want to 
[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To clarify.  Okay no that is fine.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Mr Thabethe.  We were dealing 
with Annexure 6 if you go to Tab 6.  And it is a report that we have 
actually dealt with largely in your  previous evidence.  I would just like 
20 
you to deal with one small aspect that I do not believe we have touched 
on and that you will find on page 316 under Processing Plant.  The 
reason of that I have a great interest as a – the evidence leader in the 
processing plant of course you know is because that is money that 
Estina/Paras was going to be providing.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 6 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Now this state of the art 
ISO9001/2000 and HACCP certified facility that they were going to put 
up you mention it in that report in the very last paragraph.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you maybe we are not as technically 
inclined as you are can you just explain what exactly they were 
supposed to put up because this is what you were expecting from them. 
This certified facility. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair why we had included that 
10 
those are the certification already they were having in their 
possessions.  Those are the assessment that a re being made and then 
if a company meets those requirements then they are given those 
certificates which determine a certain level of compliance.  So hence 
then we refer to them.  So it is a very technical kind of a certificate that 
is given that qualifies you to be able to issue – to be able to do 
processing at that level. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So it is a certificate that says that they 
have the capacity and capability to do processing at the level at which 
you had specked was specified the processing pl ant? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  It helps.  Because we will 
later on deal with what exactly they did then put up and we will come 
back to this. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 7 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And again we will rely on your 
assessment. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And your knowledge on this.  MPT7 which 
is the next annexure we have dealt with.  Because of the presentation 
that we have just spoken about the MPT the annexure 6 you then were 
able to secure resolution from the Provincial cabinet.  MPT8 the next 
tab, annexure 8 we have not received.  This is the invitation letter that 
you would have received – I beg your pardon – you would have sent to 
the CEO of Paras.  If you go to paragraph 12 of your affidavit MPT8 is 
10 
dealt with there.  So if you go to paragraph 12 just same document – 
same document.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry we are going to his affidavit?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Same file – his affidavit, same file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC: The same file just the beginning Chairman.  
And we go to page 247 of the same file.  You mention here that you 
invited the CEO of Paras by way of a letter.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  All I am saying is we do not have that.  I 
20 
do not know if you want to add anything at all but I am saying I do not 
know if you still have a copy of that letter.  It is not in the file.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay.  Yes Chair the – it was when 
this affidavit was deposed a copy of that letter was attached.  It is one 
of those documents that are no longer in – in my possession Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 8 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is fine.  I do not think anything in 
particular turns on it be cause we know that Mr Kumar did come to 
South Africa.  We have discussed that previously.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then 9 if you go to Tab 9 that is the 
original project proposal by Estina dated the 15 May 2012. We have 
dealt with that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In our previous hearings. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At the end of that you have annexed the 
deviation – what we have been callin g the deviation memorandum.  
Again it is something we have dealt with.  And that deviation 
memorandum would have been MPT9.  Okay?  It is just at the end after 
8 comes 9. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay thank Chair yes it is that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you will find it there.  We have dealt 
with that – that issue. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct.  Thanks. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We then move onto 10 which is the 
20 
acceptance of the proposal.  You have again dealt with that.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETH E:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In your evidence. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the only point I want to confirm with 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 9 of 203 
 
you is that though you mention a partnership agreement in paragraph 2 
of this letter you have explained that you had not intended to establish 
a PPP.  That is my understanding of your evidence.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If you can repeat again Chair I am not 
[indictinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What I will actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do is read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Read the sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me put – let me say she is saying she 
understands your evidence  to be to the effect that you did not at any 
stage intend to establish public / private partnership.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No that is correct, that is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the only reason I ask for confirmation 
20 
is because this paragraph 2 mentions a partnership agreement.  Just to 
make sure that we are on the same page.  Thank you.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  We then go to 11 – 
Annexure 11. We did not receive that.  It  refers to the verification of 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 10 of 203 
 
account details and this verification was supposed to be done by the 
Provincial Treasury.  Again I do not think much turns on that.  We will 
deal with matters relating to the Provincial Treasury when the Treasury 
witness or witnesses come in.  MPT12 is the agreement of the 7 July it 
is also called the Agreement of the 5 July.  We have traversed much of 
the content of this agreement previously.  There are just a couple of 
things that we had not looked at in that agreement which  I would like 
you to just give a short explanation on.  The first is – so if you go to 12 
which is the agreement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am there Chair. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you look at Note 11.2 or Clause 11.2.  
The heading there is Intellectual – Ownership of Intellectual Property.  
And what I understand you to have agreed with Estina here is they must 
and I underline the word must return without delay to the department all 
materials in their possession which belonged to the department.  Most 
importantly is the next bit.   
“Regardless of whether or not such materials were 
originally supplied by the department to Estina.” 
You are comfortable with that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And there is no further explanation that 
your understanding is the same.  Estina had to give everything back to 
you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Back to – yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Hm.   
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 11 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to refresh my memory we did deal with the 
agreement at quite some length  earlier but I – and I do know that one 
of the issues I think I raised with you was the fact that this agreement 
was with Estina and not with Paras.  Is that right?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  My memory is not very clear now by the way did 
you say there was some agreement that the department had with Paras 
– separate agreement or was there just a letter?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair the agreement was between 
the Memorandum of Understanding was between Estina an d Paras.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But there was no – nothing – there is no 
agreement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Directly between Paras and the department?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And the department – no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  There was some mention I think of some letter 
maybe it was a letter from Paras saying Estina would be their partner 
or something. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just a letter? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was just a letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was addressed to the department.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Department yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because I know that you – you said I think that 
from your point of view your partnership was with Paras and Estina was 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 12 of 203 
 
Paras’ partner or agent or something ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But it would seem and this is maybe a point that 
we did deal with before but I just want to ma ke sure.  So it would seem 
that for all intents and purposes in terms of records the only entity that 
you had as a department you had a partner – an agreement with or a 
partnership with was Estina?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have dealt with 11.  Can you please 
look at Clause 12 Financial Control and it says:  
“This agreement is subject to the provisions of the Public Finance 
20 
Management Act 1999”  
What had you intended here Mr Thabethe if you could explain?  
Because this is part of your agreement wit h Estina. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair – Chair this means that we 
will – we will do all transactions in line with the PFMA.  That is what it 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 13 of 203 
 
is saying. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see I ask the question because we 
have had discussions around transfer payments. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
1. We have had discussions around the how the PMFA gives effect 
to Section 217 of The Constitution.  
2. We have had discussions around the Treasury regulations and 
how those too of course give effect ultimately to Section 217.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is [indistinct]. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My understanding of your evidence has 
been that the transfer payment – well first monies that were paid to 
Estina were transfer payments?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How were you going to account for those 
transfer payments within the framework of the Public Finance 
Management Act that is all I am asking you to explain?  You may have 
done so before but… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you could just go over it. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair transfer payment are in the 
PFMA. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you just take us through the 
particular portions that you think are d irectly relevant to this?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I may not be able to do it right 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 14 of 203 
 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes no, no, that is fine but your understanding 
is that there are provisions that deal with that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Transfer payment yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can – can… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you then explain your essential 
understanding of how you would be holding Estina to account with the 
PFMA in your hand?  And the reason I ask this is because I do not know 
10 
if I should just bring it forward rather than leave it where it is.  There is 
an Auditor General report. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That speaks to monitoring etcetera.  Can I 
deal with it where I have put it?  It somewhere towards the end?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I have understood from the Auditor 
General report which we will look at.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That there is a monitoring mechanism.  I 
20 
just thought you might be able to talk us through that monitoring 
mechanism?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair the – what we had set up in 
the department for monitoring is that on a monthly basis we going to 
get monthly reports – monthly financial reports.  And on a quarterly 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 15 of 203 
 
basis we will also get quarterly reports.  Now the payment was paid in 
tranches so that in any event you have a problem you will then be able 
to say wait let us talk to this report before you proceed.  So those 
mechanisms were in place.  Now on an annual basis then the Auditor 
General also comes in and they also go inside they do their monitoring 
and they do their assessment and they issue a report in that regard.  
So monitoring mechanisms are in place in the department and also 
oversight outside the department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  I know I can explore that 
further with different examples but I am – I am – I understand what you 
10 
saying.  Can we then look at Clause 15.3?  15.3 is part of the 
termination set of clauses and it is – it is a bit of a tricky one when you 
look at the proviso which is the last two lines of that paragraph.  Maybe 
again it is useful Chairman just to read the whole provision in because 
it is going to come up again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In relation to the FDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe would you like to read that 
into the record please?  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair are you referring to 15.11. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No Sir.  15.3 on page 349. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Exhaustion of Funds. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 16 of 203 
 
“It is also agreed that should funds no longer be 
available to pay for the execution of the project the 
department may terminate this agreement in its own 
discretion or temporarily suspend all or part of the 
project by notice to Estina who shall immediately 
make arrangement to stop the performance of the 
project and minimise further expenditure.  Provided 
that Estina shall hereupon be entitled to payment in 
full for the services delivered up to the date of 
termination or suspension.” 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So my question is, can you just clarify 
what the services delivered would be in the same sentence?   
“So Estina shall be entitled to payment in full for the 
services delivered.”  
What are those services?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair there could be a range of 
services.  There could be work done, paid for but maybe the 
department did not pay for them. It could have been ord ers that would 
have been placed for delivery.  It could have been work done hence the 
choice of services so that you cover all areas that money was spent for 
20 
but not paid for by the department.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The reason I have been struggling with 
this since you started giving evidence is because we know that Estina 
was appointed as both an implementing agent and a management 
agent. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 17 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now nobody goes into an arrangement 
without there be some commercial value for them.  And I have been 
grappling with how they were paid either as implementing agent – was 
there a fixed fee?  Or as the management agent.  Can I maybe give you 
the example of FDC which seems a little easier for certainly for me? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because with the FDC there appears to be 
a fixed contract price and I – you will talk about it later.  I have 
assumed that that price was the – the payment for being an 
10 
implementing agent.  Then they sub-contracted to E’tsho Civils who 
were being paid a separate amount and I have assumed – I will – all 
subject to what you will be telling us later that that payment would then 
be for the managing agent part of things.  So the FDC arrangement is a 
little easier for me to understand.  I cannot quite grasp the same 
differentiation between implementing agents and how they are paid 
here?  Can you help me with that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair the FDC one was very clear 
because they were required to do management but in this instance 
when you have a responsibility to set up a project then when you set up 
20 
a project it means you are setting up the project you cannot then claim 
management fee until you hand over the project.  It means it is your 
responsibility to look after the assets until it comes to a stage when 
you say now I am done with the project I am handing it over.  It is 
completed.  Then beyond that then you can charge management fee.  If 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 18 of 203 
 
then you hand it over and you are not able to get the  owner to receive 
it.  But my understanding is that we should not – they should not be 
claiming management fee other than direct cost.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For work done? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Direct cost. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or for items procured? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes direct cost then should be paid.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see Mr Thabethe I really just want to 
debate this for a bit and I suppose I also have the shareholding 
structure in mind where originally you had 49% going to Estin a and 51% 
10 
of the original Zaina[?] if you remember which was then going to 
become Mohoma Mobung. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Going to the beneficiaries. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So there Estina would be a shareholder 
and I can see the commercial benefit for them as equity holders they 
would be getting payment of some kind.  That shareholding did not 
come into this agreement did it?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  The – you will remember 
20 
that it – after I had been advised by the state law advisors we ended up 
with this agreement versus the first agreement.  Now this agreement 
was saying first finish the project before the shareholding kicks in, do 
and finish it and then you revert back to the shareholding structures.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I beg your pardon were you going to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 19 of 203 
 
continue? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No I am… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You finished? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So what was in it for Estina here?  You 
know in Johannesburg it is – when I got here it is an expression I learnt 
what is in it for me.  What was in – what value was Estina going to get 
out of its association with this project?   Were they happy just to assist 
and not get anything at all? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As an investor? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not know explain to me. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They would have a shareholding.  
Remember the shares that we had agreed on will then be held by 
Estina.  It means they  were working as an investor. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I thought you said that arrangement 
was not carried forward in to the new July agreement.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Immediately.  The advice that is why 
the agreement was revised so that it does not say outright that this is 
the shareholding.  Finish the project, the construction and once it is 
finished Chair then – then you transfer the whole asset into the 
20 
shareholding structure.  Then that shareholding structure is the one 
where everybody then will be holding shares.  Because I am sure you – 
we have looked at it on the letter that was sent by the state law 
advisors to advise us to say at any given point if the beneficiaries 
whoever was there would then decide we are the owners they would 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 20 of 203 
 
sell their shares even before you finish it.  That is why the decision was 
saying finish the project and then transfer the entire project into that 
structure which is a shareholding structure.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now when you started this was supposed 
to be a two year project, am I correct when this started it was supposed 
to be completed in about two years?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is a three year project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What – three year project.  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you are saying Estina was happy to 
10 
wait until year three before it reaped any real benefits from the project 
because that is when you would bring them into the shareholding?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that – was that the arrangement?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That was my understanding Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was that arrangement written anywhere?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I understood it that they signed 
this agreement that did not carry the wording of the first agreement 
which means they understood this agreement when they entered and 
signed it. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you share the opinion of the State 
Attorney with them and tell them why they would have to wait the three 
years before they became shareholders?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we did Chair when we submitted 
the second agreement.  They - they were able to - to see that it will not 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 21 of 203 
 
be in - in it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the fact that they started putting 
money into the project is confirmation of the fact that they - I am just 
trying to understand what you saying - is confirmed - was confirmation 
to you that they understood the terms?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am going to explore with you a little later 
when we look at the monthly and the quarterly reports …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And a line item that says Directors fees.  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we will talk about those.  You can think 
about it and I will show you the line item and in the context of this 
discussion … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of this discussion, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will then ask you to explain what those 
Directors fees might be. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Alright.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have now understood 15.3 for services 
delivered but strictly and it is the next one that I wanted us to look at is 
20 
invoices.  I think somewhere here we talk - you talk about invoices 
must be presented at - on a regular basis.  In fact it was 13.5.  We 
dealt with invoices.  If you just go a page back.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  So those services deliver ed you 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 22 of 203 
 
could easily assess because you would have an invoice …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Invoice.  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That backed up the services that they 
were claiming for? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am good.  If we then look at Clause 1 -9 - 
19.2.  It is under miscellaneous.  It is on page 3 -5-1.  It is - it reads: 
“Estina shall not sub - subcontract with any person 
for the carrying out of any of its obligations under 
this agreement without in each case the prior 
10 
written consent of the department which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.”  
That is an important clause. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is part of your monitoring as I  
understand it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Were you able to give effect to this 
clause?  Were you able to put it into operation?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair, I am - I am thinking whether 
20 
there was any discussion we held on subcontracting because 
subcontracting means you are getting somebody to - to implement a 
portion on your behalf.  It is different from appointing a contractor to do 
that.  So I - I may not remember exactly whether we had anybody to be 
subcontracted. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 23 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You - you see just by way of example 
again I will deal with it when we are dealing with the - what I call the 
financials. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are going to be talking about the 
feasibility study.  Remember in Phase 1 …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We dealt with October  2012 the feasibility 
study was conducted and completed …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And they were able to show you the - and 
we have a - a feasibility study here in the bundle of documents.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There are people who conducted that 
feasibility study. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I would want to know and it is a group 
of people who are - from my recollection not South African.  So I would 
want to know from you whether 19.2 would have been applicable to 
those particular people conducting the feasibility study.  So aga in you 
20 
may want to reflect on that and when we get to the specific example 
say to me oh I know these people. 
I signed off on them coming in.  There gateway invoices I am 
going to be presenting to you and you say oh I know these people.  I 
signed off on them giving us particular or giving the - the - Estina 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 24 of 203 
 
certain items even though they were subcontracted.  Okay.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that is my interest in 19.2.  I just want 
you to bear it in mind when we get to looking at those invoices. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But the principle of the matter is in terms 
of 19.2 subcontractors had to be vetted by the depa rtment? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is the principle … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is recorded here.  Implementation 
Mr Thabethe is what we always come back to at the end  of the day.  So 
it will be implementation.  How did we implement 19.2?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Point two. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja.  We then look at just one aspect; no 
let us look at MPT13 which is the presentation you made to D -A-F-F to 
DAFF the National Department.  So it is 13 - flag 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you moving away from the agreement?  
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Maybe before that Mr  Thabethe some of the 
questions that I might ask you about the questions that linked to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 25 of 203 
 
questions that we dealt with before but it has been quite some time.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see we talked a few minutes ago about the fact 
that the records of the department would only show Estina as being the 
department’s partner in this project.  Is that right?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because the agreement was with Estina.  Excuse 
me - and - and it did not say that Estina was entering into the 
agreement as an agent of - of Paras.  You would know that it did not 
say that even though that might have some legal issues that maybe 
10 
only lawyers can - would look at. 
I do not want to be unfair to you but it was Estina in ter ms of 
the agreement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The agreement.  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now I see that - in terms of the agreement 
Clause 8.1.1 which is at page 3-4-5 the parties say: 
“Estina warrants that it is the counterpart of Paras.”  
I pause to say whatever counterpart means.  
“…it is the counterpart of Paras and the sole 
provider for the services and the project.”  
20 
That seems to suggest to me - and I would like your comment 
- that seems to suggest to me that that clause meant that the 
department could not if services that Estina was supposed to provide in 
terms of the agreement could not go to somebody else.  In other words 
you could not go to Paras and say you know you people are not 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 26 of 203 
 
providing services - the services - the agreed services satisfactorily 
because you had signed an agreement that said Estina was the sole 
provider of those services. 
Paras would say no we might have some arrangement with 
Paras but you cannot sue us or you cannot come to us.  Do you wish to 
comment on that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  The - 
the understanding that I had on that statement was that we expected a 
certain level of - of deliverables in the project that should be certified 
by Paras to say.  We - we will be able to deliver  what we had agreed 
10 
on, on this project in terms of the standard.  
It - it would then be a problem if we bring somebody else and 
say construct one, two, three and then they come back and say but that 
that does meet our standard.  Then it becomes our problem .  Hence - 
hence we say Estina being a counterpart will always be directed by 
Paras to say to meet our standard this is how it should be done.  
So they cannot come back and say we have constructed this 
role because we did not understand how it should have b een done.  
Hence - hence we say then they should be the sole provider so that we 
- we should not have a misunderstanding.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you see the sole provider in terms of that 
clause of the services as I understand it.  You might have a differe nt 
understanding.  The sole provider is said to be Estina.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So what I am - what I am putting to you is it 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 27 of 203 
 
seems to me therefore that if anything went wrong with the services 
that Estina was supposed to provide to the department in terms of this 
project the only people that you could legitimately really complain to 
would be Estina because it was Estina who was the sole provider.  
They were not the sole provider - they were not the provider 
or co provider of the services with Paras.  They were the sole provider 
of the services. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You - you accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  We - we accept Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair also in - in the earlier 
discussion we had …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Was that this - this was done so for - 
for litigation purposes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because if we - if we would have 
brought in Paras … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Into the agreement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then international issues then kicks 
in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but there is nothing wrong with international 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 28 of 203 
 
issues. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know you are not a lawyer but …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you need to involve international issues to 
protect yourself and to protect taxpayers money why not bring in those 
international issues because remember we discussed this earlier within 
the context of the fact that you did not ensure that there was proper 
checking of what Estina business was.  
Maybe I am inaccurate in - in putting this - putting it that way 
10 
but even its financial situation was not checked. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think last time.  It was revealed that I think on 
the day on which they signed the agreement or around the day when 
they signed the agreement they had only about R16,00 in the bank 
account. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is in that context because as I said previously 
part of what one is looking at is to what extent was this project handled 
in a manner that protected taxpayers’ money in light  of what we know 
20 
happened.  So - so this question that the sole provider of the services 
was Estina and that is put in the agreement means that for example to 
the extent that you might have difficulties with their services.  
You are stuck with them and if y ou speak to Paras they speak 
to you as a favour if they want to but there is no agreement signed that 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 29 of 203 
 
compels them to come in if Estina fails to provide services.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you understand? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I - I accept Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I had very limited knowledge 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In - in drafting of agreements …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But I took it that it was fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did - and - and the - and the State Law Advisors did - 
were involved in the drafting of this agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  You will - you will 
remember that after the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  The first one? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The first agreement the State Lawyers 
requested that they assist in drafting of this one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Of course - of course what the lawyer drafts 
depends also on what he or she is told by the client …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 30 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course what she is - she or he is told by the 
client also depends on what questions he or she ask ed the client in 
terms of information but - but it seems to me and I just want you to 
comment.  It seems to me that you - you - one of the things you ought 
to have said to them is you know if we are going to enter into a 
contract with - with Estina these are the protections that we need to 
have in - in the agreement as far as I am concerned.  
How you put them in the legal language might be something 
else but this is what - what I want and you - that you would have said 
actually as far as the department is co ncerned it is Paras that is really 
10 
our partner.  Estina is - has an arrangement with Paras but as far as we 
are concerned it is Paras that we want to really partner with and hold 
liable in case something goes wrong.  You - you understand that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I - I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In - in - what was brought to my 
attention …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Was that in the first agreement where 
we had brought in Paras. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Was illegal …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because at my level I did not have a 
delegation … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 31 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To sign an agreement with an 
international partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So that - that is why then it would be 
illegal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To bring in Paras … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Into the agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence then it was reduced to an 
agreement between the department and Estina.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What - what should have - the question that 
should have arisen - maybe I should not put it like this but there may 
be an argument that says the question that should have arisen in your 
mind and/or the mind of the lawyers or the State Law Advisors is if the 
intention was to have Paras as a partner and there is - there is not 
going to be an agreement with Paras …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Huh-uh. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do we make sure that the entity with whom we 
enter into an agreement meets the same standards that made us 
comfortable to select Paras as a partner?  Let us look into those things 
and only when we are satisfied about those things do we then go ahead 
and sign an agreement. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 32 of 203 
 
Part of this might be linked to what we discussed already but 
you might wish to say something. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  I - I would want to add 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You - you are in agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I agree with you Chair.  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think there is just one more that I - one more 
question that I want to raise.  I saw something quit e strange here in 
10 
paragraph - in Clause 9.1 of the agreement.  Namely that:  
“Estina shall monitor its performance in the delivery 
of the project and shall implement appropriate 
monitoring and management procedures in respect 
of the project including any re asonable monitoring 
procedure as the parties may - may from time to 
time agree.” 
Then 9.2: 
“On the notification of any failure or complaint 
regarding the quality of its performance Estina shall 
20 
attend 
to 
such 
notification 
with 
the 
agents 
appropriate 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
failure 
or 
complainant.” 
So the most obvious question about 9.1 is why - why was 
Estina to be the one to monitor its own performance?  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 33 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but maybe to fair to you I must point out that 
nine - Clause 9.4 has a clause about monitoring where it places the 
obligation on the department.  It says:  
“The department shall monitor the performance of 
Estina and may at any time in addition to the report 
in Clause 3.3 request any further information.”  
So on the one hand there is a clause that says Estina will 
monitor its own performance which I find strange and then on the other 
there is a clause that says the department shall monitor also.  Are - are 
10 
you able to throw any light on this?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Thank - thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - what we intended here was to 
say to Estina you must have your own internal monitoring processes.  
The - there are instances in - in agriculture where the department is - 
is responsible for - for monitoring compliance.  Our responsibility is 
monitor compliance.  Now in instances where …  
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say compliance is that as opposed to 
performance? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As opposed to performance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and do you want to deal with the distinction?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  We want to deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So that we - we do not go there and 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 34 of 203 
 
monitor implementation and then we come and monitor compliance at 
the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So we - we - hence we have said let 
them monitor - do the monitoring of the implementation of the project.  
We will come and monitor compliance because in terms of the Act there 
are issues the department must monitor compliance on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which Act are you talking about?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the Agricultural Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Act. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABTHE:  Yes.  So we have delegations to be 
responsible in - in the entire industry of agricu lture to do monitoring on 
certain aspects.  So those - those - you do not want to mingle those 
two … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and you do the job and you 
come back the following day and say now I am coming to monitor 
compliance.  So we said do your monitoring internally.  We will also do 
our monitoring in terms of your compliance.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well compliance would relate to what?  To statute - to 
20 
the performance of statutory obligations?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Like - like you - you will have to have 
a - an environment impact assessment who will come and say for you to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 35 of 203 
 
be able to do this do you have a PFMA.  Excuse me Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  A certificate for (intervenes). 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  A certificate that you have been given 
permission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For you to be drawing water from this 
dam.  Do you have …?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a licence? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Do you have a licence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Those things.  We then come and do 
the monitoring. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So - so when you say the department was going 
to monitor compliance those are the types of things you are talking 
about? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we are talking about, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of the monitoring of Estina’s 
performance of its obligations other than compliance with statutory 
requirements. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was going to monitor its own performance?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes and remember they will then still 
give us a monthly report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then over and above that we will 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 36 of 203 
 
monitor the implementation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And also monitor the compliance at 
the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So we do both but they must give us 
a report of their own monitoring to say this is what - because we - we 
do not want them at a particular stag e to come and claim ignorance that 
we did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence if - if there is any failure that 
they pick.  Then they must be able to - to address it immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well my - my concern with the idea or notion that a 
party to the agreement is given the obligation to monitor itself as 
opposed to or is - is given the right to monitor itself and that right not 
being given to the other party is that I do not understand why that 
would be so. 
I mean if I employ  you as a - as somebody to do some work in 
my company.  I monitor you.  You know because I must satisfy myself 
that you are doing the job properly and when I am satisfied it is fine.  If 
20 
I am not satisfied I raise issues with you and - and I do not rely on - I 
do not give you the right to monitor yourself.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see and - and here it seems that the department 
was giving Estina the right to monitor its own performance and - and 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 37 of 203 
 
that seems to me to suggest that if you try to monitor their performance 
they would be entitled to say hang on.  You are in breach of the 
agreement.  We are supposed to monitor ourselves …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that sounds strange to me. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair our understanding - maybe 
let me use the Government scenario.  Each department will have its 
own monitoring unit to monitor itself over and above the external 
monitoring that comes in.  So this - this you do so that you are able to 
pick challenge earlier yourselves.  Now that is what we were intending 
10 
them to do.  So that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that is what you - you wanted to do? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  They must then do monitoring 
internally if there are problems they are able to pick them e arly.  So 
that whoever comes and do the monitoring they are aware …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Already and they are able to say this 
is how we are going to resolve it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I would imagine that anybody would do 
their - what you call internal monitoring with or without any clause 
20 
because you want your own performance to be in accordance with your 
commitments and the agreement.  You want to perform well.  You do not 
want the other party to accuse you of failing to perform a s required but 
it may be that from your side if you say we want to see mechanisms 
that you put in place that will help you to detect as early as possible 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 38 of 203 
 
their problems in performance. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In performance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be fine.  The only question would be that 
must not take away your right to - to monitor.  My concern is that from 
what you have said it seems to me that Clause 8 -4 which seems to talk 
about the department’s right to monitor.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To monitor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you say maybe it could be relating to 
compliance but I see that it does say performance.  It does not say 
compliance. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes.  Chair we do both … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because - because by the Act we 
have to do certain compliance …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and there is work that we do …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That we also have to do compliance 
20 
on.  Some of them might not have been mandated by the Act …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But we still have to do those …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That monitoring. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 39 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but maybe I must take your evidence to - to 
amount to this that although there are two clauses talking about 
monitoring performance and one says Estina will monitor its own 
performance and the other says the department shall monitor 
performance what actually was sought t o be done is the department will 
retain the overall right to monitor performance …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But internally Estina should also monitor its own 
performance so that maybe they can pick up things even before the 
department picks them up.  It does not mean that the department was 
10 
not going to monitor Estina’s performance?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think - I think those were the two questions I wanted 
to - two areas on which I wanted to ask questions, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It has given me the opportunity to just go 
back to two issues in the sam e agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      If we just very briefly go back to page 
338 it’s still the agreement but what I’m looking at is clause 1.2 page 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 40 of 203 
 
338, 1.2 gives us the address of Estina, Block A, first progress in which 
144 Catherine Street, Sandton, the question is were you aware at the 
time that 144 Catherine Street, Sandton, that address is the address of 
a number of entities that are associated with the Gupta ente rprises? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:     I may not have been aware at that 
time Chair, although I’ve been to these offices, the relation during that 
time was not clear but now I am aware Chair.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      And the relation between Estina and in  
Particular Kamal Vasram and the Gupta enterprises, I’ll put it as 
generally as that, was not clear at that time?  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      At that time Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Mr Thabethe then the last question on 
the agreement is clause 10, confidentiality it’s on page 346.  When the 
National Treasury investigators from ENS tried to have a discussion 
with Mr Kamal Vasram who was the sole director at the time of Estina, 
when the ENS investigators and the National Treasury investigators 
tried to talk to Mr Vasram about this agreement, about the relationship 
between Estina and the department, your department, Mr Vasram 
refused to speak with them because he relied on this confidentiality 
clause as I understand matters.  He said at the time that h e had to get 
20 
permission from you.  Do you recall him ever coming back to you to say 
to you, there are these particular people from National Treasury who 
want to speak to me, can you release me from clause 10 of our 
agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Chair I have not received the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 41 of 203 
 
request from Estina although I remember discussing this with the 
investigators. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Yes my junior has just pointed me to 
correspondence from Mr Vasram on this issue and maybe for your 
information it might be useful just to read what his response was.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Okay.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      He is writing this letter to a Miss 
Jacobs and he copies Mr Thele who you know came to give evidence 
here on some of these matters and he says,  
 
“We strongly object to the content of your mail which seems  to 
10 
imply that we are deliberately not cooperating with you.  At  the outset 
please note that we have already  communicated to you that we do not 
consider it prudent to  
respond to your request in the absence of an 
approval from  
the department to do so.  This is in line with the 
 
confidentially clause in the agreement, signed with the 
 
department which can be verified with the department.  Your 
 
continued insistence on breaking protocol appears t o be 
 
motivated by an agenda that we do not understand and under 
 
the 
circumstances, 
anything 
we 
say 
will 
probably 
be 
 
misconstrued.  All the relevant documentation and information 
20 
 
in relation to this project is available with the department and 
 
if there are any gaps in the information we are more than 
 
willing to assist you, provided that this is done with the active 
 
participation of department officials.  This is an inter -
 
departmental matter which in which our participation in any 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 42 of 203 
 
 
form, if warranted can only be initiated in the presence of 
 
department officials or at the very least with their approval, 
 
best regards, Kamal Vasram”. 
 
So hence the question, my understanding of the report of Mr 
Tele and Co. was that you did not release Vasram from this 
confidentiality clause. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Chair the investigation team did 
discuss the matter with me, requesting that I give them permission to 
investigate, the investigation that they were doing was the investigation 
of the department.  We said – because they needed an exclusive 
10 
investigation without the participation of the department because there 
you are going to investigate a third party.  Now if you investigate a 
third party with the exclusion of the department, now that I can’t give 
that permission I would only give permission to do the investigation in 
the inclusion of the department, that’s where we differed.  I said we’ve 
agreed to do the investigation because this investigation is being done 
to the department if you proceed to do that investigation of Estina, 
inclusive of the department I have no problem, that we’d agreed but 
they wanted an exclusive investigation to which – of which I did not 
have the power to say, go and investigate a third party.  It had to be 
20 
limited to the application of the project, that is the situation that we 
had. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Well the report – just to tidy this issue 
up, the report that was prepared by those investigators is in the reports 
bundle Chairman at page 34 you may wish to look at it later and this is 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 43 of 203 
 
bundle B – reports bundle B, it’s under the – it’s under witness 
interviews…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do you think it would be necessary to look at it or 
not necessarily? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Chairman if – with your leave I’ll simply 
read this into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:      That’s fine ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Thank you and it reads – if you’d like 
to I don’t mind waiting for you to find it….[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes if you wish to look at it, it’s fine, just for my 
10 
purposes ja.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Reports bundle and it should be B, little 
b and it’s in b and the page is 34 and the paragraph is paragraph 2.3 it 
deals with witness interviews.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:     2.3.1 as you can see Mr Thabethe says,  
 
“After our first interview with Mr Thabethe we approached 
 
Estina’s director, Mr Kamal Vasram to discuss the project with 
 
him.  Mr Vasram is Estina’s only director.  Mr Vasram would 
 
not agree to an interview with ENS and stated that Estina was 
20 
 
bound to confidentiality in terms of the agreement signed with 
 
the department.  We requested that Mr Vasram produce the 
 
agreement giving rise to his duty of confidentiality.  Mr 
 
Vasram ignored our request and we were no t provided with a 
 
copy of the agreement.  2.3.2, at our second interview with 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 44 of 203 
 
 
Mr Thabethe we requested him to waive confidentiality and 
 
facilitate a meeting between ENS and Mr Vasram. This is he 
 
important part please Mr Thabethe, Mr Thabethe refused to  
 
assist ENS and stated that we should conduct our own 
 
investigation without his assistance.  Mr Thabethe stated that 
 
he was in contact with Mr Vasram and that he was aware that 
 
Mr Vasram refused to meet with us.  He was nevertheless 
 
unwilling to facilitate a meeting between ENS and Estina.  
 
Thereafter ENS again requested an interview with Mr Vasram 
 
but he refused to attend an interview.  As a result, we were 
10 
 
not able to interview Mr Vasram/Estina in this investigation to 
 
obtain their perspective an d explanations regarding the 
 
project.  The correspondence between ENS and Mr Vasram is 
 
attached as exhibit 18”, 
 
That’s the correspondence I read to you.  What’s your final 
comment maybe on this, I know we’ve dealt with it previously but just 
having given it, at least context in terms of the agreement?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Chair this is exactly what I was 
explaining that they needed an exclusive interview outside the 
department which I could not do.  We’ve agreed that we could do the 
20 
interview of Estina with the department, so we’d bring them in and we’d 
all sit and then they will do the interview.  So we could facilitate but 
they wanted an exclusive, them and Estina, without the department.  
That was the difficulty that I had, that I could not gi ve permission to 
them to go and do an investigation to a private party.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 45 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Why not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Because I did not know what they 
would – that’s why we said we wanted – we’d send a lawyer of the 
department to go with them and sit with Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:      But why would you need to send a lawyer of the 
department Mr Thabethe?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Chair we had signed a disclosure 
agreement, they had said to us as a private company they have issues 
to protect which they would not want to be exposed when we negotiated 
these things with Paras as international role player.  So we did not 
10 
know what would be those issues at stake.  Hence we said we would 
want that to happen but then we wanted to make it in line with what 
National Treasury has requested us to do.  National Treasury has 
requested that we want to do an investigation of the department in the 
implementation of Vrede Dairy of which Estina is a party in [indistinct] 
we don’t have a problem with that.  
ADV LEAH 
GCABASHE 
SC: 
Of 
course 
Mr 
Vasram, 
in 
that 
correspondence that I read to you, he says, if you gave approval he 
was happy to talk. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:     That’s correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    To the investigators number one.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Number two, these are investigators 
that are doing work for National Treasury you are part of the same 
government. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 46 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That’s correct.     
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Why did you have reserv ations about 
allowing National Treasury to speak to Estina who, at the end of the 
day, was an implementing agent or was about to be an implementing 
agent handling funds that, essentially come from the same National 
Treasury?   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    No I did not have a problem Chair 
in…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well there is something you say – you said you had a 
problem with and you must tell me if my understanding is wrong, it 
10 
seems that you had a problem with investigators interviewing Estina 
without you or without anybody representing you there.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      In the department, that’s correct 
Chair because I would not want to be seen giving an investigator 
permission to investigate a private company.  
CHAIRPERSON:    No Mr Thabethe, Estina has an agreement with your 
department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is going to benefit from tax payer’s money.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    That’s correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Treasury is there to look after the tax payer ’s money. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:     That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They want to investigate, one would have expected 
that you would have said to them, oh you want to speak to Estina, 
please by all means go there and actually if y ou want I can pick up the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 47 of 203 
 
phone and say they must please make sure they meet with you.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether I’m there or not, whether somebody from the 
department is there or not is neither here nor there, go and m eet with 
them, why didn’t you say that, what was the problem with saying that?     
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I hear you Chair, maybe that time 
then there was a misunderstanding because my problem – I’d never had 
a problem to have the investigators speakin g to him.  My thinking was 
that they want permission from me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you – well they may or may not have wanted 
10 
permission from you but I don’t see even why they thought it’s 
necessary to get permission from you if they thought they needed 
permission but that might be for – that might be because of what I don’t 
know in terms of how National Treasury operates and Public Service 
operates but the fact of the matter is, Estina had an agreement with the 
department in order for them to properly in vestigate the project, the 
had to speak to Estina and actually if Estina refused to speak to them it 
seems to me it would have fallen upon you to say, you can’t have an 
agreement with us being part of government and you refuse to talk to 
government because Treasury is government.  When they are 
20 
investigation, if that’s your attitude then maybe we are not going to 
continue this agreement with you.  If you enter into an agreement with 
part of government you will be investigated, so what’s your problem?  
So that’s what I would have expected you to say to Estina if they 
resisted.  So I don’t know why you seem to have a problem, I don’t see 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 48 of 203 
 
why you had a problem and why you would even have wanted to have a 
lawyer of the department to go there and be there when th e 
investigators talk to Estina, why?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:     Chair I hear you but the thinking 
that I had that time was a different thinking.  Now that we are speaking 
and the investigation is done, I hear your understanding.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You see the point? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      I see the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    My problem was that, also not being 
10 
very clued with legal issues, I thought – because I had said to them, I 
don’t see any problem in them doing an investigation directly with 
Estina without asking permission from me.  The problem was that why 
should the permission be asked fro me.  If the permission is asked from 
me, therefore I would then need to have somebody to sit with them, if I 
had given such a permission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well from what Miss Gcabashe has read there, it 
seems to me that Estina was saying they were quite happy to be 
interviewed by the investigators if you gave permission.  Did you ever 
get to know that, that was their attitude?  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      No Chair the letter she’s referring 
to had never been made available to us, his letter to the investigators.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes did - as far as you know, as far as you 
remember did the investigators ever say to you, Estina is p repared to 
talk to us but they want to know that you are permitting them to talk to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 49 of 203 
 
us or permitting us to talk to them, did the investigators ever say that 
to you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Chair in the meeting that we had 
they requested me to waive the agreement so that they are able to go 
to speak to Estina that is what they had asked?  
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did you understand the waiving of the 
agreement to refer to or is that the permission you are talking about?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes to give them permission to do 
the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you did not do that?     
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes because there were like – 
there are two issues Chair, I did not see why they needed permission to 
do investigation because the agreement says they were not allowed to 
give information without the consent of the department.  
CHAIRPERSON:    That is Estina? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    That is Estina.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Now if Estina would have then 
written to the department to say, we request permission from you, we 
would then have granted that permission.    
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry where in the agreement does it say they 
would need your permission?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Page 346 Chairman and it’s the 
confidentiality clause which says,  
 
“Estina will not, during the term of this agreement and 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 50 of 203 
 
thereafter without the prior written consent of the department, disclose 
any confidential information relating to the department and the project 
to anyone other that those persons who are connected to the 
department and/or Estina and who are required to have access to 
such…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I’m sorry I think I missed this part but then this 
appears to clearly say you must give permission.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why did you say to the investigators – or at least 
you said to me earlier on, you didn’t see why the investigators needed 
10 
your permission. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   To do the investigation.    
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, so in the light of this clause, are you saying 
they did not need your permission?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    Yes the clause is saying, Chair, if 
they wanted permission from us to go and do the investigation, we said 
we don’t have any problem for them to do the investigation but then we 
would organise the meeting for them to come and do the investigation 
but that’s not what they wanted.  They wanted an exclusive without the 
department.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see what you referred to as an e xclusive, you 
mean an exclusive interview with Estina between the investigators and 
Estina without the department?      
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and why was that a problem?    
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 51 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair like I explained, my 
understanding of what we are talking about at that time, is different I 
would have responded differently now.     
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   As now I had responded before.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that I appreciate but I want t o understand 
your understanding at that time, what did you see as a problem at that 
time, in the light of this clause?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes what I saw as a problem is me 
giving permission to investigate a private company.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you knew that their request for permission 
arose from this clause isn’t it?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And in terms of this clause Estina was prohibited 
from disclosing certain information to other people?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And obviously the investigators, if they interviewed 
Estina they would have wanted Estina to disclose certain information 
about the project to them?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:     Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes so they would need your permission then.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes, Chair maybe I’m not – all I 
asked was that we bring Estina, the department and National Treasury 
and we sit and we discuss and we agree, we would have come up with 
a solution in that meeting to say, okay proceed with the investigation 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 52 of 203 
 
this is now all our understanding.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but why do you want an understanding, they are 
investigating and they want to interview Estina people?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why don’t you give them permission, the clause says 
Estina must get permission from you in order to disclose certain 
information?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So why don’t you give them?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I hear you Chair, like I say the 
10 
understanding I have now…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes you would give the permission now.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:     I would give the permission now. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    But at that time my thinking and 
understanding of legal issues was different.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but remember I said I understand that, I 
appreciate that in terms of now, I’m trying to understand what it is that 
you would have seen as a problem at that time because it seems to me 
quite clear.  It seems to me that any head of department who was really 
20 
interested in National Treasury being satisfied that everything was in 
order would have said, oh yes Estina you have got my permission to 
disclose whatever they may ask you, these are not people who are 
coming from outside government, they are part of government?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      I agree with you Chair  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 53 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   At that time my thinking was different 
from what – if you had to come to me I would have said go and 
investigate.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   At that time my understanding was 
that I’m afraid of giving permission for an investigation of a private 
company.  That was my understandin g, then what I would say Chair, I 
made a mistake that time for not allowing them  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but I do want you to – well if that is all you are 
10 
able to say in terms of what the basis was for our not being prepared to 
give permission that’s fine, bu t I’m looking at it because I don’t know if, 
when all evidence is heard there might be a suggestion that it was more 
than that, you know and I just want to make sure you get an opportunity 
to deal with it, but Miss Gcabashe might be having questions around  
the issue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:     Chair, maybe just two questions and 
really Mr Thabethe it’s – they were not investigating Estina as a private 
company they were asking to investigate the project that you and 
Estina were partnering in, I’ll use that wo rd very loosely, partnering in. 
20 
You were satisfied that, that was all they were really asking to 
investigate?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      The second thing is I can’t quite 
understand the nature of the con fidential information that you sought to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 54 of 203 
 
protect under this clause, maybe that will help us understand your 
attitude?  What is the nature of the confidential information you thought 
needed to be protected and this is why you were refusing access to 
Estina without your being there?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I see you look at me Mr Thabethe and you’re 
not sure whether to start answering and that’s simply because I’m 
thinking that, from your answer you – well maybe not really what I’m 
thinking about.  You don’t seem  to have been concerned about the 
department you seem to have been concerned about Estina.    
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Chair…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     So but having said that, answer the question that 
Miss Gcabashe has put to you I’m just articul ating this because you did 
realise that I seem to be wanting to say something but now you know 
what I was thinking but you can answer her question.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes, Chair the question was that – 
what I had in mind was that Estina – Paras, through Estina would be 
doing products on the project and they’re the sole owners of those 
products, they brand their name, like any other company that has got 
[indistinct] property on certain products.  Now the problem comes when 
you give permission, to  what extent are they going to request 
20 
permission to expose some of those issues.  Like when you get into the 
project, they do the construction in such a way, hence they said to us, 
when we do construction of the processing plant we normally don’t 
allow people to come and take pictures because we are exposing our 
intellectual   property so people know how we achieve the production of 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 55 of 203 
 
this brand.  Now that information becomes very confidential because 
they were going to bring that information of that project  in the 
construction phase so that at the end it comes up with that particular 
brand of a product which they’ve got a sole intellectual property, 
nobody else will produce it that same way because it has the brand 
name of that product.  Now the understandin g when we had discussed 
that was in line with saying, the department becomes – we are giving 
you information that is exclusive in your construction, we wouldn’t want 
that information to be exposed to everybody because any vendor then 
would manufacture our product, they know how we do it.  Now that’s the 
10 
difficulty, hence it’s very difficult to say it seems I was protecting 
Estina more than the department…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.     
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   But this is what they had said to us, 
we are willing to come and assist you on those basis that you don’t 
allow people to come and see how we deal with this product because 
it’s our intellectual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I see Miss Gcabashe certainly has more question 
for you on the issue, I’m not sur prised.  Let’s have he tea break and 
we’ll resume – it’s twenty past we’ll resume and twenty five to twelve, 
20 
we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:      All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue Ms Gcabashe.

Page 56 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe really 
just to tidy this up just for my own understanding.   
1. I did not understand from reading the ENS National Treasury 
Report that they wanted to go on a site visit – go to a factory and 
investigate the type of products that were being manufactured.  I 
would have thought that the ambit of National Treasury’s enquiry 
would be  
1. To get a copy of the agreement which you apparently refused 
to give and that would have helped them.  
2. To understand what funds had already been transferred to 
10 
Estina.  And once they understood what funds had been 
transferred to understand what other conditional grants might 
have been agreed or might be proposed to be given to Estina 
to handle.  And then just to monitor how this – how these 
funds would be applied. 
That would have been my understanding as a public official as a HOD 
talking to colleagues through you.  That was not your thinking at the 
time? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thanks Chair.  Chair if that would 
have been the understanding at that time there  should not have been a 
20 
problem.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Then I just want to clear up Mr Thabethe 
these emails that really give a different version to what you say 
because I am not going to read all of them.  I have read the most 
important one it is just the one we read into the record.  That one was 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 57 of 203 
 
dated the 5 December 2013.  But before that on the 1 December there 
was an email sent by again Ms Jacobs to Mr Vasram saying  
“You have further not responded to my request to 
inform us on what basis you and or Estina and or 
Paras are claiming confidentiality.  During our 
meeting 
with 
Mr 
Thabethe 
on 
Friday 
the 
22 
November he informed ENS that he had discussed 
our request with you and that you were not willing to 
meet 
with 
ENS 
or 
to 
cooperate 
with 
this 
investigation.  We therefore have no option but to 
10 
deduce that you are not willing to cooperate with this 
investigation and the request from National Treasury.  
So the important thing there is we have spoken to Mr 
Thabethe on the 22 November.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat Ms Gcabashe who that email was from 
and who it was addressed to?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So the date of the email Chairman it is on 
page 249 of the Reports bundle page 249 and it is an email dated the 1 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry please give me the Reports bundle. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  The Reports bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  It is bundle B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It will be small b.  Yes and page 249 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 58 of 203 
 
please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They are filed back to front in a sense 
Chairman so I will just help you navigate through – through those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Emails.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you can just reiterate who it was from and 
who it was addressed to and then he can respond. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So it is from Jacobs dated 1 December to 
Vasram and copied to Cele, there is a Barnard as well and the title is 
10 
clear Vrede Integrated Dairy Project.  So it was very clear.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As to what they were trying to investigate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But maybe before – before it – I just want to go 
back to the answer that Mr Thabethe gave to your question before the 
break.  Remember at least part of what I was hoping would emer ges 
whether I was right in thinking that you seemed to be more concerned 
about protecting Estina than really the department.  Now you gave an 
answer and you talked about intellectual property and so on and so on.  
Am I right to say your concern was more wi th Estina than with the 
20 
department in terms of confidentiality if there was any concern on your 
part on confidentiality?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not exactly Chair the way you putting 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 59 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I did have a concern with Estina with 
regard to the intellectual property.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because – that – but it is not – it 
does not mean that I had more concern about Estina than the 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but let us clear this one at a t ime.  As far as 
your refusal to give permission to the – to the National Treasury 
investigators to interview Estina people without anybody from the 
department your concern was with regard to the confidentiality of 
10 
Estina’s intellectual property, is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then was there any other concern that formed the 
basis of your unpreparedness to give the permission?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair during the meeting that I had 
with them they were not – they were not able to say to me our interest 
goes up to this far.  Because if that should have been the case I should 
not have had the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean in the investigators?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The investigators Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you mean – what did you want them to say 
about their interest as to how far their interest went.  Exactly what is it 
that you wanted them to say?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it about the scope of investigation?  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 60 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Chair the scope of investigation 
it would not have gone to an extent because I told them that if it would 
not go to the extent they should indicate to me that it would not go to 
the extent of dealing with issues of intellectual property.   Then there 
would not have been a problem.  But they did not want me to limit the 
investigation.  It means they would have wanted to investigate any 
other thing inclusive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  About the project which would have 
also included the issue of intellectual property.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no I will talk about the intellectual – your concern 
about the confidentiality. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the intellectual property and Estina.  But as far  as 
the department is concerned what if anything was there that formed the 
basis of your unpreparedness to give permission?  In other words what 
interest of the department were your trying to protect against people 
from – investigators from National Treasu ry in relation to in not wanting 
to give permission? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair let me go back again.  We – 
20 
we had written a letter to the Director General of National Treasury.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was actually a letter o f complaint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We had given information  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 61 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To the investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And that information we had handed 
over to the investigators was in the weekend meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was in the weekend newspapers?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was with the newspapers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We wrote a letter through the Director 
General of the Province complaining to say Na tional Treasury has done 
10 
investigation.  Here is information we have given them and that 
information was in the media on the weekend.  Now we complained to 
the DG at National in writing.  We received a response to our 
communication to the DG and the response that we are receiving comes 
from the investigator.  The letter we wrote to the DG was responded by 
the investigator.  Now we – and then we have – we had a problem 
because our understanding was that the DG would then say how did 
this happen?  You release information you gave to the investigator and 
the information straight goes to the media.  We had the problem with 
that hence we wrote the letter and say we have a problem please assist 
20 
us in dealing with this thing until the investigation has been complet ed.  
We cannot have a situation where investigator comes collect 
information and release it to the media.  But we – we – we were not 
able to be assisted because we received a response from the 
investigator answering our letter we sent to the DG.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 62 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how did that form a basis for you not being 
prepared to give permission to the investigators to go and see and 
interview the Estina people?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Why I am giving this example Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To say what then came to my mind if 
– if then we would speak to them and they will say no we do not want 
you to limit us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Including the issues of the intellectual 
10 
property.  It means they would have wanted to inve stigate any other 
thing in that relation.  Now that is where the problem came in because 
if they would have agreed to say no we will – we are investigating 
implementation and all those things your transfers, your payment and 
whatever we are not going to ge t into the issues of the intellectual – 
then I would not have a problem because those things are not mine.  I 
cannot give permission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see that is part of the problem. From what 
you have said it seems to me that there really was no – there really 
was nothing that formed – there was nothing relating to the department 
20 
that formed the basis for your not wanting to give them permission.  
The only thing that seems to have formed the basis of your 
unpreparedness 
to 
give 
permission 
was 
your 
c oncern 
about 
confidentiality relating to the intellectual property of Estina.  Now I just 
want you to confirm whether my understanding of your evidence is 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 63 of 203 
 
correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now why would you be so concerned about any 
intellectual property of Estina when you were being requested to give 
permission such as is contemplated in Clause 10.1 of the agreement 
about confidentiality?  Because if you gave permission and Estina 
thought you gave permission for the investigators to interview Estina 
people  
10 
1. That might have nothing to do with any intellectual property.  
Therefore the investigation would go on but  
2. Even if there was something they wanted to talk about in relation 
to intellectual property or to see Estina could protect interest by 
refusing so why could you not say look as far as I am concerned 
I am giving you permission.  If Estina has any problem you will 
deal with them. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair they had – I had raised it in the 
meeting with the investigators.  That is my only limitation which they 
were not willing to agree with. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the intellectual property?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The intellectual property yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is where I have a problem.  Why you being 
head of the department were more concerned actually from what I think 
Ms Gcabashe read earlier on it looks like you were more concerned 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 64 of 203 
 
about Estina’s intellectual property than Est ina itself.  Because it 
seems that Estina was saying they were prepared – saying to the 
investigators they were prepared to – to meet with them if you would 
agree.  They did not seem to have the same concern that you had about 
confidentiality and their intellectual property.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it – the issue is the issue of a 
condition.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What condition? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because anybody who had to 
investigate and you agree with him and then you come and you expose 
10 
the issue of the intellectual property then it becomes a problem in my 
understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but if Estina had a problem they would raise 
the issue and also you could pick up the phone with – and phone Estina 
and say the investigators wan t me to give permission for them to 
interview you and therefore I propose to give them the permission. You 
do have any problem?  You did not do that, did you?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No it has been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And I have also said to the 
20 
investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That I have been in communication 
with Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 65 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  With regard to this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And in our discussion with Estinal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And this has been the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  This is – this one item has been the 
problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  When I was discussing with Estina 
10 
and when I was discussing with the investigators.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But from your side you see the permission that 
must come from you as far as outsiders are concerned I would imagine 
is really more to protect information relating to the department.  
Because you as – in terms of the agreement you could have – you 
could have seen whatever you needed to see from Estina.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as I understand it I think that your permission 
was put in more to protec t the department’s information and of course I 
do not see why there will be a problem with National Treasury people 
20 
seeing information of a government department as such and of course 
you have not said that was your concern.  It is – you said it was with 
intellectual property.  But I think – I think that is fine we have reached 
a stage where we agree that your concern was with intellectual property 
– that you say that your concern was with intellectual property of 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 66 of 203 
 
Estina. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you know what intellectual property Estina 
had there in relation to anything in the project?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that is the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you cannot fight so much to protect 
something that you do not know.  Did you know what intellectual 
property they had? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I had – I had – they had 
discussed with me the issue of the intellectual property.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But those documents of the 
intellectual property were not handed over to us.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So I understood what – what is – was 
at stake in terms of the intellectual property because they had to use 
some of those in the configuration of the project.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So that the output gets to what they 
are looking for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So I understood and I saw those 
documents which they were referring to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  You recall Mr 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 67 of 203 
 
Thabethe that we showed you documents that indicated that Estina was 
a commercial company IT company.  It operated in that space.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  I understood your evidence earlier to 
speak about production lines specific issue – specific products that you 
would have wanted ordered for the dairy farm.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Was that what you were communicating.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So in fact as the Chairman has been 
10 
asking you it was Paras’ intellectual property?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  That you were concerned with?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Not Estina’s? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes it was Paras intellectual property 
in the hands of Estina.  Because they were implementing.  Let – Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I do not know if I can explain this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes explain it is fine. 
20 
es explain it is fine. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In a – in a simple layman’s language.  
A recipe for baking cookies, particular cookies.  You may not have until 
the person says here is the recipe go and do it so that you are able to 
produce this. And these things are exclusively mine.  Otherwise if you 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 68 of 203 
 
do not use them the way they are you are not going to achieve that 
product.  Now I am just using that example.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I think ever ybody understands that.  He 
says Ms Gcabashe will continue with dealing with that.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe I think 
I really do not want to belabour this very much further because my 
understanding of the emails and Chairman I  just commend them to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  They run from page 249. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Through to page 251. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  And they will give further context to the 
same discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Or at least the evidence is there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  They are – end of 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Discussions that is what they reflect.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And they reflect Mr Thabethe’s attitude.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So I think I will just commend  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 69 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  These to you because Mr Thabethe has 
spent quite a bit of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Explaining his position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think – I think maybe what you – you – what 
you should nevertheless do is to put to him if that is the case that a 
reading of those emails and you can specify them without going through 
each of them.  A reading of those emails is not consistent with his 
version now on this point if that is the position.  So that he gets a 
chance to respond to that.  If he wishes to look at those emails before 
10 
he responds then that can be done and we can if ne cessary he can look 
at that over the lunch break and then after lunch he can answer that 
question if he needs to. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  In fact it boils down to this Mr Thabethe.  
The email dated the 1 December 2013 to Mr Vasram communicates 
clearly that you Mr Thabethe informed ENS that you Mr Thabethe had 
discussed ENS’s request with Mr Vasram and that Mr Vasram was not 
willing to meet ENS.  That is what you communicated to ENS.  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No it is not correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  So that is what that email dated 
the 1 December communicates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that email is from who to whom?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  It is from Jacobs to Vasram. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 70 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so Jacobs – Mr Jacobs was confirming that 
according to Mr Thabethe  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Estina was unwilling to meet with them.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – but you are saying that you never told 
anybody that Estina was unwilling to meet with the investigators?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no I have not Chair.  The bone of 
contention in my meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  With the investigator was them 
wanting to go and investigate without any reservation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which I discussed with them and I 
told them [indistinct] the only issue which is a problem unless they 
were confirming that I said they refused to do investigation into the 
issues of intellectual property then it would be correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But as far as you know why would they be interested 
in intellectual property?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would that really be of interest to National 
Treasury Investigators about this project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am – I am looking at my senior 
counsel.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You are wondering whether he should stand up and 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 71 of 203 
 
object.  He will not assist you to answer the question.  He will leave it 
to you to answer the question.  You k now some questions just need 
you.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja it is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I – I do not want to speculate Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no do not speculate but I am trying to 
understand the thinking. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The answer that I would give you …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be speculation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Would be a speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So that is why I say I do not want 
that.  That is why I am saying I am looking at my senior counsel.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so I guess that is – the correct answer then is – 
would be that you also do not know why intellectual property would be 
20 
of interest to National Treasury investigators?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Why I am afraid.  Yesterday I made a 
statement about the issue of the meat.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 72 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I had to retract this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see you do not have to be afraid of anything 
as long as you are telling the truth.  If you make a mistake you say I 
made a mistake I have thought about it you know.  So in other words as 
long as you are honestly giving the answer that you believe to be true if 
it turns out later to be mistaken or to be wrong as long as it is what you 
believe honestly to be the truth there is no pr oblem. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja because you see Chair the other 
fear I have I have seen statements being made at the commission and 
thereafter people were sued.  So hence I am saying…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I do not want to go to that area and 
make a statement and then I get into trouble.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  But… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence I am saying I am afraid to get 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but – but you accept that it seems that the only 
20 
answer is the one I hav e suggested? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Mr Buthelezi would like to address you 
Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 73 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has Mr Buthelezi been inspired too?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  I think I will let him deal with the 
issue he would like to raise Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Buthelezi.  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Mr Thabethe’s difficulty with regards 
to this question because we did p ursue it with him as well is that there 
is a certain level of a version towards making unsubstantiated 
statements which may in due course open him up to legal liability from 
10 
parties outside these proceedings who may then have – go ahead and 
say you said XYZ at the state capture commission and we now want to 
sue you for those statements.  So he says he has information that he 
has from his position as person having operated in the Department of 
Agriculture. And the nature of this information and that was shar ed with 
him in confidence in the implementation of the project was of interest to 
other persons outside the process.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  But he cannot make that as a 
statement of fact. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  He may state it as an opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Or a thought that he has for himself 
however even in stating it as an opinion he then renders himself liable.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 74 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  By those third parties now  pursuing 
him for having made such opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  On such a – in such a hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  That is the only difficulty Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  So maybe between myself and Ms 
Gcabashe we could just confer for like five minutes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  So that we clarify what the position 
needs to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Because ultimately he needs to 
assist the commission, get to the bottom of the issues.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And without any fear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Of reprisals from outside. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And we need to then couch that 
information or those statements in such a way that they are helpful to 
the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 75 of 203 
 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  But they do not leave him vulnerable 
for civil liability outside this process.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well maybe we can leave it on the basis that 
maybe during the lunch break the two of you can talk.  
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk to each other about it and then when I come 
back after lunch if we need to revisit the issue we can look at that.  
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having said that I just want to say that the question 
was – I ask the question because it did not seem to me that one would 
10 
necessarily 
think 
about 
National 
Treasury 
investigators 
being 
concerned about intellectual property and if I am correct in that 
thinking then - there may be a question as to why the approach taken 
was not that you people you go there.  
Do as much as you can and Estina will - if Estina raises 
problems about anything let us deal with it at that stage and try and 
solve it at that stage but maybe the two of you can confer over lunch 
and then depending on the need we - we can then revisit it after lunch.  
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  If - if I may … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Add an additional point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  The issue in this instance was not so 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 76 of 203 
 
much National Treasury itself but what had emerged was that National 
Treasury had outsourced to an independent outside investigator to 
conduct the investigation on behalf of National Treasury.  Now that now 
places it in the realm of an independent third party doing the work for 
National Treasury itself and if that information is now sitting w ith the 
independent third party it is no longer in the exclusive control of 
National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well accept that National Treasury can put 
conditions to the appointment of a third party to say because you will 
be doing this for us these are the limitations.  You know.  So that - that 
10 
third party is not exactly in the same position as would be somebody 
from National Treasury doing the same thing.  
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Indeed so Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  But I accept your point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  We will take it up during the lunch 
break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I just want to put 
the second proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the first one related to the email of 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 77 of 203 
 
1 December 2013 Mr Thabethe and what is recorded here is that you 
said that Mr Vasram was not willing to speak to the investigators.  You 
have denied this? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The second proposition is there is the 
email dated 5 December from Mr Vasram to the investigator Ms  Jacobs 
and in this he says.  The very last li ne is: 
“At the very least if you approve …”  
This is his attitude if the department approves he is happy to 
speak to the investigators.  What is your comment on that?  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair.  The 
indication here is that if - if we would say proceed.  Then they would do 
so having - after having cleared what we have been told is their 
concern because they had communicated to us their concern.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The last one it - it is an email from whom 
to whom? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is an email Chairman from Mr  Vasram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is on page 2-4-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is dated 5 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is to Ms Jacobs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is copied again to Mr  (indistinct) 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 78 of 203 
 
and Mr Barnard … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And Mr Vasram writes that and I am just 
reading the last sentence which is - sentence which is the most 
relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That: 
“This is an interdepartmental matter in which our 
participation in any form if warranted can only be 
initiated in the presence of department officials or 
10 
at the very least with their approval.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is the very last …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Three words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He was prepared to talk to them …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As long as Mr Thabethe approved … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you accept Mr Thabethe that at least as at 
24 December 2013 Estina - Mr Vasram were prepared to speak to the 
investigators.  I am tempted to say about anything relating to the 
project as long as at least they knew that you had no problem.  Do you 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 79 of 203 
 
accept that …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was factually the position?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair that was - that was 
correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because in the discussion between 
me and him hence he had put it down was that for us to be able to have 
a clear understanding of - of what they would ask him.  He - he said if 
the department was there so that you make sure when they go to the 
10 
area where we are not comfortable he would be able to assist us.  
That - that we said it is fine.  If I were to give an approval I 
would have then requested the investigator to say to me we are not 
interested in the intellectual property.  We therefore give you 
permission to proceed with the investigation.  So those were the two 
things Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he - he seems not to be concerned about that.  
All he seems to be wanting is if there is no - no official from the 
department at the interview …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least you should be - you should be able to say 
you are okay with there being no official from the department and they 
can continue and interview and go into the interview.  He - he does not 
say - as I understand it.  He does not say we - we are happy to - we - 
we are happy to discuss with you everything except intellectual 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 80 of 203 
 
property. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, ja.  Chair what - what I am …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope - I hope I am right Ms  Gcabashe in terms of 
what they say - Estina - that they do not seem to say we are happy to 
discuss anything with investigators other than intellectual property.  
They do not seem to say that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They - they do not speak …  
CHAIRPERSON:  About. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To the issue of intellectual property …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, at all. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They simply speak to the approval which 
is what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Clause 10 deals with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you give us permission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they do not raise that issue at ally.  You were 
concerned about it but they based on this it is not their concern - their 
20 
concern and they - they are not saying - they are not - there is nothing 
here that shows that they want you to refuse permission.  There seems 
to be nothing suggesting that they want you to refuse permission.  They 
just want you to make up your mind.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, ja.  Chair I am - I am responding 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 81 of 203 
 
on the basis of my communication with Vasram.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence I am - I am commenting on this 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not directly as it is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because it was their communication.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  My input into it … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is what we had agreed on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I suppose my closing comment is you  - 
you actually went with the ENS investigators to the farm in 
October 2013.  That is correct.  Is it not?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I am - I am trying to think.  I 
cannot remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I cannot remember. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The date is not important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The important fact is you accompanied 
them to the Vrede Dairy Farm on a site visit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any recollection?  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 82 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not recall? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am - I am not recalling Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might be able to help him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Page 48 of the Reports Bundle.  Hopeful ly 
it is the same one you have.  It should be the same …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But just go to page 48 - paginated page 
10 
48. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Reports Bundle? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  B.  Reports Bundle B.  That is where  the 
emails were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where the email was. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one you were having. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one in front of you that has the email that we 
were looking at just now.  Ja.  Page 48. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Page 48.  No Chair.  The one I am 
looking at is HH10B. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no.  That is - you are trying to find 
Reports Bundle.  Reports Bundle. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 83 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Small b. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I have - I have got. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Page 14? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  4-8 - 48. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  4-8.  Okay.  I have got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is just that very first line at clause 
or paragraph 6.1.1. 
“In October 2013 ENS visited the Vrede Dairy 
Project site accompanied by Mr  Thabethe.” 
10 
You cannot recall that visit?  Very first sentence at 6.1.1.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am - I am thinking Chair.  I am not 
denying it but I am trying …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I - I cannot remember.  I might 
have been there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I have been there with a 
number of people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is possible that … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Doing investigation but I cannot 
remember exactly …  
CHAIRPERSON:  With them. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 84 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  How many people - there were - there 
were so many people because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I think this is the fourth investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So there - there were many …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Instances I went there.  So I cannot 
remember (coughing).  I might have been there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Well I do not think that the investigators 
would put a fact into a report …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They have prepared for National Treasury 
if that would be fact especially something like going to on a site visit.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  On a site visit. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would not be verifiable or - or correct.  If 
you go to page 51 of the same report.  They actually conclude - 5-1 - 
51: 
“That is was clear that progress was being made on 
20 
the construction of buildings and that a number of 
cows had been purchased.”  
But they go on to say: 
“At 6.2.2 that ENS was not provided with access to 
the financial records of the project and as a result 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 85 of 203 
 
we were not able to comment on whether the project 
is progressing.  To date the department has only 
invested funds it was required to invest in the 
2012/2013 financial year.  No further payments 
have been made to our knowledge.  It is therefore 
likely that the project may be experiencing cash 
flow difficulties.” 
And I read this only to indicate that I would have thought that 
this really is what National Treasury’s interest is.  How are funds that 
come from the fiscus being spent on this project?  That would have 
10 
been their core mission. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not know if you want to comment on 
that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair I - I do not know 
why - why they would have struggled in the department to get tha t 
information because I had given them access to the department supply 
chain which had all these documents in terms of payments and what 
payments had been done.  So they - they had been there. 
They were able to - to access this information.  So I - I read 
20 
that they were not able to access information.  I - I - it - I - I do not 
agree that they would not have had access to this information because 
that formed the basis of the investigation and they were given access 
to the department’s supply chain to be abl e to do so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe if I - my recollection - my 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 86 of 203 
 
memory serves me well.  At - when we postponed this matter we gave 
you a file that had the ENS Report …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because you had indicated that you did 
not really have access to it.  You may want to read it again and look at 
some of the issues that they raise and - and deal with those because I 
think you are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum in relation to 
what was provided, what permissions were granted or not granted and 
what progress this investigation could make in the given circumstances.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair they had never 
10 
complained me about refusing them access to the department.  So they 
had access to whatever they wanted to investigate.  What I had said 
before was that this report came to my attention for the first time in the 
court’s records.  I - I was never given an opportunity to respond to the 
report. 
I would have - because when a report is being issued 
normally they will then give you a copy and say this is the findings.  Do 
you have any comment to make on this report?  Now I was never given 
that opportunity to do so.  I would have corrected a lot of things in the 
report which might not have been properly done if they would have 
20 
given me a draft saying this is our outcome.  
We cannot find that.  We cannot find that.  We cannot find 
that in the report.  Either to correct or to make available that 
information which they are saying they a re not able to get.  Now I saw 
this report when - when the first draft that I had also made available to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 87 of 203 
 
the Commission.  I got the first draft before this report was issued from 
the legislature and I had a copy that was given to me at the legislature 
which - which was talking to the - to these issues before they - they 
released the report. 
Now the - then the question kicks in Chair where Counsel 
says but how - how was this working?  Everybody else had a copy of 
the report except the department and when I w ent to the legislature I 
went to answer questions on the basis of a report that I was not 
provided and then that is what I said and I was given a copy by the 
legislature and when they gave me a copy they wrote on top of the copy 
10 
that I cannot use it for any other purpose other than responding to the 
questions of the legislature which is what I did.  
Now that report which I got versus this report that was in - in 
court did not bear the same date but I had used the report at the 
legislature for responding to - to their question.  Now my question has 
always been and if you also read the - the Public Protector’s Report it - 
it comes out very clear in a number of areas that I did not have the 
copy of the report. 
It seems they had a copy of the report because they were 
asking me questions about it but I did not have and they, from their 
20 
side never - they never gave me a copy of the report to be able to - to 
talk to the report.  Until, I - I then went to court and then I got a copy of 
the report.  So the - that is - that has been my problem with regard to 
this report.  I would have made my inputs before the report would have 
been released. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 88 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I do not think I want to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Pursue this particular point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Any - any further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would like to move onto the next …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Aspect.  Mr Thabethe we are back at your 
annexures to the 2017 affidavit and so that is HHB.  Yes.  You have got 
10 
the right document there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you look at flag number 13 - 1-3.  That 
is a report - a presentation actually that you made to the Nati onal 
Office - the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries - Forestry and 
Fisheries.  Is that correct?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And when would you have made this 
presentation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (No audible reply). 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you recall? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am - I am trying to recall sir.  I may 
not remember the exact date. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just the period because my assumption is 
that the purpose was to get funding  … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 89 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Funding.  That is … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Conditional funding. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So just give us ballpark …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Dates. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I think Chair it - it could have been - I 
do not want to make a mistake because between us going to the 
Provincial Executive Council I am not sure whether it was before or 
after.  I think it could have been before because when I w ent to the 
10 
Executive Council I was then able to say what is - what is possible from 
us. 
I think it was during that time for us to be - to - to make sure 
and ascertain but it - it - I am - I am just trying to think I cannot recall 
properly.  It could have been after the Executive Council says to us go 
and - and look for money.  Then we went also to - to National to say we 
have this proposal and … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I would suggest that it is probably the 
latter because if you go and look at page 3 -7-3 and 3-7-4.  It would 
appear especially at 3-7-4 that you are setting out the additional 
20 
funding … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Required in the current financial year.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay.  Ja.  I - I think so Chair.  It 
could have been after I have received approval to then go to National 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 90 of 203 
 
to present this project to source funding.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What I found interesting was that the 
feasibility study substantially reflects the same information that is in 
this presentation.  Now the feasibility study was completed at the end 
of October 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My question is which document informed 
the content of the other?  Did the feasibility study inform the conte nt of 
this document or did this document possibly inform the content of the 
feasibility study? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
Chair 
there 
- 
there 
are 
two 
documents.  There is a prefeasibility study that was done which was 
short and concise and then there was then the detailed feasibility 
study.  So the initial feasibility study also went into the big feasibility 
study. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now just to - to get absolute clarity on 
this the big feasibility study is the one that you signed off on when you 
signed off on the Phase 1 milestones that had been completed.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair, I am - I am trying to bring 
20 
it back to perspective again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  When we went to the Executive 
Council and they gave us the first tranche of payment part of that 
money was also to do that feasibility study.  Hence then when we 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 91 of 203 
 
signed off we then also got that money then to go and do the detailed 
feasibility study but then the prefeasibility study was already do ne 
which was positive at that time but we wanted the detailed one for us to 
be able to say yes indeed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am sorry. I just want to understand your 
answer.  Are you saying the first 30 million that was paid was for 
purposes of doing the prefeasibility study or the larger piece of work?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it was also - it was supposed to 
do the larger. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that is why the larger was part of 
Phase 1? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because that would be consistent with 
what you have said before that your understanding …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of the 30 million … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because it was supposed to cover Phase 
20 
1? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  Can I very briefly take you through 
Mr Dawie Marais’ report which we have also f urnished you with. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 92 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If I am not wrong and I know you have 
given us one or two comments before.  So I am just going to go through 
this very quickly.  The bundle you need …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Please remind me where to find it.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The bundle Chairman is Report’s Bundle 
B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the first page will be page 2-8-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-8-8 does not look the first page but no I think  my 
2-8-8 … 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is paragraph 1.4 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Page one - the cover page is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Report’s - Report’s Bundle B? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Report Bundle B Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And page 2-8-8? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The cover page is page 2-8-4 - the cover 
page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-8-4, okay oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would be 2-8-4. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  2-8-5 is the next one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is the same thing.  It is just that I thought 
you said the first page would be 2-8-8.  Maybe you meant the first page 
to which you want to talk.

Page 93 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is in fact - it is paragraph 1.4.  That is 
where I want to start Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And here he - he comments on location 
essentially and the - the essential point made about location was that 
this was a rather arid part of the country.  It has never been dairy milk 
cow farming territory.  He speaks to the coast - the midlands really 
being perfect for - for dairy farming and then he goes into the number 
10 
of producers who have shutdown. 
I do not know - I know you read the - the document.  You may 
just want to give us a comment on - on what Mr Marais’ issues are with 
- with regard to location. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  Maybe 
- maybe I am - I am seeing it differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Than the one he sees it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Before I comment to that I want us to 
20 
look at his - his table. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Just below that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At - at? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  1.4 under “Background” table number 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 94 of 203 
 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now his table number one is looking - 
it is giving months and number of milk producers per province.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In different years. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In different years.  Now I - I take it 
January 2006 the Free State had their highest number of milk 
producers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1 067. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  1 006. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which we have raised in our report 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Did you say the same number?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  1 067 was correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  1 067. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I thought you said 1  006. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sorry Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  1 067. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now if you look at his report you will 
see how quick the decline is specifically in the Free State.  It will mean 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 95 of 203 
 
dairy farming was doing well in the Free State irrespective of the 
statement that he is saying it is inland. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must - you say declining means it was doing 
well? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The number - it was doing well and 
then it started to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  In - initially? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Initially and then we started to see 
the decline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, in 2006 it was - in 2006 they were - there was a 
10 
great number of milk producers in the Free State.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then - then it started going down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  On top of the Free State …  
CHAIRPERSON:  By 20 - before you do that - by 20 - by January 2012 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The number of milk producers in the Free State in 
20 
terms of that information there had gone down - had decreased by 
something in the region of two/thirds.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By - by almost half Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By almost half. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 96 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no.  I - I think you are right.  I am l ooking at - I 
was looking at 3-2-2 which is for KwaZulu-Natal. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By - by half, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By half. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By almost half, ja.  You are right, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of course Mr Thabethe Mr Marais does 
say in that first paragraph that his decline is:  
“A result of higher production in the pasture based 
10 
areas or the coastal areas.  The cost of milk 
production inland provinces is a key factor due to 
the increase maize prices and other input costs.”  
So he puts this decline to environmental factors.  I am calling 
them that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I just wanted you to factor that into your 
answer or to take into considera tion. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes - yes Chair.  I - I just do not want 
to forget to answer your - your first question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Earlier question ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, because he was saying the Free 
State is - is an area where you would not do dairy.  That - that is my 
understanding.  Why did you choice the Free State?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Today, ja. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 97 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As Free State …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because we - we are in the Free 
State.  We cannot choose another …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Province to do dairy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Other than the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Nationally will do it differently but 
10 
we had an understanding that the Eastern Free State is the highest 
rainfall area, the arid part of the Free State is the worst in the Southern 
part towards Garieb, that is the arid.  Now the Eastern Free State is a 
very high rainfall area, hence we have got fruit production there, we 
have got dairy concentration and all that, so I would not agree with him 
that in the Free State you would not do dairy.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you accept his figures that between January 
2006 and January 2012, in six years, if I’m corre ct, the situation in the 
Free State, which I take to refer to the whole of the Free State.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That’s correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The situation was that the number of milk producers 
went down by half over six years, do you accept  that statement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      I accept that statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes, but I want to talk to that 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 98 of 203 
 
statement also to say this decline was a national decline, it was not 
only the decline of the Fre e State so the entire country in terms of 
dairy production we were declining, not on the basis of arid but on the 
basis of cost to do dairy.  There was – the cost of doing dairy versus 
the return on the price of milk farmers were not making it, hence they 
were leaving dairy. 
 
Now that has been our opening statement when we started 
Vrede Dairy, we say we want to deal with that issue because we saw in 
the Free State the rate at which the number of dairy farmers were 
declining were very high, so we had to do s omething, so I agree with 
10 
his statement, his figures, but the statement he is mentioning here it is 
a country statement, it is not a statement specific to the Free State, 
because everybody has been declining, so that decline cannot only 
accorded to the Free State Province, because it was the true statement 
for each province, all provinces declined.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Yes, continue, I am trying to give you 
the opportunity Mr Thabethe to deal with the issues including the 
second question, because ...[intervenes]  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes Chair I have responded to the 
first question to say this is what is my understanding and his figures 
20 
are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      His figures are correct?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      His figures are correct in the table 
but the reasoning behind it is the one I do not agree with.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 99 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Continue. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      I am not saying the Free State did 
not decline but it is not only the Free State that declined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      So it cannot be accorded to the 
Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      But you admit that by 2013 there had 
been a substantial decline?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Decline yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      In the Free State. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      In the Free State but we had 
provinces that declined more than the Free State.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   If you look at the last column on the 
right in terms of the percentage, the Free State had declined by 57, 
and then if you look further down the other Provinces had declined 
more than 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   So the issues at play here there were 
20 
many issues, they cannot be accorded to one area to say this is exactly 
the reason, so it is a number of issues.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I would imagine that you wouldn’t go into a 
business sector which had – which had effectively driven away 50% of 
businesses unless you had a solution for the pro blem that drove those 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 100 of 203 
 
businesses away.   What was your solution, what was driving them 
away and what was your solution?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair, further on in 
the report he is saying the only reason why in other countries dairy 
farming is a success is because of government involvement in his 
report he says because government is assisting the farmers, he 
normally calls it in the United States and Europe a tariff, in South 
Africa we call it a grant.  That way we assist the farmers.  T he problem 
was that you  had farms that had infrastructure for dairy, the 
infrastructure is in existent and those farmers are pulling out they say 
10 
we can’t make it, the costs become too expensive, so we needed an 
intervention of government to come in and s ay we will make it easier 
for you by bringing in a grant because this project was going to be built 
with a grant from government, which is not going to be costly for the 
farmer to be able to go back to dairy farming because the distance for 
the supply will be closer and they would be able to focus in the 
production and then the cost element is then going to be reduced.   
Now that was the thinking that made us to go back to say we need to 
assist, we can’t allow the decline of dairy in the Free State, being t he 
fourth largest producer of mealies in the country.  I agree with him the 
20 
coastal provinces were doing much better because of environmental 
factors, but the Free State did very well because in all the inland 
provinces, I would say in the inland provinces  it was number one. 
 
So we wouldn’t say we wouldn’t  do it there because we are 
inland, environmental issues are not so good for us, when before that 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 101 of 203 
 
we had proved that it can be done.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Yes I really, I am just trying to move 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well let’s talk about that Mr Thabethe.  If you are 
into milk producing as a business person and on your own I know that 
you are going to fail, because I know about five hundred other milk 
producers have failed over the past six years in the same province, and 
it seems that the reason you failed is because you did not produce 
enough or you – the business required you to spend too much on it than 
you were getting in and now I say well I don’t like this idea that you are 
10 
failing, I want to assist you, I will put in money. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, one of the questions that must cross my mind is 
if I look at what I may have to put in, the money that I may have to put 
in to assist you I must also look at wh at you will get out of the business 
and see whether it will be worth it because it cannot – it would not 
make sense if on your own if you rent the business on your own you are 
going to go under, I come in, I put in a lot of money, and you still go 
under.  It might also not make sense even if you are not going to go 
under once I have put in my money if nevertheless whatever you will 
20 
get maybe just be enough for you to float, you know.  
 
Now the question is was there a study that looked at that to 
say what will these farmers get out of this realistically speaking and 
when we look at what government, the department will put in for X 
number of farmers and what they will get out will it be worthwhile.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 102 of 203 
 
 
Now we know that over what three years you were going to put 
in about over R300million, that is a lot of money.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know what was realistically expected they 
would get out of their business over the three years?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, thank you Chair.  We had looked 
at that, the National Agricultural Marketing Council had done a study, 
and the study was indicating if this rate of decline of dairy farmers in 
the country would proceed the way it was proceeding it would mean 
that the country must then come with a plan of how to import milk, 
10 
because our own dairy farmers were not making it.   It means that’s the 
direction because if you don’t come in with an intervention strategy it 
means you will end up with all the small dairy farmers going out, only 
the large will remain. 
 
So the report was saying something needed to be done, we 
cannot allow it to disappear because it is a food security issue now, if 
you look at the country, we cannot rely on milk that we are importing.  
It is a problem but we have to  do something to make sure that we still 
have producers of milk in the country, otherwise we must decide we are 
going to import milk from somewhere, we have failed producing milk, 
20 
we are leaving it.    
 
And this intervention when we looked at this we thoug ht the 
issues that were being raised to be the cause of the decline could be 
addressed.  If you look specifically at the Free State, I think we have 
discussed this also earlier Chair that dairy – people that are selling 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 103 of 203 
 
milk are price takers, somebody comes and says I can buy your litre of 
milk for so much, take it or leave it.  It means you cannot decide how 
much you want to sell your milk, they tell you, you are a price taker, 
they tell you we can buy so much of your litre of milk, if you don’t take 
that price sorry, you are out of the market.  
 
That’s what we wanted to address, because for the Free State 
producers of milk it was very expensive, one of the elements that was 
making it very expensive was that cost of transport, because that cost 
of transport to come and collect your milk it is actually charged on you, 
the seller, that it costed me to send a truck to come and collect your 
10 
milk, if I can’t buy your milk at that price.  
 
Hence then Chair you will remember I said that’s why then we 
reverted on the model Paras, because Paras was the one sending the 
trucks, collecting the milk, bringing it into the processing facility, hence 
we are saying this processing facility will solve the problem of most of 
the farmers because it will – the milk will be collected, closer and the 
price will be much better, because the facility, nobody needs to pay for 
the facility because government has paid for the facility, because if a 
private person comes and put up the facility or have borrowed money to 
the bank he must make sure he makes enough money to go and pay for 
20 
the facility if the farmer has done that, but in this instance nobody 
owes it because government has invested into the facility for all 
farmers to benefit into it. 
 
Now that was our first model to say let’s impl ement this one, 
we believe it will succeed, and then we will address the decline of the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 104 of 203 
 
farmers because the prices will now be better because of the 
investment of government into that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But well you see if the real problem was transport and 
if that transport costs could be solved by having a truck, a government 
truck going around that is much more less than the R300million that 
you had used for the first three years and obviously you were going to 
still use a lot of – many more millions after.  So why don’t you just do 
exactly that, to say this is where we will assist you because this is 
where the problem is. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair it is not only that, I have 
10 
just put that one ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what would be the other one? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Remember in this model the farmers 
were also shareholders into the factory, this is not privately owned.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but let us go back to what the situation was 
before you came with the produce. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see there’s a problem. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The number of milk producers going down drastically.  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say one of the problems is their prices 
cannot be affected by the transport costs.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if government can take over the transport costs 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 105 of 203 
 
that could go a certain, a long way.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were the others? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   But over and above that Chair also 
being a shareholder because it means per litre if milk you are getting 
more, more than only selling the milk to the processing part it means 
you are also a participator in the value chain, you are not only sellin g 
your milk to the private sector and that’s it, it means your beneficiation 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean the farmer? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The farmer yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I am talking about is why don’t you say 
okay here identify farmers who are milk producers, and say we 
understand that this is where the problem lies, that’s where we will 
come in.  You will continue as normal but our – we will give you a 
helping hand in relation to costs but otherwise you continue and then 
you should be able to sell more of your milk because now you don’t 
have to worry about transport costs, government will take care of those.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It is not enough Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what were the other challenges, if that was 
20 
solved in that way? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes, that is why I am saying Chair if 
you are in – if you are part of ownership of the company that do 
processing you will get more money than only being provided with the 
transport so it becomes a lucrative business  to go into. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 106 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Because you will also get money in 
the processing which when you are only selling, you are not beneficiary 
to it, so it will then encourage even more farmers to get into it because 
you don’t only get the money for your milk and transporting for free but 
you also get money after your milk has been processed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But that was the only other one or were there other 
issues, costs and being shareholder.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Costs and being shareholder that 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transport costs and being shareholder.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, ja, that was the part that will then 
assist them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   And hence they will then have 
enough money to be able to deal with the issue of the production costs.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mr Thabethe of course the issue of water 
I am still dealing with the location.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And then you talked about rainfall 
patterns etcetera, that is not arid.  Water is critical to running a dairy 
farm you will agree with that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair water is critical but the 
Eastern Free State is not arid, we don’t have a pro blem of rainfall.   
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 107 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That will be a concern in an arid 
area. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   That is a view that you hold Mr Thabethe.  
If we turn to page 293 of the same document so it’s 293, I just want us 
to look at that feasibility study and his comment regarding water which 
is right at the bottom of that report, resources for site evaluation.  
Water is one of the major considerations when establishing a dairy, a 
sustainable clean source of water is very important.   There is no clear 
indication in the feasibility study on the source of water, you would 
10 
agree with that comment?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I do not agree, because we 
have a license form Water Affairs for access to water, which was issued 
by the Department of Water Affairs, so the problem he might have had 
he only focus the documents that he was provided with were three 
documents without any other supplementary information and he never 
came back to the Department to say but I do not see anything that  will 
assist you in here, what other information do we have, so – and he has 
a disclaimer on that in the report, to say this is the only documents that 
were made available to me by the investigator, because he was not 
20 
interacting with us, the investigator provided him with this document 
and he had no access to any other document because they were not 
asked from us, but we had permission from Water Affairs to access 
water, and hence I say I do not agree with the statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when you say you had permission from Water 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 108 of 203 
 
Affairs to access water that gives me the impression that you are 
talking about a river or rivers or dams as opposed to depending on the 
climate as such. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair.  That 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Were the rivers ...[intervenes]  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That gave access to the dam that 
was on the farm and also access to do boreholes on the farm for 
additional water. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I don’t know enough about boreholes, so I don’t 
10 
know whether the position is that as long as you dig deep enough you 
will find water or whether it is only certain areas where you will be able 
to do boreholes and find water. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, it depends on the strength of the 
area Chair, some areas the water availability strength is low, in some 
areas the water availability strength is high depending on the water 
table, and also depending on the rainfall in the area where you are, and 
the area that we are talking about had more than enough wate r. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you’re saying that the area where the farm was, 
farm is, is such that in terms of the requirements for finding water 
20 
using boreholes that you would easily have been able to  have 
boreholes and find water. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s what you are saying. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 109 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is based on the knowledge of the climate in 
the particular area. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In the particular area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   And I agree with him when he says 
water is key in a dairy, you would not start a dairy when you are not 
happy with the amount of water. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Chairman I notice that it is just on one  
o’clock, this might be a convenient time.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   To take the lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you, let us take the lunch adjournment, we 
will resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. Mr Thabethe my 
next question is one where I have tried to collect a few things from the 
20 
Maree Report.  So Mr Maree also questions the irrigation and 
mechanisation cost, the rain fed mechanisation cost, the cost of cattle 
and the cost of the bulk cooling tanks, the dairy products manufacturing 
plant and pasteuriser, the annual feed plant and grain old seed mill.  
You will find this at Table 5 on page 295 of the same documen t that is 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 110 of 203 
 
Reports B.  So my question to you is you have now read those 
observations made by Maree.  Did you interrogate the costing in the 
same manner that he did when you were given this – the feasibility 
study, the business plan?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thank you Chair.  I have went 
through his report on page 294 where he was talking to a number of 
issues. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But what I want to get into Chair was 
– I am trying to get to the exact statement where he t alks about – 
10 
because he has got a disclaimer on this.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Where he says his comment is only 
subject to an economist to do the evaluation and comparison.  Which 
he says he has not done.  Which makes it very difficult for me to agree 
with him because it is just his observation but he has not done any 
exercise to do comparison to say yes indeed.  Because you cannot say 
it is expensive when you have not done comparison to say what informs 
you to say this is too expensive.  So it is a statement that cannot be 
substantiated.  He should have gone and said this is the price of this 
20 
and this is the price of this why did you pay so much.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So are you – are you saying that when the 
feasibility study was done, when the business plan was done, the ones 
that were submitted to you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 111 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  You had specialists who interrogated the 
issues such as economists and would have dealt with the costing?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes what – what we provided Chair in 
our submission were cost estimate but when we were implementing 
then we presented the actual cost.  Now he assessed the plan not the 
actual cost.  Because those were two different things.  He looked at the 
document and he did the assessment in terms of the plan.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes that is what he had before him.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Because there you put 
estimation of the cost and then when you then implement the project 
10 
then you get actual.  Sometimes it is cheaper sometimes it more 
expensive than what is on the plan.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Now that actual document that you are 
talking about what is – what – where is it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The actual documents Chair where 
the actual cost are it is when you implement and then you – we have 
those monthly reports to say this was done and this was the cost.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Oh I see.  No then I am with you.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  If you are saying that the numbers you are 
20 
talking about that you can relate to are in the monthly reports and the 
quarterly reports. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because he assessed the original 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 112 of 203 
 
document before the implementation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then on the basis of that he says it 
looks expensive. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  And he… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But he does not say it looks 
expensive he says it is an expensive exercise.  Still I say to him he 
could still have done comparison to say why he says expensive 
because he has checked this tractor and this tractor – this size of a 
tractor in the market this is what is costs and in your plan it says this 
10 
much therefore we do not agree with you.  H e is giving a general 
statement that this is expensive, this is expensive without doing any 
comparison. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes.  No I have understood what you have 
said and will deal with the detail when we get to the monthly reports.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  But now that you mentioned tractors.  Do 
you – I – the evidence we have heard is that the department supplied a 
number of tractors to this particular project, do you recall that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  You – are you saying that the department 
did not supply tractors?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Now I think he is confusing.  
There was a separate program called Ilema/Letsema where the 
department supplied tractors in that area to assist small farmers to do 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 113 of 203 
 
ploughing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So those tractors were not meant for 
this project.  There was in a particular stage where we requested 
assistance from those farmers to come and assist befo re we could 
acquire tractors for the project but they were never bought and supplied 
by the department.  In fact those tractors came from National.  They 
were donated to the Province and there were specific farmers that had 
to be assisted with those tractors. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You know that is a bit strange because we 
10 
had the evidence of the Mr Basson who said he has a number of 
tractors belonging to the department that are parked in his yard – on 
his premises.  Now if you have got departmental stock a nd that is in 
Vrede. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Departmental tractors that are parked in 
Vrede you are saying that you would rather still use money that has 
been allocated to the Vrede Dairy Project to buy new tractors and not 
try and use stock that belongs to government that is sitting in Vrede 
and doing nothing at all.  What is the distance?  A five kilometre 
20 
distance between Basson’s premises and the farm – less? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair the department do not have 
tractors.  He might have been referring – I am not sure which tractors 
he was referring – he might have been referring to the tractors of the 
project which were being serviced by him that is the Vrede Dairy 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 114 of 203 
 
Project because the project has been servicing tho se tractors and 
repairing those tractors with him.  He might have alternatively been 
referring to these tractors which were given to farmers by the 
department which are in the hands of the farmers.  So they are not 
depart – they are not tractors that belon gs to the department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  If I – my recollection serves me well the 
donation was mentioned in Mr Jankielsohn’s evidence.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Mr Basson spoke about tractors that 
belonged as I have – I understood him to the project.   And as you say 
10 
that he had been repairing.  So I think that these are two separate sets 
of tractors. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  I think that would be correct because 
there are two different individuals who gave us this evidence.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  So I am not 
sure what – which tractors Mr Basson is referring to whether those of 
the project or he is referring to the set of tractors that  were donated to 
farmers.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  But… 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am not sure which ones were 
standing with him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  But if you were referring to tractors that 
belonged to the project that have been repaired by him that are still 
sitting in his premises you would be checking the invoices to see why a 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 115 of 203 
 
new tractor is being purchased whereas three months back a tractor 
was in fact purchased.  Is that how you would monitor the expenditure 
on tractors? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  There is a plan of how 
many tractors need to be bought for what purpose.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now those tractors at a given time 
will go there for repairs, they will go there for services.  Now I am not 
sure why he referred to those standing but it could be that when the 
projects came to a stop because then they were not operational 
10 
anymore then he might be referring to those tractors still standing.  I do 
not know I am just – because I am not able to say exactly what tractors 
is he referring to that are standing with him.  I do not – it is difficult for 
me to answer Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  That is fine because the point really I had 
been making at the beginning was the extent to which stock that is 
available is used for the dairy project as opposed to purchasing new 
items when the money for the new item could be used for something 
totally different. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is what I was trying to explore at the 
time. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  No there was not stock readily 
available Chair hence we had to purchase tractors.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Your understanding is that everything that 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 116 of 203 
 
was purchased for the dairy farm was new?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is my understanding Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you Mr Thabethe I want to move on 
because we have a long way to go and we have got a couple hours this 
afternoon.  If we then go back to your annexures to the 2017 affidavit 
MPT14 – Annexure 14 at Tab number 14 was not received.  This is the 
preliminary – all the detailed business plan.  I was not too sure which 
one you were really referring to.  If we just go to paragraph 16 of your 
affidavit.  So just go to the front of that same doc – same file.  If you – 
paragraph 16 you will find on page 249.  
10 
tMR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  My apology Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which flag number? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  We are talking about 14, 14 and 14 says 
not received.  So when you go to  the affidavit to see what it is that has 
not been received. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  We go to paragraph 16.  You know we 
were trying to give content remember Mr Thabethe to what you say in 
your affidavit.  We had the affidavit but no annexures. So now we are 
20 
just putting the two together.  So MPT14 refers to the preliminary.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Or to the detailed business plan?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As per the binding agreement Estina 
was requested to develop a feasibility study and a business plan.  I 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 117 of 203 
 
think Chair this is the big business plan.  The latest one not the 
preliminary. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So if you go Mr Thabethe to Reports 
bundle B – Reports bundle B.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is the one we were using just now.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  That we were using earlier Chairman.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  And you go to page 3 – no this is a 
feasibility study.  We go to page 321.  Can you identify this and tell the 
10 
Chairman whether this is the preliminary or the full business plan that 
was commissioned?  Page 321 Reports bundle B.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Chair the one where we are now 
is the preliminary. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is this the preliminary?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  This is the only copy as far as I am aware 
that the commission has.  Is there a bigger document than this?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  There is a bigger business plan than 
20 
this one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  You might as well tell us about the 
feasibility study which is the very next document at 331 just now that 
we talking about final and interim documen ts. The commission has 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 118 of 203 
 
understood certainly the evidence leaders have understood that that 
document that runs from page 331 all the way to page 396 is the final 
feasibility study of October 2012.  Is that correct?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Excellent.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I think what we are having here this is 
– the first document is the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  32 – page 321 you say is the preliminary?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is the preliminary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then page 332 – 331. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is the bigger plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the big – is the final? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes that one. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Of the feasibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Feasibility study ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So they are just together. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Together yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they are different… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They are two different. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes.  Thank you.  Then we have Annexure 
15 which is the deviation memorandum.  We have discussed that we do 
not need to go into that at this point in time.  If we go to 16.  Now at 
16, Annexure 16 you have given us Annexure 16A, B and C.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 119 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Have we moved aw ay from the feasibility 
study? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Oh Chairman we are back yes – we are 
back to HH… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I should close it.  You will come back to it.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Do not close it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  HH10 we are back with the affidavit and 
10 
the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  We are at Tab number 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  16? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  16 Chairman.  And here you have actually 
– it is just that the photocopying has chopped off some of the letters at 
the top.  But you have got a 16A which is on page 424.  16B is legible 
on page 425.  16C… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – my one does not reflect A oh you say it is 16A 
and the… 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes the A has been chopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja   16 A and the A has been…  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  A little Chairman yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay I think we need to  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Reinstate it. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 120 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make sure that otherwise one thinks that one is not 
on the right page.  Okay then the next one is 16B  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that is 16A.  The next one Chairman is 
16B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  That one is legible.  And the third one is 
16C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Those are the ones I want to deal with 
right now.  You mention them at paragraph 18 of your affidavit.  So if 
10 
we go to the front again give us context?  
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you say these are at 16A, 16B and 16C?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman it is a record of payments that 
were made to Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  They are not very legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  But I will – I will deal with them as best I 
20 
can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So if we go to paragraph 18.  They are 
actually set out in this schedule here Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 121 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  In fact Mr Thabethe what you have at 
paragraph 18 and then you explain it in 19. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Is – these are the payments that you 
believed had been made?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  To Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  Of course we have agreed that the 
first R30 million that was paid in July 2012 is not recorded here?  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Because at the time you prepared this 
affidavit you were not aware? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  The – I had not 
received proper confirmation which I had later then received.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  So you knew that the money had 
been paid but because nobody could give you the receipts.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The proof of the payment yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You were reluctant to deal with the 
amount? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  But we … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I had to provide evidence to 
that in attachment but then later then we got that.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  So… 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 122 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let – the first line of paragraph 18 says the table 
shows the – reflects the manner in which payment was done.  Does the 
manner in which payment was done refer to the times when payments 
were made and the amounts that were made.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That were paid. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETH E:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If – so in a financial year 2013/2014 if you 
look at that schedule at 18 – at paragraph 18 the amounts were 
R34 950 000.00.  You have got it there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes.  The second amount was R30 million.  
You have it there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  That is the second item.  And these are 
both April payments that were effected.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ten days apart hey? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Just a few days apart Chairman yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes.  And then the third one is 
R19 050 000.00.  That is the third one.  That is 16.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 123 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is eight days later than the second one.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Now I have a copy of the – the AG’s 
report.  My colleague is just getting the reference I made the error of 
not putting the reference in here.  I normally write it in.  My apologies 
Chair just if you would please indulge us.  In essence a total of 
R113 950 000.00 was paid. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  In that particular financial year.  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  I actually want to point you to a particular 
note in that AG’s report.  Well I will come back to this point because I 
actually am trying to cover a bit of time.  Coming back to the same 
paragraph 18 we then find that in 2014 an amount of R30 million was 
paid.  That you will find at 16E – Annexure 16E.  And before that of 
course the R29 950 000.00 which you will find at Annexure D – 16D.  I 
just want – all I am asking you to do is to confirm these amounts that 
you are happy with these amounts Mr Thabethe?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am – I am Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you confirm that these were – these amounts were 
paid? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  I confirm 
because these were the amounts that proof of payment …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was available to you. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 124 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Was available to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To include yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you.  My colleague has located the 
document that I was looking for.  So we are looking at Reference 
bundle F that is the one that was admitted into the record yesterday F.  
Are you there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  And the page is 106.  Oh they did say 
10 
that. Chairman can I explain this?  My colleague is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Because we took these… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page first? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  It is page – if it is – there are two 
numbers – two page numbers.  Please use the centre page number.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  And that is 1968.  Because these came 
out of a different bundle Chairman the one in the corner belongs to the 
other bundle.  For this bundle we are using EST reference 1968.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ah. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  So in the middle… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether it might not be better that even later 
on somebody crosses out the corner…  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  The one on the right? 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 125 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja so that there can never be any confusion. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  We will do that Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  It is Tab number 91 if your bundle is 
tabbed. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I have got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Now at note 5.4 what I found instructive 
was the second paragraph.  Because it deals with these transfer 
payments that we have been trying to come to grips with.  And the note 
is as follows in paragraph 2. 
10 
“Departments are requested to provide the name of 
the transferee.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am at…  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1967 middle number. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  1968 which is the next page.  The – one 
the far right it will be 1060. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  But it is 1968 that is the correct number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Paragraph 2 Chairman is the one that I am 
focussing on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so when you said paragraph 2 I was looking 
for a number 2. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  I see.  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 126 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas – because there is 5.4. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  It is 5.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  But it is the second paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay it is the second paragraph under 5.4.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Thank you.  Yes.  So it reads as fol lows 
Mr Thabethe: 
“Departments are requested to provide the name of 
the transferee, the purpose for which these funds 
were transferred, did the department comply with 
10 
Section 38.1J?  The amount transferred.  The 
amounts spent from the transfer.  Received b y the 
transferee and in bracket [excluding individuals or 
social grants payments].  And the reasons for 
unspent funds by the transferee. Departments must 
also comment on monthly monitoring systems or the 
lack thereof to monitor spending on such transfers.  
If such monitoring did take place departments must 
provide details of difficulties experienced and what 
steps if any were taken to rectify such difficulties.”  
20 
So you then have the table below that and I – my assumption is that all 
of this has come from th e Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development, it would be correct?  These numbers would have come 
from you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  You mean the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 127 of 203 
 
numbers that are in the …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  In this – that column that firs t column? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Aha I thought so.  So the name of the 
transferee here the name you have put in is Vrede Dairy?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  Is there any reason that it is Vrede Dairy 
and not Estina because Estina is the implementing agent and it is 
Estina that is held to account?  I just failed to understand that but I 
knew you would be able to explain it.  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair the name of th e name on 
which the budget is gazetted it is Vrede Dairy.  It is not Estina.  So 
when you report you report the budget allocation under Vrede Dairy.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you report against the project not 
against the implementing agent?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You report against the project 
because if this money is gazetted under a certain topic to say this 
amount of money goes to Vrede Dairy then when you present your 
report otherwise then it will confuse somebody which budget are you 
relating to.  Hence it says Vrede Dairy. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :  You see…; 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is the name under which the 
budget was allocated. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I understand.  My - my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 128 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Difficulty I suppose ar ises from the fact 
that when you want to hold somebody to account having the project 
name there can be misleading because it is the implementing agent 
who is the person you want to hold to account.  You do not think that 
would present any difficulties at all? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I - I hear you Chair.  Hence the 
comment that they are giving but remember the audit that is done by 
the Auditor-General …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They do the audit on our financial 
10 
statement.  Now the financial statement says so much money was 
allocated and - and this much.  Then they are then saying moving 
forward departments must then also reflect that - that is my 
understanding of the statement that we will then have also to reflect to 
whom the money was transferred?  How much was spent and so on.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and that is where I - I just want to 
spend a little bit of time because one of the things the Chairman is 
enjoying to do is make recommendations on how to improve syste ms 
that are in place.  Systems that are not as clear as they might be if a 
different modality was adopted …  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And this is why I debate this with you 
because at least you have some knowledge of - of these matters. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair my knowledge on 
this is very limited.  The - the CFO and the - the finance section of the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 129 of 203 
 
department deals with this.  So they know the details of - of doing the 
financial statements which eventually get  to the Auditor-General.  I am 
only explaining my understanding of these but I will not be able to go 
into the details. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Mr Thabethe but as the HOD - you are 
the Accounting Officer for everything - finances - for absolutely 
everything.  So your team - you have got people who report into you 
who explain things to you.  It does not matter which division they may 
sit in.  Yours is to at least have a - a strategic overview of what is 
going on in the department. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you - money is important.  You will 
have a very close relationship with the CFO.  Am I right?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair I agree but I would 
not have gone otherwise I - I will be a very super person to know the 
details of - of each - because this - this is going into the details.  What 
I would know is that so much money has been paid and - and the 
details then the CFO comes in because they are trained into these 
issues. 
They will understand even what Treasury - what the Auditor-
20 
General is saying here.  They will understand far much better than - 
because if I will try and explain these I may not be telling the correct 
thing.  What is it that they are saying?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But this is a simple proposition because 
this table that very first table accords with what you have put in 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 130 of 203 
 
paragraphs 18 and 19 of your affidavit.  We - we agreed on that 
earlier? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That the total amount spent between 
April 2013 and March 2014 was R113 905 000,00. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja.  So I mean there is no - there is no 
rocket science thinking that goes into this.  You know that that is 
definitely correct.  Yes.  That number is correct.  I am just starting at 
the easy thing. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I agree the number is correct 
Chair … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But what - what is on top those 
statements that are on top are - are very key. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They need - they need somebody who 
understands to be able to implement what they say.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No and the reason I say they do not need 
somebody who is a specialist in finance is because as a lawyer I was 
20 
able to read this and understand exactly what is required and I have no 
financial background at all …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I have never been a Head of 
Department.  So I am challenging you to help me work this through this.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 131 of 203 
 
From my position of never having been a Head of Department.  Let us 
go Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe please do not forget your line of 
thinking. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to see whether we are on the - our 
concern is the same or not. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Mr Thabethe you said that in effect it was in 
order that they wrote Vrede Dairy in the column wh ere they were 
supposed to write the name of the transferee.  You remember that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I hear you Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have difficulty with accepting that because if 
you look at the third column in that table.  It says p urpose for which the 
funds were used. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So each column you are supposed to enter only the 
information that is required.  Now under name of transferee obviously 
20 
what is required is you must say who was paid and then - and then the 
next column says type of organisation …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And one assumes that there is a reason why they 
would even want type of organisation that might not be apparent to me.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 132 of 203 
 
Maybe to Ms Gcabashe as well as lawyers but they - we - we have to 
assume they have a reason to want that information.  Then the next - 
the third column is purpose for which the funds were used and then you 
see what is written there is project implementation.  
If you ask me that is where the reference to Vrede Dairy 
Project would come in. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so that if I am correct about that then writing 
Vrede Dairy under name of transferee could not be correct because that 
is not the person who was paid. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair that - that is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  What I was explaining Chair is that 
we - we are looking at this table.  We do not know what informs how 
they put it in this table.  May - maybe the - the mistake could have 
happened on the budget side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am inviting you to concede that it was wrong for 
them to write Vrede Dairy when they were supposed to disclose the 
name of the person to whom the money was  transferred because there 
20 
is a column …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where they needed to disclose what the payment was 
for … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 133 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Which 
is 
where 
they 
would 
have 
written 
implementation of Vrede Dairy Project or just Vrede Dairy Project.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - do you accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I do not know whether we (intervenes).  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is exactly …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Absolutely Chairman …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because I think it just makes it much 
clearer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Irrespective of where that record sits.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Whether it is in your annual financial 
statements, in your strategic plans.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The same explanation.  As I un derstand 
what that paragraph that I read into the record requires.  You really - it 
is - it is asking for transparency. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is right. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Quite frankly.  It - so that we know exactly 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 134 of 203 
 
who is handling the funds a nd - and I was actually going to suggest 
that it could even be Estina/Vrede Dairy.  So that your needs are 
catered for as the department.  You know that that is the project …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But we must know the implementing agent 
that is handling that money …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because when the issue of monitoring the 
spending on such transfers arises and that is line one, two, three, four 
in the middle of the same paragraph.  One then interrogates how the 
10 
monitoring of the spending of these monies was conducted.  So we are 
talking - it is implementation. 
We are really talking about how the department implemented 
the obligations that arose in relation to the dairy farm and accounting 
to the public for the monies that had been dispersed.  You have 
understood …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That - that line of thinking anyway?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I - I just want to check Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because I - I only see the extract of 
three pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am - I am not sure if this was a final 
report. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 135 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It makes it very difficult for me to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  To - to … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To talk to it whether was it a draft.  At 
this time whether it was already final.  I am - I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Of course you can preface your comments on by 
saying well if it was not final this is what I  have to say.  If it was final 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is what I have to say. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I - I take it Chair they took it 
from the final …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It - it is.  Chairman I must say that where 
we got this from it came to us in this format …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I asked one of our investigators …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To print the entire document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For me … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because I wanted to be sure …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  when I say the AG.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 136 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am actually speaking about the AG’s 
report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I must say that it is sitting on my 
desk.  I looked at it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But in the rush to get here this morning …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I really knew that this issue might 
arise … 
10 
CAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Which is why I know …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have the - I can actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If it is important Mr Thabethe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When we adjourn we can go across the 
road and I will give you - it is actually quite a thick document.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I could give that to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but it - it depends whether you want to look at 
something in that - in the report or whether you just wanted to know 
whether it was final or not. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, ja.  Chair I have a number of 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 137 of 203 
 
other questions because if - if it was the final report because we would 
have then have engaged with the Auditor -General to say but why is 
column … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  B empty? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We could have then engaged with that 
because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Our - our audit statement leave s from 
10 
us to Provincial Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If there would be any problem 
Provincial Treasury will say no, no we do not agree with your …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Your statement.  One, two, three, fo ur 
is not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
Before 
then 
it 
goes 
to 
the 
Auditor-General. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is the reason why I am 
asking if …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Indeed this has gone through all - all 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 138 of 203 
 
our hands and we are not able to pick it.  Hence it is an issue now.  
That - that is the basis why I am asking …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I suggest to you that it did go through 
your hands and that - that is the precise question …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I was going to ask you.  In relation to 
these empty columns …  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because not only type of organisation is 
empty.  You have not - there is no entry - there is no entry here … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And my assumption is the department did 
not supply that information but there may have been an explanat ion for 
that … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then the column that says amount 
spent by the entity … 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again does not have an - an entry and I 
am sure you would have had that am ount … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes) Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Readily available. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 139 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that you could account for it …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In all the records that you need to prepare 
prior to the AG being given information.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Hence my comment Chair 
because even the Provincial Treasury would have referred it back to us 
to say but you are giving us a - a financial statement that has gaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is why I am asking but …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It might be that it - it might have 
slipped through …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  All of us …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Without this information …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and I take it Chair that in that 
particular year we got unqualified audit.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They said to us your financial 
statements are absent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In - indeed so.  I am coming to that. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 140 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I was surprised but pleasantly surprised.  
I have got - I have actually - I have got it.  Do not worry.  I am - I am 
very fair Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I made a note of that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Of that opinion.  You are quite 
correct about that but we are going to get to it in a minute.  In fact …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is the very next document we are 
looking at …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you must remind me now Mr  Thabethe …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because at some stage I had a clear understanding of 
these things about qualified and unqualified audits …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I know that some peopled used to get them mixed 
20 
up … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think right now I am - I am not sure that I am - 
because I think if you follow with just the general understanding.  
Sometimes you understand it in a certain way.  Just go back qualified 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 141 of 203 
 
and unqualified. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see unqualified to the general lay person’s mind 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might - might give the idea that it is good …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no qualification.  There is - there is no 
condition you know. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is no dark spots. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know, but if you say also qualified.  You know 
qualified is supposed to - if somebody is qualified it is good but also if 
it is qualified it can be - it means it is condition - it could mean it is 
conditional. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is a very basic thing but I just realised that I 
have just forgotten and …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly which one is good which one is bad?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  The one on top Chair is the clean 
audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The unqualified? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  The clean audit is the one where  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 142 of 203 
 
they cannot say anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first prize? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is the first prize. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Clean audit? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Clean audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Just below clean audit is unqualified . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unqualified? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Unqualified says your finances 
are fine but we have the following comments to make to you to improve 
10 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why do you say unqualified because it is like they 
are qualifying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair but …  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is like yes, but. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is - that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is how it is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe that is why it is - it is confusing.  You know.  It 
is like you say to a student you have passed but you must focus on this 
20 
on this otherwise you will fail next time.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Next time.  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You see.  That is the - that is the unqualified.  The 
one that says that.  That is the unqualified?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is the unqualified. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 143 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is the second from the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But, but can you understand what I am saying?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From a lay person’s person it is like I am approving 
but my approval is qualified. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is called unqualified.  It is like - it is - it is okay 
10 
but if you do not fix A, B, C next time there will be a problem.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then the qualified? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And then the qualified one has a bit 
of holes …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In - into it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and then there - there are two 
which are at the bottom.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which are very bad? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which are very bad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Just remind me what are those again.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 144 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the last one is a disclaimer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Disclaimer, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then that is … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It means you are not (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a disaster? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  You are not even … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is chaos. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is just - it is a mess. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is a mess Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a mess.  The documents of records are not there.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You - you are not even able to 
present your financial statements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the worst. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is the correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is the bottom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Disclaimer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one above that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - it is - it is not actually - it is - it 
is normally what you … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 145 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or better than that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Will - will talk to but it is not a 
category. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  What do they call it?  I am 
trying to go back to it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It has been some time Chair that 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but do not worry if - if you cannot remember it. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So - so you say what - which one did you get 
this - this time around that you are telling me about?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is - it is the unqualified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The unqualified? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is like second best? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Ms Gcabashe I was - was I alone in this 
confusion? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Unfortunately yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at least at some stage I understood it very 
clearly.  I do not know what h appened recently. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would probably be in the same position 
next week Chairman when I have not been looking at these documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But - yes in fact can I just go a step back 
because I have now found the - the other document that I was looking 
for and it is really just to corroborate in a sense …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What you had put in your paragraph 18.  
Now these - if I can ask you to look at Reference Bundle D for Donald 
and the page there is 1 -4-5-2.  D - Reference Bundle D and it is 
10 
towards the back.  Reference Bundle D …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which one is that one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The page is 1-4-5-2 Chairman.  Towards 
the back Mr Thabethe.  Page 1-4-5-2.  I am at the same time still 
looking at paragraph 18 of your affidavit which is on page 2 -4-9 of 
HH10B and all I am saying Mr  Thabethe is that when I look at the 
figures you put out … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In paragraph 8 you will find the very same 
20 
figures in Reference Bundle B page 1-4-5-2. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Save that that first 30 millio n that we have 
agreed … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 147 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is the very first one that - that is recorded 
there.  So in July - on 9 July Estina was given R30 million?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On 18 April 2013 it receive another 
R34 950 000,00.  On 26 April 2013 it received R30 million.  On 
3 May 2013 it received 19 050 000.  On 20 December 2013 it received 
the amount of 29 950 000.  Then on 25 July 2014 just before you 
cancelled that contract. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They received 30 million. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  After cancellation on 8 May 2015 they 
were paid 60 million and the last payment they received was on 
5 May 2016 and that was R46 252 652,00.  The total that was disbursed 
is there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  280 200-and - I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  280 million. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is - it is big money to some of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought …  
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These - these amounts are … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite familiar to Counsel. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No and I was doing so well with all the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 148 of 203 
 
others.  You know DCJ.  It is because I have been looking at them for 
so long but now I go back to my old style of knowing.  I - I handle 
thousands.  I do not have to live - but let us go back to - thanks DCJ.  
R280 202 652,00. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So essentially R280 million is what they 
were paid.  That is the number I want you to lock in your head.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because we will be coming back to talk 
about it … 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And - and the reason I produce this 
particular document is just to compare it to what you had produced and 
say you are spot on save for that little error at the beginning.  
Otherwise you are quite correct … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  About what you had disclosed at the time.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think if we just finish off with these 
annexures - I am trying to get them out of the way. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe I am sorry. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just do not want to forget this am I correct to say 
throughout the period until the cancellation of the agreement Estina 
had not made any payment in terms of the amounts that it was 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 149 of 203 
 
supposed to pay in terms of the agreement?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had not?  I - I know - well what I have not double 
checked now is whether the last agreement like the first or the second - 
I cannot remember - still had a provision that said Estina was to put in 
a certain amount.  You remember that?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, ja.  The difficulty Chair the way 
you put … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is difficult for me to say you are not 
10 
correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I - it is a very simple answer.  No, no 
Mr Thabethe. You have read the quarterly and the monthly reports …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you have seen the numbers that were 
submitted by Estina. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the answer to the Chairman is 
Chairman you are wrong …  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because the quarterly and the monthly 
reports reflect a differen t version. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is what I am - I am saying 
Chair but it … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 150 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  What I am saying is difficult to say to 
the Chair you are wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Gcabashe just explain that again. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So Chairman …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Your remember initially there was a clause which said 
Estina would put in a certain amount and the department would put in a 
certain amount and we were looking at the question of where Estina 
would get the money from. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I was saying I have not looked at the last 
agreement whether that provision was carried throughout or whether it 
was dropped and if it was not dropped whether Estina ever made th at 
contribution. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When we get to the monthly and quarterly 
reports which I am hoping we can still get to today Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will see the reports from Estina where 
they say we have put in 250  000.  We have put in 3.6 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This is what they say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But it is all in the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Documentation … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 151 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That was presented … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As per the agreement to the Head of 
Department or to the department maybe not to the head …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And we will go - go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At the end …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of the day you really want to know 
compared to the - so they were supposed to put in 228 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For the processing plant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are talking you there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are talking you to a valuation of the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Processing plant …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That was done in 2017 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then we are comparing …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 152 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just to put me at ease.  Is the position that they 
did pay - do their part in terms of payment or … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that unclear? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Once we show Mr - it is unclear - Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thabethe the evidence that is in those 
quarterly reports …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We would like an explanation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On why the last two payments were made 
after the contract was …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was cancelled … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because those were claims in terms of 
that Clause 15.3 I referred to earlier …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But whether they were justifiable claims 
only Mr Thabethe possibly can help us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I - I think I just want to mention this so that 
even if I were to forget at least one of you will not forget.  It is 
important for - I - I do want to know whether one that obligation 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 153 of 203 
 
continued through on the part of Estina to make a contribution.  
Whether it made the - the contribution that was envisaged 
and - that is two, but three I am interested in the timing of the payment 
by them.  In other words did - did they not pay with the money that you 
paid them. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Exactly Chairman.  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But that is where we are going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is called round tripping. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have learned a lot Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  There is a term for it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There is a term for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is called round tripping. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You pay and then they round trip it.  It 
comes back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Your money. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then they say we are money into the 
budget … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 154 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But Mr Thabethe is going to assist us …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because we can only speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Really on the basis of documents that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That are available … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I think it will be fair to ask him to help 
10 
us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Analyse what we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr  Thabethe let us 
just get rid of these annexures very quickly.  We are almost done with 
it.  We are now looking at - with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Do I push aside this file now?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just for a minute Chairman.  I - to your 
left possibly because I can see on your right you have got other files or 
20 
the other way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  From where I am sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To my - to my right …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To your … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 155 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your left? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To your - please put it on your right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe are you one of those people who need 
to do this … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say whether it is left or not?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am.  I will admit very quickly.  Do not 
ask me left or right hand.  I have got to think or turn right.  I - I have to 
think Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But they say creative people Chairman.  I 
like that.  That is a (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We - we go back to the annexures. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we are back to the annexures 
Chairman simply because I think I would like to get this file out of the 
way as - as soon as we can.  So we have been dealing with 18 and - 
and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I just cannot resist this remark.  That if Estina had 
R16,00 when the contract was entered into.  It is highly un likely they 
paid with any money other than the money they got from the 
20 
department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are going there Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but Mr Thabethe might be able to explain and 
say … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Exactly. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 156 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it is not like that.  Okay, thank you.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes sir.  If - if - Chairman if you really 
want to go there immediately if you give me a five minute adjournment I 
will find the spot in my questions and we can actually deal with that 
immediately because I have got the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  If - if it is convenient.  If it is convenient otherwise I 
am happy to go at your pace.  It is just that it was something worrying 
me.  I - I am easy about it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I - I literally just need two 
minutes to collect - to … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just to find - let us look at those monthly 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Monthly reports.  If you just give me two 
minutes to pull out the right documentatio n. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Let us adjourn for five minutes, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And let us do that.  Thank you.  Thank you 
sir. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 157 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Chairman so we are dealing with 
reference Bundle D for Donald, reference Bundle D, and I think that is 
probably going to take us at least an hour Chairman, I doubt we are 
going to use any of the others, but it is Reference Bundle D that has 
the monthly and the quarterly reports.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      And the page number Chairman is 
1398, Mr Thabethe page 1398 is where it starts, and I am hoping that 
these are semi-familiar Mr Thabethe because this report or these 
10 
reports, because there are a number of them were submitted in terms of 
that 7 t h of July agreement, it’s part of how you implemented that 
agreement, it is one of the ways in which you monitored th e spend that 
you had transferred to Estina, okay.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      So the first one we’re looking at is 
September 30 2012, and in the background paragraph just to touch on 
what is set out there they r eally say that the project was initiated on 
the 5 t h of July 2012.  Okay Mr Thabethe?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      We know of course that that’s the date 
on which you signed the agreement, and that’s what they are calling th e 
initiation.  The first phase obligations that are set out on that same 
page I – we have dealt with, these are the ones that the Chairman 
interrogated, I interrogated and you will them, I just want us to get a 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 158 of 203 
 
clearer copy, if we go to page 1378 of the sa me document, the same 
file, 1378.   And again you will find this looks familiar Mr Thabethe, 
those were the phase one obligations that we interrogated a while back 
with you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      The same obligations which appear in 
the agreement if you keep your finger on 1378 are the ones which are 
in this red print and that are not particularly clear.  If you turn the page 
there’s an explanation on the project, I am going to the third paragraph 
there, which says that Estina is awaiting the signing of a lease 
10 
agreement for the said property and an official handover of said 
property to enable them to commence work on the project.  Do you see 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry are you reading from 1378?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      I am reading from 1399 Chairman, my 
apologies, it is 1399 now Chairman, and it is the third paragraph.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      And I will read the fourth paragraph,  
“Estina would like to make the Department aware th at all its 
obligations can only commence from the date of official 
20 
handover of the land to Estina.”  
You were aware of this Mr Thabethe at the time, that they were waiting 
for the – this is the September report remember.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      The lease was only signed on the 14 t h 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 159 of 203 
 
of December 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      So you were very much aware that 
between September and the signing of the lease in  December their view 
was they couldn’t do much?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      Yes Chair I think that was the 
issue that was also discussed in the Commission, I think it was the 
State Law Advisors in terms of dealing with the issue of the land.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Yes that is a different topic which I will 
also address with you at a later stage.   But I know that you were 
10 
involved in ensuring that that lease was signed.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      In December of 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Then the very last paragraph on page 
1399 reads ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Yes Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Again Ms Gcabashe you will tell me if there’s 
something I am missing here, could it be Mr Thabethe that by ensuring 
20 
that there was a provision to this effect in the agreement that is Estina, 
namely all its obligations would only commence from the date of the 
official handover of – or this is of the land, I thought there was a 
provision that was a little similar but relating to the handover of the 
shareholder company or the handover of the project to the farmers, at 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 160 of 203 
 
some stage, but at least this relates to the handover of the lan d? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Of the land Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, no, no. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      And it is evidence that Mr Morreme 
gave at the hearing because he was at that point the Municipal 
Manager of Phumelela Municipality.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      And this land is located, this farm is 
located, in fact it is all of Vrede plus at that municipality.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I probably had something else in mind, ja, 
10 
okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      My colleague thinks yo u may be 
thinking of the handover of assets because you have been reading your 
documents, there’s also the FDC taking over at some point Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what I was concerned about whether Estina 
ensured that the agreement had a clause which wou ld make sure that 
they did not have to put in any money until a certain stage but that 
stage could only be reached after the department had made payment to 
them therefore allowing them to be able to perform their obligations in 
terms of putting in their co ntribution with the money from the 
20 
department that’s what my thinking was, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      Chairman you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We might not need to bother about it until later 
maybe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      In fact it is the evidence of Mr 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 161 of 203 
 
Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      That there was a phase one and a 
phase two, am I correct Mr Thabethe?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:      That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:      And your evidence was phase one the 
milestones for phase one are the ones on page 1378.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   The most important milestone for phase 2 
10 
was the establishment of the milk processing plant?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETH E:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   And that is the plant Chairman that 
Estina was going to pay for in total and you had a debate with Mr 
Thabethe at the time about whether the money was coming from Estina 
or from Paras and I think that’s t he evidence you have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes at the back of my mind.    
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   At the back of your mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   But that phase 2 according to Mr 
20 
Thabethe, correct me if I’m wrong, would only kick in on ce phase one 
had been signed off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Thank you Mr Thabethe. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 162 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the department’s obligations to pay the R250 or 
whatever million it was during phase o ne or phase one some phase 
two? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Chairman it was a three year program.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It was rounded off at 114million for each 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For each year, okay, okay, and phase one was within 
the first year? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Phase one was within the first year.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   And as Mr Thabethe explained if we just 
very briefly look at page 1378, these are matters we did debate with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   On the 18 t h of January 2013 he signed off 
on the completion of phase one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Because he at the time was satisfied that 
all the phase one obligations had been met.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Been met, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And I know that by the end of the 
discussion on this he had conceded that there were a few of them that 
had not been met. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 163 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But the record will show the nature of 
that discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   So those are the – because we are in 
September of 2012 Chairman we are still talking about those phase one 
milestones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And this is why what’s written in the 
pinkish/reddish colour is the environmental impact assessment, you will 
find it on that phase one schedule at 1378, the feasibility study, water 
10 
reticulation and then electricity connections and applications, that’s 
what is written just above the last paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Am I correct Mr Thabethe?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Thank you sir.  Then the report goes on 
to say in the very last paragraph Chairman that all the above activit ies 
can only be initiated after the land is officially handed over to Estina, 
however Estina has already commenced work on the feasibility studies 
which should be completed by the 30 t h of October 2012. 
20 
 
And Mr Thabethe if I recall your evidence you underst ood that 
first R30million to be allocated to in part that feasibility ...[indistinct]  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Thank you.  Over the page at page 1400 
the identity of the BEE entity and the set up of the BEE entity in the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 164 of 203 
 
agreement, I think it is clause 7.1 Mr Thabethe if the department, I 
actually went back to verify, you did say the department took 
responsibility for identifying the beneficiaries, not for setting up the 
BEE structure but certainly for identi fying the beneficiaries. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Am I correct, thank you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman then you have in that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remember to raise your voice a bit Mr Thabethe, 
10 
I know it is late in the afternoon, it has been a long day so that your 
answers are recorded, just remember to raise your voice a bit.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Now Mr Thabethe I need your input on 
that first paragraph, in fact everything that follows under the Agri BEE 
entity.  What is written here is the following:  
“In terms of the agri BEE entity Estina has already set up an 
entity called Zana Investments Pty Limite d having registration 
number 2012/037526/07 in February 2012.  Estina have now 
20 
applied to the registrar of companies to change the name of 
the above company to Mohama Mobung Dairy Project Pty 
Limited in line with the vision of the project.”  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Two things arise Mr Thabethe, number 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 165 of 203 
 
one this is September 2012, we know that the Zana Investments Pty 
Limited entity was part of the 5 t h of June 2012 agreement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   We know that you accepted the advice of 
the State Law Advisors when they told you that that particular 
agreement was not a valid agreement.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :    Hence the signing of the new agreement 
on the 5 t h and the 7 t h of July.  When you saw this entry that still spoke 
about Zana Investments on receipt of this September 2012 report from 
10 
Estina what did you do?  Did you – what was your reaction?   How did 
you start dealing with this issue?    
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I am going back to say this 
was a report of September 2012, which we have already ticked, that the 
shelf company has been registered.   Because the department had 
changed the conditions which then de layed, because it then became 
our responsibility to come forward and say here are the beneficiaries 
into which must be registered into the company and then proceed with 
the shelf company and the beneficiaries from the side of the 
departments are the follow ing, we need the beneficiaries from the side 
20 
of Estina to be then into shell, so the shelf company existed in the 
name Zana.  All that they are telling us is that we had said to them we 
would want it to be in line with the project to be called Mohama Mobun g 
so that’s what they needed just to change but it already existed.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   I see so you were intent on using the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 166 of 203 
 
same company once the dairy project was established.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Is that what you are saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That exactly Chair, that would be the 
shareholding company. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   So you did not deregister it for that 
reason? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No Chair it was not deregistered, it 
was the company that was supposed to be the shareholding company 
and that is what we had ticked off to say the company is in existence, it 
10 
has been done.  Then the change of the name and the inclusion of the 
beneficiaries into the shelf company then remained with us and that is 
the part that we have been dealing with, with the State Law Advisors.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   It is clearer to me, can we look at the 
next paragraph which reads as follows:  
“The Department has via [or vide] through its letter dated 
August 22 2012 nominated  one Mr Frans Oupa Mokwena to be 
the 
custodian 
of 
the 51% shares 
on behalf 
of the 
beneficiaries until further notice.   A shareholders agreement 
is being drawn up to clearly outline the roles of the various 
20 
shareholders.” 
Who is Mr Frans Oupa Mokwena?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair this is exactly the point where 
we had agreed with the State Law Advisors to put that on hold, because 
we could not have an individual who will hold the shares until further 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 167 of 203 
 
notice, when we were busy in the process of finalisin g the beneficiaries 
to come into the entry, hence then that process did not happen, 
because this was their report to us to say this is what they believe 
should happen and we did not agree with this implementation.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So you are telling the Chairman that you 
set up a company, Zana Investments, you asked for a change of name 
to Mohama Mobung Diary Project Pty Limited.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   But the only custodian or shareholder on 
behalf of the beneficiaries whom you had nominated was told that you 
10 
were changing the shareholding structure, or what exactly – because 
you have told us the company existed, so who were the shareholders?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No Chair, the responsibility fo r 
Estina to do was to go and register a company.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   A shelf company? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes.   Then they came back to us to 
say the company is registered, here is the registration number, here is 
everything so that is done.  Wh at then was required from us is to put 
the shareholder and then what they are suggesting to us is that at the 
meantime let’s keep this person as a shareholder into the company, 
20 
which we did not agree with, hence the shareholding issue was delayed 
until the end of the project, we said the shareholding, the putting of the 
shareholders into the company let’s delay it once the project has been 
completed, hence it was not in the agreement that we had signed with 
them, so that was the understanding.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 168 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   I think it is going to be important for us to 
understand whether you are talking about a shelf company, that’s one 
that’s already in existence. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   And then you just take it over. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Or a shell company, which as I 
understand it a shell company is a company that has no shareholders, 
but you have got to correct me on this, what did you understand Estina 
to have done for you? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I might not have been giving 
you the correct name, my understanding is that there was a company 
registered that was then presented to us to say here is the company, 
and their proposal was that at the meantime let us put one person, I am 
not sure how it was approved, whether it was approved as a company 
or how the process that was followed but the company was then 
presented to say here is the company.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well 
there 
wouldn’t 
be 
a 
company 
without 
shareholders isn’t it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so if there was a company there would be 
shareholders to the company.   Ms Gcabashe is that right, or is that not 
right? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   ...[Indistinct – mic off] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am saying isn’t the position that there won’t be 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 169 of 203 
 
a company without shareholders, if there is a company there must be 
shareholders, or at least a shareholder.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   In fact Chairman my colleague has just 
given me the Mohama Mobung Dairy Project Pty Limited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there was even a company called that?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Yes this is what is reflected in that first 
paragraph Chairman that they were changing the name from Zama 
Mohama Mobung Dairy Project Pty Limited, so that docu ment is in 
reference Bundle B, which is the one, no you have D Chairman, B is a 
different one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   At page 426, you may just want to make a 
note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   So as the enterprise name, they’ve got a 
registration number here, there’s the enterprise name which is Mohama 
Mobung Dairy Project, the registration date is the 11 t h of October 2013, 
the business start date is the 11 t h of October 2013.   Enterprise it just 
says private company.  En terprise status “in business”, financial year 
end February.   Main business/main object entered here “no restriction 
20 
on business activities”.  Postal address 111 Shimbali Sands, Naviyasha 
Road, Sunninghill, Gauteng, 2192, that is Mr Kamal Vasram’s address,  I 
know that off by hand, by heart. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughing] 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Company the address of the registered 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 170 of 203 
 
office again Mr Vasram’s Sunninghill address Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the concept of ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   If I might just clarify the last point 
Chairman I can just see where your question is going.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   On the following page at 427 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You then have directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Which is where I think you were about to 
go to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   And the surname and first name Vasram 
Kamal, status active, ID number, director  type is a director, 
appointment date the 11 t h of October 2013, postal address again that 
Sunninghill address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   So you have a company that has been set 
up ostensibly the same company that this report speaks to , the same 
company that the HOD knew was going to be set up to house the 
beneficiaries of the Vrede Dairy Project, is that correct?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 171 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Does that help Chairman, you may still 
want to ask your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, it is very helpful, it is very helpful.   Yes.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The last document Chairman is just a 
CIPRO registration certificate which reads concerning Mohama Mobung 
Dairy Project Pty Limited and the r egistration number.  The above 
company has been registered in terms of Section 14 of the Companies 
Act 2008.  In accordance with the notice of incorporation the 
registration of the company takes effect on the 11 t h of October 2013.  In 
conjunction with this  certificate the Commission has not issued another 
10 
notice contemplated in Section 12(3).  
 
So there is a legitimate company that was established called 
Mohama Mobung Pty Limited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   We come back to you Mr Thabethe 
because we now have Estina whose sole director is Mr Vasram.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   We now also have Mohama Mobung 
certainly by 2013. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   In 2012 it would still have been Zana. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   But again sole director Mr Vasram.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mr Frans Oupa Mokwena then had 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 172 of 203 
 
nothing to do with any of this? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Remember Chair I had – you read a 
statement from the report that says we vide that it should be him, 
where we then said we did not agree because we will provide the 
beneficiaries, all that we needed that time is that that company must be 
registered and must be in existence.  That’s then when he went to 
correct that then he put it in his name, so the shareholder at that time 
...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Who is he? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Kamal, Kamal Vasram the director. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Vasram. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Then he registered and opened the 
company now in his name, in anticipation that we will then come and 
say here are the beneficiaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm.   Well I think that re ference at page 1400 to 
the paragraph that has got “vide it’s letter” I think that its somebody 
who is used to – I do not want to say old English – I think that vide 
means see, see letter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   In fact you are correct, it is letter, you 
are correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, so in other words whatever he is saying in 
that paragraph he says go to that letter if you want to see what he is 
talking about. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   What he is talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 173 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, thank you Chairman.  Then at 
– I would like to come back to you at some point in relation to Ms Su -
Jong taking over as the sole director of Estina, maybe I should just 
deal with it now and get it out of the way.   Did she then also take over  
as the sole director of Mohama Mobung?  What is your information, 
what was your information?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, my understanding of the shell 
company it did not matter who you put there, but during the time when 
then you are ready to put your beneficiaries into it then that discussion 
would be entered at that time, to say here are the beneficiaries from 
10 
the farmers, who are the beneficiaries from Estina’s side, then they will 
decide who they want to put. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC :   Sorry to interrupt you Mr Thabethe she 
was appointed as the sole shareholder, sole director of Estina on the 
1 s t of July 2015.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The issue with her is that she is not a 
South African National, she is from Korea , so that complication means 
that you don’t have a BEE company holding the Estina – being the 
director of Estina, because she is from Korea, and if she was also 
20 
holding the Mohama Mobung shares again your whole idea behind 
creating that BEE culture and doi ng things in terms of the BEE thinking 
falls apart, but I do not know what you recall of the facts as they 
related to these issues at the time.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair, I - I am aware of the letter 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 174 of 203 
 
she is referring to of the change of the Dire ctors of Estina in 2015 …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
But 
in 
2015 
we 
had 
already 
terminated the agreement with the department.  The - we had 
terminated in 2014 to say that relationship has been ended.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Hence my question.  Mohuma Mobung who 
remained the sole Directors of Mohuma Mobung to your knowledge?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that - that was the - the - 
because that relationship had collapsed because it would not be - 
because we have terminated the relationship between ourselves and 
10 
Estina.  What my understanding is that that shell company because it is 
our shell company it would then revert to us and - and become our 
asset whether we want to use it in the future or not but it had - from 
after the termination it had nothing to do with Estina anymore.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You - you say it would.  Do you not recall 
what in fact happened during your term as HOD?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we never came to the stage of 
transferring the projects to the beneficiaries.  That - that is why it did 
not happen.  We - we requested the Free State Development 
Corporation to manage it until such a decision would have been agreed 
20 
upon. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is fine.  We - we will just check - do 
a check on CIPC to see what the status of Mohuma Mobung (Pty) Ltd is 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 175 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Currently. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So next time we speak to you we can tell 
you.  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I - I whoever is there now would 
have decided differently from what I would have.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do not worry Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I do not know what would they have 
decided to do with it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  Do not worry.  I will only be speaking 
10 
to things that happened up to April  2018 … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because that is when you left the 
department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The - the next few paragraphs really just 
speak to the project plan.  They say it is appended to this report.  The 
following paragraph confirms that the capital injection by Estina will be 
coming in Phase 2. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Conclusion - they just say again that 
lease agreement please could you have it signed.  So that is the 
September report.  The very first one that you received.  Do you recall 
receiving it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair these reports to do not - did not 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 176 of 203 
 
come to me directly.  They - they were sent to the Chief Director.  They 
- they are not reports that go to the HOD because in receipt of this 
letter he need to go and confirm whatever that is being carried here if 
indeed it has been done . 
By the time he tells me he says I am happy because I do not 
need to also go there myself.  He confirms it.  Then - then it is 
accepted. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That sounds ominous Mr  Thabethe only 
because there are - the very next report deals with monies  and how 
monies were - were spent and I would have thought that you would be 
10 
keeping a close eye on this mega project and the monies that would be 
spent.  It is a lot of money 500  000 put together the Estina and the 
departments. 
500 million putting together the Estina and the department 
contributions but let us look at the next report.  October, the 31 s t 2012 
on page 1-4-0-1.  Again paragraph 1 just again is an executive 
summary.  There they acknowledge that 30 million was received on 
9 July 2012.  Paragraph 2 is interesting Chairman because this answers 
one of the questions you have asked.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They say that: 
“There was …” 
In the third line or fourth line: 
“There has been no activity from July to September 
due to the non-availability of additional funding 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 177 of 203 
 
from the department.”  
And they go on to say: 
“However Estina has in good faith decided to start 
making capital contributions to enable the project to 
commence operations and has injected 250  000 in 
the month of September.  In consideration of the 
allotment of land in October Estina has made a 
further capital contribution of 3.75 million in 
October to enable the procurement of urgently 
needed farm equipment and accessories and they 
10 
ask the department to expedite the releas e of the 
balance of 84 million since they have in good faith 
made a capital contribution of four million into the 
project till the date as bridge finance to enable 
them to commence work on the project.”  
Over the page Mr Thabethe are the numbers that speak to 
this narrative I have just spoken about but what is really interesting 
here Chairman is a question again that you have asked.  The opening 
balance in July 2012 that first column there is nothing at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  At 1-4-0-3? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At 1-4-0-3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So it is cash flow position of Estina (Pty) 
Ltd from July 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 178 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Vrede Dairy Project.  Source of funds on 
the left and then you have got three/four months r eflected here because 
it is a quarterly report.  July  2012, August 2012, September 2012 and 
October 2012.  The very first line says opening balance there is nothing 
at all recorded in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So Estina did not reflect any money it 
might have had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Am I correct in what I am saying?  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then I am just look … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is there any reason to - is there any reason to 
take that to mean anything other than that there was no money?  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chair to be …  
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no money that was transferred.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To be fair to Mr Thabethe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  An explanation he has given …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that his understanding was that Estina 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 179 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was not going to co mix its money … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  I can remember that yes.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With project money.  Am I correct in what I 
recollect you saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASH:  A … 
CHAIRPERSON:  An explanation. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Possible explanation Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am simply repeating what Mr …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe had told you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the R16,00 we saw was in - in a different 
account. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In - in Estina’s account Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Estina’s account that …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are not mixing with the project money according 
to that explanation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or they are too embarrassed to put here 
Chairman as the balance on that account whichever Chairman …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 180 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or Mr Thabethe is correct in his 
explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to say Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair although I may not go to 
the details of this during - during the - the investigation that was done 
by the Hawks in - into the investigation of the - of the banks.  They 
confirmed to me that there was a loan that Estina had - had taken.  I 
10 
think in - in one of the statements.  I would not be able right away now 
to go in there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and show you but there was 
that proof which they had actually brought to say we …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We are aware that there was a loan 
that was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Even though when - during the 
20 
implementation they had never explained to us that they had taken a 
loan … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For us to be able to deal with that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 181 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But there was later on confirmation 
that indeed a loan was - was done by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I may not remember exactly how much 
the amount was now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But there was such a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So whether it was later or and so on 
but there - there was something like that that existed.  Now what was of 
10 
interest to us if they would come to us and say as Estina we have paid 
this money and we have bought a tractor we would then go and check if 
indeed there was a tractor and then if the tractor did exist we will then 
tick and say we have seen the tractor that you have bought.  
So that - that is what we would do.  So that when they say we 
have done one, two, three we  will check that and say okay we are - we 
are happy with that because it has happened.  You are telling us it has 
happened.  We have seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of - of course if they had - if Estina had borrowed 
money in order to be able to carry out its oblig ations of making a 
20 
contribution into the project that might not help it if it got that money on 
the basis of the fact that it was going to get this money that would 
come from the project. 
It - it would help it in terms of its financial position when we 
look at whether it was the type of entity with which the department 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 182 of 203 
 
should have entered into an agreement involving such big amounts.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In - in the agreement Chair during the 
- this phase of implementation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They would not have started with their 
implementation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence they say we want to start with 
10 
your part of the implementa tion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But it is your obligation.  It is not 
Estina’s obligation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But we are now beginning to pay our 
money … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Into your obligation of Phase 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So that we - we do not stall the 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which we believe when your money 
becomes available you will then make that money available.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 183 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well we - we might or might not be talking at 
cross purposes.  I am just going back to the concern that …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I had raised earlier and much - even much earlier in 
terms of Estina if in terms of fina nces it really had R16,00 in its bank 
account at the time when it concluded an agreement in terms of which it 
was supposed to inject millions of Rands into the project.  
That suggests that they were not the type of company - entity 
that should have been in - been involved - with which the department 
should have been involved in such a project and I am saying it seems 
10 
to me that even if they were - even if the position was to be that they 
had borrowed money in order to carry out those obligations provided 
the position is that they had borrowed that money on the strength of the 
money that they were going to get out of the project from the 
department that should not change their position.  
The - the same concern would remain unlike if maybe they 
had loss of properties and so on and so they - they got money.  They 
got a loan from the bank on the basis of their property portfolio for 
example.  You know. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if they went to the bank and said please lend us 
RX million and the bank said how are you going to pay it back.  They 
said look - look at this agreement.  We have signed with the 
Department of Agriculture.  We are going to be getting a lot of money.  
So we will be able to pay you back.  That would not help them.  That is  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 184 of 203 
 
what I am suggesting. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that - that is- is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  What - what I am coming is that the - 
the portion which they had been implementing was the portion that we 
were responsible for the cost but here the indication is that they started 
paying for the cost that we should have paid for …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As a department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It means they - they - because we - in 
actual fact we were waiting for the new financial year because that is 
where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Our money was sitting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and if - if they would not have 
proceeded with the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It means it would have stalled the - 
20 
the whole activity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence then they proceeded - hence in 
their statement they are saying with the understanding that the money  
that will then be paid to us …  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 185 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Will then cover that money that we …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Are spending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you - you are comfortable …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that context? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you accept that that does not address the earlier 
concern that we talked about?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is just a separate concern/issue?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe the - the difficulty with what 
you are saying is found in the very next line.  Grant received from 
DARD 30 million.  Total source of funding up to July  2012 R30 million.  
Then we have under application of funds.  So far nothing to creditors.  
20 
Then you have got a line that says reserved for parlour equipment R29  
million … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that is where I thought you differed 
with Estina … 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 186 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because I understood your evidence to be 
that that 30 million was supposed to pay for Phase 1.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That was your explanation?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They took that 30 million. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Kept one million in this bank account.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Took 29 million out of circulation.  Did not 
use it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Took it out and said they were  reserving it 
for parlour equipment.  Not buying parlour equipment.  Reserving it for 
parlour equipment and this is why I was hoping you would be able to 
explain to us how they justified that and yet at the same time they say 
to you we are having to put mo ney into Estina because - I beg your 
pardon - into the Vrede Dairy Project because you are not giving us 
money. 
20 
Did you inter - my question really is did you interrogate this 
and say why are you putting money in?  We gave you 30 million …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On 9 July 2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes.  Chair I remember we - we 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 187 of 203 
 
discussed this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And - and I had indicated to you that 
we had engaged them because we had not agre ed with them …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That they should - they should do that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But their - their understanding was 
that when - when they were doing inquiries into the - into the dairy 
10 
project itself which is the parlour, the machine that does the - the 
milking.  They were supposed to place an order and if they place an 
order then it had to be - to be manufactured and you would not just 
place the order. 
You - you have to guarantee that if they start manufacturing 
that equipment for you.  You would be able to - to pay.  So if - if your 
money is sitting in a bank.  The bank will - you cannot touch it once you 
have issued a guarantee on that particular money for them to be able to 
construct. 
Now hence I said they - they have done that but we were not 
20 
happy because we had agreed that this money was meant for specific 
purposes for us to be able to proceed and - and that was those things 
that we had listed that they - they should have done in that particular 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words they were using money given to 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 188 of 203 
 
them for one purpose …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For another purpose? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  This - this money was put aside 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe using might not be … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The right term. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure but maybe, yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  What I had said they should 
have first - because it was a correct - it was a necessary thing to do 
but our problem was that they had not consulted with us before.  We 
could have also agreed but the issue was that then do not delay the 
issues that the money was meant for.  
It - it should not do that.  Hence then they had the n to go and 
- and find money so that those issue happen.  They had to happen and 
- and we - we did not have a problem with that but we did pick up a 
fight with them and say you should not have done it but we are 
comfortable. 
20 
We know you have reserved it an d here is the papers and 
here is what you are saying to us you - you have done.  So that - that 
is - that is what I had explained also before Chair.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see Chairman and Mr  Thabethe my 
difficulty with what you are saying is this was your project.  It was not 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 189 of 203 
 
Estina’s Project. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is a department project. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  These are public funds. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You had not even received let alone 
approved the feasibility study …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At this point when they took the 29 million 
10 
and put it in a different account.  Why could you not say  to them bring 
it back?  We have not - we do not even know in terms of our feasibility 
issues what we will or will not be able to do.  So how do you start 
thinking of placing an order to manufacture anything when we - we have 
- we are not even out of the s tarting brackets yet. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I - I hear Chair what - what she is 
saying.  We - we had engaged that after they have provided us with the 
report to say this is not what we had agreed but we were convinced 
with the explanation with the  understanding that it - it is something that 
we have to place and order on time for you to be able to get it because 
20 
during - earlier on when they had not engaged with these none of us 
had known how much time we will require to do that …  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But then they said to us Chair on all 
these activities that you expect us to do there would not be any delay 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 190 of 203 
 
because that part - that part of the - of the equipment was still part of 
our responsibility to deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see Mr Thabethe you are dealing with a 
different question that she did not ask.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the question she is asking is what you may do 
or what may be done … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With money before there is a proper feasibility study.  
So she is saying why allow that to happen.  Why allow Estina to take 
10 
the money and put it into another account?  Such a lot of money.  When 
actually you do not even know what the feasibilit y study will say.  That 
is what she is asking you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Oh - oh - yes.  No.  I - I hear it now 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And can I add to that.  So my question 
was why did you not say it is our money.  Bring it b ack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you are putting it at risk now.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  The - the understanding 
20 
that we had Chair we - we were doing the detail feasibility study.  We 
had already done a preliminary feasibility study which already g ave an 
indication to us that in - indeed these projects can be done but then we 
were going into the details of the project.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the rush Mr  Thabethe?  Why not do the 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 191 of 203 
 
study - a further study finish properly and then start involving mo re 
money?  What was the rush about?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair there - there was not 
any rush.  We - we had already agreed and spoken how the money 
would be allocated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but then …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you not wait until the - a final feasibility study 
is done?  You see what outcome it gives you …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you proceed properly. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That could have been done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why was it not done?  That is my question.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is a difficult one Chair to answer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were the HOD. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you were in charge.  I mean you could - you 
were -you were the HOD.  You were in charge.  You were the 
Accounting Officer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew that if anything went wrong with the 
taxpayers’ money …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have to answer … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 192 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you started spending some money and a lot of 
money before there was a final study that told you that what you are - 
what you are - you want to get involved in is viable you would be 
putting the taxpayers money at risk and you would have to answer.  So 
the question is why did you not wait until all of that was done properly?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I was convinced that there 
would not be any problem.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but what - what will - if - even if you are 
convinced is it not the right thing to get the paperwork first right - get 
the paperwork right and then start?  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is it …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why - why start before - before that - that stage is 
done? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair in - in - I am - I am 
trying to - to put it the correct way Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is that - heads - Heads of Department 
works within a time frame.  When you come in and you say  this is what 
is going to be my deliverables in terms of my contract.  You have to 
make sure that the deliverables happen as per your contract because if 
20 
- if you do not deliver as per your contract then you would not have 
delivered what is expected of you . 
So I had the contract and - and those things were part of my 
deliverables of - of the contract.  So delaying those would mean you 
have not delivered in terms of your contract that has been agreed upon.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 193 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So I - I had also to work within time 
frames to say by this time as in my contract this has to be delivered.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But your contract I take it did not require you or 
entitle you not to do things the right way.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no it did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and doing the feasibility study first.  Finishing it, 
seeing what the outcome is before engaging in certain expensive 
aspects of the project would be the right way.  Is it not?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Gcabashe I - I leave it at that.  You - you 
had your own angle. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman in fact I was simply going to 
draw a parallel with questions you asked at an earlier hearing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When the CFO went to ask for the 30 
million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And wanted it on a Friday afternoon  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At 3 o’ clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You asked similar questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Why the urgency. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 194 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not know if you have seen the 
transcript or the evidence given by Ms  Anna Fourie.  She dealt with that 
aspect … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the Chairman asked the same 
questions but the issue I want to raise is the following.  Your contract 
could not have been the reason that you were rushing this because the 
Executive Council was well aware that they only app roved the 
implementation of this project …  
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On 13 June 2012.  Now that was quite a 
way - three months into the new financial year.  Is that not correct?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Not only that Mr Thabethe.  The same 
Exco knew that you had hoped to allocate a budget of 114 million per 
annum to this project.  Am I correct?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The same Exco was well aware that you 
had to find 84 million for the remainder of this financial year.  Am I 
20 
correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So they were aware of the constraints that 
you were operating under. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 195 of 203 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Why would you feel that your contract 
compelled you to make sure that this project got under way in that 
particular financial year to the extent that as much of the 114 million 
you had hoped to spend would in fact be spent?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair in - in my thinking hence 
we - we - like I have indicated this is what had agreed and this is what 
Estina had explained to us which I have indicated that we are not 
comfortable but then after their explanation on the reasons we then 
agreed with them.  
On the basis that they spent their money to complete what we 
10 
had.  It means if there was going to be any loss in that money it would 
not be a loss of the department because what we would  have asked 
them to do with the money they had would have been done.  So that - 
that guarantee after we have discussed with them.  
We said it is fine you can guarantee that the activities that 
we had money available for must happen.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I - I do not know if - if that addresses the - the 
real issue that Ms  Gcabashe is - is drawing your attention to. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is saying the explanation you give for having 
20 
done things the wrong way - the wrong way in terms of my discussion 
with you.  The correct way would have been to do the feasibility study.  
Have a final feasibility study.  See the outcome and then start things.  
You said well there were certain constraints placed upon you by your 
own contract with the department. 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 196 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the MEC or premier whoever it was.  So she is 
saying but that could not have been the reason.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I - I accept Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that.  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So then the - the next question is that if you accept 
that there could not have been any constraints on your contract tha t 
10 
justified you doing things not in the correct way.  What then was the 
reason for the rush if it was not the contract because you were 
suggesting it was your contract?  
Now you accept that it was not your contract.  So what then 
was the reason for the rush ? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair there - there was not - 
there was not a reason for the rush because all - all that I needed was 
to be seen delivering what I had made commitment to deliver.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but when you - when - did you not want to be 
seen delivering in the correct way by doing things the right way?  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  At - Chair at that time my thinking 
was that after we have interrogated and discussed it.  We - we then 
proceeded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you still felt - if you - if you accepted that 
there was a need for a final feasibility study.  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 197 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I want to suggest to you that you should only 
have started doing something before the - the final feasibility study w as 
completed if there was some special reason.  Otherwise you just wait 
for the outcome of the feasibility study.  Then you - you continue.  So 
but if you say there was really nothing then it seems to me that you 
may have done things the wrong way for no r eason really. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  May - maybe Chair it is difficult 
for me to understand - to get into your thinking.  I am - I am trying to 
see what is it that is … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  Let us go back.  There is - there is the 
correct way of doing things and there is a wrong way of doing things.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I thought you and I agree that if in order to 
embark on a project it is necessary to do a feasibility study …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The right way of doing things is to do the feasibility 
study first - first.  A final one if you want to call that.  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  See that it is outcome is before you start the project 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you incur a lot of expenses.  We agree so far?  
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 198 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, ja.  We agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so far. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  on - only to the point to say …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The detailed feasibility study …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Will then give you the details.  The - 
the initial feasibility details will give you the go ah ead to say there is 
no problem in - in doing this project but then you need to go into the 
details of - of doing everything to say this is how this is going to be 
10 
done. 
So the detailed feasibility study you go into it because you 
already have a green light to say there is no problem in doing this 
project hence you can then move to the next.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - you accept that normally the best thing 
would be to get everything in order in terms of the study.  Understand 
everything and see exactly what yo u need to be careful about before 
you - you move ahead but you are saying that well the preliminary 
study gave you what you needed in terms of the - the approval to say 
you can go ahead with this …  
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  With this, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - the final study was going to give you some 
details … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you needed? 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 199 of 203 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I just want clarity 
on one aspect.  Earlier on when we looked at the business plan and 
then we looked at the feasibility study did I understand you to say that 
that short business plan was in effect the feasibility study - the 
preliminary feasibility study that we are talking about?  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we are past 4 o’ clock. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman and I was …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But may - maybe - I thought we would stop at four 
because more or less our plan is that Mr Thabethe would come back 
but we could - we could go up to half past if it is - if - if that is 
necessary to complete whatever you want.  I am - I do not have a 
problem. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I would prefer to stop now.  I 
just want to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Place on record that the business plan 
that Mr Thabethe had identified as the preliminary …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Plan is the one in the Reports Bundle 
which we spoke of earlier today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That runs from page 321 up to page 320 - 
04 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 177 
 
Page 200 of 203 
 
330 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that it is Mr Thabethe from what you 
are saying is on the basis of this …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of this … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Very thin document I am holding up …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That you were prepared to rush this 
project? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chair if we might adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  We - we are going to adjourn 
Mr Thabethe.  We have not finished and we are adjourning in 
circumstances where I am not an nouncing now when you must come 
back but I think Counsel will see me after this and there will be a 
discussion about when you must come back but it will - it will not take 
20 
long before you come back. 
So your - your Counsel will - will let you know what date  we 
have talked about and then if necessary the Commission can send 
written notification of what the date is afterwards.  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am fine Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine?  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Very briefly.  I am sorry to interrupt you …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But it is an important point my colleague 
has just pointed out to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That the date of that business plan … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The so called preliminary feasibility plan 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is October 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I leave you with that so you can 
prepare for next time.

paid in July …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But it is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so in other words the point being there could not 
have been the comfort that he says the preliminary report study - 
feasibility study would have given him - could not have given him 
because it was not there at the time.  That is the point.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and I misunderstood your question.  
Sorry Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In September … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.
