CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not saying – I am used to saying 
good afternoon in this venue I normally say good morning 
because we normally start in the morning.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Please administer the oath 
again or affirmation to Mr Zwane.

MR ZWANE:  No.

Page 4 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane this 
afternoon we would like to deal with the advanced payment 
system that was introduced towards the latter part of 2010 
in the Free State Department of Human Settlements.  You 
know about the advanced payment system.  You have 
testified about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I suspect that they have not 
given me the files that has got that or unless it has been 
changed.  This appears to be the transcript – yes what I 
10 
have here is mostly the transcript.  I do not – it is the 
transcript throughout. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That file should… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There should be the file that has got – 
that have got Mr Zwane’s statement and everything. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you – if you look at the index of 
the exhibit in the front of the file Mr Zwane gave evidence 
on the 25 September 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that is day 271.  His evidence 
20 
is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but there was a file which we were 
using before he gave evidence that had got various 
documents. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well there are twenty files for the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 5 of 131 
 
Free State which one are you referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that we used before he started 
giving evidence which we used. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The one there… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before there was a transcript.  Obviously 
there was a time when we did not have a transcript of his 
evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did we have that related to him?  
All the documents that has – the file that had documents 
10 
including the document that had his signature, of service 
providers, his statement.  A lot of documents. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is FS12 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what I have just received. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because one is statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That affidavit which was signed is 
Exhibit UU9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And FS12 – Bundle FS12. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I have just been given.  It 
was not in front of me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you using the transcript not this 
one? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 6 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Insofar as the next few questions 
go we will be using the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you will go back to this one or 
not really? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja after a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After a while.  Okay.  No that is alright.  I 
mean this one will just help me refresh my memory on 
certain things because I am more used to it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay you may continue. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  You have testified 
about the advanced payment system Mr Zwane?  You know 
about the advanced payment system?  You know what topic 
we are moving onto now? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good.  Ms Mokoena testified that 
the advanced payment system was first raised at a meeting 
in October 2010.  It was a meeting that we have referred to 
as the War Room meeting. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And it appears from your 
evidence and the evidence of Mr Tsoametsi that this 
meeting took place after the Welkom meeting with the 
contractors. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 7 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I understand that at the Welkom 
meeting certain contractors were invited to attend, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  All the contractors. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well that is what I want to ask 
you about.  That list of contractors that was invited what 
was that list? 
MR ZWANE:  That was a list that was developed by the 
Evaluation Committee – Bid Evaluation Committee given to 
the Bid Adjudicator Committee and subsequently to the 
Accounting Officer who agreed and signed that list and 
10 
brought that list to me for approval. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the list of 106? 
MR ZWANE:  I cannot remember the exact number but that 
is the list we used in inviting people to the Value 
Committee Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it is not clear what list that 
was still.  When the tender process was abandoned a list 
we know was compiled of bidders who had qualified and 
bidder who had been disqualified.  That was a list of over 
300 people who had tendered. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  There was another document that was a list 
of 306. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  361. 
MR ZWANE:  6. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No the… 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 8 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:  Of direct yes 306. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It was over 300. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And it included bidders who 
had qualified and bidders who had been disqualified 
including bidders who were adjudged incompetent or not 
qualified to – to be granted contracts. 
MR 
ZWANE:  According to the minutes of the Bid 
Evaluation Committee that is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Alright so we have a list of 
10 
people who had or contractors who had bid for construction 
contracts within the Free State Province for the year 
2010/2011.  Those people included bidders who were 
qualified and bidders who had been disqualified including 
bidders who for one or other reason were declared unable 
to continue with the process.  We know that.   
MR ZWANE:  According to the minutes yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  According to the Bid Process yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But we know that in September you 
20 
approved a list of contractors of 106 people. 
MR ZWANE:  That was not actually in September Chair I 
think it was end June. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we will – I think we are 
going to have to look at – Would you look at FS14 page 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 9 of 131 
 
225.   
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is that document?  You will 
see it is signed by yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page – what page is it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  September 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius what page is it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS14 – 225. 
CHAIRPERSON:  225. 
MR ZWANE:  Housing allocations Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well to be fair to you Mr Zwane that 
document begins at page 223.   
MR ZWANE:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright what is this document and 
when did it originate? 
MR ZWANE:  This document as far as I can remember it 
originated in – around the 30 June.  That is the time when 
EXCO approved it and even requested that building of 
houses should start in earnest Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We will come to the timing of the 
20 
presentation of this document at least on your evidence.  
But is this document had been presented to EXCO on the 
30 June and we will refer to that minute in due course and 
had been approved by EXCO why was it only signed by you 
on the 10 September? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 10 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I – I would not recall the – this issue of 
signature but as you have been fair to me to indicate that 
document – this document actually starts at 223 I want to 
point out that although I cannot see the date properly on 
page 223 but one can see that the – the way I signed here 
is not – the way I – the way I signed in 225.  So I would 
have – what I can think is that those document was needed 
for official reasons at that month September so I signed.  
But the document was taken to EXCO earlier than that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright well we will come to the 
10 
EXCO meeting in due course.  But this document was 
presented in accordance with your evidence to EXCO on 
the 30 June 2010.  That is the EXCO of the Province – the 
Free State Province. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Provincial Government, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That EXCO would have been aware 
then of the entities on this list and would have after 
consultation with you approved this list. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  After presentation well Chair we made the 
approved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  They approved. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go please to page 217 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 11 of 131 
 
of that same – oh no 127 of that same bundle please.  You 
will 
see 
there 
in 
paragraph 
75.3 
a 
record 
of 
the 
proceedings or a summary of the proceedings of the Bid 
Evaluation Committee and the Bid Adjudication Committee 
in the abandoned tender process.  It says there that 361 
bids were received.  You see that?  This I can assure you… 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is consistent with the minutes but if 
you want to go to the minutes I am happy to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  75.3? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  75.3 yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So it was 361 not 306? 
MR ZWANE:  Okay.  Some documents are saying 306. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes alright.   
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am not going to quibble about 
that. 
MR ZWANE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But it is over 300? 
20 
MR ZWANE:  It is over 300 I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  105 were disqualified for basic bid 
compliance.  104 were disqualified because they did not 
meet the minimum functionality threshold.  28 bids from so 
called established contractors and 81 bids from so called 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 12 of 131 
 
emerging contractors qualified to be evaluation on price 
and the BEC then recommended 109 qualifying bid to be 
adjudicated on price.  Is that more or less consistent with 
your recollection of what the Bid Evaluation Committee and 
Bid Adjudication Committee found? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oh.  Now it seems to me that the 
list considered on the 30 June was not a list that emerged 
from this process, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Ja I think you are correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In fact this process had not yet 
been completed.  It was on-going. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So explain please how under your 
submission or consequent to your report the EXCO on the 
basis of your report consider 106 contractor or contracts 
and at the same time there is an incomplete tender 
process, how could this happen? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair may I respond? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  I – I notice what you are raising.  I think I 
can remember that there was a process and it will reflect in 
some minutes here that earlier on there was a list of 
contractors which was approved and when the size of the 
houses was increased there was a dispute.  I am sure 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 13 of 131 
 
some minutes will raise that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know about that yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  I think the – the – this one of the 30 
June if I remember well is that – is the list that was 
affected by the dispute of contractors when the size of the 
houses had to be increased.  And the list that you have 
just asked me it is after that process of the dispute raised 
by contractors.  We had to start afresh – ja I think so. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well I am afraid it may be that I do 
not follow but as yet I certainly do not follow.  After the 
10 
dispute has arisen between the contractors and the 
department over the size of the houses the evidence is 
clear that at that stage it was decided to embark upon a 
fresh tender process.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That process would have advertised 
for tenders and received tenders. 
MR ZWANE:  Which process Sir? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The process we are talking about. 
The process… 
20 
MR ZWANE:  The first on or the second one? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us start again. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There is a list of contractors – a 
data base we understand from your evidence at least that 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 14 of 131 
 
pre-dated the 2010/2011 financial year, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The contractors appointed on that 
data base and there is no concession that that data base 
was 
properly 
appointed 
and 
it 
seems 
from 
our 
investigations that it might well not have been.  But we are 
not dealing with that financial year.  There was a dispute 
that arose between the contractors and the department.  
The contractors said now we have to build bigger houses it 
is not going to work for us, is that correct? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So it was decided then to scrap that 
data base and go out to tender again, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As part of that process – that 
tender process 361 bids were received, correct?  And the 
figures in paragraph 75.3 page 117 of FS14 I can assure 
you that those are reflected in the minutes of the Bid 
Adjudication and Bid Evaluation Committees.  So we have 
now a list of 361 bidders, correct? 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But we also have it around this time 
– remember we are not yet at the 28 July we are at the 30 
June.  We have a list approved by yourself of 106 bidders.  
Where did that list come from? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 15 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:  Oh okay.  Well Chair when we arrived at the 
department … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:  So when we – I arrived at the department 
there was a list that was there and that list was not 
developed by me.  To my best recollection we used that list 
for [00:22:09] 2010 and that list was supposed to be used 
for 2010/2011.  Until a dispute arised as far as I can 
remember arising from the reasons I have already pointed 
out then there was a need then to begin to follow the 
10 
processes that will actually give us a new list.  That is 
what I remember Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now that process to give you a new 
list was that same process that received 361 bids in 
answer to its invitation to bid.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  If I recall from the minutes it should be the 
same process by the Bid Adjudication and Bid Evaluation 
yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it would – there are many 
things here that are difficult to understand but it would be 
20 
completely beyond comprehension that there were more 
than one bidding process.  There was one bidding process. 
MR ZWANE:  If I recall according to the minutes Chair after 
the – if you talking about the second process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 16 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:  After the lapse of the open tender there was 
a 
decision 
that 
was 
made 
either 
by 
the 
Evaluation 
Committee or the Adjudication Committee that information 
which is available out of different processes I cannot 
remember them properly but similarly there are about three 
processes.  Those – the names are released were to be put 
together and formulate a data base.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That would have been a data base 
of 361 persons or entities plus the old data base.  Correct?  
It would have been far in excess of 360 entities or 
10 
constructors – logically.  Or you not following me? 
MR ZWANE:  No I hear that but I cannot confirm or deny 
that 
Chair 
because 
that 
information 
was 
not 
at 
my 
disposal. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No but this one you can confirm or 
deny. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because it follows your evidence.  
The – there was a bid process that followed on a dispute 
between the contractors and the department.  That bid 
20 
process advertised and invited tenders.  You nod. 
MR ZWANE:  There is [00:25:29] Chair yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As a consequence of that invitation 
361 persons or entities bid for work.  Correct?  That is the 
minute I have just showed you. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 17 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:  Well Chair let me say maybe more 300. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes because you say 306 and I say 
361. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So far the – let us not go there.  
More than 300 bid. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That list included qualified and 
disqualified bidders. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes as per the minutes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  You say there was another 
data base that had to be added to that list, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  I am saying – yes that is what I am saying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes you saying that. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja I am saying that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So therefore it is not difficult to 
conclude that the final consolidated list was more than 306 
or more than 361 whichever figure you choose. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So that we can establish? 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On your evidence right? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This process – the tender process 
continued or was still in existence until the 28 July when it 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 18 of 131 
 
was finally abandoned.  We know that as well, correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But on the 30 June you present a 
report to EXCO correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You give EXCO a list of contractors, 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That list is the list that was signed 
– you say later by you on the 28 September 2010. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  I think I should correct that Chair.  I think I 
should correct that.  When you asked this question for the 
second time I said I can remember that there were actually 
two lists for 2010/2011.  The first list is the one that was 
disputed.  I corrected myself by explaining that.  That from 
where I am seated I think the list that went to EXCO is the 
list that of the contractors that later disputed the price of 
building a house which had moved from 35 square meter to 
50 and more.  I think the list that I submitted on the 30 t h 
could be that list. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So it is not the list that you signed 
on the 28 September. 
MR ZWANE:  No, no Chair. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 19 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was that list?  Now in 28 
September 
or 
on 
28 
September 
we 
have 
a 
list 
of 
contractors signed by yourself and approved by yourself.  
What is that list? 
MR ZWANE:  This list if I recall is a list that came out of … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Out of? 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 A 
process 
that 
was 
followed 
by 
Bid 
Adjudication Committee and finally submitted to me by the 
Accounting Officer.  Because on the 28 July when the 
decision was taken to go the route that the department 
10 
took it was after the abandoned list of the disputes.  So the 
lists that was produced on the 10 September I think it is 
stemming out of the process that was undertaken by the – 
the committees that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The process that you are talking about, 
you see I think last time, you gave evidence to the effect 
that after it had been decided to abandon the open tender 
process, the department... you asked them what the way 
forward was going to be. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was decided was that the 
department would produce a list.  I do not know whether on 
that occasion we called it a database.   
 
But they would produce a list of contractors and if I 
recall correctly, you said they were going to... that list would 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 20 of 131 
 
include the contractors who had submitted bids during the 
open tender process.   
 
But you also said the department was free to include in 
that list contractors who may have not submitted bids during 
the open tender process but who met certain requirements 
that had been certified by Exco, namely contractors owned 
by women, people with disabilities and young people.   
 
Is that the process... the list that you are talking about? 
MR ZWANE:   I am talking about that list Chair but to the 
best of my recollection, I think I was asked a question, if I 
10 
am not mistaken by yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That was I aware that some of the names were 
taken outside the process that had elapsed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And outside any other process that they have 
existed?  I said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   I even said, if I knew I would have asked, how 
did you get these claims? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Because they are not part of any process 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That is in front of us here. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 21 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I... that is what I can recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   But what I agree with the Chair that the list of 
the date of September is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is coming from this process that we are 
talking about? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now talking about the 
qualification that you have just made, namely that you did 
10 
testify that you would have asked them the basis for 
bringing... for selecting certain contractors who may not 
have been in the list of contractors who had submitted bids.   
 
Now, I remember you putting... saying that you would 
have asked them that question.  My understanding of your 
evidence was, not that you were opposed to them bringing in 
contractors who may not have submitted bids but you would 
simply have wanted the criteria that they followed on the 
basis.   
 
As I recall, my understanding is that your position was 
20 
that there would have been nothing wrong – and you must 
tell me if my recollection is not correct. 
 
There would have been nothing wrong in the department 
bringing in contractors who were not in the list of those who 
had submitted bids as long as they were those contractors 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 22 of 131 
 
these requirements that came from Exco, namely women, 
young people and people with disabilities.   
 
Did I misunderstand that part of your evidence? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair let me say to you.  People are 
thoroughly misunderstanding that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  Just explain that part 
before we proceed.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  The correction will remain that in my 
affidavit I raised an issue that I was acquainted with PFMA 
which stipulates that there should be a short process and 
10 
that also is stipulated two hundred and Section 217 of the 
Constitution that there must be a process that is fair, 
competent, cost-effective.  To name a few ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] efficient, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other requirement.   
MR ZWANE:   And that process, I understood it to be after 
the list which was still in existence during ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The process. 
MR ZWANE:   ...a process of dispute. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That we should follow that open tender so that 
everybody is given a chance.  That is why I recall that at a 
later stage, I even said to you.   
 
I asked the official when they came to me that:  Why did 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 23 of 131 
 
you not tell me that there was a shorter process that could 
be followed if you are telling me that no we have can have a 
database that can be quicker?   
 
I asked the following the PFMA.  So I was well-aware 
that a process where somebody wakes up and come up with 
a name and put it in database, it would have not been in line 
with the Constitution and PFMA.  So my view was that if I... 
had I known, I would have asked that question.   
 
And I must also explain that the instruction by Exco, it 
was not requesting us to follow(?) any process.  The 
10 
instruction was saying to all the departments:   
 
As you engage yourself here in an activity that will 
create jobs, this is the group that you must take into 
consideration.  That is to the best of my recollection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure that I do not 
misunderstand you know.   
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that mean that your understanding at 
the time when the open tender process had been abandoned 
that your understanding was in creating a list or database, 
20 
the department was simply going to take a list of contractors 
who had submitted bids, all of them.  Is that correct?  Is that 
so? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 24 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you.  I wanted to understand 
that part. 
MR ZWANE:   I think I must clarify one part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please do. 
MR ZWANE:   This or this all of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   This all of them ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...consists of even those contractors who did 
10 
not qualify during the open tender.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That was not my ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That was not your understanding. 
MR ZWANE:   That was not my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was your understanding that the 
department would take the list that had been prepared by the 
Bid Adjudication Committee after sifting all the bids and 
indicating who was disqualified and who was not competent 
and so on?   
20 
 
So it was the list that they would have proceeded with if 
the open system had not been abandoned?  That is the list 
you were talking about, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   My view is that, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 25 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   If the tender process was... had been 
abandoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   There are contractors which may have not 
made it in the database because they were disqualified.  
That is my understanding.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 Yes, 
but 
what 
about 
those? 
 
My 
understanding is that what you are saying is.  Those 
contractors who had been disqualified during the open 
tender process were not going to be in the list that the 
10 
department was going to use after the open tender process 
had been abandoned?  Is my understanding correct. 
MR ZWANE:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If you had disqualified during the open 
tender process, that is the end of you? 
MR ZWANE:   I am giving my own understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is what I am interested 
in. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, ja.  I am giving my own understanding 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That process should have been like that.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  So in other words, on 
your 
understanding 
the 
list 
that 
the 
department 
was 
supposed to use after the open tender process had been 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 26 of 131 
 
completed was the list of only those contractors who were so 
to speak had passed the test during the open tender process 
and nobody else? 
MR ZWANE:   In the first instance Chair, there can be the 
aim of going through the open tender process.  It is actually 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that was your understanding? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let us go through the 
documentation to test your answers Mr Zwane.  First of all.  
Could you look at FS14, page 295. 
MR ZWANE:   295? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   295.  As it appears from page 294, 
the previous page, these are the minutes of the Special 
Departmental Bid Adjudication Committee of 28 July 2010.  
Do you see that? 
MR ZWANE:   FS2? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 294. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It appears that the document we are 
now 
dealing 
with 
are 
the 
minutes 
of 
the 
Special 
Departmental 
Bid Adjudication 
Committee 
held 
on 
the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 27 of 131 
 
28t h of July 2010 in the Free State Province.  Do you see 
that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good.  If you go over the page to 
paragraph 7.1. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It reads:   
“An evaluation of tender... 
 
It gives a reference number. 
“...for the construction of BNG House in the Free 
10 
State through project linked.  The chairperson 
indicated to the committee that the tender had been 
evaluated but due to the fact that the validity of the 
tender has expired and they cannot adjudicate.  
They have to cancel the tender.  However, in order 
to spend the money appropriately, they have to use 
the suppliers on different databases.” 
 
And then there is the checks of a resolution taken by 
that committee.   
“Cancellation of tender is recommended due to the 
20 
expiry thereof.  The committee recommends that 
different databases be consolidated and use as a 
source of service providers.  That is departmental 
database, provincial centralised database, Puadrem 
Database, as well as the list of all suppliers who 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 28 of 131 
 
tendered for this tender.” 
 
That is the resolution which was approved by the 
accounting officer on the 30 t h of July 2010 as appears from 
page 297 of FS14.   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you see all of that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe for the sake of completeness.  
One can repeat that before the chairperson wrote or the 
resolution is repeated in 104.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Under the Head Committee’s 
10 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then the chairperson signed and 
the accounting officer approved.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   I can see that, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, arising out of the failed tender 
process – let us not go back into 2009/2010 because we do 
not have the facts before you in a comprehensive format.   
 
But arising out of the failed tender process, it was 
decided to consolidate a number of databases as well as 
20 
all... a list of all those entities or persons who had tendered 
the 306 or the 361.   
 
So the proposition I am putting to you is that the 
database now, after the failed tender process and this 
consolidation recommended and approved, would be far in 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 29 of 131 
 
excess of 306 or 361. 
MR ZWANE:   That is my understanding Chair as I alluded. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So with that simple arithmetical 
process, we can proceed.  I do want to give you a chance to 
refer to the open report which may assist you in fairness to 
you because you are dealing with matters some time ago.  If 
you would go to FS15, page 523. 
MR ZWANE:   523... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will give you a chance to have a 
look at this extract in a moment because it does set out a 
10 
summarised history and there is... there at least three 
questions that I would like to ask you arising out of.   
 
But what is a matter of confusion, at least at this stage 
Mr Zwane, is that we have a list of well over 361 or 306, 
whichever version you choose, contractors.   
 
A large, consolidated list.  Let us refer to it as a 
consolidated.   But we have on your evidence before the 
committee, the Exco Committee meeting, a list approved by 
yourself of just over 100 contractors.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   The last... the list of the 9t h...  Sorry, the list 
20 
of the 10t h.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The 10t h of September? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Oh, that is what you say? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 30 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now my question is.  There was at 
least a process and a formal decision, giving rise to the 
consolidated list.  Whatever defects it may have had and 
however bad in law those decisions may have been to 
include disqualified bidders on a list on the administrative 
say-so of officials.  Let us leave that issue aside.   
 
At least there was that list.  Where does this list of a 
106 come from?  It can only come from someone under your 
direction, sitting down and compiling it in your discretion.   
MR ZWANE:   Well, my own understanding is that Chair that 
10 
this list was an outcome of these process that we talked 
about.  And no circumstances, in terms of my recollection, 
did I instruct anybody how to compile a list.   
 
If I wrote it to do that and I thought that is the right 
thing, I would have waited for all these tedious processes of 
an open tender and so forth and so on.  I would have done 
that thing. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, but Mr Zwane.  You take this list 
to the meeting of the 30t h of June. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you proposed this list before the 
Exco Committee.  You say:  Exco, this is my list presented to 
you by the MEC.  Please, approve it.   
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I explained earlier on my understanding 
of the list that was presented to Exco.   
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 31 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But I am asking you, it is your own 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   That is my own recollection. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How does it come about?  It is your 
list. 
MR ZWANE:   No, I have said Chair that there was a list that 
was used during my predecessor’s time.  The list I followed 
in 2009... remember, in 2000...  I arrived at the department 
in 2009.  We did not go for a tender.   
 
We followed the list that was there, existing already.  In 
10 
2010, we followed that process as it is until there was a 
dispute by contractors because of the bidding price that had 
remained and the size was increased. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Build the house for that price? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, to the best of my recollection Chair, that 
should be the list that I sent to Exco on the 30 t h of June. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And was that the same list you 
signed in September? 
MR ZWANE:   I alluded to the fact that that was not the same 
because the list I sent to the executive, there were disputes 
20 
around it and the decision was taken that we should 
formulate a new database.  And so this process is followed 
up until the 20t h... the 28t h of July.  Up until, actually, the 
motivation on page 297 what was the 30t h of July.  That is my 
best recollection Chair. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 32 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, the allocation list approved by 
you on the 10t h of September 2010 ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...did contain at least 15 bidders who 
had been disqualified during the tender process.  Were you 
aware of that? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  But it was your list approved 
and signed by you? 
MR ZWANE:   The list was brought to me after it was brought 
10 
to me by the accounting officer.  So I approved, yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, but when you approved it, did 
you back the list?  Did you say, how was this list made up?  
Does it include disqualified bidders?  Where does this list 
come from? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, I did not do that Chair.  What I did and 
this is even what I said on the 25 t h.  I went through the 
criteria that were given by Exco whether they are young 
contractors, disabled persons and women.   
 
And I approved because I had given this task to a 
20 
competent officials who had been doing this sort of work for 
more than 15 years when I was not even there.   
 
And at that particular time, there never had been a 
dispute in terms of their work.  So I did not go through those 
details because I was not even favoured by the detailed work 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 33 of 131 
 
they do behind closed doors in their committees and so 
forth. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just to assist you.  Perhaps you 
should look at FS15-523 which is an extract from the report 
later conducted under the auspices of the Free State, 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements. 
 
It 
is 
dated 
14 September 2015 and it sets out there the findings that it 
made regard to various lists and you can look at it. 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You want us to look at what page 
10 
mister...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   523 of FS15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Have you finished reading? 
MR ZWANE:   I am just finishing, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am just giving him a chance... Mr 
Zwane to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
20 
MR ZWANE:   Alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know what the Bid Adjudication 
Committee recommended and we know what was approved 
by the accounting officer.  It was that large, consolidated list 
which must have constituted well over 300 entities.  We 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 34 of 131 
 
know that on the 10t h of September you approved a list.  
Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What your duty was in approving and 
what you actually did, we have interrogated to an extent.  On 
the 10t h of June, you took a list to Exco, the Provincial Exco 
and you said:  Here is a list.  Please approve.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now please help us.  The list that 
you took on the 30t h of June, what list was that?  And the list 
10 
of September 10, what list was that?  And how did those lists 
informed who eventually got contracts? 
MR ZWANE:   The list of end of June as I have alluded to 
that fact earlier on Chair, according to my memory, was the 
list of contractors who later on had a dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Later on...? 
MR ZWANE:   Had the dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but where were they coming from?  
Were they coming from the open tender process or were they 
coming from a prior database that existed before the open 
20 
tender process? 
MR ZWANE:   No, they were coming the prior database 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are coming from the prior database 
that existed before the open tender process? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 35 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MR ZWANE:   And the list of the 10t h of September, was out 
of this process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Out of which process? 
MR ZWANE:   Out of the open tender that had lapsed and a 
decision was then arrived at by the Bid Adjudication 
Committee to consolidate those different tenders and, as a 
result, that was signed by the accounting officer as a 
database. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, perhaps I am not making 
myself clear, Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The list of 106 projects and 
contractors in relation to 21 050 houses to be built, the 10 
September list approved by yourself, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   10 September, yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Must have been a selection from 
the bid adjudication consolidated list because it is a far 
smaller list. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You agree? 
MR ZWANE:   Not only that, Chair.  I think on hindsight at 
the particular time I think around early September, if I am 
not mistaken, these contractors that had made a dispute, 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 36 of 131 
 
we had to engage them because we could not start building 
houses, they went to court and around that time together 
with other MECs were able to resolve this matter amicably 
that the price of the houses has been increased to R72 000 
and if they agreed, those who agree may come and become 
part of the process moving forward.   
 
To the best of my recollection I think the list of 105 
and the list of 106 might be telling that story, unless I do 
not understand the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let me understand.   There was a list 
10 
that you took to Exco at the end of June, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said that was a list that came from 
the database that the department had already prior to the 
initiation of the open tender process.  So it was people 
who were on the database.  Okay.  Do you know whether 
some 
or 
all 
of 
those 
people, 
those 
contractors, 
subsequently 
submitted 
bids 
during 
the 
open 
tender 
process or is that something you do not know? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I did not know that fact. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know that. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, I did not know that fact.  
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you are concerned it is 
possible that some of those might have put in bids as well 
but you do not know. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 37 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   The people who were not qualifying? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, as I explained this process earlier on 
and my expectation of it, is that it will be a database of 
people who qualifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the ones who – okay, so you have 
this list you took to Exco at the end of June.  What was the 
purpose of taking that list to Exco again? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   We would normally report in terms of our 
activities and provide a report as to whether what has been 
requested from us by Exco in our normal course of duty 
has been addressed and if there are issues that we need to 
deal with, Eskom is not happy about one, two, three, we 
will then go back and deal with that issue.  So it was a 
standard practice, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely to tell Exco or update Exco as to 
who you had on your database? 
MR ZWANE:   No, not that, I knew that the Exco was 
20 
interested 
in 
the 
main 
that 
the 
list 
should 
have 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Women, young people and …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   Disabilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   People with disabilities. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 38 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   And so we took that list to Exco.  The one 
that we found it there …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the one that existed prior to the open 
tender process. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  And it was approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was approved by Exco. 
MR ZWANE:   By Exco, I think on the 30 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so when you took it to Exco the 
idea was that Exco should approve it. 
MR ZWANE:   Exco should have the word, if they are not 
10 
happy you would go back because normally I am the one 
who approves in the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but am I to understand that the 
purpose of taking this list to Exco at the end of June was 
to update Exco as to the list that the department had? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The contractors on the database of the 
department. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say these are the contractors who are 
on our database and then they might, in looking at the list, 
ask questions about which ones are owned by women, 
which ones are owned by young people and so on, that is 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 39 of 131 
 
what they would be interested in, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when they approved – you say they 
approved the list, when they approved they were saying we 
are happy with this list because we think it meets some of 
these 
requirements 
about 
young 
people, 
people 
with 
disabilities and women and the idea was that after they 
had approved it would simply go back to the department, 
so it would simply give you the comfort and the department 
that the contractors you have on your database are 
10 
approved by Exco, they meet the important requirements. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   The other issue from where I was seated, it 
will give me comfort that we have done accordingly with 
what we needed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when the open tender process was 
initiated and therefore bids were invited it follows that they 
20 
would have been entitled if they met the requirements to 
put in bids as well. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So then the validity period of the 
tender expires and then the department decides that what 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 40 of 131 
 
it will do is to put another – to put a certain list together 
and you say on your understanding the list they were 
supposed to put together was the list of only those 
contractors who had passed the test during the open 
tender process.  That was your understanding of what the 
department was going to do. 
MR ZWANE:   That was my understanding but that would 
extend to all the other database that we had according to 
the minutes of the Bid Adjudication and my understanding 
of those database is that they would be comprising of 
10 
people who had passed the test, so to speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now let me try and understand that.  You 
know there would have been a list of contractors who had 
passed the test, as it were, during the adjudication 
process. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that list would only be a list of 
those who had submitted bids in response to the invitation, 
is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anybody who may be on some other 
database who did not submit a bid would not be on that 
list, is that right?  The list that you are talking about.  You 
said what you expected the department to do is to take the 
list of contractors who had passed the test under the open 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 41 of 131 
 
tender process, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And give you that list.  Or, at least, that 
was my understanding.  Or are you saying that that would 
not be the only contractors, they were supposed to add 
others from other databases. 
MR ZWANE:   I am saying in terms of the open tender, if it 
has not lapsed, only the contractors who had passed the 
test would be considered.  That was my understanding 
also.  In the case where the Bid Adjudication Committee 
10 
said and recommended, as it has been said here, that a 
broader kinder of a pool must be considered off the 
database that is in existence in the department.  My 
understanding also there would be when that broader 
database is considered nobody who failed the test, whether 
in the open tender or in those other database they had 
would be considered.  I do not know if I am clarifying the 
point, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me check.  It seems to me that 
what you are saying is in putting together the list of 
20 
contractors that the department was supposed to put 
together and bring to you after the open tender process 
had been abandoned, you did not expect them, that is the 
department, to confine themselves to the list of contractors 
who had passed the test during the open tender process, 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 42 of 131 
 
you expected them to have that list of contractors who had 
passed the test under the open tender process, that is the 
open tender process that had been abandoned, but you 
also expected them to include other contractors taken from 
other databases that they talked about in their minutes and 
that but those contractors from those other databases 
would have to pass a certain test before being included in 
the list that would be brought to you.  Is that what you are 
saying? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair, they came to me after the tender 
10 
had lapsed and suggested this process and suggested that 
they would be taking from various database which are 
already there.   
I was just making my own understanding of that 
process that even if I had agreed with them or their 
proposal, 
I 
still 
expected 
that 
Section 
217 
of 
the 
Constitution should not be lost in the process.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I will leave it to Mr Pretorius to 
deal with how you expected that Section 217 to apply with 
regard to those contractors were to come from other 
20 
databases.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Mr Zwane, I am afraid the 
manner in which you have answered these questions raises 
even more questions and we are still far from clarity.  So 
let me attempt to question you in a way that does provide 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 43 of 131 
 
some clarity.  We know that was a dispute with existing 
contractors.  Open Waters tell us there was a dispute 23 
contractors.  Did you know that? 
MR ZWANE:   I may not remember the exact number but I 
know there was a dispute with those contractors, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, Open Waters report say 23, 
right?  It decided to embark upon an open tender process.  
Did 
I 
understand 
you 
correctly 
that 
you 
gave 
that 
instruction? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I knew about that instruction. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You knew about that and you gave 
that instruction. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  So any evidence that you 
gave previously that this was all in the hands of officials, 
we can revise that evidence. 
MR ZWANE:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You knew the circumstances, you 
knew the need and you instructed an open tender process 
to take place. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I must say that is somewhat 
different from your evidence previously but I am not going 
to go there for the present.  The tenders closed on the 16 
April 2010, right? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 44 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the final decision was made on 
the 28 July 2010.  So between the 16 April 2010 and the 28 
July 2010 on your instruction there was an open tender 
process underway for the selection of contractors to build 
houses in the Free State, 2010/2011, correct?  You nod. 
MR ZWANE:   If there was no dispute from the contractors, 
that you have just said 23 contractors, it shall have meant 
that this list of the tender that was started in April would 
have come at a later stage. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let us go with what 
happened. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that tenders closed or the 
date for the submission of tenders closed on the 16 April, 
the period for the submission of tenders closed on the 16 
April 2010, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A decision was made on the 28 
July 2010.  We have looked at that decision about the 
20 
consolidation of databases, correct?  You must say. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The recording does not pick up a 
nod. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay.  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 45 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So between the 16 April 2010 and 
28 July 2010 there is a tender process underway, an open 
tender process taking place on your instruction, correct?  
Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On the 30 June, however, in the 
midst of this tender process, you go to Exco with a 
different list of contractors.  Should you not have told them 
look, there is a tender process, we cannot now use another 
historical process, we embarked upon an open tender 
10 
process on my instruction.  Did you tell them that it was 
underway?  You must have known it was underway. 
MR ZWANE:   My explanation to you, Chair, is that the 
tender that was underway was not in any way going to have 
a problem with these contractors that were there from the 
previous tender.  Up until  a point where we had to – if I 
recall, dealing with the issue that these contractors have 
laid a dispute.  If you take it maybe the question that I 
thought would have been answered, what would have 
happened if these 23 contractors, as this page is saying, 
20 
did not have a dispute, it means those contractors were 
going to go on and build houses and there would be no 
issue about building houses from those contractors, it 
means those contractors, in terms of my recollection and 
my understanding, would have again ensured that they 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 46 of 131 
 
become part of the new database of an open tender 
because, if I am not mistaken, some of the evidence that 
was put by some of the people who came here, the tender 
was lapsing of this one that was done by my predecessor.  
So we had in any way to come into a new tender.  That is 
my understanding, Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, the 2009/2010 database had 
lapsed.  Did you know that?  I did not exist anymore in 
2010/2011.  You had to start from scratch. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  So the tender process was 
intended to appoint contractors for the whole project of 
housing. 
MR ZWANE:   What, 2010? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   2011, correct. 
MR ZWANE:   2011. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  So at the time you go to the 
Exco with another list of contractors, whether it is a 105 of 
a 106 - , first list, second list, does not matter for present 
purposes, the point is it is another list of persons.  They 
20 
may have come from an expired list, does not matter for 
present purposes but the point I want to make to you is 
that on the one hand Exco is saying we approved this 
listen presented by you, MEC Zwane, for the construction 
of houses.  At the same time there is a tender process 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 47 of 131 
 
underway that has nothing to do with that list.  The tender 
process produces a consolidated list of well over 300 
bidders but on the 10 September 2018 you approve a list of 
106 contractors. 
 
Now what I am saying to you in simple terms is that 
as far as you, MEC Zwane, were concerned and as far as 
Exco was concerned, there was one process of selecting 
contractors underway largely based on the discretion of 
yourself or the Exco or individual officials and there was a 
fair tender process, open tender process on the other.  You 
10 
knew on the 30 June that there was another process.  Now 
I have put together a lot of questions, I can break them up 
if you like but that is what happened.  How do you explain 
that? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, I thought I had explained, we – I had 
not used or compiled any list prior to the open tender.  
What I used was the database that was there and the open 
tender process was going to facilitate a new database that 
would be used by me for the next five years if I stayed the 
five years.  That is how I understand it, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Zwane, can I ask this 
question?  In the context of a situation where there is a 
need to initiate an open tender process, what is the use of 
the department having a database of contractors because 
for the open tender process you are not going to invite only 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 48 of 131 
 
those who are on your database to bid, as I understand the 
position, you invite everybody, whether they are on your 
database or not.  
 
So why is it necessary for a department to have a 
database of contractors or is it necessary in the context of 
those situations where you do not go on open tender?  
Maybe you need a few quotation then you use those? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair, you would remember that I 
indicated when I was here on the 25 t h that when I asked 
that question it is when I was told about what the Housing 
10 
Act is saying and I can see that one of the witnesses, when 
he was here, he also touched on that issue of the view of 
the department, Mr Kaiser Maxatshwa by saying it was the 
MEC who would approve the list, would actually give 
contractors… 
CHAIRPERSON:   It cannot be.  Can it be that prior to your 
time, as MEC of this department – well, I am saying prior 
to your time, maybe prior to this open tender system that 
was initiated that we are talking about in 2010, it cannot be 
that the department was not – it cannot be that the 
20 
department was awarding contracts without following an 
open tender process that they just picked people who were 
already on their database.  Can it be?  
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair, I am saying I was told that the 
database is acceptable and, as I have said, I think it is 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 49 of 131 
 
page 44, if I am not mistaken paragraph 53.2 where Kaiser 
Maxatshwa is saying the MEC could allocate work to the 
contractors.  Despite – that issue came when the open 
tender had lapsed, if one recalls what I said here, when I 
was asking the officials, where …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you asked the way forward? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, what is the way forward?  Then they told 
me that no, we can do the database and they explained to 
me.  I said but why did you waste my time?  As I said 
earlier on.  We could have followed this thing if it is lawful, 
10 
they said no, it is part of the Act, Housing Act so 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I just want to understand.  
So, as I understand it, the officials, when you asked them 
for the way forward, were saying to you or said to you the 
department can award contracts to contractors who are on 
its database without following an open tender process.  Is 
that what they said? 
MR ZWANE:   They said we can use a database and 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   A database would, according to how they 
explained it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the way – well, they might not 
have put it like this expressly but the gist of what they 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 50 of 131 
 
were saying, is it that they were saying the department can 
award contracts to contractors who are on its database 
without following an open tender system.  That was the 
effect of what they were saying?  
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair, I think that is my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That is why I am even quoting what Kaiser 
said in this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   He was relating here, it is no longer 
10 
something that comes from me, only Kaiser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was your understanding then arising 
from what they told you at that time that prior to this 
particular open tender process that had been initiated, that 
had just been abandoned, that they were saying to you 
prior to that they had been – the MEC could just award 
contracts to contractors on the database of the department 
without following any open tender process.  That was your 
20 
understanding of what they were telling you? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, are you seriously saying, Mr 
Zwane, that if an officials tells you that from a list of 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 51 of 131 
 
people you have the discretion to appoint whom you like as 
a contractor that you believed that, that you could appoint 
entirely on your discretion from a list?  An expired list, by 
the way, because we know 29/2010 that list had expired, 
that database had expired. 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair I was not told that the list for 
twenty ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  9/2010.  
MR ZWANE:   Was, was – had expired. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you learn that? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I am saying I was not told that, the 
contractors that were doing work for 2009/10 the list was 
expired, because I came there in the department 2009 just 
through the year when the work was already happening.  It 
means there was a database that was followed by the 
department when I came and there I did not stop that work 
continued on.  
2010 this contractors who were already there as 
being 
said 
here 
continued 
and 
to 
the 
best 
of 
my 
recollection the list was going to be used for 2011 moving 
20 
forward.  The list that often open tender that is going to be 
used at a later stage maybe 2011 at a later stage when we 
had 
already 
compiled 
it 
but 
that 
was 
my 
simple 
understanding Chair because if the list had actually 
expired the department should have actually even got into 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 52 of 131 
 
an open tender before I arrived.  I should have not told 
them to get into an open tender because I found them 
already using this list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the open tender Mr Zwane what was 
your understanding of the objective of the open tender 
process that was initiated and later abandoned? 
MR ZWANE:   My understanding Chair was that that 
process was the correct process.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR ZWANE:   My understanding was that that process of 
10 
an open tender was actually the correct process.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no but my question is what was 
your understanding of what was sought to be achieved 
through it.  What was going to be the product or the 
outcome of that process?  
MR ZWANE:   The product of that process we will have a 
database of names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   That was going to be used for the next five 
years.  So was your understanding that that process was to 
20 
produce a database as opposed to appointing contractors 
who were going to build houses?     
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
I 
might 
be 
wrong 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
understanding of a database as a layman Chair but my 
understanding is that we would use those contractors that 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 53 of 131 
 
have been approved by an open tender process to build 
houses.  
CHAIRPERSON:   To build houses in regard to the specific 
project or to build houses in any project that could arise in 
the next five years?    
MR ZWANE:   To be fair in this Commission as I was told 
Chair those contractors would be there for the next five 
years as that has been the case even before me.  You go 
into an open tender identify contractors they then become 
your database for the next five years.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Pretorius.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am afraid that clarity alludes us 
Mr Zwane so let me try once again.  You on your 
instruction initiate or have initiated by the officials an open 
tender process for the construction of houses in the Free 
State for 2010/2011.  Correct?  You nod, yes.   
MR ZWANE:   The open tender was? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   2011.  Tenders close April the 16 t h 
a final decision is made for the establishment of a 
consolidated list of contractors on the 28 t h of July.  
20 
Correct?    
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On the 30 t h of June you take a list 
to EXCO you say that list was the expired database list.  
Correct?  You nod.  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 54 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   I am saying that that list was the list that we 
found there and it may as well be a list that was that to 
expire.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well it had expired but be that as it 
may it was a historical list according to you.  Correct?  
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you not tell EXCO look we 
have an open tender process for the establishment of a 
new list of contractors because you gave them a list you 
asked them to approve that list and they approved that list 
10 
whilst the tender process was underway and they actually 
told you at that meeting to start constructing houses.    
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So they were saying to you this is 
the list that you must now use.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That list certainly the list of 
September included people who had not tendered at all in 
the open tender process and included people who were 
disqualified during the course of that process.  It seems to 
20 
me the only explanation can be is that the MEC together 
with EXCO had their own plan of who was going to 
construct houses and on what basis persons would be 
selected and that had nothing to do or no relationship with 
the open tender process.    
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 55 of 131 
 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
Well 
Chair 
that 
is 
not 
my 
understanding…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well let us look at the minutes.  
MR ZWANE:   …of the whole process.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could to page 439 of FS21.  
Now I did speak to you before the proceedings started Mr 
Zwane and said that in fairness to you I would give you an 
opportunity to look at that minutes and read it and think 
about it.  
MR ZWANE:   Chair I think I must just share on this point 
10 
appreciate that fact because I had raised a concern earlier 
on that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you had not had a chance to read 
certain documents.   
MR ZWANE:   No, this file was not with the files in my 
possession so I appreciate the fact that I am being given 
an opportunity to go through these files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine.  
20 
MR ZWANE:   You said page 423? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   439 of the S21 
.  
MR ZWANE:   439.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Again the black numbers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius.  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 56 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Have you read it? 
MR ZWANE:   I have read it Chair, thank you.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now this is a minutes of the 
meeting of the EXCO cabinet on 30 June 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or resolution rather than minute Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Resolution rather than minutes I think.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well yes it is a resolution which 
would appear in the minutes but be that as it may it is a 
10 
resolution that was taken at a cabinet meeting on 30 June 
2010, it is an EXCO resolution.  Do you see that?  
MR ZWANE:   I see it Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now before we get to the 
resolution you would have presented to the EXCO a report, 
a briefing.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What would that briefing contain, 
can you recall because I must just say that we have tried 
our best to obtain that report that simply appears to be 
20 
unavailable? 
MR ZWANE:   I also tried my level best to go back and that 
is when I was told that you have all the information 
because we had to subpoena EXCO I was told that the 
minutes of EXCO are – cannot be distributed unless there 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 57 of 131 
 
is an order.  So I tried my level best also to have some 
information around this I could not Chair.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us not spend too much time on 
it we cannot obtain the report.  
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we made every effort to obtain 
your report.  Can you help us and tell us what you said in 
the report? 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair I think I would not be doing 
justice or I would not be doing justice. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think Mr Pretorius cannot be 
asking more than the main features of the report that you 
can remember obviously it’s been quite some time and if 
you have left out some things one would understand 
because there has been a lapse of a long time.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see it is an important report if 
I may just interject Mr Zwane because it would reveal your 
knowledge of how the list of contractors was compiled the 
standards applied.  Whether you informed them of the open 
tender process or not and it would inform us as to what 
20 
EXCO’s knowledge was, it is a very important document 
one would have thought that it exists somewhere but we 
have been unsuccessful but I interrupted you please go 
ahead.        
MR ZWANE:   Thank you Chair let me try and I hope that it 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 58 of 131 
 
is not used against me in future because I may be told that 
this is what you said in your affidavit and I can say for 
record purposes I cannot remember exactly what I said I 
think that should go on record.   
But in the main it looks like I presented a list of 
contractors that were ready to can continue building 
houses and that list was rapid in terms of the requirements 
whether people have a company that is registered with 
HPRC.  Whether they have a VAT certificate those issues 
and the other issue was that the question of the criteria 
10 
was raised by EXCO in this meeting.  Here I should say 
that from reading this it tells me that EXCO had not 
interrogated me to the point that show us contractors were 
the woman, disability and so forth and so on that is broadly 
that I can remember, Chair.      
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well paragraph A of the resolution 
reads: 
“The 
member 
of 
the 
executive 
council 
for 
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and 
Human Settlements” - that is yourself.    
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   “Briefed the executive council with 
regard to the vetting and profiles of all companies 
listed in the report involved in housing projects in 
the province.” 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 59 of 131 
 
So it appears that you would have reported by giving them 
a list of companies and information with regard to their 
profiles and vetting process.  That is what appears at least 
from Sub A here of the resolution.    
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   B says: 
“The executive council noted and agreed to the 
information given to the executive council by the 
department on housing allocations.” 
In other words, that list must also have included the 
10 
allocation of how one tracks.  How many houses each 
contractor was to build.     
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.   
“It is further directed that the 1 August 2010 should 
see the implementation 
of the construction 
of 
houses by these companies.” 
So what your report proposed and what EXCO decided was 
to approve a list of companies to allocate houses for 
building by those companies.  Correct?  And that that 
20 
would be the basis upon which construction would start on 
the 1 s t of August 2010.  Correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was about three days or so after 
the Premier signed that resolution, he signed on the 28 t h of 
July.  So in two, three days’ time those companies were 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 60 of 131 
 
expected to start building houses.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is what the resolution says on 
your proposals.  
MR ZWANE:   Chair the 28 t h of July I see our signatures 
here.  Paragraph 3 says: 
“It further directed that the 1 s t of August 2010 - oh I 
hear 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
- 
should 
see 
the 
implementation of the construction of houses by 
these companies.” 
You are right Chair, ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    So it seems – ja let me ask you 
this question.  Did you tell EXCO look I know that I have 
made a proposal, I know that I am putting this proposal of 
who should be appointed and how many houses they 
should get to enable them presumably to start on 1 August.  
But I wanted to tell you that there is a parallel process on 
the go for the selection of contractors through an open 
bidding process.  Did you tell them that?     
MR ZWANE:   I think they should have known it I should 
20 
have reported it Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   Ja, because in the course of building houses 
if there is contractors from the database of the previous – 
my predecessor had lapsed a process of creating a new 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 61 of 131 
 
database should have not waited for me.  It goes without 
saying that if I arrive around June I might not be sure 
about the date houses are already being built out of a 
particular list and that list is part of this list that I sent to 
EXCO. 
Having in mind that this list was expiring a new list 
which will be a database should be compiled out of an 
open tender.  You had just said that the information that 
you have says this list had expired.  If this list had expired 
I accept that I did not, I was not aware that this list had 
10 
already expired for us to use it for 2010 because nobody 
Chair raised any concern out of that list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me ask this Mr Zwane in the 
light of this resolution of EXCO in the Free State Province 
which approves a certain list of contractors for purposes of 
building houses and says the building of houses should 
start on the 1 s t of August 2010 as the implementation of 
the construction of houses by these companies.   
Did you go to EXCO with a list of contractors at a 
time when the open tender process was still ongoing and 
20 
said to EXCO here is a list of companies that I want you to 
approve who must construct houses.  Is that what you did?            
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so – but that is very strange the 
open tender process the companies or contractors who 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 62 of 131 
 
were going to win the tender out of the process were they 
going to build houses under the same project or a different 
project?  
MR ZWANE:   Well let me try to answer that question Chair 
and I think I will rely on the forensic audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   Seemingly if you look at paragraph 
5…[intervene]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just for the record my apologies 
for interruption you at FS15, 523 just for the record.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 5 where? 
MR ZWANE:   FS15, 523 Chair for the record.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Zwane you are going to be a lawyer 
soon so after this process you will be very good with this 
things.   
MR ZWANE:   No I have already applied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have already applied. 15, Mr 
Pretorius repeat I want to see where he is referring to.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS15, 523 sorry for interrupting.  
MR ZWANE:   No that is okay.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just wait until I have got the file. It 
is in this one.  Oh okay please repeat the page for me on 
Bundle Free State 15.  
MR ZWANE:   523, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   523.  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 63 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   All black numbers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   523? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Black numbers?  
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Good, yes and then you said paragraph? 
MR ZWANE:   Paragraph 5, Chair which starts with the 
original lists. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry at 523 you said?   
MR ZWANE:   Yes, FS15, 523 black numbers.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got that is part of the open water 
report is that right?   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that has got a page that has got a 
lot of bullet points.   
MR ZWANE:   Those bullet points I refer to them as 
paragraphs.  
CHAIRPERSON:   1, 2, 3, 4, 5 the one that says this 
original list? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
MR ZWANE:   Chair if you look at the original list identifies 
105 projects totalling allocations of 20 600 houses and 
then the bullet point underneath says: 
“On the 10 September 2010 the MEC approved a 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 64 of 131 
 
second allocation list identifying 106 projects and 
contractors in relation to 21 050 allocated.” 
To the best of my recollection Chair this would mean there 
were two overlapping processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second Mr Zwane, yes 
continue.     
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
This 
would 
mean 
there 
were 
two 
overlapping…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Projects.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR ZWANE:   Because you will remember even when the 
Chair was interviewing one of the witness the accounting 
officer he had said in his affidavit which I am not 
confirming the correctness thereof or otherwise houses had 
not been built up until October for that financial year.  
Meaning there were houses that were built, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Financial year?    
MR ZWANE:   Yes, so it is my understanding Chair that 
there was always that overlapping of allocations I do not 
20 
have much information to bid that point because I am 
relying on my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your understanding therefore that 
the 
list 
that 
you 
took 
to 
EXCO 
at 
the 
end 
of 
July…intervene] 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 65 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   June Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is it June I thought it was July.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   30 June, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay 30 June.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that list was of contractors that 
you wanted to be approved for purposes of building houses 
that came from the previous financial year in terms of 
allocation.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Whilst we are waiting the process of the 
10 
open tender process.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   To also finish and allocate, that is my 
understand yes, Char.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the difference that you are 
emphasising is this that the open tender process that had 
been initiated on your instructions related to houses that 
were to be build in terms of the allocation for 2010/2011 
financial year but the houses that were to be built by the 
contractors that you took to EXCO on 30 June 2010 those 
20 
houses related or belonged to the allocation for the 
2009/2010 allocation.        
MR ZWANE:   That is my understanding yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright but the ones then relating 
to the 2009/2010 financial year had there been an open 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 66 of 131 
 
tender process with them or were they being approved 
simply because they happened to be on the database no 
bids had been invited in terms of the public?  You should 
know because you took them to EXCO. 
MR ZWANE:   No Chair, with the humility I am smiling 
because I thought I had made this point earlier when the 
Chair said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you made the point that one of the 
officials said that before the MEC could award contracts on 
the basis of the data base. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   On the data base. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to confirm that this one that 
you took to EXCO was one of those or was it one like that? 
MR ZWANE:  This was – according to my understanding this 
was a product of a data base that was formulated by my 
predecessor Chair.  Remember I had said according to the 
information that was readily available there that was also 
testified to be correct by one of the witnesses here.  You will 
go into an open once the data lapses and that open tender 
will create a data base and that data base will then be used 
20 
for the next five years and after that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whenever houses – whenever there was a 
need to build houses. 
MR ZWANE:  In the Province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you get contractors to be put on 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 67 of 131 
 
the data base effectively even if there is no housing project 
just to have them. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As and when a project – a housing project 
comes up or is approved then you do not invite tenders from 
the public in general you just go to this data base and then 
choose the ones that will build those houses? 
MR ZWANE:  For record Chair the situation was that there is 
never time where there is no houses to build. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  For the longest time this department has been 
there and even before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  But Chair is correct that that data base will 
then be used to build houses in that province for the next 
five years. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well Chair I might – I might just 
interject there.  It is clear from the Treasury Regulations 
under the Public Finance Management Act that for contracts 
of this size you cannot just appoint. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It has to go through a process from a 
data base.  But I do not want to confuse things further at this 
stage.  It cannot work like that Mr Zwane that is the law.  
You know the PFMA and the Regulations under the PFMA.  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 68 of 131 
 
But are you suggesting that when you went to EXCO on the 
30 June the subject matter of discussion was the completion 
of the contracts for 2009 and 2010?  That cannot be. 
MR ZWANE:  Well that… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And I will tell you why it cannot be in 
a moment but I – let me give you a chance to put your – nail 
your colours to the master. 
MR ZWANE:  Chair that is actually correct because as I have 
said there is no time lapses contractors build houses – it 
does not happen that during the end of the financial year 
10 
every work stops and new contractors starts to build.  There 
is an overlap.   
Some houses are at the wall plate, others are still on 
the foundation level of the previous year.  So normally you 
do not allocate new contractors because the financial year 
has lapsed to finish the – you allow these contractors that 
were there to finish their work and continue allocating work 
for the new financial year.  I guess that is why a data base 
was used.  So ja that is my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you – when you invite the public 
20 
for purposes of – so you invite the public to respond to 
whatever you say.  I do not know what you said but you want 
to – you want contractors that are going to be put on the 
data base.   
That is what you want actually when you issue an 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 69 of 131 
 
invitation to the public.  And you say that data base will be – 
those who succeed being put on the data base it is from 
them that the department will from time to time over the next 
five years appoint contractors to build houses.  That is the – 
that is the idea. 
MR ZWANE:  That has been the idea Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That has been the idea. 
MR ZWANE:  Up until I think around 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until about 2012? 
MR ZWANE:  Ja where I think the concern was raised by 
10 
Auditor General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  That those process should follow PFMA as well 
to the letter.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now when you took this list that you 
took to EXCO on the 30 June did you think that this process 
was in accordance with the PFMA?  You remember you said 
the PFMA is the Act that you really familiarised yourself with 
not the Housing Act.  But did you think that was in 
accordance with the PFMA or is that something you did not 
20 
apply your mind to? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I alluded to the fact that I asked about 
this data base that is when you will remember even the – on 
the 25t h the issue of Housing Act was introduced in this 
house.   
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 70 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that it was much later in the year 
around September/October when you were told about the 
Housing Act after you said to your department – to the 
officials what is the way forward? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the open tender system had been 
abandoned.  I thought that is when… 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct? 
MR ZWANE:  You are correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We are now talking about 30 June 
much earlier. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja.  No as I – as I am saying that was a norm 
Chair not only in the Free State.  I had an opportunity to talk 
to my colleagues – former colleagues in other provinces.  
They are confirming actually that Housing Act and the 
National Housing Code would be followed.   
And this process I am talking about of a data base 
was challenged by AG and it meant the country or provinces 
went to follow suit on what PFMA says.  It was not a 
20 
situation that was obtaining there in Free State alone as I 
understand it Chair.   
Because I was also worried when I came out of this 
commission to say was I the only one doing this thing?  And I 
was told no.  This is what used to happen and I also went 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 71 of 131 
 
back to the former DG Ralikontsane.  He confirmed that that 
was the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But going back to my question.  As at the 
30 June when you took that list to EXCO. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand this way of doing 
things to be in accordance with the PFMA? 
MR ZWANE:  The one of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one of… 
MR ZWANE:  The data base. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of using a data base to appoint without an 
open tender. 
MR ZWANE:  Well according to the – to the data base Chair I 
guess the – I am putting it as a layman of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  According to the data base on the PFMA the 
issue of a data base is there but it has limitations in terms of 
the amounts.  So I knew about it that you get into a data 
base and to build houses and at a point where you do – you 
allocating your data base that issue of the amounts normally 
20 
will not arise up until you do your allocation.   
Because the allocation will then determine that how 
many – what is the value of the contract in terms of the 
number of houses given to a particular contract.  That is 
when this issue will arise.   
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 72 of 131 
 
I did ask about that Chair because I was aware of it 
and I was told that no this has been happening like this for a 
number of years so there is nothing wrong about it. And that 
continued Chair even beyond my time.  So until the AG 
raised the point around it and it was stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is your short answer therefore to my 
question that yes it was your understanding as at 30 June 
when to took that list to EXCO that what was being done was 
in accordance with the PFMA? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I want to go back because it seems 
that your answer to the contention that there was a tender 
process on the one hand and another process on the other 
which was in complete contradiction to the tender process is 
that oh no on the 30 June 2010 all that the Cabinet was 
doing was completing the 2009/2010 allocations.   
Now I want to put it to you that that is simply 
incorrect.  The 2009/2010 arrangements were cancelled.  
That is why you instructed a new tender process to take 
20 
place.  They were cancelled as you have already explained 
because the Premier said we want bigger houses and then 
there was a dispute.   
So that whole process was set aside and that it had 
to be started afresh.  So the 30 June was not just a 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 73 of 131 
 
completion of what happened in 2009/2010.  That was 
history.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you say to that proposition? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I think here we should look at the issues 
of dates.  When was the dispute laid, by these contractors 
that are here and how are we going then to respond to the 
work that they should have continued doing?  Because the 
fact is that not all the houses were finished when the tender 
came to a halt.   
Now that contractors who were building at that 
10 
moment it would have made sense that they should continue 
finishing their job.  I do not dispute the fact that there was a 
dispute I think I have said it and the contract was cancelled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The evidence is clear and you can go 
to the Open Water Report if you like.  You did not go to 
EXCO to say we have got to finish what we did in 2009/2010.  
You went to EXCO to tell them what you were going to do 
during 2010/2011 to complete the housing project for that 
20 
year.  That is point number 1.  Am I correct? 
MR ZWANE:  You are correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  You in your report to 
EXCO not only said these are the contractors – not these are 
the contractors that must finish the work – these are the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 74 of 131 
 
contractors that must build houses in the 2010/2011 year in 
the 2010/2011 project and you allocated houses to these 
people – to these contractors for the 2010/2011 year.  
Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That was done – the selection of 
those contractors and the allocation of houses to those 
contractors as per your report was done without any formal 
tender process.  You knew it and EXCO knew it.   
And they knew that against the background of the 
10 
fact that there was an open tender process parallel which 
was allowed to die a quiet death in fact.  That is what 
happened.   
So 
this 
process 
of 
you 
and 
EXCO 
selecting 
contractors and allocating houses to them was done outside 
of the formal tender process – the formal tender process was 
allowed to die an unnatural death in this case.   
MR ZWANE:  Can I respond Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Thank you.  Chair I would not have said and I 
do not think Chair even my successor said it. The houses 
that are built into 2010 we normally say they are houses – 
they are 2010 houses.   
In that year there is an overlap of houses coming 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 75 of 131 
 
from previous years – let me say years not even a year that 
will find others – it is 2010 others still comes from 2008 that 
is the situation was it obtains on the ground.  Now I say this 
is 2010 because why in 2010 but if you go to the details I 
think that is where we are going to live.  If you go to the 
details in terms of the bars and financial systems they will 
reflect that information.  That is why I know about it.   
That actually if you go back you will find that a house 
which was supposed to be finished in 2008 has actually 
overlapped to 2010 and as I present the number of houses 
10 
we are going to be built in 2010 I include all those houses 
and if in terms of the correct putting of this issue is an issue 
I understand that.   
But I would have still said these two contractors 
separate list are the 2010 contractors that are building 
houses in 2010.  Because the fact of the matter is that in 
2010 between February to this – up to this time there was a 
lull in terms of building houses in the Free State.  So I – I 
thought that – well I explained it .. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I think you have answered in a way 
20 
that clarifies the issue now in your most recent answers but I 
just want to point something out. 
MR ZWANE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Last time you gave evidence the 
general thrust of your evidence was that you did not know 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 76 of 131 
 
what was going on.  This was all being done by the officials.  
Now it seems you know precisely what contractors were 
appointed, which were finishing 2009 – 2009/2010 contracts, 
what 
you 
were 
presenting 
to 
EXCO 
with 
allocations 
determined or approved by yourself.  You now express 
detailed knowledge.  Is there an explanation for the sudden 
change between the last time you gave evidence and the 
time you give evidence now? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair there is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is it? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Two issues Chair.  I have – I must consider 
that in my life I have never had this amount of work that is 
behind me to go and conclude in two weeks.  These are the 
details 
that 
under 
normal 
circumstances 
will 
be 
an 
administrative detail.  And – and I thought it will help for me 
to go and read and try and give clarity.   
Because any way these administrative questions are 
coming to me irrespectively of the fact I am saying this was 
the work according to PFMA that was supposed to be done 
by officials.  Remember Chair those commission had to give 
20 
me time to go and familiarise myself with an Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes with the Housing Act. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so do I understand you 
correctly when you said on the occasion that you did not 
remember or that these were matters that resided within the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 77 of 131 
 
knowledge of officials in your department that was an honest 
answer to the position at the time? 
MR ZWANE:  That was an honest answer Chair but I – I also 
should add that I did say last time that one of the ways of 
interacting with an administrative work was through reports 
that will be brought to us as Politicians. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The point I am making now is that 
your evidence now appears to be an attempt to make sense 
of all the documentation you have written – read in the 
meanwhile? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is not your own memory and your 
own recollection.  You have referred to documents and you 
like us are trying to wade through this mountain of 
sometimes contradictory information.  But I am really asking 
what you can remember not – we can just as you can go 
through all these documents.  They are there for everybody 
to see.  But what I want to put to you are certain facts that 
reside in your memory rather than your interpretation of the 
documents.   
20 
MR ZWANE:  Well Chair I think why I took this approach 
because I was convinced that it would not be a sensible 
thing to continue to say I cannot remember.  Remember last 
time we spent quite a sizeable amount of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 78 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:  Emphasising the point that how can you not 
remember this simple fact? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  So I thought I should try and consolidate with 
the little knowledge that I still remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Basically you are saying that you have had 
a chance to look at certain documents. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that has helped you to refresh your 
memory in some case.  In some cases it has revealed some 
10 
details that you may not have been aware of? 
MR ZWANE:  Exactly Chair and some of the details that I 
have already forgotten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Where – ja – for an example if you say Housing 
Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  At that particular time it was an animal that I 
would have said no I cannot remember anything here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  J. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  But if I sit down and peruse this Act then the 
memory came to say you once read this thing somewhere 
and I may have not had the details as they are required but 
as a layman I had to spend time to try and assist this 
commission as I have promised last time Chair.  Thank you.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us take it – take a step back.  
The first proposition I would like to put to you is that on the 
30 June and I think you have now confirmed this what EXCO 
was considering was who would build which houses for the 
2010/2011 financial year?  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  They were not saying look we have 
had some contracts in existence in 2009/2010 we must 
complete 
those 
contracts. 
 
That 
was 
not 
what 
was 
10 
happening.  Because all the documentation to which you 
have now had the benefit of referring is clear.  Those 
contracts, those allocations were cancelled and a new 
system under your instruction had to be initiated by way of 
open tender.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:  I – I thought that – that part is correct but not 
complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  I had said the houses that – when this – when 
these bids came we cancelled contracts of people.  There 
20 
were milestones that were still left to be finished.  It would 
have been irresponsible of me as a MEC to leave those 
milestones and continue for a new tender that will build new 
houses.   
We had to find a way of ensuring that the milestones 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 80 of 131 
 
uncompleted as they are should be completed.  And to my 
best recollection Chair is that there 
was 
no parallel 
processes in terms of these allocations.  There was an 
allocation in 2010 that would have completed the work left 
and I can say Chair that incomplete houses as we go to the 
minutes of EXCO when we find time you will see that they 
were also issue and incomplete houses do not normally 
reside within a particular financial year.   
So these two processes – this one was to complete 
what has not been completed and this one would have still 
10 
had its allocation away from the allocation of the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me understand this.  I would have 
imagined that during each financial year there would be an 
allocation for the construction of houses.  Am I right about 
that or no – or not really? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct.  Now you would know that 
you have got X budget for houses during that financial year. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would then decide how many 
20 
house would be built with that housing budget, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:  Of that particular financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of that particular financial year? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you would during the same 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 81 of 131 
 
financial year you would appoint contractors who would build 
houses based on that financial years’ allocation? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct.  Now that seems to 
suggest to me therefore that you would not go into the next 
financial year without having appointed the contractors who 
would construct the houses based on the previous years’ 
financial allocation.  Am I right? 
MR ZWANE:  If the Chair could be kind enough to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am saying that if the position is that 
10 
for each financial year when you have been allocated the 
housing or a budget for building houses for that financial 
year you would appoint contractors who would build houses 
on the basis of that financial years’ budget in that same 
financial year. 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am suggesting therefore that I – I 
do not see how you would go into the next financial year not 
having appointed contractors to build houses based on the 
previous financial years’ allocation.   
20 
So in other words I would not expect you in 2011 to 
be appointing contractors to build houses on the basis of the 
allocation for 2009/2010 allocation.  Because I would have 
expected that those would long have been appointed.   
If come 2010/2011 they still have not finished their 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 82 of 131 
 
allocation of houses that they were supposed to build or they 
have built up to windows or foundation and they – they have 
to continue.  You do not have to appoint them afresh, they 
just continue.  That is what I would expect.  Is that not how it 
happens? 
MR ZWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So what circumstances would have 
required you in 2010 30 June to appoint contractors who 
were supposed to build houses based on the allocation – 
financial allocation for houses for the 2009/2010 financial 
10 
year? 
MR ZWANE:  The State of the Province address Chair to 
earlier and in that State of The Province Address, there was 
an issue of houses in the Free State.  Move it from 45 metre 
square and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To 50. 
MR ZWANE:   ...to 50 square metre.  And this bid arise.  And 
even this bid arises, people take you to court.  You... they 
are not going to build these houses.  These are the people 
the Chair said they are...  They are building.  Under normal 
20 
circumstances, they will continue ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Until they are finished. 
MR ZWANE:   ...until they are finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That is why the chairman is up to 2010 Chair 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 83 of 131 
 
as we deal with them here.  Under normal circumstances, I 
did not appoint a contractor when I came in 2009.   
 
I continued with those contractors who were building and 
those contractors would have gone to finish whatever they 
were supposed to finish.   
 
I must just add that should we have taken a decision we 
want to deal with, maybe to show houses and so forth, then 
we will take from the database that we are creating.  I think 
Chair in a nutshell it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes, but I want to connect.  Maybe 
10 
there is something I am not connecting.  Contractors who 
had already been appointed in the previous financial year 
had a dispute with the department because the premier 
increased the size of the houses.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was the premier saying that the size 
of the houses would be increased including those which had 
come from the previous financial year, not like new projects? 
MR ZWANE:   It goes back to my earlier point that in 2010 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR ZWANE:   ...as the premier spoke, it would affect 
everybody that build houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Immediately? 
MR ZWANE:   Immediately. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 84 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now the issue of the dispute 
with the department and how has this dispute resolved? 
MR ZWANE:   If I can recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   We were mandated I think a few of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I was part of those people who were mandated 
after the contractors had taken us to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   To go and engage them.  To say:  No, come 
10 
down.  Let us talk.  Let us see how we can resolve.  And 
what assisted us in the discussions, trying to resolve this, 
was that Exco had agreed to...  Remember, the issue as you 
build houses at the same price of fifty ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that was the dispute.  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   That was the dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exco agreed to top-up. 
MR ZWANE:   To top-up by 2000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Which went to seventy-two. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   So finally we could resolve those issues and 
to my best recollection, some of them, I cannot remember 
the number, came back to be part of the database of 
ensuring that these houses are build.  Yes. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 85 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying, the resolution of the 
dispute by topping-up did not mean that those contractors, 
all of those contractors, who had a dispute with the 
department were then prepared to continue and finish?  You 
were to appoint some new ones to finish houses that had 
been started by others? 
MR ZWANE:   The resolutions was not made a point when 
the decision of building the houses Chair.  The decision 
came with 50 000.  There was a dispute.  People went to 
got../ where to sit down.   
10 
 
And I must say that officials also engage me and we 
engaged Exco in terms of feasibility of these 50 000 for 50 
square metre house.  At the particular time, I cannot 
remember, when should it take but it was a later meeting.   
 
Exco then agreed that no we will top-up.  We will go to 
seventy.  Then the task which was given to us was to go and 
convince these contractors to come back.   
 
Your question is that, they did not come back, all of 
them?  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Also who had the dispute. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   To the best of my recollection Chair.  I do 
not... I do not recall all of them coming back.  We had to 
open that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, my difficulty is that.  If that list of 
30 June that was approved by Exco or related to the list of 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 86 of 131 
 
the contractors who had the dispute with the department 
because the department now wanted them to construct 
houses, build the houses on the basis of a price that had 
been agreed upon on smaller houses.   
 
I would not have expected that you would take it to Exco 
for approval because those people had a contract.  So they 
did not need to be approved by Exco.  That is what I am 
trying to understand.   
MR ZWANE:   Ja, Chair.  I think there is an overlapping of 
issues. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That there was a decision taken and if I am 
not mistaken, also this decision was taken at the Exco level 
when we reported that these contractors had laid a dispute, 
that okay, they have laid a dispute, council to be a contract.   
 
Ensure that we then have contractors willing to continue 
at the same price of 50 000.  That issue had to be engaged 
in subsequent meetings, going back to the department, 
talking 
to 
ourselves, 
understanding 
the 
financial 
implications, meeting with contractors themselves who had 
20 
pointed out to us but it is not feasible.   
 
These contractors were here to make profit.  We are 
losing.  The making(?) that would have made.  So it is not 
feasible that we can build houses for free.  So we engaged 
Exco when that decision had been taken of that the work 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 87 of 131 
 
done have contractors that will finish.   
 
And at a later stage, as we have convinced them, I 
cannot just remember but properly but I think they were also 
made those of them who agreed to come back, part of the 
process.  That is my recollection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Pretorius.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were interviewed by Open Water 
Forensic Accountants? 
MR ZWANE:   I cannot remember, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, they say you were.  And they 
10 
say, MEC Zwane gave them certain information.  Now 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I cannot remember, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...I am not going to try and unravel, 
quite frankly, the facts which do not appear to fit neatly into 
any timeline or to any consistent sequence.  Safe to put to 
you certain what appeared to be incontrovertible facts, right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The allocations, 70 600 and you may 
recall this number, allocation scheme, contracts however 
20 
they arose, were cancelled arising out of the need to build 
new houses but different specifications and arising out of the 
dispute with the contractors.  That was cancelled.  That was 
put aside.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   According to this report.  Yes, Chair. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 88 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, according to the evidence of 
more than one source.  You then, we learnt today, instructed 
for the construction of houses in 2010/2011 an open tender 
process the initiated and concluded.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Correct, Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That ultimately died an unnatural 
death because it was cancelled, the tender bid evaluation 
period had expired.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At the same time as this process was 
10 
being concluded, you reported to Exco with a list of 
contractors and allocations which included the building of 
new houses.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now whether those are parallel 
processes, whether they conflict.  We need not debate.  That 
is just a semantic debate.  The fact is, that there was an 
open tender process and there 
was 
an allocation 
of 
contractors for the building of new houses in 2010/2011 
presented to and approved by Exco.  Correct? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And not only would that have been to 
build houses, different from houses in previous years, bigger 
houses but the allocation list would include new entrance 
onto the list, not just old contractors who had to put a roof 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 89 of 131 
 
on the house.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   They were disabled people that had 
now to be included. 
MR ZWANE:   On the open tender. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, no, no.  Not on the open tender. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On the 30 t h of June, Exco said to 
you on your new allocation list, make sure there are youth 
and women formations. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.  So that is not just old 
contractors. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a new list.  Correct? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The point about this new list.  It is 
formed and formulated at the discretion, whether your 
discretion or whether the discretion of the officials, in 
implementing the guidelines of Exco.  Correct? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, Mr Zwane.  From what you have told 
me, it seems to me that it could not have been correct to say 
when you met with the officials of the department after the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 90 of 131 
 
open tender process had been abandoned when you asked 
them what is the way forward and they told you that the way 
forward 
would 
entail 
appointing 
contractors 
from 
the 
database.   
 
It could not have been correct that you were hearing 
about this way of doing things for the first time.  I am under 
the impression, and you must tell me if my impression is not 
correct.   
 
I am under the impression that last time you were saying 
when they told you that that was new to you.  So you asked 
10 
them:  Well, why did you not tell me all along... I do not know 
whether you said:  Why did you let me waste time if we 
could... there is a short way?  Did I understand your 
correctly? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But from what you have said with 
regard to taking the list of contractors to Exco, it seems that 
you would have known at that stage that there had been no 
open tender process in regard to those and they were taken 
from a database or do I misunderstand something? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair you do not misunderstand some 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  H’m.  So did you know... if you knew 
in June that the department could do... could just appoint 
contractors on the database and give it... let them build 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 91 of 131 
 
houses, then why did you say to them you did not know that 
there was a shorter way later in the year? 
MR ZWANE:   No, thank you, Chair.  The... there are two 
issues.  The issue that I raised as I did not know, as Chair 
has correctly put it.  This was a process where an open 
tender that had lapsed did not see its light of the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that taken to its conclusion? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Now a database is formed, not out of an open 
10 
tender.  The previous occurrences, as I understood them, 
you 
brought 
your 
open 
tender, 
go 
through 
a 
series 
submissions and create your database.   
 
Now they have a process where the open tender has 
lapsed.  Now from where I am seated, you could not have a 
database without having an open tender.  Back to where an 
open tender, then a database, then a list taken out of a 
database.   
 
I did not know that there would... there could be a 
process of coming up with a database when we have not 
20 
gone through the open tender.   
 
The earlier issue that I made, as I have alluded to 
earlier on, is that there would be an open tender and out of 
that open tender there would be a database that would be 
used for five years.   
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 92 of 131 
 
 
And when that lapses, open tender, then database.  That 
is how I understood these two processes not to be in synced.  
Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Except that you said your understanding 
of what the officials told you at that meeting was that the list 
that was going to come out and I guess that would form the 
database, would come from... would be the contractors who 
had gone through this open tender process and had passed 
the test.  In other words, therefore, those who would have 
passed the test.  You understand what I mean? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That those would have passed the... that 
is what you said as I understand you. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So although later on, I think you said that 
you had an understanding that others from other databases 
would be included.  Is that correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Those database Chair....  Yes, that is correct.  
Those databases would have to composed of contractors 
who had passed the test.  Who make ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  So it does not make much of a difference.  
They are here and they have passed the test because there 
was a fair process of procurement to get them on that 
database. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 93 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what then was new that they were 
telling you, which you did not know, if the list that they were 
going to create was one that had gone through an open 
tender process.   
MR ZWANE:   What was new Chair is that in this open tender 
process 
we 
had 
opted 
for 
had 
been 
undertaken 
notwithstanding that they were other databases that were 
still in existence that could have been used, according to 
this late information.   
 
But for this particular purpose, because the database 
10 
which was there before was lapsing.  We had to get to a 
process, procurement process that will lead us to earlier(?) 
database for the next five years.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but as I understand the position.  
Your understanding already in June, maybe even before that, 
was that it was in order to award contracts to contractors 
who appeared in the database.   
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now in that meeting with officials, the 
officials tell you, as I understand it:  We are going to create 
a list of a database based on the contractors who had 
passed the test under this open tender system that we have 
just abandoned.  Okay?  And we will also take contractors 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 94 of 131 
 
from other databases.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now on your understanding as you have 
conveyed it to me.  Anyone... any one contractor who is on 
the database has gone through a certain open tender 
system. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what was different that they were 
telling you that you were... that you did not know then?  
Because you did say:  Why did you not tell me?  I wasted 
10 
time.  Or something like that.  We wasted time with this 
process. 
MR ZWANE:   The process of an open tender Chair had to 
date, according to the legislation, a particular time before a 
tender can be closed.   
 
The process that the officials were now engaging on was 
to take the databases that were already there that do not 
want a specific timeframe to be done.   
 
This databases are here, all of them.  They sit down, 
they compile a database out of them.  I did not know that can 
20 
happen and it is legally sound.  I thought that the process 
that was be explained to me, that if this database lapses you 
will have to go into an open tender and create a new 
database.   
 
You are changing(?) from the databases that are in 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 95 of 131 
 
existence.  That was new to me.  What was the board to 
lose?  I have indicated which I questioned and I was... the 
explanation came to me that you go into an open tender 
once in five years.   
 
That I know even before the open tender lapsed as I 
alluded earlier on Chair.  The Chair is correct.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say what you did not know is that 
the department could create a list of contractors from 
various databases.  Is that what you say you did not know?  
Without inviting contractors in terms of the public to submit 
10 
their names. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Pretorius.   
MR ZWANE:   Now before that Chair.  Can I... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I was also looking at... we are two 
minutes, three minutes past five.  Before we take the break, 
let us talk about how far we can go.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, we are not going to finish 
today.  We have been involved, hesitate to say stuck 
because I am here at fault, not just Mr Zwane in a particular 
20 
set of issues surrounding the database and the tender 
process.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Really what we wanted to do today 
was to deal with the advanced payment system. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 96 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are not going to finish? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We are certainly not going to finish 
because that is a whole section on its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I must take responsibility for 
introducing this topic because I asked the Welkom meeting, 
how was that database or on the basis of what list was the 
Welkom meeting compiled and that took us back to the 
10 
30t h of June which I was going to ask about ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it seems that we have not 
moved beyond that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It showed that we... that maybe there was 
a lot of confusion or lack of clarity.  So maybe you did not do 
anything wrong by letting us having a ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I would like to ask a few more 
questions to clarify that but... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But I am happy.  We originally 
planned to go for six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am happy to meet that requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am happy to do that as well.  Maybe 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 97 of 131 
 
let us take a break, a short break and then we come back.  
We continue until six and we take it from there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we adjourn.  Let us adjourn and then 
we come back, at what?  At quarter past or twenty past Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am in your hands. 
MR ZWANE:   It is fine Chair.  Quarter past is fine with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Quarter past is fine with you.  Let us say 
quarter past.   Okay. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Before we 
return to the original question, Mr Zwane, can I just clarify 
one issue?  The list that you presented to Exco on the 30 
June could not possibly have included entities that had 
passed muster through the tender process; the tender 
process only reached that conclusion much later, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the list that you approved 
through your signature of the 10 September we know from 
analysis and I can take you there later, if necessary, 
included persons who had tendered but were disqualified 
and included persons who had not tendered at all.  Did you 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 98 of 131 
 
know that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, that I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, that is a fact but if necessary 
we can get there later or just submit that to the Chair.  Let 
us go back to the Welkom meeting, if we may, which is 
where we started, Mr Zwane.  How did you decide who to 
invite to that meeting? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair, the Welkom meeting to the best 
of 
my 
recollection 
was 
around 
October 
and 
these 
processes had already been completed.  So if I remember, 
10 
I said they must invite all the contractors who were 
involved in building houses in the Free State. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would that have been your 10 
September list? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, it would have been my 10 September 
list and I guess it will not have necessarily excluded those 
who have not finished building houses earlier on. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, the meeting was chaired or 
attended at least by yourself, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
what 
the 
contractors 
apparently said to you was look, if you want us to finish 
houses in a hurry or on an expedited basis, at least we 
need help, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 99 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Why could they not obtain 
materials themselves?  After all, the contract with them 
would have required them to be able to finance the building 
of a house and to obtain materials by contracting with 
suppliers? 
MR ZWANE:   To the best of my recollection we were being 
faced with two challenges that I thought it will make sense 
to listen to them.  The first challenge was that we were 
lagging behind in terms of the percentage that we needed 
to achieve by national norms. 
10 
 
Number two, is that we were already heading for 
builders holiday which is your late November, the whole of 
December to go into mid-January next year.  And that 
process came out with its own challenges for contractors 
because now they were required to go and have more 
material for the period, which under normal circumstances, 
they would have not had - been required to go and buy 
materials themselves.  That is why they said to us you 
cannot expect us to be working on weekends, expect us to 
go and work during holidays but you, as the department, 
20 
you are not assisting in any way.   
The material suppliers were going to close and the 
process we were trying to push to ensure that we catch up 
with where we are lagging behind was not going to happen 
if we did not assist contractors. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 100 of 131 
 
 
I think the last issue is that amongst the contractors 
were the so-called new entrants, the young, the disabled 
and some women and they would  not have that capacity to 
buy material that would last them for the whole of 
December, late November, December to mid-January.  I 
think those are the issues, Chair, I want to put in front of 
you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Are you saying that the suppliers 
would close down and therefore there would have to be 
bulk buying and not everybody was capable of bulk buying?  
10 
Do I understand you correctly? 
MR ZWANE:   That is true, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see, because one would have 
thought that had a proper list of competent contractors 
been compiled that they could have dealt with these 
issues, did not need the department to intervene.  The 
reason why the department intervened was they had to 
spend the money. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, the fact of the matter is that we had 
all agreed, as Exco, that we must try and transform the 
20 
patterns of economy in the Free State and that was the 
norm even in the country, the BEE story.  It means at a 
particular point, as government, we were going to be faced 
with a challenge of ensuring that we open up for new 
entrants, women, young people, those who were disabled.  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 101 of 131 
 
 
And 
the 
other 
fact 
is 
that 
some 
experienced 
contractors, because of the movement of – the size of 
houses and so forth, did not come to the party, so we had 
to deal with that issue, Chair, under that understanding. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but you did not deal with it 
through a proper tender process which would evaluate the 
competence of the bidders from what every category of 
person they emanated, you did it through individual – the 
exercise of discretion on the part of yourself or officials or 
of Exco and it seems to me that the overwhelming evidence 
10 
that we have heard to date, which is also documented in 
the review application and the judgment of the High Court, 
that the advance payment system was designed, at least in 
major part, to ensure that the allocation was spent.  Would 
you concede that much? 
MR ZWANE:   To make sure that the allocation…? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was spent. The DORA allocation 
was spent. 
MR ZWANE:   I said last time when I was here, Chair, to 
the best of my knowledge and my records will show you 
20 
that I took leave, I worked in December.  My priority, which 
I clearly communicated to the officials, even when I was 
saying to them they should all cancel their leaves in 
December, was to get houses built on the ground, was not 
just to spend money, take money to suppliers and through 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 102 of 131 
 
national inflate expenditure when we have not done so.   
 
That is why you will see that during the process of 
the time when the Minister spoke to me, I acted.  I ensured 
I was there so that if there is a problem, the problem 
should be resolved, to ensure that houses are built and I 
am sure the reports will show you, Chair, that we did what 
we could to the best of our ability in terms of insuring that 
from the 21% that the Minister wrote us a letter on, by 
January according to the reports by the accounting officer, 
we were at 62.   
10 
 
So that is my take, that I would not have resisted 
money being taken if we were failing to do the work.  If the 
aim was to inflate, I would not have taken time, forfeit my 
holidays when every MEC is on holiday and work. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
We 
will 
come 
to 
the 
implementation. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In due course because that will 
reveal much of the true intent of the scheme but the 
overwhelming evidence, documentary and oral evidence 
20 
before the Chair has been that quite apart from other 
considerations, a major consideration of the advance 
payment system was to ensure that you could convince 
the national department that you were spending your 
allocation so that they would not take money away.  It is 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 103 of 131 
 
in black and white, we have been through it last time. 
MR ZWANE:   By building houses, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of course by building houses. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But by building houses in a 
manner that we will come to in a moment. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, alright.  Now the advance 
payment 
system 
we 
have 
heard 
from 
a number 
of 
witnesses and I can take you through all the evidence, if 
10 
you like, but you would have read the evidence, was 
raised by yourself at the meeting in October 2010 after 
the Welkom meeting.  Is that a fair proposition? 
MR ZWANE:   I raised the question, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   I raised …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You use that term advisedly 
because that is the term used by another witness.  You 
raised a question – that same witness, however, says later 
on in his evidence that it was a proposition but let us not 
20 
go into that detail.  What question did you raise? 
MR ZWANE:   Why cannot we help the contractors if we 
want houses to be built and achieve on our ERP. I have 
raised this matter and I want to know what can be a 
hiccup in terms of us doing this. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 104 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Doing what? 
MR ZWANE:   Helping the contractors buy material. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By making advance payments to 
suppliers so that they could then give the materials to 
contractors? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair, if you pay for material with the 
suppliers, from where I am seated that is not an advance 
payment.  Your material is ready, it is yours.  The issue – 
that issue, why I raised this question, is that under normal 
circumstances, the material will be purchased or procured 
10 
by the contractors themselves.  Those contractors we had 
engaged with and they have requested us as to help us.  
We are working on weekends to make you achieve your 
goal, why do you not come to the party?  So I thought it is 
a sensible question that I should put and it must be 
engaged.  It was not an instruction. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was the question that you put 
or raised? 
MR ZWANE:   Why can we not help these contractors? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   I take it, Chair, that if I go to a meeting of 
officials who are competent in terms of procurement and so 
forth, I raised a question that what will prohibit us in 
ensuring that we help these contractors with the material?  
They are capable enough to be able to say to me we 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 105 of 131 
 
cannot help.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, they did, but we will get 
there. 
MR ZWANE:   Somebody in a meeting said we can and 
even raised an issue of [indistinct] that [indistinct] has done 
this thing before in one of their projects and indeed, Chair, 
you are correct, some engaged this matter, that is why the 
outcome 
was 
that 
somebody 
must 
then 
go 
out 
and 
research. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane, the question is a 
10 
straightforward one.  How were you to help the contractors, 
what was your suggestion? 
MR ZWANE:   By making material available. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How would you do that? 
MR ZWANE:   I did not at that particular point, Chair, 
process my thoughts in terms of the details, the how part 
and so forth.  That is why I went to a meeting and asked 
the question.  If I had concluded, I would have raised a 
proposal, not even an instruction, because I know in terms 
of PFMA, money issues are not my purview.  I can only 
20 
suggest and propose and if the proposal is not taken, there 
is nothing that I can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did you formulate the question you 
raised? 
MR ZWANE:   Why can we not help the contractors with 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 106 of 131 
 
material?  Because that was the issue raised by the 
contractors in the Welkom meeting, that we are willing to 
help you, we are committed with the work on holidays. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the department did not keep 
material, Mr Zwane.   
MR ZWANE:   Well, it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You knew that did you not? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I knew, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was service providers or material 
providers who – or suppliers, material suppliers who kept 
10 
material.  So the department could not help the service 
provider, the contractors with material without money being 
paid for that material, is it not? 
MR ZWANE:   That is true, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that would have been obvious to you 
when you put the question, is it not? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, coming from a meeting where people 
have raised this matter, Chair, does not mean that was a 
20 
question that I have properly processed in terms of what 
will this mean, what will that mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Tsoametsi in his testimony and 
we can go there, if necessary, said that you proposed 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 107 of 131 
 
buying 
materials 
in 
advance 
for 
contractors 
at 
this 
meeting. 
MR ZWANE:   I asked a question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was the question to the effect that 
why can we not buy materials in advance for contractors? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Why can we not help the contractors by 
availing the material to them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane, please, we can be here 
10 
for a long time but I can promise you, I am going to persist 
until we get clarity.  Obviously by providing materials to 
contractors they would have to be bought, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is one way, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is? 
MR ZWANE:   That is one way. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How else do you do it?  Could you 
go and steal it from …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   Well, the department could have negotiated 
and then it stood as a guarantor for the contractors. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that your …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   I am just thinking about – I am saying, what I 
am bringing to the fore is that – it is not given that this was 
the only option, that is why I put this question to people 
who are learned, people would have known that – I mean, 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 108 of 131 
 
a government is an institution that is there.  At all times 
government is an institution where the movements of these 
contractors that will be working during December is kept.  
So I am raising this point very aware that I have just said 
to the Chair I have not processed this issue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, but you must have known, 
Mr Zwane, that to supply materials to contractors without 
the contractors having to buy the materials, which they 
would ordinarily have to do in terms of their contract.  The 
financial responsibility, whether by way of guarantee or 
10 
purchase would belong to the department. 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the department would have to 
incur in one form or another an obligation, a financial 
obligation to enable the supply of materials. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Now let me put to you 
what the other witnesses say and there is more than one 
witness in this regard.  Mr Maxatshwa says in his testimony 
on the 23 September – you have the EXHIBIT UU, the 
20 
bundle marked transcripts? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is day 270, it is after divider 3, 
Chair, in that bundle, at page 89. 
MR ZWANE:   FS12? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 109 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   What page, Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 89 where the fact of the 
meeting is introduced, the October meeting.  In paragraph 
80 of his statement and I go over to page 90. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr...  Are you not finding 
it? 
MR ZWANE:   The what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the bundle number, Mr 
Pretorius.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It does not have a number, it is 
marked transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Transcripts. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It has been recently introduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, each day’s transcripts, 
because they will be uploaded onto the website in this form, 
has its own numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But day 270 is after the third 
20 
divider and we are at page 90. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think day 270 is with me.  Oh sorry - 
okay, at the bottom there are page numbers on my one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, so it is page 90 of 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:   90.  Yes, I have got it. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 110 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right if you look at page 90, Mr 
Maxatshwa was being led on the basis on the basis of his 
statement which was before the Chair and I put to him: 
“But is it correct in paragraph in 80 where you say 
“during the meeting the MEC advised those present 
that he had come up with a plan.”  Is that your 
recollection of what happened?” 
“Correct, Chair.” 
And he says the plan originated from you.  What do you say 
about that? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I do not agree with this, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say you asked a question? 
MR ZWANE:   That is what I am saying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  He goes on to answer a 
proposition put to him, also based on his statement: 
“He explained then what that plan would involve and 
that was essentially buying material for building 
projects from suppliers and paying for those in 
advance.” 
Correct?  Is that what happened? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   That is what happened, Chair, as I am told, 
but you read  the plan, the background of the plan says: 
“An 
advance 
payment 
will 
be 
made 
where 
necessary.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When…? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 111 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   Where necessary.  My own interpretation of 
that is that there would be instances where there is no 
advance payment.  Where necessary, that advance payment 
would be made and if it is made there should be an 
agreement between the contractor, the supplier and the 
department. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we will come to the 
agreements and how they worked or did not work in due 
course but do you know that over 600 million was paid by 
way of advance payments during this period? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I have since learned when I – learnt about 
it when I read. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you seem very cautious now 
to qualify your proposal to say that well, it did not have to 
be advance payments and only when necessary should 
there be advance payments.  Were you aware then of the 
dangers of an advance payment system and therefore you 
needed to be careful about how it was formulated and how 
it was implemented?  It seems to me that that was present 
to your mind, certainly now and then? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   In fact, Chair, if you go on – I think it is 
FS12 - you would see that the risk factors, mitigation 
factors were actually raised at a particular meeting and I 
think in this case in the 30 December or November 
meeting, in that Bethlehem meeting.  That is when the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 112 of 131 
 
department started raising these issues as a layman, 
Chair, talking to lawyers, talking to people who have done 
master’s in urban planning.  I do not understand how 
would all these people, people who are responsible as 
accounting officers, sit on that side, the people who are 
supposed to advise me, come to this Commission and said 
when we have done this on the basis of a proposal by the 
then MEC and this proposal was …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is not the proposition being 
put to you.  The proposition is that the proposal originated 
10 
from you, that is all – it went through various processes 
after that.  But let us stick to the question. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Otherwise we are going to go 
down another rabbit hole.  The proposition that I would 
like you to consider is that you were aware from your 
evidence now even in October 2010 that this proposal, 
advance payment or provision of guarantees or the 
assumption of financial responsibilities in respect of 
suppliers was fraught with risk and had to be controlled, 
20 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That was brought to me at some stage, 
Chair, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, but right in the beginning you 
were careful only to raise the question and to seek advice 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 113 of 131 
 
and you were aware that there were various forms, 
according to your evidence, of achieving the goal and you 
were aware that it should only be done where necessary.  
You took pains to emphasise that now.   
The clear import of your evidence is that this was 
matter 
that 
involved 
risk 
and 
had 
to 
be 
carefully 
formulated and controlled, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, the idea of the advance payment 
arose out of a question that I asked and the debate in the 
meeting and the decisions of that meeting. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was it an issue that raised risks 
and had to be approached with caution?  That is my 
question. 
MR ZWANE:   The debate, Chair, in the meeting 
suggested that there was no unanimity in terms of taking 
this route, that is why …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry to interrupt, Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The question is, were you aware 
at the time that any system of assisting contractors, 
20 
whether by way of financial commitment or who have 
financial responsibility through guarantees was a matter 
involving risk. 
MR ZWANE:   No, no Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You didn’t think it was risky? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 114 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   If I may Chair I would have put this question 
differently, in fact I would have proposed and detailed my 
proposal. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But when the proposal came back 
to you on the 25 t h of November signed by Mr Tsoametsi and 
the HOD, that contained a provision that advance payments 
should be made only where necessary, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will get to the contracts which 
show that the department assumed financial risk, that must 
10 
have been obvious to you when you read that document, 
correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so at least on the 25 t h of 
November if not at this meeting in October a month before 
you would have been aware of the risk involved to the 
department assuming financial obligations.   It seems that 
you agree to that. 
MR ZWANE:   No, I don’t. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You don’t? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On the 25 t h of November you were 
not aware that the advance payment system involved any 
risk to the department, financially?  Mr Tsoametsi the risk 
involved the loss of hundreds of millions of Rand to the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 115 of 131 
 
department, R600million was spent by way of advance 
payments for which little or no value was received.  Are 
you 
saying 
in 
October, 
I 
mean 
that’s 
an 
alarming 
proposition 
to 
put 
to 
you, 
but 
are 
you 
saying 
in 
October/November you weren’t aware of this risk? 
MR ZWANE:   When this agreement was brought to me on 
the 25 t h, after the 25 actually of November I went through 
it, it was signed and approved by the Accounting Officer, 
remember this is the question I had asked and even said 
people must go and investigate properly and that would 
10 
have included the issue of the document being legally 
sound.    
 
Now when they come back these people some of 
them were lawyers, they have legal background as a and I 
wouldn’t have doubted that skill that this document has 
gone through the processes and we can use it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, you have introduced a new 
topic now, which  we will get to and that’s the legality of 
the proposition , there can be little doubt that what was 
proposed and the manner in which it was implemented was 
20 
completely illegal but what Mr Tsoametsi made very clear 
was that he didn’t test the scheme against any legislation 
or any legislative provisions by way of regulation, he didn’t 
do that, it was not a legal opinion.   Do you understand 
that, what do you say about that evidence?  
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 116 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   Well I have gone through the transcript I 
have seen that Chair, I have also heard that he agreed 
when he was questioned that we had given him a broad 
mandate to go and look into the feasibility of what was now 
on the table, and for me that would also include the 
soundness of the document legally.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well he said it didn’t. 
MR ZWANE:   I have come to understand it now through 
the transcripts but at that particular time after the 25 t h of 
November 2010 here is a lawyer bringing to me a document 
10 
that is been signed by himself, it means he is happy, 
signed by the Accounting Officer, it means the Accounting 
Officer as the receiving officer who is also responsible for 
the up-keeping of the finances that the Department is 
having and see to it that those finances are being used in 
an efficient manner, they signed also.   
 
As a layman Chair I did not have a reason 
whatsoever to begin to say I have a question on this issue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You called the Welkom meeting, 
you managed the Welkom meeting, you dealt with the 
20 
concerns of the contractors who wanted assistance with 
supplies, you raised the issue by way of a question on your 
evidence, not consistent with other evidence, at the 
October meeting with the officials.   You must have been 
concerned about the legality of any proposed scheme 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 117 of 131 
 
because 
you 
say 
included 
it 
by 
implication 
in 
your 
instructions to Tsoametsi, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, he was tasked by the meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, okay, just we are not going 
now as to what happened after that, I am just enquiring as 
to your opinion at the time that it indeed needed a legal 
opinion, as to the legality, you  yourself has just said so. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.   Why didn’t you go to the 
Legal Department, Mr Venter, and say look here is a 
10 
proposal or a contemplated proposal please check, you are 
the responsible party in the Premier ’s office for the legality 
of contracts, in fact you were at a meeting where the 
Premier said everything must through Mr Venter.  Why 
leave it to Mr Tsoametsi, a BProc who had never practiced 
law before. 
MR ZWANE:   It was not my task Chair as an MEC to go 
and get the details and things of the research that I said 
must take place.  I did not at any point - measures or 
accounting officers where – or consulting with people I said 
20 
go and research, the mandate was broad and open, so 
when it comes back to me, like many others I take it that 
the work has been done. 
 
At that point in time Chair I did not see a reason 
why I should ask who and who have you consulted.  I 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 118 of 131 
 
thought they had done everything they should be doing and 
I was happy with that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The issue I am putting to you is 
one of accountability.  The Province lost hundreds of 
millions of Rands through this advance payment scheme 
and its failure.  R600million was spent in a short period of 
time by way of advance payments which had to be 
recovered or attempted to be recovered through litigation.  
Certain people did things and certain people didn’t do 
things, what we know is that you as MEC did not ensure 
10 
that a proper legal opinion was prepared and presented to 
you to satisfy you that the scheme was legal. 
 
You never saw a proper legal opinion that set out 
the proposal and gave an opinion as to its legality in terms 
of laws and regulations, you never saw that, it never 
existed.   
MR ZWANE:   Can I respond Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I am sure any politician, a leader at that 
level who was not a lawyer, who did not have a legal 
20 
background, when a document is presented here by a legal 
person who is being cast broadly to go and research about 
the feasibility of doing this particular issue, would have not 
at that particular time say let me go and get a legal 
opinion, unless anybody at that level had raised an issue 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 119 of 131 
 
about the legality or discomfort I am sure would have then 
said no let us go for a legal opinion, but when the 
Accounting Officer was happy and everybody – why would I 
have ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Legality was a concern to you, you 
have said so.  
MR ZWANE:  Therefore I sent a legal person to go and 
research.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Exactly, and that is precisely 
because you are not legally trained that you would ask to 
10 
see a document that made it clear that the opinion had 
been properly obtained, properly formulated and properly 
set out, precisely because you are not a lawyer, you would 
want to be assured as an executive or as a Minister, MEC, 
that the research had been done and conclusions had been 
properly reached. At the very least you would have made 
sure that Mr Venter of the Legal Office had been consulted.  
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair as I am saying that did not come 
to my mind at that particular time. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know with hindsight, as 
20 
pronounced by various reports, by the affidavit of the 
Department itself, by the judgment of the High Court that 
the advance payment scheme was illegal, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By omission therefore the scheme 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 120 of 131 
 
had been allowed to be implemented, at least from your 
point, will you not concede that? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair the advance payment for contractors in 
terms of South Africa is not an illegal issue.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well let’s deal with them. 
MR ZWANE:   One of the Treasury regulations, I think it is 
paragraph 8.2.3 raises a point, and I think the PFMA raises 
that point too, to say if you have an advance payment 
there should be a contract that specifically indicate that 
you are going to do an advance payment and then in that 
10 
case then you can administer an advance payment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well there was no such contract. 
MR ZWANE:   Now I am saying Chair from where I am 
seated I think it will be unfair of this Commission to want 
to say no as a layman politician there I should have taken 
responsibility, the responsibilities of an Accounting Officer 
who himself had actually signed this document that I need 
to come to this Commission and say it was an illegal 
document. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But Mr Zwane ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Zwane don’t you perform oversight 
over the Accounting Officer as MEC? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you are going to keep on saying if 
the Accounting Officer says this is right who am I to say it 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 121 of 131 
 
is not right, how are you going to perform oversight? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair equally if I were to ensure 
that every time I play my oversight I have an external 
person to actually qualify what the person who is being 
appointed to advise me this person under his control have 
a number of people who are ...[indistinct] I am sure to be 
seated in this Commission for a different reason of having 
wasted 
government’s 
money 
having 
people 
in 
the 
department that are tasked to do the same work, so the 
oversight I am doing simply according to the law the same 
10 
Accounting Officer must provide me with reports and with 
this report it is when I can say the progress here is not 
according to what we have agreed, why did you deviate 
here if you have deviated and get responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying that you are playing 
oversight, you are performing oversight over the HOD if 
you have to rely on him, whether he has done the job 
properly? 
MR ZWANE:   That is actually the case Chair, he must 
provide me with reports. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if he says I have done the job 
properly then you are satisfied? 
MR ZWANE:  If it is the job that I can be able to verify like 
in the case of houses, there should be a person that I will 
take time to go with him and the team to verify that indeed 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 122 of 131 
 
houses have been built.  In that affidavit I had said in 
December of that particular year I myself have opened 
some houses and that was in the ...[indistinct] to ensure 
that if they said to me houses have been built, I must go 
and open these houses and here if people are happy and 
then open the houses, I think that is how far I would 
oversight Chair as politicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you believe that you possessed what 
would be required to perform oversight over the HOD or 
Human Settlement at the time? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair I will answer that question 
broadly, when you are appointed as a politician to whatever 
position now of late your parties will want to get your 
qualifications but under normal circumstances there is an 
emphasis that the people you appoint should be adequately 
appointed, that is why there are levels that at this level of 
an HOD these are the requirements of a person who must 
be.  This person goes through an interview and this person 
should then be trusted by you, and you should utilise the 
skills that they possess, otherwise it would be pointless to 
20 
appoint people and you don’t use them.   
 
So I still believe that with the experience that I had 
I had given it my best shot to be present where I could be 
present, it does not mean Chair that in that scheme of 
things some issues would not go wrong, no it does not 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 123 of 131 
 
mean that.   
 
I think also what I want to emphasize, maybe just to 
point is that in December the minutes will show and some 
reports will show that we had gone into a session, that 
session which was even saying contractors there should be 
a meeting between officials and contractors to reconcile so 
that we mitigate the risks that were there. 
 
Now I would say ja, I was adequately equipped to 
actually look after the housing issues at that particular 
time Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We are at four minutes past six 
Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps I should just finish this 
line of questioning if I may Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is clear Mr Zwane is that the 
legality 
of 
any 
answer 
to 
the 
question, 
and 
I 
am 
paraphrasing your own evidence now which is contracted 
by the witnesses but the legality of any answer to the 
question that you raised had legal implications which 
20 
should have been considered, correct? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Notwithstanding that concern you 
never saw a legal opinion which set out clearly that the 
scheme was legal and complied with legal prescripts 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 124 of 131 
 
whether by way of statutory regulation? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I am going to put it to you in 
summary, but what the witnesses, Mr Mokoena and Mr 
Tsoametsi and Mr Maxatshwa say is that the scheme with a 
question, the proposal however you want to put it, was not 
a general proposal but it was that the department should 
pay suppliers for materials.  What do you say to that?  Not 
one, but three witnesses.  
MR ZWANE:   I think Chair I should humbly put it in this 
10 
Commission that I find some of the facts from this too 
amazing, to say the least.  The HOD was a lawyer and Mr 
Maxatshwa is a lawyer by profession.  They know about the 
legislation, they know that their Accounting Officer has 
powers to actually overrule me on issues that have an 
unauthorised expenditure, illegality, and I have alluded to 
this before, he should ask me in writing, preferably in 
writing and he must report me to the Treasury of National 
and the Province. 
 
Now he comes here and says he feared for the fact 
20 
that I would have said he should resign but the same HOD 
I have given him instruction as an MEC that every official 
should cancel their holidays in December.  What did he do?   
In this case he tells me I can’t, did I fire him?   No, he 
went and come back and that is not the only decision Chair 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 125 of 131 
 
that the HOD had actually said in this Commission here I 
do not agree with the MEC and I put my foot down.   
 
Now I find that to be quite frank his relationship 
with facts is a bit fractured.  If he was saying I was this 
monster that came with a document, he did not sign it, 
again did not sign it and he did not – he cancelled his trip 
out I would understand.  If myself me as a person Chair in 
these different departments sir I don’t seek to rule the 
officials by iron fist, I always ask can you do this, if they 
say no I say why, tell me, if there are legalities, I abide 
10 
with the decision of the collective, so I am just saying 
humbly in this Commission, I may not know the reasons 
why they have chosen to do that, but at least HOD should 
have acknowledged that he was an HOD and an Accounting 
Officer and he was aware of PSMA to say the least. 
 
Thank you Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes well I am not sure I detected a 
direct answer at least to the question but more than one 
witness has said before the Chair that when this idea or 
question was raised at your instance it was raised in the 
20 
context of the Department making prepayments, not any 
other form of liability.  What do you say to that? 
MR ZWANE:   Prepayment is advance payment? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Advance payment, in other words 
that you would buy the materials. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 126 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   I think at the ...[indistinct] the documents 
...[indistinct] that we will buy material yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and that what was discussed 
at the meeting and when we meet again, fair warning, we 
will discuss the fact that they raised the legality pertinently 
there, which is even more reason why you should have 
satisfied yourself that a proper legal opinion was taken. 
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair this thing as an MEC in that 
department, if I was this person who was so adamant to 
choose this scheme against all odds why did they continue 
10 
with this scheme when I was not there anymore, why did 
they continue to sign cessions.  I left the department in 
early February Chair, in May according to the documents 
that I have read here HOD Mokoena was still signing these 
cessions and the media even saying this thing even went 
beyond HOD Mokoena’s time and it overlapped to Mr 
Moeketsi’s time. 
 
If I have to entertain what they are saying they 
should have stopped this thing in February because it was 
a scheme of MEC Zwane who did not want to hear any 
20 
legalities.  Now that Mr Zwane is no longer there why are 
they not stopping this thing which is illegal, why do they 
continue with this illegality Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In fact the evidence, you are quite 
right Mr Zwane, the evidence says that even after the 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 127 of 131 
 
Minister – Mr Sexwale, had said to the Department stop 
this system, the system continued. 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
I 
am 
asking 
why 
Chair 
because 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you agree that it did?  
MR ZWANE:   I do not know the details because the letter 
that ...[intervenes]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You said it did Mr Zwane.  
MR ZWANE:   No the letter, I am saying about Minister 
Sexwale, the letter that I have that is on page 252 that 
10 
comes from the Minister, he is not saying this thing must 
stop, it says – he has placed the intention, the intention 
was some allocation and reallocating and it says to us 
please furnish  us with written representations as to what 
are you going to do.  I think to my best memory as I read 
that letter these are the two points I picked up unless there 
is another letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    No it was a meeting in February 
2011 where the evidence is that the Minister, National 
Minister said that this prepaid system must stop and no 
20 
further payments should be made.  Notwithstanding that 
instruction the Department continued.   
MR ZWANE:   Well Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which raises – well let’s deal with 
that first. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 128 of 131 
 
MR ZWANE:   Chair I left the department of Human 
Settlement in February, the second week of February I left.  
Now what I am trying to bring to the attention of – your 
attention Chair, would there have been a reason of the 
department not stopping about this issue because I left. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But the fact, I am not blaming you 
Mr Zwane.  
MR ZWANE:    Oh, okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is not my task to blame you, the 
fact is I just want to establish that as far as you are aware 
10 
the system continued after February. 
MR ZWANE:   Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that correct?  
MR ZWANE:   According to what I have read Chair, 
according to what I have read, I was not there, that is why 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane you stated emphatically 
not five minutes ago with your hands in the air that the 
system continued, you didn’t say why do I read here that it 
continued, 
you 
stated 
it 
as 
a 
fact, 
and 
you 
know 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   I state it as a fact and I quote it Chair that 
according 
to 
what 
I 
have 
read, 
we 
can 
check 
the 
transcripts, according to what I have read by Iponkwena, 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 129 of 131 
 
by Kaiser, Kaiser was even saying it continued beyond the 
time of -  that is the emphasis I did ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Anyway, we can rest assured your 
evidence is not necessarily to establish that factor, it is 
established in documented version.   
MR ZWANE:   Alright, thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As you seem to agree.  Is that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But also I think one or more of the 
witnesses testified about a meeting that was held which 
10 
was attended by Minister Sexwale and yourself if I am not 
mistaken where it was just – where he said this advance 
payment must stop and whoever testified said you may 
have put up some argument but ultimately you agreed, but 
when you came back to the Free State you said no, no, no, 
we must continue.  Is my recollection correct Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes chair we have recorded those 
references and we will deal with it in due course, but you 
are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have seen evidence to that 
effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, shall we leave it for 
him to respond to it next time or must he respond to it 
now? 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 130 of 131 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps in better sequence.   I am 
happy to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You will come to it at some stage? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then he doesn’t have to respond 
now.  Okay, alright.  We are going to adjourn, so we will 
need to arrange another date for Mr Zwane to come back.  
Mr Zwane another date will be arranged for you to come 
back, unfortunately, but thank you for coming to the 
Commission today, we will adjourn now and ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR ZWANE:   Can I say something chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I just want to assure this Commission that I 
am willing to cooperate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   This is for the second time in the same 
matter but I am willing to come back Chair, I will come on 
another time, and I must appreciate the endeavour to finish 
me with, what would have helped me, and I also appreciate 
the way in which this Commission has conducted its issues 
20 
today.  I must say first time when I was here I felt like I am 
in a serious court, but I think today I appreciate and I will 
give it my fullest cooperation Chair. 
 
I just wanted to make that point and thank you very 
much. 
12 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 281 
 
Page 131 of 131 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine, well I don’t know 
about last time but it may be because you had not had the 
chance to read certain documents.   I thought that both Mr 
Pretorius and myself haven’t changed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we might not be able to see 
ourselves.   
 
We will adjourn, I believe tomorrow I will be hearing 
evidence relating to Eskom and I think the witness will be 
Dr Ngubane.  
10 
 
We adjourn.
