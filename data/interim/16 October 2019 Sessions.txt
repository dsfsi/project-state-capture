PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 16 OCTOBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready?  Are you ready? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes DCJ I am ready.  DCJ this morning we have Ms 
Rockman who is a former DG in the office of the Premier and former 
MEC for Finance in the Free State Provincial Government.  She is here 
DCJ as an implicated party but has all along indicated that she is quite 
willing to assist this Commission.  Her documentation DCJ is to be 
10 
found in Exhibit HH13.  There are four volumes to HH13.  It is Volume 
A, B, C and then Volume D has a supplementary affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see that the one that has a supplementary 
affidavit is not marked D. 
ADV GCABASHE:  It is HH13, 13.1.  I have been corrected by my 
colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That is the supplementary affidavit that we received 
day before yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – has 13.1 been admitted already or not really? 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Even 13 has not been admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 3 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  We will be relying also on the usual reference 
bundles that we have been using for all the Estina witnesses.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I do not know if you would like the witness to first 
make affirmation which she prefers to do and then you admit the 
Exhibits into the record of if you are prepared to do that now before 
she makes affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well actually let us try and get her to – let her 
do the affirmation first.  Please administer the affirmation. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Elizabeth Cornelia Rockman. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
shall be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you proceed Ms Gcabashe shouldn’t 
20 
her legal representatives place themselves on record? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Mr Roeloffze has done that previously Chairman but 
I think that it is opposite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Apposite for him to do so now because I noticed on the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 4 of 190 
 
transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  They did not get his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So I will give him the opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  To correct that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV ROELOFFZE:   May it please you DCJ. I am instructed to appear 
on behalf of Ms Rockman in this matter on the instruction of Boqwana 
Burns Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you. 
ADV ROELOFFZE:   My instructing attorney is Mr Brett Murison from 
Boqwana Burns Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ROELOFFZE:   Sorry DCJ.  Apparently I must place my full names 
on record so I am Alexander Roeloffze who appears for Ms Rockman.  
My surname if spelt R-o-e-l-o-f-f-z-e. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV ROELOFFZE:   It is an unusual spelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. Thank you. 
ADV ROELOFFZE:   Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  (African language) decision. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 5 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know why Ms Gcabashe wants your full 
names. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Maybe it is because they gave me a supplementary 
affidavit the day before yesterday DCJ.  Thank you.  Thank you DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well actually that reminds me.  The transcribers I 
suppose are listening.  I previously asked somebody to speak to them 
to say in the transcript there is no need for them to write the full names 
of a person as they appear in the ID all the time when they refer to the 
person.   
You look at various transcripts they have got Advocate Paul 
10 
Joseph Pretorius each time they refer to him.  It is Advocate Paul 
Joseph Pretorius – I mean it is enough at the beginning as far as 
counsel is concerned if you have got his or her initials and the surname 
and for the rest in the transcript you just refer to Ms Gcabashe or Adv 
Gcabashe, Adv Pretorius.   
In the end I think that writing all those full names takes a lot of 
space and increases costs unnecessarily.  So transcribers please do 
not do that.   
If it is a witness at the beginning when the witness takes the 
oath or does the affirmation they give their full names.  After that you 
20 
do not have to write all their names each time there is a reference to 
them or each time they give an answer to a question.  
Okay, alright.  Ms Gcabashe I think at least that is taken care 
of now. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 6 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I do not know if the – they have been writing your 
full names as well.  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman so we go back to the record and the 
admission of Exhibit HH13 Volumes A, B and C to the record and then 
also Exhibit HH13 Volume – the Volume marked 13.1.  We ask that 
those with particular documents be admitted to the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  A has got Ms Rockman’s main statement or affidavit, 
is that right? 
ADV GCABASHE:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Annexures B and C contain just Annexures, is 
10 
that right? 
ADV GCABASHE:  To Volume A that is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Volume – ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To her main statement or affidavit.  And then HH13.1 
is her supplementary affidavit and Annexures to that affidavit? 
ADV GCABASHE:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Safe to say that Volume A also has the first few 
annexures. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So it is the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
ADV GCABASHE:  With Annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 7 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  And then it continues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The lever arch file containing Ms Rockman’s main 
affidavit or statement and Annexures is admitted and will be marked as 
Exhibit HH13A.  There are two other lever arch files they are marked – 
they are to be marked Exhibit HH13B and Exhibit HH13C respectively.  
Each of them contains Annexures to Ms Rockman’s main statement or 
affidavit.  And those two are admitted as well.  And then that is – 
another lever arch file containing Ms Rockman’s supplementary 
affidavit or statement with certain Annexures – it will be marked as 
Exhibit HH13.1. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Before you proceed I just want to say something 
about Ms Rockman’s evidence – statement.  Ms Rockman I have read 
your main statement. I have had a look at the supplementary statement. 
The impression I have is that most of the things that you deal with are 
unlikely to be controversial or are unlikely to be disputed by anybody.  
Of course there are some which may be disputed.  
 
In order to use our time profitably I do not want us to spend a 
20 
lot of time on oral evidence that is unlikely to be disputed by anybody.  
It may be important but it is there – it is in an affidavit.  Whenever I 
need to look at it I can look at it.  You understand? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Ms Gcabashe will approach your evidence and 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 8 of 190 
 
lead you in a manner that I believe will take account of what I am 
saying. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot of things that are common cause like somebody 
wrote a letter to somebody, a bill was passed, resolution was made.  
Insofar as those are non-controversial I do not want us to spend too 
much time on them. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The areas which I would like oral evidence to focus 
on are areas which show that there may have been corruption.  There 
10 
may have been non-compliance with procedures.  There may have been 
undue influence.  There may have been some of the issues that are 
covered in the terms of reference in circumstances where that might be 
in dispute.  
 
Now some witnesses have already given evidence in the 
Commission in relation to the – Estina and Ms Gcabashe is aware of 
some of the areas where somebody might have given evidence that is 
not in – that is not consistent with what you are saying. 
 
So it may be that we are not going to take too long in terms of 
oral evidence.  That is not necessarily because your evidence is not 
20 
important it might just be because a lot of it is unlikely to be disputed 
or controversial.  You understand that? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 9 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  And obviously your counsel also hears what I 
am saying.  I can always go and read what you have written here.  
Okay.  But there are areas where I am interested.  One of them is the 
issue of transfer payments and implementing agents but there are other 
areas that Ms Gcabashe will explore.  But I do not expect us to be too 
long in terms of your oral evidence.  Okay.  Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Ms Rockman you have 
familiarised yourself with the files that are on the witness table? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can you please look at Volume A which has your 
main statement.  And if you turn to page 4 thereof can you confirm the 
name that is recorded there and that that is your affidavit? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes it is. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And in everything you say you will always be 
addressing the Chairman so I may ask the questions but the responses 
go to the Chairman. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  If you then go to page 112 of the same file. Could 
you confirm whether that is your signature, confirm the date of 
20 
signature and the place of signature of what you are saying is your 
affidavit? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes it is my signature.  It was signed on the 13 t h of 
August 2019. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And the place of signature? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 10 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Bloemfontein. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you.  Let us do the same exercise with the 
supplementary affidavit which is in File HH13.1.  If you then go to 
paginated page 1. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Again could you confirm that that is your name and 
that it is your affidavit? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  If you turn to page 44 and 45.  On page 44 there is 
a signature.  On page 45 the rest of the details appear.  Whose 
10 
signature is reflected on page 44? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is my signature and I signed it on the 13 t h of 
October in Bloemfontein. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Excellent thank you very much.  Can we go to just 
broad introductory questions?  I am going to try and be brief as 
indicated by the Chairman.  But the questions I will be asking are 
actually important.  Your current occupation, what do you do right now? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I did not return to the Legislature after the elections 
earlier this year.  I am primarily keeping myself busy in the NPO sector 
and it felt like I have been working for the Commission preparing the 
20 
affidavit for the past few months. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In the NPO sector you said? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  What is NPO 
MS ROCKMAN:  Non Profit.  Non Profit Organisations. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 11 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Oh okay as NGO. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I know it as a different acronym but thank you.  That 
is fine.  When I get to your positions as DG and MEC I will talk a little 
bit about your qualifications for those particular jobs in context.  But for 
current purposes can I just indicate that you are aware that we are 
dealing with the Vrede Dairy Project investigation. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  With regard to this particular project the questions 
that we will be asking will relate to these themes.  The first theme is 
10 
whether provision was made by the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development for the payment of R114 million per annum over the three 
year period of the Estina Agreement.   
That is a critical issue because you were both during that 
three year period in the Premier’s office and then you were MEC 
Finance.  You are with me on that then? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I will also then be putting to you matters raised by 
Mr Jankielsohn in his evidence.  Roy Jankielsohn and by Mr Moremi – 
Moses Moremi whose testimonies have implicated you to a certain 
20 
extent.   
 
I know that you have received Rule 3.3 Notices in this regard.  
Is that correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In addition the Commission is interested in the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 12 of 190 
 
oversight role that the Provincial Treasury played in relation to the 
transparent effective and efficient use of funds that were allocated to 
this dairy project as well as the assets that were acquired on behalf of 
the so called beneficiaries.   
 
Included in this discussion will be information regarding the 
accounting treatment of transfer payments which the Chairman has 
indicated he is interested in and of course of the whole issue 
surrounding implementing agents.   
 
There appears to have been regular non-compliance by the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development with the SCM 
10 
procedures.  That is the Supply Chain Management Procedures.  Again 
that is an area that I would think falls under your remit.  I now address 
you as the former MEC of Treasury.  Would that be correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The other area that we will then deal with very 
briefly to an extent regards the broader issues that arise under term of 
reference 1.4 – I beg your pardon.  1.1, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.9 and I am just 
going to paraphrase what those essentially speak to. 
 
These issues really will try and elicit from you your knowledge 
or observations if any with regard to undue benefits that accrued to the 
20 
Gupta family or Gupta entities if I might call them that.  Gupta related 
entities or any other family or entity including the facilitation of the 
unlawful award of tenders.  The nature and extent and irregularities.  
Undue enrichment, corruption and undue influence if any in the 
awarding of contracts and whether any public official or functionary 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 13 of 190 
 
influenced the awarding of tenders to benefit themselves, their families 
or entities in which they held a personal interest.   
 
So that is an area that the Commission has been tasked with 
in terms of our terms of reference.  Can I just go through your 
background very briefly?  How long were you employed in the Free 
State Provincial Government just in terms of years? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I joined Provincial Government after the 2009 general 
elections.  Initially as the Head of Monitoring and Evaluation in the 
office of the Premier.  Then I was the acting HOD of the Department of 
Economic Development Tourism Environmental Affairs for a brief period 
10 
in 2010 until I was appointed as Director General around September 
2010 up to March 2013 when I became a member of the Legislature. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Director General in the Premier’s office? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And then in 2013 – March 2013 you were appointed 
MEC for ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes I became a Member of the Legislature and then 
subsequently MEC Finance. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Excellent.  Your appointment as DG in the Premier’s 
office were you head hunted for that particular position?  Did you apply 
20 
for it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No I applied. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You applied for it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes 
ADV GCABASHE:  And what do you believe qualified you for that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 14 of 190 
 
position? 
MS ROCKMAN:  By then I was the secretary to the Legislature for 15 
years between 1994 to 2009.  I hold BA Languages degree and an 
Honours in English from the University of the Free State.  I think I was 
an experience administrator.  Though more in the Legislative sector 
than in the Executive branch of government.  So I think in terms of both 
skills and experience I had a good background understanding of the 
environment and specifically the political interface and administrative 
interface. 
 
It is a particularly challenging environment to be in for any 
10 
Director General or Head of Department.   
ADV GCABASHE:  In fact that is an area of interest for this 
Commission because one of the recommendations the Chairman has to 
make is – concerns how well that interface works because at the end of 
the day we have three branches of government.  And it is whether there 
is influence that permeates from one to the other that creates this 
undue influence, corruption etcetera.   
 
So I will be asking you one or two questions around that.  We 
will get to that in just a minute.  The – we have been told that the Free 
State Government would regularly hold meetings Lekgotla, did you 
20 
attend those? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes I did. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Is that one of the areas where this interface 
between politics and administration would come to the fore? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes it would. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 15 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  We will get to it in a minute under a different 
question.   
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I just want you to flag that.  I am also interested in 
whether you met Mr Thabethe before Mr Thabethe being the former 
HOD of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development?  Did you 
meet him before you became DG or only when you became DG in the 
Premier’s office? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No I met him before.  When he was appointed HOD 
Rural Development I think that was in 2011 I think by then I was still 
10 
Head of Monitoring and Evaluation.  So I had met him in that capacity. 
ADV GCABASHE:  What I am interested in in that score and I suppose 
it does not just apply to Mr Thabethe but to all HOD’s.  Sitting in the 
Premier’s office as DG in the Premier’s office what was the relationship 
you were expected to have with HOD’s?  And really I would really – I 
am trying just to explore whether there was anything untoward.  Is 
there anything the Commission needs to note within the context of 
making recommendations on how better to manage those relationships? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No I do not think so.  We have what we call and I think 
it applies to all provinces.  There is the forum of Heads of Departments 
20 
forward – at national level it is called FORD.  Where in the province it 
is where the DG and all Heads of Departments meet on a regular basis 
basically almost every second week for coordination purposes whether 
it relates to matters of – with the public service, whether it relates to 
programs 
of 
provincial 
government, 
preparation 
for 
Lekgotla, 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 16 of 190 
 
implementing Exco resolutions, preparing for Exco meetings and so 
forth.   
So it is an important forum.  It needs to be active and 
constructive.  Many departments would also for example Treasury 
would present their technical reports, quarterly income and expenditure 
reports, trends in irregular expenditure, preparations for audit.  All of 
those technical work goes through FORD and ideally from FORD it will 
feed into the Executive Council. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So by the time that Mr Thabethe signed the 
agreement with Estina on the 5 t h of June 2012 you had met him a 
10 
number of times? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Did he tell you about the deviation that he was 
either about to embark on in relation to the appointment of an 
implementing agent for the Vrede Dairy Project or did you hear of it by 
the way? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No when the matter came to Exco in June 2012 the 
memorandum did not indicate that the contract had already been 
signed.  That we only realised after that meeting when there was a 
request for the Treasury Committee to convene and find additional 
20 
funding to – for – to allocate to this Vrede Dairy Project.  It was only 
then that we realised but the contract was signed before the Exco 
meeting.  Not that it had a material impact because the Executive 
Council itself had no authority to enter into contracts.  But it was about 
the political support for the project.  But it was not disclosed that the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 17 of 190 
 
contract had already been signed. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But you are saying that in terms of your own rules 
and conventions, excuse me, there was nothing irregular about Mr 
Thabethe signing the contract prior to getting approval from Exco for 
the implementation of the project? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Mr Thabethe or at least the Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development had been presenting on Mohama Mobung’s 
strategies since early 2011 I think.  So it was not a completely new 
project.  We were not surprised oh suddenly here is a project.  There 
was a build-up on how Mohama Mobung was introduced as a strategy 
10 
through the course of 2011.   
 
I think we do make reference to quite a number of 
presentations. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I am going to take you to those. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Presently if you do not mind.  I really am just trying 
to set the basic groundwork for your relationship – for understanding 
your relationship not just with Mr Thabethe as HOD but also with other 
HOD’s.  Because the impression one gets is that quite a lot of power 
was centralised in the Premier’s office.  Is that an incorrect 
20 
impression? 
MS ROCKMAN:  There was more of a perception but the Premier’s 
office as a co-ordinating structure for the province at the – I was trying 
to put together a list of the number of forums that operated or was co-
ordinated through the office of the Premier.   
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 18 of 190 
 
 
You would have your ICT Forum.  You would have your security 
managers.  You would have HR.  You would have communications.  Not 
every department can have 20, 30 communication people but if you 
bring all of them for example together you have a stronger, more 
efficient structure.   
 
So there was a lot of emphasis in 2009 that term of 
government that came in.  It was a lot of emphasis on the introduction 
of the outcome based approached to government.  The 12 priority areas 
and breaking down the silos that government worked in – where the left 
hand did not know what the right hand was doing.  So I think a lot of 
10 
stronger emphasis cam on co-ordination and a lot of it was perceived 
as more control than what it might necessarily have been. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Well you see I ask the question also in the context 
of Mr Thabethe’s evidence.  We know about the letter that you had 
written centralising the advice that departments – I beg your pardon it 
is really contracts that we would be signed by departments centralising 
that in – with the State Law Advisors who sat in the Premier’s Office. 
You call that letter that said all contracts should come 
through the State Law Advisors in the Premier’s Office? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think it was more that no department should enter 
20 
into contracts committing Government without at least clearing it with 
the State Law Advisors.  There was a lot of contracts that we had 
discovered that departments were entering into that was necessarily in 
the interest of Government in various departments. 
We also had the problem that come audit the Auditor-General 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 19 of 190 
 
would obtain from the State Law Advisors the database of cases which 
will indicate your liability.  When you compared that database to what 
departments were disclosing it was different stories.  So we try to say 
let everyone feed into one database. 
We tried to strengthen some of the departments who did not 
have adequate legal capacity.  Not all departments had properly fully 
fledged legal capacity internally.  As was the case with municipalities. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman, just for purposes of the record those 
letters are contained in Reference File B for Barry from pages 5-5-1 
through to 5-5-3 ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And there is one more at 5-4-9 that deals with this 
particular issue ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But I think that Ms Rockman has given us a general 
explanation that includes what happened in respect of these particular 
letters.  We – what of interest Ms Rockman in relation to this which we 
will again explore a little later is that when Mr Thabethe signed that 
agreement on the 5 t h of June he had not processed it through the State 
Law Advisors Office in the Premier’s Office.  That is correct? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And you are saying it was a directive but one that 
could be ignored?  I do not know. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Well it was ignored.  Whether it could have been 
ignored or should have been ignored is a different matter. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 20 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  But would – under the normal course would 
disciplinary steps be taken against an official who failed to comply with 
a directive from the Premier’s Office? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not easily.  Not at an HOD level because he would not 
have signed the contract without at least his MEC.  The responsible 
MEC knowing the – that he had entered into the contract.  If the MEC 
did not know that he had entered into the contract certainly the MEC 
would have taken action. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Or ought to have taken action? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ought to have, yes. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  We again will come back to that in a bit more detail 
because of course the State Law Advisors when they eventually did see 
this particular contract found that it was invalid and a new contract was 
drafted and signed on the 5 t h and 7 t h of July and that really became the 
operative contract? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But again coming back to what we really are talking 
about it is that relationship between the Premier’s Office and the 
powers that reside whether real or perceived in the Premier’s Office 
and from your particular perspective as the DG.  If there is anything in 
20 
that that South Africans need to be wary of or need to be careful about 
is really what I am exploring for purposes of recommendations that the 
Chairman might wish to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Going back to the – whether the directive was 
required to be complied with or could be not.  I would have thought that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 21 of 190 
 
it being a directive it was required to be complied with as opposed to if 
it was just a guideline. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think that is appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Then the next question again 
in relation to your functions in the – as DG in the Premier’s Office is 
the following; did you negotiate contracts on behalf of the Premier’s 
Office? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  If I can just fast forward for one second.  As MEC 
10 
Finance were you expected to negotiate contracts on behalf of the 
Premier’s Office or the Free State Government? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I ask this because I am trying to understand who 
would have had the competence to deal with that Estina contract and 
then thereafter with the FDC contracts but maybe for current purposes I 
should ask this question.  Once Exco has taken a resolution do HOD’s 
take instruction on how to implement that resolution or do HOD’s simply 
ask for guidance in the implementation of that resolution? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I would think that the HOD is responsible to implement 
20 
an Exco resolution within the confines of applicable laws.  Exco cannot 
say go buy 10 houses and an HOD sets off and randomly picks 10 
houses and buys them.  The procedures must still be followed.  So 
whatever Exco decides must be done within the prescripts if it is the 
PFMA it is the PFMA. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 22 of 190 
 
If it is preferential procurement framework all the applicable 
legislation must be followed.  There was a thing that we used to say an 
Exco decision does not constitute a procurement process. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That was the bottom line.  Regardless of what Exco 
had decided you still had to follow whatever process if you want to 
enter into whether it is a contract procurement does not matter what. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Staying with Exco did the subcommittees of Exco 
that existed have decision making powers and – that is the first 
question.  Maybe I should let you answer that. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  They would make recommendations.  That would be 
the 
clusters 
that 
you 
are 
referring 
to. 
 
They 
would 
make 
recommendations to Exco. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Did the Premier preside over any of those 
subcommittees of Exco? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not of the clusters.  He was chairing the Treasury 
Committee but the Treasury Committee is not part of the clusters.  
Treasury Committee is Treasury Committee.  It is a separate structure 
with terms of reference.  It was chaired by the Premier and the Deputy 
Chair was the relevant MEC Finance and then a few other MEC’s, HOD 
20 
Treasury and so forth. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I find that quite interesting.  So maybe you should 
just elaborate very briefly for us but then my picture really is a national 
picture.  I cannot see the President sitting in and chairing a Treasury 
Committee.  That is what the Minister is supposed to do and that is 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 23 of 190 
 
what the PFMA expects of the Minister. 
So if we transpose that illustration to the Provincial level I 
find it curious that the Premier would be chairing the Treasury 
Committee.  Maybe you just want to explain to us why that would have 
fitted with the provisions of the PFMA and any other legislative 
prescripts that are relevant. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is how the memorandum was brought to Exco to 
say we – that was when I was DG – my predecessor.  I presume that in 
the consultation with National Treasury remember at that stage Section 
100(A) had been implemented.  So this was the Treasury Committee set 
10 
up around somewhere in 2011. 
I think July/August 2011.  That is the – previously the terms 
of reference was not formalised.  It was then formalised like that but in 
practice the practical budget preparations and so forth was centred 
around Treasury Committee members but it was extended to be more 
consultative. 
We included for example some of the District Mayors, the 
Metro Mayor, other MEC’s, other HOD’s.  It became a broader task 
team than the few people that were in the terms of reference as the - 
the task team but the Premier – the former Premier practically seldom if 
20 
ever actually chaired a Treasury Committee Meeting. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So it was just that in terms of form he could attend? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But most of the time he in fact did not attend those 
meetings? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 24 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I am really trying to understand where the power lay 
in influencing decisions and this is why I ask you the question but I am 
satisfied that you are saying that in reality this particular premier 
hardly attended those particular meetings. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I notice also that as DG in the Premier’s Office and 
as MEC of Finance you held meetings with Mr Tony Gupta on a number 
of occasions between November 2012 and 2014.  Is my information 
correct? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think it starts – the engagement with the Gupta 
family and associates predates that by far.  It starts in July 2010 when 
the New Age made a presentation to the Executive Council to get 
support for advertisements.  So between 2010 to almost 2013 my 
engagements was mostly with Mr Ashok Narayan and Mr Nazeem Howa. 
 
In – I think – August 2011 I was on the way to an Exco meeting 
in Bethlehem.  It started the afternoon.  I was informed that I was to 
meet people from the New Age. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Who informed you that you were to meet them? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I was called by the Premier. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  Continue. 
MS ROCKMAN:  To say they were at the meeting.  They wanted to meet 
before the Exco started. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So I do not know who organised the logistics of the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 25 of 190 
 
meeting.  We were then – the purpose of that meeting turned out to be 
– they presented a proposal where we should enter into a subscription 
agreement to …(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  For the New Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:  For the New Age.  One of the Gupta brothers was 
present but unfortunately ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I cannot remember ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that sentence.  One of them 
was what? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  One of them was present at that meeting in 
…(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  One of the Gupta brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the Gupta brothers? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you cannot remember which one? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Cannot remember which one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  That was August 2011.  Then in May 2012 there was 
the first business breakfast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you move away from the August 2011.  
You say this was a Provincial Exco Committee? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 26 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was to be held in Bethlehem? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say you do not know who had arranged – had 
made arrangements for the logistics of the Exco ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Meeting? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No.  For them to be present in Bethlehem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  What you do not know is who had arranged or 
approved that they should be present? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was the Premier who called you and said you 
should meet with should meet with them before ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The meeting? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Because the engagement was between Exco and 
Dihlabeng Local Municipalities.  So it was not part of our Exco meeting.  
20 
It was also not strange for private people to show up at venues where 
we had Exco meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 27 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was nothing out of the ordinary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I ask you this question as you pause?  So this 
was a pitch by New Age to the Provincial Government not to various 
departments 
– 
individual 
departments 
within 
the 
Provincial 
Government? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The idea was that Office of the Premier would 
enter into the subscription agreement on behalf of all departments.  
Yes. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Was that something the Premier did quite often 
enter into particular contracts on behalf of every single department? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  At that time I think we were moving towards 
transversal contracts.  We for example used the media bulk buyer that 
would buy advertise – advert – advertising space in newspapers.  The 
coordination was just easier.  Instead of having 11 departments 
advertising posts in the same week in 11 – you know different 
newspapers. 
It was very haphazard.  So it seemed to be easier.  So yes.  
It was something that we were moving towards. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  So you were continuing to tell us this was really 
your first exposure to the Gupta family/Gupta entities.  You are going to 
continue and ...(intervenes), 
MS ROCKMAN:  With one of the ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Bring us through to ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 28 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  With one of the family itself. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I mean the others Mr Narayan and so forth I had met 
before.  It was ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  We will speak about Mr Narayan.  His name has 
been mentioned in this Commission.  We will come back to him in a 
minute.  Any other engagements with the Gupta family per se or Gupta 
related or associated entities that you can recall? 
MS ROCKMAN:  During May 2012 it was the first business breakfast.  
Those that were broadcast with – sponsored by I think it was Eskom at 
10 
the time, SABC and so forth.  The President addressed – the President 
attended – President Zuma. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Was this in Bloemfontein? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  It was in Bloemfontein. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  Continue. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was on the 17 t h of May 2012.  I think again more 
than one of the Gupta brothers was in attendance as well. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Again this was a function that was linked to the New 
Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  It was those New Age business breakfasts. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Business breakfasts ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That we have come to hear about? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Continue.  That is May 2012. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 29 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes and then December 2012 as you would remember 
it was the ANC National Conference.  So as I left the registration area I 
met them coming in.  Them again – some of the brothers.  They also 
came to register. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So it is not like – they were in the environment.  It was 
not like they were not known and not – no one ever engaged with them.  
They were there. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In relation to any visits you might have made to 
Saxonwold to the residence of the Gupta family. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Some  ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  What can you share with the Chairman in relation to 
that? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Some of the first meetings I only met with 
Mr Rajesh Gupta …(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  And that is Mr Tony – his also known as 
Tony Gupta? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you.  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I never had other – one on one meetings with the other 
20 
brothers.  There was a meeting around April 2013.  It was after I had 
left as DG when I was appointed as MEC Finance.  With my 
appointment we were already in the budget process.  My predecessor 
had delivered the budget speech. 
So we proceeded to deal with the budget by debates.  So that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 30 of 190 
 
was a really busy period.  We were owing – there was always 
outstanding debt of New Age that the Office of Premier was 
coordinating.  So the purpose of that meeting was to say okay what are 
the arrangements now that you are now no longer there. 
So it was just confirmation that whoever will be acting as the 
DG will continue doing whatever the Premier’s Office had been doing in 
any event and then obviously it was the outstanding payment to Vrede 
Dairy for the 2012/2013 financial year. 
ADV GCABASHE:  They raised that with you? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Who in particular – Mr Tony “Rajesh” Gupta raised 
that ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  With you? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  Continue. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Then there after – well obviously ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Oh, oh.  Sorry.  Can we just - just I thought you 
were going ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  To give us a little more information on the issues he 
was raising that payment.  What was the broad tenure of that 
discussion and you say that would have been in April 2013? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can you recall the broad tenure ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 31 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  That we owed ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Around the issues that were raised? 
MS ROCKMAN:  We had owed them money.  There was – I think the 
first year it was the 84 of which only 30 million had been paid.  So it 
was the balance of the first year’s payment and then it was obviously 
the financial implication for the 2013/2014 financial year. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Could you clarify whether in those discussions you 
were able to say to Mr Tony Gupta we have paid you 30 million.  This is 
our money that you are dispensing on a project that has been selected 
by us.  So the concept of owing money is a difficult concept to grapple 
10 
with. 
Unless they – he understood it differently or I have totally 
misunderstood the relationship between Estina as an implementing 
agent and the Free State Government/the Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe.  I am sorry. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do not forget the question that you have just 
put.  For me I thought before getting to that point.  I thought she was 
20 
still going to – she would first tell me about that meeting in Bethlehem 
when they wanted to – that is the Gupta family wanted the Provincial 
Government to subscribe to the New Age. 
So can I take you back there?  Tell me how that happened 
because that probably was the start of what followed in terms of the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 32 of 190 
 
New Age and so on and so on.  Maybe it was not but I would like to 
hear about that meeting. 
MS ROCKMAN:  By August 2011 the New Age had already existed.  We 
were 
already 
advertising 
in 
the 
New Age. 
 
So 
the 
support 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had not subscribed yet? 
MS ROCKMAN: 
 
But 
we 
had 
not 
concluded 
a 
subscription 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were just advertising ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On an ad hoc basis? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as far as you know had there been any formal 
request from the New Age or the Gupta family that you should advertise 
maybe a lot in their newspaper or was the position that each 
department was aware that there was a new newspaper around and 
they would advertise if they so choose but it was not co-ordinated? 
MS ROCKMAN:  The July 2010 presentation to Exco – Exco had 
20 
already agreed in principle to support the New Age. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is July 2011? 
MS ROCKMAN:  10 - 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2010? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 33 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So - so there had been a presentation 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is not the Bethlehem meeting.  Is that right? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, please.  I may have missed something. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me about that presentation. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  The July 2010 presentation the New Age came to 
present to the Executive Council ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  To say we are the New Age.  This is our approach.  We 
are the new kid on the block.  We want support from Government and 
Exco agreed in principle.  Yes.  We are going to support this new daily 
newspaper.  You should remember that in the Free State there is no 
other English daily newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Is that so? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So this was ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  This was something new, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the New Age was going to be the only daily 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  English daily newspaper. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 34 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  English newspaper? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other newspapers were weekly ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or and so on ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would those have been national newspapers or 
would those – were they provincial ones that were weekly? 
MS ROCKMAN:  There is a lot of provincial community newspapers 
...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That advert – ag – that publish on a weekly basis 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And then you have the Volksblad which is part of the 
Media24 Group ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But that is an Afrikaans ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Medium newspaper.  So ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Or – I think the mid-1980’s the Free State has not had 
an English daily newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So there was a particular niche market that the New 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 35 of 190 
 
Age would operate in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So at the 2010 presentation the Provincial 
Executive Council said – agreed in principle to support them? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without specifying details and without formalising any 
relationship? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  As and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage? 
MS ROCKMAN:  As and when for example we would place recruitment 
advertisements. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright. 
MS ROCKMAN:  We would ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Definitely also advertise in the New Age. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At that stage was there any discussion of how 
much they desired the Provincial Government to spend on the – on 
advertisements with them? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no discussion ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  About that? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was difficult to predict for example when you – how 
many posts you could advertise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  What posts became vacant when ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 36 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It is very difficult to quantify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So it was not formalised into a quantum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then after that various departments advertised in 
– in the New Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Coordinated through Office of the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the Premier? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Everyone would submit their posts ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  For example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  We would consolidate and send it through to the media 
bulk buyers.  They would place the advertisements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and in terms of payment how did it work?  Did 
you get invoiced after advertisement? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The normal standard procedure there had to be 
an order ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The invoices would come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 37 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think we worked on – a lot on interdepartmental 
claims. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Where Premier’s Office would pay and then we would 
claim back from ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Relevant departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next meeting was the 2011 August one 
in ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bethlehem. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The subscription agreement proposal was 
August 2011 in Bethlehem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just tell me more about the content of the 
discussion in relation to the Gupta family or the New Age delegation 
and the – and Exco at that meeting. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I was introduced – the Premier was not part of that 
discussion.  He had actually walked away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  Actually the Premier had said you must 
meet them before ...(intervenes). 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
actual 
meeting. 
 
Did 
you 
meet 
them 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the actual meeting? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 38 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was discussed at that ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  The ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Meeting. 
MS ROCKMAN:  They had a draft proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was almost in the format of an agreement.  It was on 
their letterhead only.  It did not have Provincial Government.  So it did 
not look like a contract that Provincial Government would enter into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was for a specific number of copies ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Of newspapers per day at whatever cover price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Whatever they required from us ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  For a certain period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  What I remember is it seemed that this was something 
that had been discussed prior or long before because the initial 
20 
agreement was dated February – it was somewhere around February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2011? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But it was clear that – look this is not going to happen 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 39 of 190 
 
because we did not make any budget provision.  So for this thing to be 
brought in it would be from the next financial year ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  To get ourselves in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So there was process of engagement ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  To formalise the agreement itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  We also utilised the State Law Advisors.  They 
10 
formalised the agreement ultimately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So the discussion between yourself and them 
before going to the meeting – the Exco meeting ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was they wanted the Provincial Government to sign a 
subscription agreement with them? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that would indicate how many newspapers per 
day and so on and so on ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be bought by the Provincial Government? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  As well as how do we – how would we control the 
distribution, the distribution points? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  How do you manage and monitor ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 40 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That process throughout the various ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Respective Government buildings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you have any recollection as to whether in 
that agreement there was a number of newspaper copies that they had 
already put in to say Provincial Government must agree to? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think it was about 4 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About? 
MS ROCKMAN:  If I remember correctly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was 4 000 ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 4 000 ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Per day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A – per day? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You might have no recollection of how much that 
would have cost at that time that can be checked? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  I can …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what was the outcome of your discussion with 
them before going to the Exco meeting? 
MS ROCKMAN:   It would have to be further pursued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 41 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:   Because for that quantum we would want something in 
return and our demand was always, find a way to accommodate young 
people in skills development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   So we wanted the – to offer certain – a number of 
students training or support through bursaries and so forth.  We would 
also have to follow some kind of procurement process as well.  Clearly 
you would not advertise a tender because who else is going to tender, 
you want specific newspapers.  So the procurement process in itself, 
would have been a deviation but that still had to be drafted it’s not like 
10 
it was ready and available.  It also became clear it was – this was a 
standard pitch made to many provinces, it was not only the Free State, 
other provinces were also considering various types of subscription 
agreements, they obviously varied according to the size and whatever 
requirements and demands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in terms of the outcome of the meeting you had 
with them, was there still going to be a need for them to make a 
presentation to the Exco meeting? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was going to be no need? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   No they were not invited to attend the Exco meeting 
itself it was only to have this discussion on the proposed subscription 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they had come to have a meeting, actually with 
you? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 42 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not with Exco? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay so no final agreement was reached all 
that was reached was that the matter would need to be pursued? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think we agreed in principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja agreed in principle but the details would have to 
follow later? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright thank you Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Thank you Chairman, just one or two issues arising 
10 
from your discussion with the Chairman, you indicated that the initial 
agreement that they showed you when you met them was dated 
February 2011? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes.   
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes but you don’t know who might have had 
discussions with them, that – which discussions would have informed 
that draft? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No. 
ADV GCABASHE:   You never did find out? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:   The second question relates to the comment you’ve 
just made about the procurement for that subscription. You said that 
that process would have been a deviation? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Explain that, why would it have been a deviation? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 43 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:   Because it would be impractical to get three 
quotations because you want a subscription agreement with a specific 
newspaper, we were not entering in – it was not a public call for anyone 
who wants to come to us, we have money to throw at newspaper 
subscriptions, it wasn’t that, it was a specific proposal based on a very 
specific niche market that’s where the English Daily newspaper comes 
in.  Free State would have a specific page all of those things would 
come – would still play – it would be in play so you wouldn’t get 
quotations for this specific subscription agreement.  There were 
sufficient grounds for us to deviate. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:   I’d like to just debate that with you for a minute.  
Would it not have been in the Free State Government’s interest to 
approach any other English Daily’s that do not have newspapers in the 
Free State and say to them, we’ve had a bid – I don’t know how this is 
done, I’ve never had to do this personally but essentially just to 
indicate that you’ve got a proposal and you’d like to get value for 
money – as much value for money as you can by looking at other 
competitors if they have an interest in the same product or service.  I 
don’t know if you’re understanding the question, was there no reason to 
look for anybody else and try and make sure that you were getting 
20 
value for money in relation to the product that New Age was selling to 
you? 
MS ROCKMAN:   There was no one else available, the last English 
Daily newspaper in the Free State closed down in the mid 80’s, it was 
called The Friend, I think, I speak under correction it might have been 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 44 of 190 
 
part of what, by then was Independent Media Group or – don’t know 
who owned it but there was no one else in this phase.  It’s not easy or 
cheap to open a newspaper, I think the fact that our community 
newspapers have not been able to make the transition, in terms of 
schedule to go from a weekly to a daily newspaper, it’s indicative it’s a 
very challenging industry.  It’s very cash intensive it needs a lot of 
capital outlay which is just simply beyond the capacity of what the 
average community newspaper would have. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So in effect you really did not really do the 
research, you didn’t go beyond the pitch that was made to you? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think we had done the research in respect of the 
rest of our media strategy, so we already knew. There was no one else 
who was going to offer to open a newspaper in the Free State – a Daily 
newspaper an English Daily newspaper in the Free State.  They were 
also not going to be Free State based but at least we would have a 
dedicated page of Free State news which would be significantly 
different than what any other English newspaper would be offering. 
ADV GCABASHE:   The essence of your answer is, you applied your 
mind to the possibilities and the probabilities and the practicalities.  
You looked at your SEM procedures and took a decision on the basis of 
20 
what you had before you? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s look at that again and maybe what I’m 
going to ask you has something to do with something that I’ve asked 
some of the witnesses when we deal – we talk about deviations from 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 45 of 190 
 
procurement.  What is it that the Provincial Government needed to buy 
an English newspaper for, why did you need to buy newspapers as a 
Provincial Government? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think the media environment, specifically needed for 
us to have an appropriate approach to provincial communications 
strategy.  It wasn’t only based on newspapers.  It had your electronic 
media, it had community radio stations, it was a much broader strategy.  
So getting access to an English Daily newspaper, strengthened our 
ability to communicate with communities beyond what was available in 
the space at the time.  Your community newspapers which was English 
10 
based, the volume they produced is obviously limited, their distribution 
area is also more limited.  Your Afrikaans Daily newspaper would be 
limited in the audience that you reach.  So there was a number of 
factors that informed this specific decision.  It was also not only on 
newspaper subscription, it was the New Age but we also had other 
agreements for other proposals like a special publication, for example 
with Mail & Guardian that was pursued.  There were other agreements 
with E-TV, with SABC, so it was – there was really a lot of elements to 
the overall communication strategy, it wasn’t that New Age was singled 
out above all other but it addressed a specific demand that we 
20 
identified within the environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I would think – I would have thought that when 
the New Age made an approach to the Provincial Government the 
Provincial Government would have take the attitude that, you know, 
these are business people, they want to do business with us, their 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 46 of 190 
 
business and – but we have to ask ourselves the question, why do we 
need it and who can give us the best value for the best price.  Now if 
you say here – you said they wanted you to subscribe to 4 000 – to 
buying 4 000 copies per day, is that the number that you ultimately 
agreed upon as far as you recall? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No I can’t recall ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was it in thousands? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was in thousands? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes it was. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think somebody would need to check what that cost 
at that time – at whatever price at that time but let’s stay with 4 000 for 
argument sake, that’s quite a lot of newspapers per day, that means 
over five days that’s 20 000, that’s quite a lot.  Now my understanding 
of what you were saying earlier on about advertisements is that there 
wouldn’t be, for Provincial Government, there would be too many 
advertisements, did I understand you correctly?  In other words there 
would be some advertisements, sometimes there would be no 
advertisements sometimes and certainly at some stage it was not 
coordinated as I understand, later on it may have been coordinated, is 
20 
that right? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   The advertisements was as and when required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so if you bought the – these newspaper copies, 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 47 of 190 
 
what was going to happen with them, were you going to distribute them 
among the staff in various departments? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes there was a number of distribution points, 
Provincial Government buildings, primarily as well as Mongu Metro, I 
can’t remember the details of all the distribution points but it was quite 
structured to say, this many goes to building A, building B, building C.  
We had people in the different buildings that would monitor proper 
distribution and obviously it would be free of charge for officials, 
general public, whoever walks in would take a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the arrangement, you mentioned about a page 
10 
in terms of the agreement with them that the Provincial Government 
ultimately had with them.  Was there a page that was dedicated for use 
by the Provincial Government? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes it was dedicated to Free State News it would not 
necessarily be only Provincial Government news, I mean if Provincial 
Government doesn’t have any news for a specific day they would fill the 
page with Free State news, whether it was sport, private sector, doesn’t 
matter what but it wasn’t unique to the Free State, most provinces had 
dedicated pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the New Age? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I’m trying to understand what it was used 
for.  Let’s talk about the Free State. What was the – why did the 
Provincial Government need a dedicated page for themselves? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Information about your government programmes, 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 48 of 190 
 
whether it was a specific project, operation Hlasela, whether it was 
human settlements whether it was transport month, public service 
month, audit outcomes, any news that’s generated by Provincial 
Government to strengthen government’s ability to communicate in a 
better way or to get more access to information.  If there was a slow 
period it would be other municipalities could contribute, universities, 
whatever, whatever was in the news or what is newsworthy for the Free 
State would be on our page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that insofar as it needed to be – insofar as it was 
information that needed to be known by government employees that 
10 
would have been easy for the government to do without a newspaper 
isn’t it, in terms of circulars and so on, is that not so?  Whenever 
there’s anything that government needs to convey to its employees I 
would imagine they would issue circulars and so on? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes it would not be your internal government type 
communication that would be sent to officials and obviously any 
newspaper relies on the fact that the person who buys or the person 
who takes the copy, he takes it home, there’s three, four, five other 
people who have access to it, who also read, it’s the same principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So other than that page, where the Provincial 
20 
Government may communicate certain things what other need was there 
for this subscription by the Provincial Government as you saw it? 
MS ROCKMAN:   It was general support. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Support to the Gupta family, the New Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:   To the New Age. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 49 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the New Age, okay. I don’t know if you want to 
take that further? 
ADV GCABASHE:   Not at this point Chairman simply because it’s 
quarter past eleven and tea time gives us the opportunity to reflect on 
some of these questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright let’s take the tea adjournment and we’ll 
resume at 11:30, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Gcabashe do you have any follow up 
questions on that issue? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman I just want to talk a little bit about that 
subscription agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Not necessarily follow up to the questions you were 
asking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But it is in relation to the same agreement – 
Subscription Agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  When was that Subscription Agreement eventually 
signed between the Department of – the Premier’s office and New Age, 
do you recall? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chairperson it would have been somewhere after that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 50 of 190 
 
meeting but before the start of the next financial year.  Before April 
2012.  I cannot remember the exact date.  I am sure we can establish 
it.  
ADV GCABASHE:  So it would have been before April 2012 in any 
event? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The budgeting process for that line item would have 
been put into which financial year? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It would – if it starts from April 2012/2013 it would be 
from that financial year starting 1 April 2012. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  So it would be in the 2012/2013 financial year? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Do you recall the term of that contract – how many 
years did you subscribe? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair that would be the standard term of contract 
three years. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Three? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So it was a three year – three year term.  Then the 
last question on that is were you aware of any other provincial 
20 
governments or State Entities or National Government Departments that 
had signed similar Subscription Agreements with the New Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chairperson at the time we were informed I think that 
the same type of proposal was made I think to KwaZulu-Natal and 
Mpumalanga.  Whether they had signed I am not aware and I do not 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 51 of 190 
 
know about national departments or SOE’s. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But as far as you were aware you were not the first 
to sign up for this particular service? 
MS ROCKMAN:  We were not the only ones which received the 
proposal.  I would not want to go as far as saying that we were not the 
first to sign up.   
ADV GCABASHE:   Can you just describe to me that page you say that 
the Free State government would have in the New Age Newspaper and 
really all I want to understand is whether the batch that would come to 
the Free State would have a Free State page in it.  The batch that 
10 
would go to KZN would have a similar page but it would be KZN page or 
would you find various provincial pages if I might call them that in the 
batch that arrived at the Free State? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair I would speculate but I – if I remember correctly 
it was – each newspaper had a page per province.  You would not print 
a Free State version – a separate KwaZulu-Natal version, a separate 
Mpumalanga it would – it would drive up costs enormously.  So if I can 
remember correctly it was – there was one edition with pages per 
province. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I see your counsel is nodding his head.  He seems 
20 
to know a lot about this.   
MS ROCKMAN:  I would not know. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Let us ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  I can safely say this is not something we had 
consulted on. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 52 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  No I know because it is – that is fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But I –...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  But let us go into ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying there would be one page in each issue 
of the New Age on a particular day on every day? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that one page would be used by all provinces 
who – which had – which may have had a Subscription Agreement with 
the New Age?  In other words if KZN had something it would go to the 
same page.  If the Free State had something it would be the same page 
10 
that would be used.  Is that what you are saying as you understand – 
you understood the position? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair I – our news would go to the Free State page.  
KwaZulu-Natal’s news would go to KZN page but all in one newspaper.  
But New Age also had team of journalists – full time journalists in the 
province.  They had offices in the Free State.  So those journalists – 
the stories they did was also on that page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I thought what you were saying earlier on was it 
would have driven the cost too high if the New Age were to have a page 
for each province with which they had a Subscription Agreement.  Did I 
20 
misunderstand you? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The newspaper – say it has 16 pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And there are 9 provinces. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 53 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Maybe some provinces had half a page others had a 
full page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But you would not get 9 different editions of one 
newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that I understand. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the same edition would there be a page dedicated 
10 
to a particular province or is the position that there was one page 
which was shared by the different provinces which had Subscription 
Agreements with the New Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I am not sure how the level to the details of the 
Subscription – how the Subscription Agreement links to the page 
specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But provision was made for each province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  To have a dedicated page at least.  Half a page/page. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So on your understanding if today’s edition of the 
New Age had 20 pages there would only be like page 3 or 4 that is for 
the Free State province? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 54 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would that be another page for example the KZN 
province? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how you understood it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying that that page would be used for 
each province or provincial government to put in whatever message it 
10 
wanted to convey to the population or whatever story or it wanted to 
convey but apart from that journalists of the New Age would also put in 
their own stories in relation to the province on the same page? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the page was not dedicated to the provincial 
government exclusively.  In other words it was not going to be filled 
with what the provincial government decided should go into that page 
only.  It would be what the provincial government puts in but there 
would be something that the newspaper itself decides to put in? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be two – both? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS ROCKMAN:  It was definitely broader than provincial government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was broader than it. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 55 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Sometimes municipalities ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Would also ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Generate content or have something that they wanted 
covered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And like I say New Age journalists themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MS ROCKMAN:  They were obviously not limited to that page. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  They would – appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They could write on other – ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  If it was newsworthy enough it would compete with the 
front page, second page, and third page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Whatever the priority would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The advertisements that the provincial government 
20 
would have for jobs, DG or whatever – there is a vacancy would they go 
into that page or would they – could they be put elsewhere in other 
pages?  In other words did this dedicated page mean that your adverts 
would also go into that page and not anywhere else? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think that was the layout and design decision.  I do 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 56 of 190 
 
not think we – we had covered that in any way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  As a preference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It might or it might not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Now did the provincial government in 
terms of the Subscription Agreement pay any particular amount for this 
page as opposed to the obligation to buy 4000 or whatever the number 
was of copies per day? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was – ja the expenditure to New Age was as and 
when we advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And the Subscription Agreement was a Subscription 
Agreement.  We did not pay additional amounts for that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So basically you paid for the copies 4000 or 
whatever the number was per day and in return you got a page that you 
could use for whatever you wanted to write or advertise? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when I say advertise I accept that you are 
not sure whether you could advertise on other pages or not? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And you said that the justification for 
the Subscription Agreement was basically to give support to the New 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 57 of 190 
 
Age?  Is that right? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  As a new entrant in the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was a new voice.  It was speaking to a niche market 
that no one else covered in the Free State being the only English daily 
newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  
ADV GCABASHE:  I had asked you about the term of the contract.  You 
10 
said it was a three year subscription contract? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Was it renewed? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  There was a function shift around 2015 where 
certain of the transversal communication matters, it related to the 
public information platform and the Subscription Agreement was moved 
from office of the Premier to Provincial Treasury.  It was a function shift 
and accordingly the budget also shifted. So the – after the expiry of the 
first Subscription Agreement a second Subscription Agreement was 
entered into between Treasury and New Age and that one was also the 
20 
same three year period.  Then in 2017/2018 there was an instruction 
note of National Treasury on cost containment measures which 
addressed really a broad range of issues.   
Anything from entertainment, telephone data costs, included in 
that cost containment measure was then the measure that says 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 58 of 190 
 
subscriptions to newspapers or other publications should – when they 
run out they should not be renewed and we implemented that.  So early 
2018 I think around March 2018 when that Subscription Agreement 
came to an end that was the end of the relationship.  We did not renew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that was end of 2018? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  March 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  March 2018? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not when it closed down?  I mean the New 
Age? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think it was before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was it soon thereafter? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was before it closed down.  I know we made a final 
payment to the liquidators.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  If I can remember one of the spreadsheets that I saw.  
It was a few months before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The New Age closed down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and ...(intervenes). 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman it actually closed down in June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In June? 
ADV GCABASHE:  2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and it may be that – I am trying to remember 
whether we have been told as to when the Gupta family fled from South 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 59 of 190 
 
Africa.  I cannot remember whether in the – in Mr Ajay Gupta’s 
Application for Leave to cross-examine anybody whether he dealt with 
that but we know that they did flee from South Africa.   
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes but can I ask this question?  The paper was 
called Afro Voice from about 2017 when Mr Manye took over and 
rebranded the New Age.  Would the old Subscription Agreement have 
carried over to that new company if I might call it that or do you recall 
if the Subscription Agreement would have terminated by that time? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I cannot recall. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You cannot recall? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  I would – no I would have to go back Chair and look at 
that but I cannot recall anything about that.  Although I know Mr Manye 
himself also made a presentation to the Executive Council after he had 
taken over the New Age same principle of requesting support and so 
forth. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm.   
MS ROCKMAN:  But I cannot remember the technicalities around 
whether the Subscription Agreement had continued or I am sorry I 
cannot remember. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But again it would now be Provincial Treasury that 
20 
would have been in charge of. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Taking a decision. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  On whether to subscribe or not to Afro Voice. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 60 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You cannot recall whether you did or did not? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But what you do recall is that you were asked in 
terms of that cost containment directive to cut all the excess. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Things you were doing and one of them was the 
buying of newspapers? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. It was not only newspapers it was newspapers 
and publications.  I mean departments subscribe to magazines 
10 
professional industry type magazines so you would really have to 
review – do you really need everything?  Do you need the quantity of 
newspapers that you may be subscribing to?  It was a quite extensive 
cost containment measure.  It is instruction note 3 of 2017/2018. 
ADV GCABASHE:  A related questions is the following:  You had the 
Subscription Agreement in place for two terms.  During that period did 
you continue to advertise and pay separately for any advertisement 
space that you were taking in the New Age paper? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair I am sure that is the – that would have been the 
arrangement.  Yes. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Again on that ad-hoc basis that you described 
earlier? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would advertising in the New Age even if it was 
advertising most of the Provincial Governments in the New Age – why 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 61 of 190 
 
would that not have been enough support to the New Age?  Why did you 
have to go to the extent of subscribing to – I know that I am using the 
figure 4000 but you said you are not sure. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was in 2000’s.  Why did it – did the Provincial 
Government have to subscribe to buying every day thousands of copies 
of this newspaper? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair I think I would speculate but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you were the DG of the province at the time, is it 
not?  So you cannot be speculating. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  The advertisement would only – it would be limited 
support. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but that would be ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was not predictable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that would be the support you can give.  I mean 
obviously as a Judge my background is that of a lawyer.  When I left 
practice a lot of us as black lawyers wanted support from government 
but we did not expect anything other than that if and when there is work 
to be – that needs a lawyer then we would be considered.  We did not 
even think of – we did not even ask to be guaranteed just that we would 
20 
be considered.  So in other words you have work to be done, you need 
a lawyer therefore you give support to categories of people that might 
deserve special support.  So I do not understand why it was necessary 
to go beyond just saying okay the way we can support you is consider 
you may be considering – consider giving you more adverts than – even 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 62 of 190 
 
most adverts compared to others if that is justified.  But to say we will 
subscribe to thousands of copies per day seems to me to be on the 
excessive side.  I may be missing something and you must help me if I 
am missing something. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja I think Chair if you go back to the context of that 
time.  I can remember clearly out of ANC Lekgotla’s, out of government 
Lekgotla’s and I am talking about both province and national.  
Government’s ability to communicate was extracted as a specific area 
of concern.   
So it is not randomly that we decided in the Free State this is 
10 
the way to go.  There was a bigger picture that informed that.  I do not 
deal with this in any of the affidavits and I am certainly able to go back 
and extract those kind of documentation.   
I think as an entrant – as a new entrant to the market we know 
the existing media ownership was skewed to a specific group.  I think it 
was a very particular argument to say let us do something to promote 
the diversification of media ownership.  I think it should also be seen in 
that context.   
It is a – I mentioned it before it is a highly cost driven industry.  
So you would not expect any media house to simply cover their costs 
20 
through advertisements if they do not have some other kind of support 
that they can rely on.  And in this case it was government providing 
focused support whether it is through a Subscription Agreement, 
whether it is through advertisements to a specific new player in the 
market.   
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 63 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well l think we have heard evidence of how much was 
spent by the Provincial Government or maybe the Premier’s office on 
the New Age at a certain time.  We did have that evidence and Mr 
Manye did deal with it but I think – ja we did have that evidence.  I 
cannot remember the amounts that were involved.  But I mean if one is 
talking of 4000 and again I accept that that is the figure that you are 
sure about.  If it was – if the New Age a copy was R10.00 that would be 
R40 000.00 a day – five days that would be R200 000.00 in five weeks 
that would be a million.  Then one can go on if it was not R10.00 it was 
R5.00 it would be half of that.  But I have this impression that it seems 
10 
excessive but I think you have said what you are able to say about that.  
But if there is something you want to add you know feel free to add. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair I have so many documents that to extract it 
might be – might take some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well you can always ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  But certainly I think the – I agree with you the 
evidence was already in the Commission.  I think almost it came from 
the GCIS presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. It did ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  They did outline. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The expenditure.  I think per province, national 
departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And provincial departments. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 64 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did ja.  Okay thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Then just to tidy up this part 
of our discussion.  You said one of the returns that you indicated to the 
New Age was that they should develop young people.  There should be 
a skills transfer. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Did this take place to your knowledge? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I know in the time that I was still DG there was a 
10 
recruitment process so a number of young people were nominated and 
they had gone to like interviews, skills test type of thing.  After I had 
then left I do not know what happened to that part of the program. But 
certainly they started or they started to participate in a possible 
recruitment training type of program. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Would there be a record somewhere of the 
achievement of that particular objective? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I am not sure whether there would be.  We would 
nominate and we being broadly it could be anyone that forward names.  
New Age would invite them.  They would do the skills test.  See who 
20 
they wanted to develop – who they could develop in terms of potential 
whatever.  But I do not know that there was ever any formal feedback 
process. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Even in relation to your media strategy and the work 
around that is there no line items someone or reports somewhere 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 65 of 190 
 
whether it is in the annual performance plans of the particular 
department that is either the Premier’s office or later on the Provincial 
Treasury where you are saying we achieved this objective. These are 
the numbers of students that were able to participate in this particular 
program. Alternatively in the SOPA addresses because I know that as a 
matter of course politicians like to say, this is what we actually worked 
for and achieved and this is the kind of report I have in mind. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair it may or may not have been.  I just do not have 
that information available at this stage. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Okay.  Can I then come back to your meeting with 
10 
Mr Tony Gupta?  One of the things you said he asked about was 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Gcabashe I just do not want to forget 
this.  Will somebody not check if nobody has checked the exact number 
of copies that – of the New Age that the Provincial Government agreed 
to buy every day number 1. 
 
Number 2 will somebody not check how – what percentage of 
what the New Age sold of the newspapers they sold in the Free State 
was the amount that was bought by government in terms of the 
Prescription – no was this a situation where for all intents and 
20 
purposes only the Provincial Government was buying their newspapers.  
That is what I am looking for and hardly anybody bought it or what the 
position was and that be given to me or to the hearing at some stage in 
the future. 
ADV GCABASHE:  We will do that Chairman. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 66 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  We are back at the meeting with Mr Tony Gupta and 
one of the things you said that he was concerned about – this is my 
paraphrasing of what you said about continuity.  Because you were now 
moving from being DG of the Premier’s office in the Premier’s office to 
MEC.  The question is:  Why would he be concerned about an item that 
had been budgeted for?  Was the province not paying timeously? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Do I understand you correctly as referring to the 
outstanding debt for the newspaper? 
ADV GCABASHE:  For the newspaper. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes that is what I am talking about. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Sorry I did not make that clear. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair at that stage because we used the media 
bulk buying agency the office of the Premier would pay the bulk buying 
agency who would in turn pay all the relevant newspapers.  There 
developed a problem with the media bulk buying agency both between 
the partners and in terms of reconciliation of payments between what 
we paid to them and what they paid to respective newspapers.  So 
20 
there was a stage where New Age and a number of others were saying 
we are not paid and we were saying but we have paid.  We cannot 
double pay.  We cannot pay the media bulk agency plus pay you then.  
So it was quite a technical process of reconciliation until we were able 
to resolve it.  But it was ultimately resolved and in addition let me be 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 67 of 190 
 
honest between January and March of any given financial year you 
would find it very difficult to get 30 day payments out of most Provincial 
Government departments.  Most service providers are now equipped to 
know that in their planning they must know there – everyone is made to 
survive in that period but no-one or very few would actually be paid in 
full because by then cash runs out.  That is the reality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is one of the things I have never understood with 
government.  They say they support small business – businesses and 
so on, small businesses are very important for the economy.  But they 
just do not pay them on time and I think various Presidents of the 
10 
country over the years have made all kinds of promises that this would 
be fixed but one continues to hear that it is not done.  A lot of 
businesses get – go under because government is not paying them. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS 
ROCKMAN: 
 
It 
is 
a 
problem 
that 
bedevils 
Government 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But it is about cash management ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  And in your last quarter you protect salaries – cash for 
salaries so that you do not overspend.  Inevitably you run up your 
accruals and payables.  I think in the period 2011/2012 to 2017/2018 
the Free State accruals doubled from – 2011/2012 I think it was about 
1.3 billion.  By 2017/2018 it stood at 2.6 billion. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 68 of 190 
 
That is money really owed to people for services rendered, 
goods rendered.  That at year end closed they had not been paid but it 
was – it – expenditure was …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just so unacceptable.  It is just so unacceptable.  
You know small business who – of people who are trying to do the best 
they can.  They are asked to do a certain job.  They do the jobs and 
then they are not paid for months on end and it is just so unacceptable.  
Ms Gcabashe you may proceed. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I – thank ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that it is one of those things that I think the 
10 
problem is that public service have a problem about supervising that 
people do the job that they are employed to do and that they do it on 
time and they do it properly.  For me it is a simple thing. 
Do not ask a small business person or anybody to do a job 
unless you know you would pay them on time.  You may be protecting 
salaries for – I mean public servants protect their own salaries but they 
forget about the salaries of people who are employed by these business 
people and these people complain, complain, complain and nothing 
happens and that is a Government that says it cares about poor people. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Well ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman we are here talking about Mr Tony Gupta 
complaining about the 84 million ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That they were expecting to receive from the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 69 of 190 
 
Provincial Government or from the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development but before we deal with that in detail I just wanted clarity.  
So one of the discussions with Mr Tony Gupta at the time concerned 
payment to the New Age? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Good.  So let us come back to the monies that were 
due on the Estina agreement and my question at the time was really a 
reflection of how the – and it is my understanding of the contract was 
that this is a contract.  Government is the principal requester of 
services. 
10 
Estina has been employed as the implementing agent.  Estina 
has already been given R30 million to start certain processes.  In 
April of 2013 which is when this meeting took place you have 
Mr Tony Gupta saying to you, you guys owe us money.  You have not 
given us the 84 million that is outstanding. 
So my question was did you engage him just in discussion on 
two things?  One; that it cannot be an owing of money because they 
were at the end of the day implementing services that Government had 
requested.  That is one.  Second, when you really look at when that 
contract came into effect it would have been on the 7 t h of July. 
20 
The 12 month period to – for – that would trigger the payment 
of the full 114 had not been reached yet.  So why was he concerned.  I 
just want to know if you discussed this and if you did what the tenure of 
those discussions might have been. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think we did not discuss it in – at that level that you 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 70 of 190 
 
would be discussing or you are referring to.  It was mostly a discussion 
Chair that this is how the contract was structured.  We must pay X 
amount per financial year.  It did not come into 12 months from this 
month to that month.  It was per financial year. 
The first 30 million was supposed to go for X, Y and Z.  
Whether it was land acquisition, whether it was feasibility studies this 
that this that.  What we had discussed more was there was a report 
from Provincial Treasury.  One of our budget officers had visited the 
farm in January 2013 and he had raised a number of issues and he had 
photos. 
10 
I think it is somewhere in the supporting documents.  That 
report is there. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Is that the Asset Management Unit Report? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think it is the – it was the budget office.  It is the 
Myburgh Report.  It is saying. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was in the Sustainable Resource Management Unit. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So a number of issues were raised and the HOD at the 
time – HOD Treasury of the time had also raised concerns to say look 
20 
when this project started this is what we said should be done.  The 
contracts needed to be reviewed.  We wanted X, Y, Z.  By January it 
seemed that some of the documentation was not provided to Treasury. 
 
By April – by the time we were going to meet it seemed that 
events had overtaken the January concerns.  So I was saying to 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 71 of 190 
 
Mr Gupta that – to Tony Gupta that regardless of whether there is a 
payment now.  In April the new budget is – firstly it is loaded on the 
system. 
You do not just open the system on the 2 n d of April and 
everyone starts merrily paying people.  It does not work that way.  It 
takes time to upload the budget on the system.  Then we wait for cash.  
It is not like National Treasury is either going to dump cash on us on 
the 1 s t or 2 n d of April.  It is as and when money becomes available. 
So depending on what cash we have available is how we will 
process the payments but more importantly is Treasury is going to do 
10 
its own site visit because there is a lot of noise in this space.  So we 
want to make sure that what you had said is going to be done in the 
first phase or the first year or the first payment. 
We need to compare that with what is actually on the ground 
and that is what informed the May 2013 site visit which I went with the 
whole merry gang of Provincial Treasury and whoever else wanted to be 
present was there.  They did not have a problem at all with the site 
visit.  They were quite comfortable to say things are in order. 
There is work in progress on site.  We have planted – we 
have done this that the other.  The animals are being bought, delivered 
20 
so forth. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Let us take a step back.  You were aware that 30 
million had already been paid to Estina? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Had you seen an accounting for the use of that 30 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 72 of 190 
 
million? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It would be difficult for me now Chair to say when did I 
see that accounting because I know I knew about the Myburgh Report 
after I had become MEC ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  In March, but I had not seen that report and that report 
was not necessarily an accounting report.  It was also type of a site 
visit report.  So I do not think by April I had seen an – a report 
accounting for the funds. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In fact the Myburgh Report criticised the Project 
10 
Managers, the implementing agent for their lack of progress.  My 
colleague is just trying to find that particular document but they 
certainly made various points where they distinctly identified the lack of 
value for money for what had already been disbursed as one of the key 
areas that Treasury would have to look at but we will come back to that 
particular document as soon as we find it but I do – I know exactly 
which document you are talking about and which particular visit and 
those were their conclusions. 
My question really is in your discussions with Mr Gupta was 
there an obligation that rested on you – that oversight obligation to say 
20 
to him.  Show me even if it is in document form what you say you have 
done with the first 30 million that we have given to you as an advance 
payment and then we can properly assess whether the 84 is due now or 
at a later stage. 
I would have thought that that is the type of discussion you – 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 73 of 190 
 
because you are trying to bargain and buy time knowing you do not 
have those funds in your account and I would have thought that would 
be the type of discussion you would be having with him. 
MS ROCKMAN:  No not ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Oh. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not at that technical level, no. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I also say that there is a bit of a dispute around 
what that first 30 million was intended to do?  On Estina’s version that 
30 million they took 29 million of that and sent it out of the country.  
Ostensibly they were reserving parlour milking machinery.  Then 
10 
eventually the last one million that was left they also reserved for other 
purposes. 
Mr Thabethe’s view of what ought to have happened with the 
first 30 million was that it ought to have paid for the feasibility study, 
for the EIA Study, for the planning that needed to be done etcetera.  So 
there is a bit of a disjuncture between Estina and Mr Thabethe with 
regard to what that first 30 million ought to have been doing. 
Hence my interest in whether you had a discussion with him 
about why they were asking for more money when they had hardly 
finished Phase 1 which the 30 million was supposed to take care of on 
20 
Mr Thabethe’s version.  I do not know if you are aware of that 
disjuncture between what Estina thought the money – they could do 
with the first 30 million and what Mr Thabethe believed they were 
supposed to have done with the first 30 million. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Thanks Chair.  We are stuck with what is presented to 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 74 of 190 
 
Treasury by Agriculture Rural Development.  We had no relationship 
with Estina.  So whatever happened between Estina and Agriculture is 
between them.  Mr Thabethe was the Accounting Officer.  He had to be 
comfortable that conditions had been met. 
The accounting treatment was in order.  Ours was more a 
cash management and the oversight and the oversight part.  So we 
would not necessarily know those levels of details.  What was that 30 
million for except for what Agriculture put in front of Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is what they put in front of Treasury in 
accordance with what Ms Gcabashe has just stated as having been 
10 
Mr Thabethe’s evidence? 
MS ROCKMAN:  From – Chair from what I could construct out of the 
correspondence at the time because this was now before I become MEC 
in March 2013.  What Advocate Gcabashe has put on record to say it 
was supposed to pay for feasibility study, environmental impact this 
that this that, that is in Treasury’s records that is what is reflected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And that would be correct because there is a letter 
dated the 18 t h of January 2013 signed by Mr Thabethe which says these 
– Phase 1, these were the milestones they have been achieved.  
20 
Therefore we are asking you to release further funds ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  To this particular implementing agent? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But can we move beyond that to some of the other 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 75 of 190 
 
meetings that you had with Mr Gupta and the essential question 
because we are really interested in Estina is whether any other 
meetings you held with him where the purpose of the meeting was to 
discuss matters relating to Estina and the Vrede Dairy Farm of course? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think in between there were numerous other TNA 
Breakfasts running into people here there but focus discussions on this 
– Estina there was a specific discussion after it was – there were quite 
a number of media reports about cows dying on the farm.  I think this 
was somewhere in 2014 – early 2014 and we raised specific concerns 
to say you know you cannot be spending this amount of money and we 
10 
have cows – in the media it says cows are dying on the farm. 
Then we were provided by Agriculture by ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Before you go there.  Who did you have those 
discussions with?  Who did you express those concerns to? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Firstly Mr Thabethe himself ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And then there was a meeting with Mr Tony Gupta and 
Ashok Narayan was present where we said look this is just not on. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And would these meetings have taken place at 5 
Saxonwold? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  That one specifically, yes.  The February 2014 around 
there.  I am not sure about exact dates Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Then we were provided with that email correspondence 
from the SPCA that said they had done an on-site inspection.  There 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 76 of 190 
 
are no causes for concern.  That is two completely different sets of 
information you get that in the one hand the media is reporting cows 
are dying. 
On the other hand here is an email from the SPCA saying 
there is no cause for concern.  You do not see it – you did not really 
know which version do you believe.  Are these even our cows that are 
busy dying all over the project?  I can up to today not say to you yes it 
was our cows. 
No, it was not our cows because it seemed there is also a 
difference of opinion whether the cows were probably branded.  It did 
10 
not seem – now I am talking about information we got to know after the 
Public Protector’s Report initially came out.  This is much later than at 
the start of the project. 
That it appeared that the cows were never properly branded 
or tagged when they first arrived.  Those that seemed to have been 
bought and delivered.  So it was – there was a lot of inconsistencies 
uncertainties which we also later picked up in audit when there was a 
reluctance from the department to disclose the assets as part of work in 
progress in the asset records. 
That we deal with extensively in the audit and accounting 
20 
treatment part.  So it was clear that we had a feeling things were not 
going that well but after the May 2013 site visit at that time it seemed 
that the project had started.  Fields had been planted with I presume 
maize or whatever it is that cows had. 
I am not an agricultural person.  The first infrastructure

developments had started.  It looked like a project in progress.  There 
was nothing alarming in May 2013 that said we need to stop.  We need 
to reassess.  It seemed that things were as it should be with a project 
as it begins to be implemented. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So you are here still explaining some of the 
meetings you held with Mr Tony Gupta ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And you say that would have been one of the more 
critical meetings you held with him to discuss what was going on at the 
farm? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And that meeting you held before you went on a site 
visit – you personally went on a site visit? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  It was March 2013 and then the last reference I 
made this is around February 2014.  That is about a year later.  Then in 
between – around – I think it was September 2013 there was also a 
request that we assist a student from India who had interest in 
enrolling for a Master’s Degree at University of the Free State but it 
was completely unrelated to Estina and that was just a matter of – we 
handed it over to the Department of Health to say please advise but I 
20 
do not think it went anywhere because the student had not qualified 
already. 
He was still said to qualify.  Then he would have had to go 
through the processes of writing the medical board examination and so 
forth and so forth.  It was a long process but that was just a request.  It 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 78 of 190 
 
was not linked to any other thing. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Some of the other meetings – I have a list of 
roughly about 14 meetings.  Oh no, 20 meetings that my colleague has 
noted for us.  That you are said to have attended and my real interest 
is in the Estina/Vrede connection.  The ones you have told us about 
those meetings are the only ones you can recall attending with 
Tony Gupta that dealt with the Vrede Dairy Project? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think there were subsequently in April 2014 there 
was also a meeting, same story, start of a new financial year and so 
forth until the termination of the decision to terminate.  I think there 
10 
were quite a number of meetings that was planned that never took 
place.  There were two or three meetings which was cancelled at a very 
last minute. 
To the extent that I had already arrived at Saxonwold.  I was 
dropped by my protectors and I was told sorry something came up.  The 
meeting is not happening and we had to – and we would leave again.  
So there was quite a number of – a few of them, two/three of those type 
of meetings, a number of others would have been planned. 
It did not happen.  Either I was not available or he was not 
available or someone got sick something like that. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Did the Premier know that you were meeting with 
Mr Tony Gupta? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I am ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  I really – you know the difficulty is in part you were 
meeting with him as DG in the Premier’s Office.  So it is really that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 79 of 190 
 
reporting line.  Would he know that you were doing so? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  On the other hand as an MEC you were meeting with 
Mr Tony Gupta.  Again just the reporting – I am just trying to 
understand the reporting structures or relationships and just how 
informed the Premier would have been about what was going on right or 
wrong with one of his mega projects. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Well as DG he would have known about the TNA – 
those meetings.  He would have known.  As MEC I am sure he would 
have known but we never attended a meeting together ...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  With Mr Gupta or Mr Zwane and the Premier. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Did you attend any meeting with Mr Gupta and 
Mr Peter Thabethe? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not that I can remember. 
ADV GCABASHE: 
 
Would 
you 
have 
attended 
a 
meeting 
with 
Mr Tony Gupta and Ms Seipati Dlamini, the CFO? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The other persons who are reputed to have been at 
those meetings, not all of them some of them, are a Mr Ashu Chawla of 
20 
Sahara Computers.  Do you know about him?  Who he is? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Did you have a meeting with him? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So no.  Not Chawla.  Chawla - C-H-A-W-L-A 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 80 of 190 
 
Chairman.  Then the other one is Mr Evan Tak.  Tak spelt T-A-K.  Is 
also reputed – also of Sahara Computers.  Also reputed to have 
attended meetings. 
MS ROCKMAN:  No Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  It would appear those meetings might have had 
something to do with computers.  That the Premier’s Office is again 
reputed to have bought from Sunday Trading (Pty) Ltd which is one of 
the associated companies of Sahara Computer.  You do not know 
anything about those meetings? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not about meetings.  I know that when I was DG office 
10 
of the Premier did buy laptops.  I think – I cannot remember the 
purpose for it.  At one stage it was for – it was either intervention unit 
or community development workers.  The others would – may have 
been laptops for students but I do not have those details but I did not 
have meetings with those – the names you have mentioned.  No Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  What about Mr Kamal Vasram?  Would you have had 
meetings with him?  He remember was the Sole Director of Estina when 
the agreements with DARD were signed. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chairperson I may have met him but I have no 
recollection of ever meeting – being in a meeting discussing Estina with 
20 
him. 
ADV GCABASHE:  He is also or was also a Director of the same 
Sunday Trading (Pty) Ltd which is why we had an interest in finding out 
what his relationship in that case would have been with you.  You have 
no clue at all? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 81 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Never met him? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No recollection, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is your recollection of the number of 
meetings that you had with Mr Gupta in relation to Estina or Vrede 
Farm? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I would imagine Chair around four or five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around four or five? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja over the period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What was the venue or were the venues of 
10 
those meetings?  If you can remember. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Some were at Sahara Computers.  Some were at 
Saxonwold.  Some were – either Bloemfontein that would have been not 
the directly related to Estina ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But mostly between those two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So is my understanding correct that those that 
related to Estina or Vrede Farm either happened at the – in their 
company.  That is the Gupta company, Sahara, or in their home? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Johannesburg? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes, 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had to travel from the Free State to 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 82 of 190 
 
Johannesburg for that purpose? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Mostly we tried to have the meetings if I was already 
in Gauteng for any other business.  Whether it was meetings – any 
other kinds of meetings that I would be already here.  It would not be a 
specific trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was not a situation where arrangements were 
made for you to come for that meeting only? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No.  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but from what you say it looks like they never 
held meetings in your office about Estina? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  We had no direct relationship as Treasury with Estina.  
So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The engagement in the offices would have been with 
Agriculture Rural Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but why would they discuss Estina anyway with 
you 
then 
instead 
of 
discussing 
with 
the 
Rural 
Development 
Department? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Purely from having the funding available in terms of 
the budget. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I ask you about the 20 – November 2010 Diwali 
Celebration that was held by the Guptas?  Were you invited to that?  So 
it would have been in November 2010. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I do not think I was invited, no but I did not attend 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 83 of 190 
 
either Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You do not recall ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Attending a Diwali ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Celebration in November 2010?  Then the next one 
is the Gupta family wedding at Sun City in 2013.  Were you invited to 
that wedding? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I was invited but I did not attend. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But you did not attend? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can you just – if you are able to assist the 
Chairman in understanding whether all HOD’s or all MEC’s would be 
invited to a function of that nature or whether specific people would be 
targeted as invited guests?  In other words why did you get lucky and 
get an invitation?  I do not know if you can answer the question. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair I wonder, the wedding invitation I took it as one 
of those courtesy type of invitation, you know you invite people to 
certain events because you work with the but you don’t really expect 
them to turn up.  I took it that it’s that type of invitation it’s not like it’s 
20 
compulsory to actually go, you decide to go or you don’t go, I decided 
not to go but I can’t say there was a strategy to say invite this one, that 
one, the other one, I don’t know what informed, who got invited and 
who didn’t. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Do you know if any of your other colleagues who 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 84 of 190 
 
were invited and who did attend? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think MEC Zwane at the time was invited, I think 
HOD Thabethe was invited, I’m sure the Premier was invited, I’m not 
sure about the others. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And do you know if they attended? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I’m under the impression that MEC Zwane and Mr 
Thabethe might have attended I doubt whether the Premier has 
attended I have no recollection but I don’t think he attended. 
ADV GCABASHE:   You know what we have found interesting is that 
that wedding was hosted between the 28 t h and the 30 t h of April 2013.  
10 
You visited Saxonwold to discuss the payment of outstanding monies 
with Mr Gupta in April of 2013.  Payment was made in three tranches, 
payment of the R84 million that was outstanding was made in three 
tranches, on the 18 t h of April 2013, on the 26 t h of April 2013 and the 3 r d 
of May 2013 and of course speculation out there and certainly from 
some of our witnesses, is that this money was not used for Estina/The 
Vrede Dairy Project, it was used for the wedding.  Did you have any 
idea as to what these monies that you were paying in April and in May 
would be used for? 
MS ROCKMAN:   We would only know what agriculture had presented 
20 
to Treasury in terms of the submission.  The three payments would be – 
would have been made in accordance to how cash was available.  They 
would obviously have preferred probably one payment for the whole 
amount and we would have said to them, it depends.  As and when cash 
becomes available that is how we can pay but we would not go into 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 85 of 190 
 
overdraft this early in a financial year to enable a payment to be made 
but we would be limited to what agriculture tells us, to say they need X 
amount, they must pay for A, B, C, D, E, we would not have had any 
other information. 
ADV GCABASHE:   That’s a fair comment because we are in the 
process of taking Mr Thabethe through the monthly and quarterly 
reports of Estina on the Vrede Dairy Project and I’m sure the Chairman 
will be pursuing some of these questions with him because he had a 
look at what they reported on.  Can we briefly deal with Mr Ashok 
Narayan?  Now you met him long before he became economic advisor 
10 
to the Premier. 
MS ROCKMAN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:   You would have met him what 2010/2011? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I would imagine around 2010. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And at that time who was he representing in 
relation to the matters you were discussing? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I had always associated him with the New Age. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Do you at any point associate him with Estina? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think I did yes and it’s fair to say that that was the 
inference it was not only – when I started knowing him, in was in 
20 
relation to our dealings with the New Age but as it started evolving into 
the Mahoma Mobung strategy and so on, I also realised that he was 
assisting Mr Thabethe in some way.  I’m not able to say by when but 
yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Now the appointment of Mr Narayan took effect on 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 86 of 190 
 
the 1 s t of March 2012, there’s a letter signed by the Premier to that 
effect.  Your engagements with him, not just on New Age but also on 
Estina would have preceded the 1 s t of March? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I don’t think on Estina. 
ADV GCABASHE:   One of the issues that really arises in relation to Mr 
Narayan is that he appears to have been wearing both an Estina hat 
and an economic advisor to the Premier hat when he dealt with matters 
relating to the dairy farm. Would that have been your observation as 
well, just reflecting back on your engagements with him? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Because I had known him from before the time of his 
10 
appointment to the Advisory Council and I hear you say there was a 
letter from the Premier of a certain date.  That council was announced 
during the budget vote speech of the Premier. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Date? 
MS ROCKMAN:   It was slightly after – it’s not the 1 s t of March but it 
was in March 2012, I do address it somewhere in the affidavit. 
ADV GCABASHE:   There’s a 16 t h of February 2012 SOPA address that 
I think that that might be the one that you’re referring – no it must have 
been after that because I know as a fact that his appointment took 
effect on the 1 s t of March 2012. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   The advisory council was, Chair, announced during 
the budget vote speech of Premier on the 29 t h of March 2012. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Excellent, that helps.  Mr Narayan accompanied Mr 
Thabethe to India.  There is a memorandum that he submitted to the 
Premier requesting leave to go – Mr Thabethe wrote to the Premier 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 87 of 190 
 
requesting leave to go to India and Mr Narayan was going to 
accompany him.  Because at that time you were still DG in the 
Premier’s office, were you aware of that submission? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No Chair I wasn’t. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So not all submissions from HOD’s to the Premier 
would have come past your desk? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No, unless they wanted the DG to recommend 
something to the Premier, they could write directly to the Premier. 
ADV GCABASHE:   In that motivation which, Chairman for record 
purposes, you will find at HH reference bundle D for Donald at page 
10 
1323. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 13? 
ADV GCABASHE:   23 – Estina reference 1323.  A couple of issues 
arose in relation to this submission and I really ask for your view from 
you because you worked in the Premier’s office at the time.  The first 
thing the Chairman took up with Mr Thabethe was what was reflected in 
paragraph 2.1, so I don’t know if you can find – I can read this to you 
otherwise if you want to find reference bundle D and it will be 1323 but 
essentially what – I want it to be convenient to you, what would you 
prefer to do? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   I would rather listen, you can read please, thanks. 
ADV GCABASHE:   What’s written here at 2.1 is the following: 
“Provincial Treasury received the final preliminary 
allocation letter from National Treasury on the 12 t h of 
December 2011.  An amount of R1 million in 2012/2013 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 88 of 190 
 
R.837 million, that’s R8 073 000, I presume we were 
battling a bit with those numbers but we can take it, it’s 
R8 073 000 in 2013/2014 and R8 073 000 in 2014/2015 
has been allocated, additional to your baseline to cover 
carry through costs on improvement in conditions of 
service”, 
 
And it’s that last line that’s important.  To cover – carry 
through costs on improvement in conditions of service and the question 
from the Chairman at the time was what would this have to do with the 
motivation to go to India.  The response if I recall correctly was, oh we 
10 
were able to dip into those funds, they were available, they weren’t 
necessarily firewalled for these carry through costs but these were 
funds that would be available.  I must say I didn’t quite understand the 
answer but I knew that I would have a former DG coming to give 
evidence and in that capacity I don’t know if you are able to explain 
what this might have been about?  You would understand baseline to 
carry through costs. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes Chair the improvement of conditions of service, 
you know it’s a salary adjusted related issue.  Now you would imagine 
that in your projections have 10 staff members you’re going to need X 
20 
amount more depending on how improvement of conditions of service is 
implemented.  So if you lose two staff members a year you don’t 
replace them, there’s a technical saving.  So that would be the way to 
say we have funding available that we can shift to accommodate other 
expenditure.  If you did not lose staff members during a year or you 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 89 of 190 
 
increased staff members it would be very difficult to tap into that 
funding. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So this really is an indication that there was money 
allocated for conditions of service, salaries or whatever that might – 
what other things might be entailed under conditions of service but 
these funds were lying fallow – they were not being used and could 
therefore be shifted in an adjustment or readjustment budget process.  
Is that the essence of what this might have been about? 
MS ROCKMAN:   It could be but you also need to look at the phrasing 
it’s – National Treasury says specifically it’s added to your base line for 
10 
your carry through effect.  So once you start tampering with that money 
it might mess you up in future so it might be better to leave the money 
as ring-fenced because presumably you needed this additional funding 
to maintain your current staff compliment at that time but it does 
happen.  Departments tap into compensation of employee funds 
because you can move the funding out of COE but you can’t move 
money into COE.  So in order to technically balance your books you 
often tap into your COE funding. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Then …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Ms Gcabashe can you go back to explaining 
20 
that conditions of – improvement of conditions of service issue again, 
paragraph 2.1 of that memo from Mr Thabethe to the Premier says, 
“Provincial Treasury received the final preliminary 
allocation letter from the National Treasury on the 12 t h 
of December, an  amount of – here is that R100 000 000 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 90 of 190 
 
that was written, I think we were told we should read it 
as R1 million in 2012/2013 and …(indistinct) R3 million, 
I mean R100 000, R8 073 000 in 2013/2014 and 
R8 073 000 in 2014 has been allocated to your baseline 
to cover carry through costs on improvement in 
conditions of service” 
 
Just give me that explanation again if you …(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:   That’s paragraph 2.1. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair it’s very difficult to find the relevance of 
paragraph 2.1 in the rest of the motivation, it just makes reference to – 
10 
there was a preliminary allocation letter from National Treasury 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that was my concern, that I didn’t see what the 
relevance of improvement of terms and conditions of service was. 
MS ROCKMAN:   The next paragraph talks to the issue of identify dairy 
farming and so forth and then the allocated budget of R17 million for 
completion of three dairy plans.  It does not say they have the funding 
to – I think it’s a presumption probably, that what they were trying to 
suggest is that they have funding available to undertake this trip but 
that’s not the strict and the narrow interpretation of the letter would not 
20 
suggest that.  It does not actually say where are they getting this 
funding from …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   The money from. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and yet it was supposed to be a letter to do 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 91 of 190 
 
exactly that, isn’t it, to provide motivation? 
MS ROCKMAN:   The Premier at the time would approve the principle 
of the trip, he would not necessarily approve the expenditure part of 
the trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   They would know whether they have the money or do 
not have the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   But this first paragraph is a bit misplaced in this 
letter, I also struggled to see the relevance of it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and of course what is strange is that all three 
signed it without anybody – it’s as if they knew what this was about, we 
don’t know what it was about. 
MS ROCKMAN:   There’s no other comments or notations made, so – 
it’s just signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Thank you Chairman.  Then of course you note at 
paragraph 4.1 we’ve got Mr Ashok Narayan undertaking the trip with Mr 
Thabethe and the issue that arose in relation to that was whether it was 
correct/prudent for a department to pay for a third party, who did not 
20 
work for government to undertake a trip to – a trip of this nature.  In 
essence the department was paying for Mr Narayan to go to India and 
the questions that were asked of Mr Thabethe was, is this regular, the 
man is not employed by the Free State government, he is not yet 
appointed as the Economic Advisor, why is it that you would spend 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 92 of 190 
 
departmental money on a stranger.  I don’t know if you can just clarify 
what might have been the position in this instance, especially because 
you ended up working with Mr Narayan in the Premier’s office, once he 
was appointed? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair I would presume that Mr Narayan was going to 
accompany Mr Thabethe in his capacity as a member of the Economic 
Advisory Council, whether – I note your point that this three dates, 
you’ve mentioned the letter signed by the Premier but it has happened 
that third parties or other parties not employed by government that 
their expenditure has been paid to participate in international visits.  
10 
ADV GCABASHE:   What’s the justification for that? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Exposure, empowerment you can – it would depend on 
the purpose of a specific visit to be undertaken, I don’t know what was 
the specific purpose of this visit. 
ADV GCABASHE:  This visit was to go and find a strategic partner in 
India and Mr Thabethe had done a desk top study and identified Paras 
and decided he wanted to go and talk to them.  He had not selected 
them but he wanted to talk to them about the possibility of becoming a 
strategic partner, so that’s the one fact.  The second fact is that Mr 
Zwane has submitted an affidavit to the Commission in which he takes 
20 
responsibility for suggesting that Mr Narayan, in particular accompany 
Mr Thabethe, reason being, says Mr Zwane they were to deal with 
protocol issues, foreign culture issues etcetera, etcetera so it was as a 
convenience to Mr Thabethe but the question remains, are these 
justifiable reasons for using tax payers money to pay for somebody 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 93 of 190 
 
who, from his own profile – Mr Narayan’s profile is quite capable of 
paying for himself to go to India and come back to South Africa. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair I think it would depend on whether he wanted – 
he had his own agenda to pursue in India, if he was only going on 
request of Provincial Government then it might have been reasonable to 
presume Provincial Government would pay for him.  If he had his own 
interests that he was going to pursue he should certainly have paid his 
own expenditure. 
ADV GCABASHE:   There’s a matter I’m going to be taking up with you 
later relating to the Municipal Manager of Phumelela Local Municipality, 
10 
Mr Moremi but part of that discussion I want to extract now and use 
now because Mr Moremi says that when the Indian delegation arrived at 
Vrede to speak with him, one of the members of that Indian delegation, 
representing Estina was Mr Narayan.  So we here have Mr Narayan, the 
same Ashok Narayan, representing Estina in discussions with the 
Phumelela Municipality, we have the same Mr Narayan being paid for 
by government to accompany Mr Thabethe to India.  The question must 
arise, which does he wear and how do you determine which hat he is 
wearing at any particular point in time?   I don’t know if you can throw 
light on this question? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   No Chair it would be difficult to make such a crisp 
distinction. For all intents and purposes he was announced as a 
member of that Economic Advisory Council so the expectation was that, 
that is the capacity he would act in.  It would be very challenging to 
manage interests if we also then say but he was representing Estina.  I 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 94 of 190 
 
cannot remember at that time that he was said to be representing 
Estina.  I was not part of meetings in Phumelela so I would not have 
that perspective that Mr Moremi would have. 
ADV GCABASHE:   No in fact that is Mr Moremi’s evidence that, Mr 
Narayan indicated – and even in the negotiations themselves indicated 
that he was representing Estina in those negotiations but that’s fine 
because it’s not a matter, as you say, that you can take very much 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your reaction to Mr Thabethe’s evidence, if I 
recall correctly that Mr Narayan was needed for protocol purposes to 
10 
assist with protocol, are you able to understand that? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair it’s difficult, I don’t know if Mr Narayan had any 
specific protocol training but certainly he would understand the 
language. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   He would understand the culture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   But apart from that I would not be able to comment 
what else he could have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja something that I maybe should have raised with 
20 
Mr Thabethe but he’s coming back.  South Africa would have an 
embassy in India I would imagine, I think it does have an embassy, 
there would be an ambassador there, I don’t know if there would also 
be Consul Generals in different cities and so on and one would have 
thought that one of the things an Ambassador has to try and understand 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 95 of 190 
 
is the culture of the people in the country where he or she serves and 
the people that he or she has in the embassy, the staff and people who 
assist him or her would include, maybe advisors and people who 
understand the culture when one would think that, then if Mr Thabethe 
needed somebody who would advise him on those things the embassy 
in India would have been – the South African embassy would have been 
best placed to provide him with somebody without incurring the 
expenses of travelling to India.  Is that something you are able to 
comment on? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair yes I think India has a – we have a High 
10 
Commission in India if I’m not mistaken, we are all part of the Common 
Wealth so it’s High Commission …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is the difference in terminology, not just 
terminology the substance is the same as an Ambassador? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, so there would be capacity in the High 
Commission to take care of whatever protocol requirements, logistical 
arrangements and so forth that would be available.  I would not know 
specific dynamics that required this unless it is – I’m just not able to 
comment further on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:   When did you first hear about this company called 
Paras, so would it have been before the Exco decision of the 13 t h of 
June 2013, that’s an easy defining point, would it have been during the 
Mahoma Mobung discussion, you know which really would have started 
around November – September 2011, so I’m just giving you a timeframe 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 96 of 190 
 
that might assist? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think it must have been around – Chairperson I think 
around 
June 
2012, 
ja 
the 
Exco 
submission 
was 
June 
2012 
…(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:   On the 13 t h of June 2012? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So you heard about Paras before that or at that 
meeting? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I can’t remember having heard of Paras before that 
meeting.  Before that meeting it was Vrede Dairy, I don’t now that it 
10 
was presented as – with that level of details now talking about Estina 
and Paras and there were quite a number of names that later came in.  
I think it was only after we got the copy of the agreement that had been 
signed before that Exco date, that we had seen, okay there’s now a 
number of other entities that is involved. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Would you know anything at all about the 
relationship between Estina and Paras? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No Chair, sorry nothing. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Did you have any meetings with anybody from 
Paras? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   No, no Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Did you come across payments that had to be made 
specifically to Paras for services rendered to Estina or in relation to the 
dairy farm? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No Chair. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 97 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  So the only people who would have talked to you 
about money really and Estina – rather money and the Vrede Dairy 
Farm would have been Mr Tony Gupta, as we’ve already discussed? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, in terms of budget. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Not of expenditure and who they had sub-contracted, 
no there was not that level of discussion. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Correct, we will of course come a little later to the 
Free State Development Corporation but I think that’s a matter we’ll 
raise with you just after lunch.  Chairman I notice it’s just about 1 
10 
o’clock I’m now moving actually to the regulatory framework and just so 
that you know where we’re moving to now, I’ll be putting the testimony 
of Mr Jankielsohn to you and we’ll really be talking about that R114 
million, how – what provision was made for it, that’s the area we’re now 
going to move into after lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes We’ll take the lunch adjournment but maybe Ms 
Rockman, I can just mention this so that maybe during the lunch break 
you can reflect on it and see whether later on you might be able to 
enlighten me on.  When I read your affidavit I got the impression that 
you may have been trying to stay away from accusing anybody of not 
20 
doing the right things, of not following procedures that were supposed 
to be followed and that all you wanted to do is just give us certain 
information that you can back-up with documents, whether it’s a 
resolution or the passing of a bill, adjustment bill or appropriation bill 
or whatever.  What I was expecting from your affidavit statement was 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 98 of 190 
 
something along the lines that, having set out what the role of 
provincial treasury is, then to say in regard to Estina, here is what was 
supposed to happen, it was done, here is what was supposed to happen 
it wasn’t done and deal with it in that way.  I seem to struggle to find 
that, so you might be able later on to enlighten me but that’s what I was 
expecting I found that a lot of it was really saying this is the framework, 
that’s the framework but without connecting it to say, let’s look at 
whether certain things in regard to Estina were done with full 
compliance with the requirements and/or with certain procedures.  So I 
just want you to know that that’s a concern I have about you – one of 
10 
the concerns I have about your statement and later on you could 
enlighten me on it.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment and 
well resume at 14:00, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us continue. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Ms Rockman we are now 
going to just try and understand whether Section 38.2 of the PFMA was 
complied with by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 
20 
and if not what steps were taken by Provincial Treasury to deal with 
this irregularity?  It may not just be Provincial Treasury you may want 
to indicate other institutions within the Regulatory framework that are 
supposed to monitor and correct non-compliance. So are you ready? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 99 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  The focal provisions that relate to your oversight 
functions are found in if I am not wrong Chapter 3.  Yes Chapter 3 of 
the PFMA.  I do not know if you do not really need the Act but I can 
take you to it if you think you might want to use it.  Are you alright 
without it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  It is in the Legislative bundle under tab 3. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But shall we just continue?  You will tell me if you 
want to actually pull ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The Act out.  At of course Section 17 and 18 deal 
with your powers and functions both as MEC and what you are able to 
delegate to others.  The other important provision we are going to deal 
with – so I think the most important thing really about Section 17 let us 
just pause here for a minute.  Is 17.2 which says; 
“The MEC for Finance as the Head of a Provincial 
Treasury takes the policy and other decisions of the 
Treasury except those decisions taken as a result of a 
delegation or instruction in terms of Section 20.” 
20 
 
You are the Head of the Provincial Treasury.  That is the most 
important thing about Section 17.  Am I correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes as the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you mean she was. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 100 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Well yes.  In your capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  At the time.  In your capacity yes Chairman. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But not at – sorry – Chair not at the time. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In 2013 as of April 2013. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Let us be very specific. 
MS ROCKMAN:  As of March 2013 but not as of June 2012. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Absolutely.  June 2012 you were still in the 
Premier’s office. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That is correct.  And in fact that is part of the 
difficulty because I tend you ask you questions that speak to 2012 
whereas quite frankly they are questions that relate to 2013.  So 
whenever I do that just bring us back to the correct timeframe and 
simply say I will relate to what happened in 2013 when I was MEC for 
Finance.  Then that will then contextualise properly your answer. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course you may ask her some questions when 
she was not MEC of Finance if you want information that could be 
20 
expected of – that she could be expected to know because of her 
experience as both DG of the Province and MEC Finance. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Indeed so Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of procedures and so on.  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Absolutely. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 101 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then she can throw light on the basis of what she 
knows even if she was not occupying the particular position. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I think it is useful to contextualise this round of 
evidence by just reminding you about what Mr Jankielsohn said.  He 
essentially said and it was not only about you it was about the Premier 
and other members of Exco that in your capacity as members of Exco 
and he names you MEC of Finance as well in that grouping that you 
were one of the individuals who was and I quote: 
10 
“Pertinently aware of the issues and problems relating 
to Estina and in spite of that allowed substantial 
payments to be made towards this project while being 
pertinently aware of these issues.” 
That is the one comment.  He goes on and I really paraphrase 
his other comments.  He goes on to intimate that you were aware of the 
skewed allocation of shares to Estina and that fact that Estina never 
contributed any of its own funds. 
 
He also points out that the contract was drafted in the office of 
the Premier.  Last he goes on to say and I have not taken everything 
20 
out of his transcript verbatim but this is the last section that I would 
like to add.  He also says that you were aware that there were no 
beneficiaries in this project.  
 
And I suppose this is an important point because the 
conditional grant allocations relevant here the CASP allocation and to 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 102 of 190 
 
the extent that it was used the Ilima Letsema allocation that Ms Elder 
Mtshiza testified about at this Commission would have been processed 
through the Provincial Treasury.   
 
If I might just add to this list of indicators that Mr Jankielsohn 
placed on record is that you were a member of Exco when the FDC, the 
Free State Development Corporation, was appointed to take over from 
Estina.   
 
Now Mr Jankielsohn noted that substantial funds were paid to 
FDC and its agent …(indistinct). So when we look at these comments 
they really give context to the questions that are going to follow.  And 
10 
there are comments made to you in your capacity as MEC for Finance. 
 
The first comment really relates to how aware you were of the 
issues that bedevilled this particular contract.  I do not know if you 
want to very briefly touch on that know that you are still going to come 
back to dealing specifically with the R104 million that had to be found 
for each year for Estina.  What is your response to Mr Jankielsohn? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Thank you Chair.  I think in my initial communication 
with the Commission I also indicated that I think Mr Jankielsohn was 
relying on a National Treasury investigation report with a certain date 
which he appears to have knowledge of which we never had a copy of.  
20 
And I indicated in the subsequent financial years the audit reports of 
each and every one of those financial years.  The Auditor-General 
reflected that that investigation had not been concluded.  So I do not 
know what else Mr Jankielsohn was relying on. 
 
Certainly ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 103 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I interrogate just that first portion. 
MS ROCKMAN:    Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Are you saying that you did not have sight of that 
report at any point in time?  It is actually a report that is dated 
February 2014.  There are some versions that dated 2013 that is an 
incorrect date.  The correct date is February 2014.  That is the first 
fact.   
 
The second one that I really want you to respond to is when 
the Public Protector made enquiries about this matter the Premier 
responded and gave a response that indicated that he was aware of the 
10 
report and had read the report which is why he was able to respond to 
it. 
 
Would you not have been in his office at that point in time or 
would you not have been aware of that report having being sent to the 
Premier? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Thank you Chair.  If the report is somewhere in 2013 
what I remember is that the Provincial Account and General at the time 
Ms Fourie was giving evidence.  I think it was around October 2013 she 
made us aware that she was requested to meet with the investigators 
appointed by National Treasury.  So certainly at the time by then the 
20 
investigation was still in progress.  The HOD Treasury later requested 
information from Agriculture Fishery and Forest – Fisheries and 
Forestry about the progress of the investigation.  Because National 
Treasury never communicated with us directly.   
ADV GCABASHE:  Who is us? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 104 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Provincial Treasury. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you. 
MS ROCKMAN:  This is now after I had become the MEC Finance.  
They never communicated with us as Provincial Treasury on any aspect 
of the investigation asking us for information, asking us for assistance, 
they 
communicated 
directly 
with 
the 
Provincial 
Department 
of 
Agriculture.  So we were left in the dark.   
 
Equally when whether it was a preliminary report or a final 
report was issues National Treasury never asked us for comments on 
the report.  They never asked us for input.  The report was never 
10 
referred by the Premier to Provincial Treasury either. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Was it not discussed at Exco at all? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was never tabled in Exco for any form of discussion.  
Neither was the investigation or a draft report by the Public Protector.  
It was not referred to Provincial Treasury.  It was never tabled in the 
Executive Council. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I ask you to pause again?  Would it have been 
quite regular for the Premier to have discussed this particular report 
with Exco at one of the Exco meetings? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It is difficult to say.  Some reports on forensic 
20 
investigations some were presented, some were not presented.  If it 
was a report on I could remember specific municipalities that was 
placed under administration.  Those type of reports would mostly or 
generally it would go to Exco and be presented.  But the others on 
specific matters it might not be.   
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 105 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  The fact that the Public Protector got involved in 
this particular matter again would not necessarily mean that it would 
come before Exco in any form? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No it would not. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I ask these questions because I know you would 
have been DG at the time but there was quite a bit of irregular 
conduct/expenditure in that period spanning 2011/2012 that the Free 
State government was aware of.  It was brought to the attention of the 
relevant parties.  Or am I wrong? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair if you are referring to – I think the one big 
10 
problem that the Free State has or had was the 23 roads project that 
was around 2009/2010. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And then around 20 ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Just elaborate for the Chairman what that particular 
project would have been about? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was a project initiated by the Department of Police 
Roads Transport where we either rebuilt or upgraded 23 roads 
simultaneously.  It was pretty much a similar problem at that time as 
ultimately Vrede Dairy.  It was not fully budgeted for.  So the project 
20 
started, budget was or funding was committed and when it came to 
payment obviously we ran into trouble.  Then a year later it was the 
advance payment to material suppliers.  It was …(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Material suppliers to which project? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Human Settlement sorry.  To Human Settlement. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 106 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Human Settlement. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Department of Human Settlement yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In what amount?  What were the amounts involved 
there? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No.  I cannot remember the exact amount. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Roughly. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But it was substantial because it was the Human 
Settlements grant – conditional grant funding that we were at risk of 
losing.  I think it was close to R1 billion probably.  It was a substantial 
amount of money.  That led to cabinet invoking Section 100A of the 
10 
Constitution.  Is that December 2011 I think?  Because the Minister of 
Finance then issued a directive to the Premier January 2012 and if I am 
correct indicating that certain measures had to be taken to ensure that 
the Provincial Government comply with standard provisions of the 
PFMA that certain performance audits had to be undertaken in 
departments I think it included Police, Roads, Transport, Human 
Settlements and Education.  There was quite a number of issues that 
the Minister covered in that directive. 
ADV GCABASHE: Yes.  So those were the two large areas where there 
were irregularities and National Government then put the Free State 
20 
Government on terms and asked you to essentially monitor what was 
going on and correct what was going on? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct.  It was not only the Free State at the 
time.  It was the Section 100 1A interventions was Free State and 
Gauteng Health I think and Limpopo was 100B. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 107 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  You mention these in your supplementary 
affidavit. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes, yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So Chairman you will find the reference to the fact 
that there was this directive made in terms of Section 100 1A of the 
Constitution that impacted on the Free State.  And this is why I ask the 
question and what worries me about the fact that the irregularities 
seem to recur.  You had been put on terms as the Free State 
Government here we have got yet another project.  It might not be as 
large as the R1 billion project but it is a substantial project in its own 
10 
right, the Estina Project.  And again you have irregularities that occur I 
would put that to you because again Section 38 2 was not complied 
with.  And this is what Mr Jankielsohn is in effect saying that you were 
aware that there were problems but did nothing about it.   
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair if you could clarify?  We were aware of the 
broader problems around the issues of budget not being fully secured 
before a project commences.  Yes indeed.  Whether we were aware of 
the operational details of the Vrede Dairy Project that is not something 
Treasury would have been aware of.   
We did the oversight visit in May 2013 I indicated it seemed 
20 
like a project that has commenced.  Various aspects were in progress.  
It is not Treasury’s responsibility to monitor the day to day running of 
projects.  You would imagine when we deal with transfer payments we 
transfer hundreds of millions every year to non-profit organisations.    
 
We do not go out as Treasury and monitor whether each and 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 108 of 190 
 
every one of those ECD’s for example Early Childhood Development 
Centres whether they exist.  We simply do not have the capacity.   
So the monitoring and evaluation responsibility remains that of 
the Contracting Department and the Contracting Department was 
Agriculture.  By signing off on each and every invoice they signed off, 
they confirmed goods and services rendered.  They have complied with 
all provisions to the PFMA. 
The Executive Council functions as a collective leadership. 
There is no super power except maybe the Premier. There is no MEC 
that is individually going to stand up and say, we have a problem with 
10 
this project let us stop it or go outside the Executive Council that 
consistently approved and supported the project.  And then say, no we 
are acting on our own. 
I remember clearly the project as presented in June 2012.  The 
MEC Finance at the time was in the meeting.  I am quite convinced the 
HOD was in the meeting.  They did not object to the approving the 
memorandum at the time.  They would not go afterwards and say, we 
now object to the project.  They would not act outside the collective.   
ADV GCABASHE:  You see I really want to just tease this out a little 
more because I have now found that Myburgh document that we were 
20 
talking about before lunch. And I also have I think it is your ER102 and 
I think ER103 that is from your original bundle and that will be bundle 
C.  103 is also a further report I think by Mr Moses regarding that visit.  
Now if you will recall really the bad press around the Vrede Dairy 
Project really only emerged in early 2013. All was quiet in 2012. It is 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 109 of 190 
 
with that media report and with Treasury and its investigation that 
people started asking questions and that would have been in 2013.  You 
would agree with that?  I call it the – yes the – l want – let me call it 
the “bad press” in inverted commas around what was happening at the 
project.  You then followed on in March with your own visit in 2013 as 
well. 
MS ROCKMAN:  In May. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In May I beg your pardon. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But in January 2013, Mr Myburgh and here he is 
10 
part of the budget management directorate that is your ER102 at page 
1220. So that would be at Volume C of your original affidavit. I am 
going to wait for you to find it.  Your original affidavit. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You have got three volumes to it.  A, B and C. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Hm 
ADV GCABASHE:  HH13.  It should be on the table.  So Volume C of 
that is what you are looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at the spine.   
ADV GCABASHE:  HH13.  Volume C and that is page 1220 is where the 
20 
letter starts.  I am really just going to go straight through to the 
findings which are on page 1221 in January 2013.  
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes I am there.  Thanks. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I also confirm that Mr Myburgh sat in Provincial 
Treasury? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 110 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes although I was not there at the time but I can 
confirm he was there. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  In Provincial Treasury? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Absolutely you arrived much later.  And he says 
here that: 
1. The land on which the project is to be developed 
belongs to the municipality and they are currently 
still valid leased contract to other commercial 
farmers in the area.  The contract will only expire in 
10 
August 2014 and no progress was made to buy out 
these 
contracts. 
 
The 
project 
managers 
can 
therefore not do any developments on the land until 
such time that the issue is resolved. We have had 
corroboration 
of 
this 
particular 
fact 
in 
other 
evidence that we have put to Mr Thabethe.   
2. A total area of about 151 hectares have however 
been planted with maize and beans.  These crops 
will be cut and used as silage (feed) for the cows 
when they arrive.  So that you would call progress. 
20 
3. Some money was spent on the purchasing of 
tractors 
and 
implements. 
 
Two 
tractors 
were 
purchased with implements for them to work on the 
farm.  That you would tick off as progress. 
4. No permission is granted up to date by the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 111 of 190 
 
Municipality for the project managers to start drilling 
for water (boreholes) in the area where the actual 
dairy (milking parlour etcetera) will be established 
problem.  Now water, no farm. 
5. The dam wall close to this area is on the verge of 
collapsing but repairs cannot be made without 
permission from the municipality.  Problem. 
6. Some ground work was done only to the extent of 
levelling 
a 
piece 
of 
land 
where 
the 
actual 
construction 
of 
the 
silage 
storage 
facility 
is 
10 
supposed to be constructed.  Work has however 
come to a standstill and no actual work is being 
done as we speak.  Problem. 
7. Rough estimates would be that an amount of 
approximately 6 to 7 million could actually be 
verified as expenditure on the project.  This would 
include the abovementioned progress as well as 
salaries for staff currently employed on the farm.” 
Now this is a report that speaks to the situation at the farm in 
January 2013.  And I bear in mind that in April already Mr Gupta is 
20 
asking where the rest of the R84 million is.   
 
These are the types of facts that Mr Jankielsohn drew on.  I 
am not saying this report just the types of facts that he used to inform 
his view that you were aware that there were problems.  You as in the 
collective you but did nothing or very little about it.   
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 112 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  I am not able to comment on how this report was 
processed at the time internally in Treasury.  What I do know is in April 
when the department approached us with the request for payment – for 
further payments I had a discussion with the former HOD of Treasury, 
Mr Kgomongwe at the time who did raise queries – issues around the 
January report.   
 
We then established find from Agriculture certain documents 
had been produced.  I think they had forwarded the feasibility study, 
whatever other requirements that was agreed to in June 2012 the prior 
year.  It was subsequently submitted.  But then we had agreed to do a 
10 
further over – further sight visit to establish in May now what was 
actually happening on the farm.   
 
So that was – but we were sufficiently comfortable that most of 
the January concerns by then had been addressed to some extent or 
was in the process of being addressed that it was not necessary to take 
any other actions at that point in time. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Now the report you speak of – the May report would 
that be the one that was authored by Mr I J Moses? The date here is 
the 22 n d of May 2013?  Does that sound familiar?  It is ER103 the very 
next document in that file. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  No I am sorry on – in which file are you? 
ADV GCABASHE:  File C. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Your original affidavit.  This is an annexure to that.  
So the one we have just been reading from was 102 that was the one 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 113 of 190 
 
Myburgh had presented.  And the very next one is 103 – ER103 the 
page number is 1226 and it is titled Preliminary Financial Report on 
Mohama Mobung and in brackets (Vrede Project).   
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair no there is a different report.  I think it was 
drafted by Mr Leboni that directly speaks to the site visit. This was a 
different financial report.  The site visit report of Mr Leboni did not 
cover all aspects of finances.  This is an additional report. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But this is one that you have annexed to your 
papers and it is one that says:  
“The purpose of this preliminary report is to provide the 
10 
Honourable 
MEC 
for 
Finance 
with 
the 
following 
information regarding Vrede Dairy Project.  Project 
background, cost and finding – funding implications, 
progress on to date.”   
That is what is written in paragraph 1. At 1 – page 1226. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. Chair you are correct.  In my main affidavit on 
ECR0106 the report I am referring to about the site visit of Vrede Dairy 
23 May is ER43. 
ADV GCABASHE:  ER43? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  I have it.  Yes please point out the salient portions 
of ER43 that you want the Chairman to note?  Again the purpose 
essentially is the same?  Exactly what Mr Moses has – had written. 
“Purpose of the report is provide the Honourable MEC 
of Finance and the CEO Provincial Treasury with the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 114 of 190 
 
following regarding Vrede Dairy Project in brackets 
(Mohama Mobung).  Projects background …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think hang on she is still trying to find it. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I am so lost with this document that I do not know 
where you are. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The page number is written in red. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think maybe start with the Exhibit name on the spine 
so that she checks whether she has got the right file. 
ADV GCABASHE:  It is file ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at the spine of the file ...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  And it will be File B. 
MS ROCKMAN:  B? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes and it is written in red – the pages numbers are 
written in red.  It is 5-6-3. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Chair I am with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You found it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So were pointing to this as a report that you can 
relate to? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  This is – I was with Mr Moses.  There was a 
whole delegation of Treasury Officials. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That was at the site of Vrede Dairy.  It sets out the 
basic financial information.  It sets out what – paragraph 9 of that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 115 of 190 
 
report says: 
“The 30 million was required to do one, two, three, 
four, five …” 
ADV GCABASHE:  Now ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  “… land acquisition …” 
ADV GCABASHE:  Continue. 
MS ROCKMAN:  “…land acquisition, environmental impact 
assessment, feasibility study and so forth.” 
ADV GCABASHE:  Now remember we spoke about this earlier on about 
the disjuncture between what Mr Thabethe thought the money – the first 
10 
30 million was for and what Estina thought the first 30 million was for 
but continue.  At least here this corroborates what you said to the 
Chairman earlier on. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  This is exactly what you said. 
MS ROCKMAN:  We would not have information about what Estina 
alleges they were supposed to do with the money.  We are stuck with 
the version that Agriculture tells us in whatever submission they made 
they must do one, two, three. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Then paragraph 14 deals with the progress on-site.  
Then they do say paragraph 15: 
“55 million was spent at the June 2013 the physical 
progress on-site seems to be sluggish due to the fact 
that bulk of the funds were meant for parlour equipment 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 116 of 190 
 
which was ordered.  The milking parlour equipment has 
not yet arrived.  However the order has been made.  
From …” 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes, but if you just want to pause there for one 
minute.  There is again disjuncture between paragraph 15 and what you 
agreed in paragraph 9. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You would agree that the two are completely 
different? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Paragraph 9 is exactly what Agriculture 
10 
presented at the time they made the request for the first payment to be 
made.  They said we want to do X, Y, Z. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Now we are on the site visit a couple of months later 
May 20 – May 2013. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And we are told this is what has happened with the 
first payment. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And you are told by who? 
MS ROCKMAN:  By the officials of Agriculture. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  And the Project Manager.  I am just ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I am just wondering if the Project Manager was 
on-site. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The Project Manager was on the farm but he was 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 117 of 190 
 
very difficult to understand.  He spoke with a very heavy accent.   
ADV GCABASHE:  That is Mr Prasad? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE: 
 
So 
your 
information 
really 
came 
from 
the 
Departmental Officials? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The same people who had given you the information 
in paragraph 9? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Continue. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  That would be correct.  Then it says: 
“The tractors that were purchased, the total area of 
land that has been planted, the harvesting machine, 
implements and other agriculture equipment.” 
And we would not be – we were not doing a stocktaking.  We 
would not go to that level of details. 
“The construction of silage bunkers that was in 
progress on the day.” 
It - the estimate was – it was about 80% complete. 
“Construction of dairy parlour was in an initial state.  
20 
The milk processing plant was not yet started as the 
latter is interdependent on completion of the dairy 
parlour and also relates to Phase 2.  Indication from 
Project Manager was that this project will gain 
momentum immediately once approval of usage of land 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 118 of 190 
 
for different purposes has been granted by National 
Department of Agriculture.” 
And then it confirms the following obligations were executed: 
“Land acquisition, environmental impact, feasibility 
study.” 
They were in the process of finalising identification of 
beneficiaries for the Agri BEE entity and there was a number of photos 
that indicates. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Then the recommendations.  It was noted the amount 
10 
they had spent.  It is note that progress seemed to be sluggish because 
the land usage application had not yet been approved and it 
recommended that we agree that we must make a follow up visit during 
November 2013. 
ADV GCABASHE: 
 
Now 
this 
makes 
the 
precise 
point 
that 
Mr Jankielsohn makes.  At paragraph 20.1 you are correct.  It notes 
that the total amount of 85 million has been spent thus far.  Now we 
know we can take 29 million off - let us call it 30 million off because 
they said they had put that away to reserve it for buying milking parlour 
equipment. 
20 
You still have an amount of 55 million that is noted here as 
having been spent so far and the simple point really is could you see 
55 million as you walked around that farm?  That is really what the site 
visit was about.  Could you see where the 55 million that you know had 
come from your coffers could possibly have been employed? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 119 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  At that time we knew that a significant portion of that 
money went into the studies.  For example feasibility study, 
environmental impact assessment.  You would not expect to see that 
physically on the ground.  The paperwork had been submitted and it 
was subsequently forwarded to Treasury.  So it was to Agriculture. 
What was on the ground was exactly as I said.  It was a 
project in the beginning stages of implementation. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You know can I ask you to pause because 
interestingly enough that memorandum we showed you of the 28 t h 
of February that Mr Thabethe and MEC Zwane signed off on and sent 
10 
through to the Premier author – asking for authorisation to go to India.  
In the third or fourth paragraph of that particular memorandum 
Mr Thabethe mentions 17 million that at that point in time was available 
for – either for plans for three projects Qwaqwa, Setsoto and Vrede. 
All feasibility studies.  There was a bit of a debate about 
what exactly that 17 million had been allocated to but my understanding 
of Mr Thabethe’s evidence is that that 17 million was in the bag.  It had 
already been set aside for whether it is for the plans or for the 
feasibility studies is immaterial at this point in time. 
So when I then look at the 55 million that paragraph 20.1 
20 
would be referring to should you take the 30 million off.  I come back to 
asking as Mr Jankielsohn might have had he been here.  Could you see 
the South African taxpayers 55 million on this farm that you were 
visiting? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair for 2013/2014 in the APP there was 53.9 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 120 of 190 
 
committed for – from CASP for funding.  That is the Conditional Grant 
Funding. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In which year? 
MS ROCKMAN:  2013/2014. 
ADV GCABASHE:  2013 – I agree with you on that. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And from infrastructure enhancement allocation where 
was 60. 
ADV GCABASHE:  6-0? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja.  6-0 million. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So that constituted the full funding.  It was taken up in 
the annual performance plan. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  In other words it was approved by the National 
Department.  At least the CASP funding of 53.950 million.  It went 
through the whole process that they standardly followed.  The 
Department of Agriculture would prepare a business plan, would submit 
to the assessment panel of the National Department. 
20 
Projects would – some would be approved.  Some would be 
not approved.  There would be certain conditions.  So the funding was 
definitely secured. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I ask you to pause?  Please do not forget where 
you are going to because I am simply reminding you that that letter that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 121 of 190 
 
was written to the Premier asking for permission to go to India is dated 
the 28 t h of February 2012.  At that point in time this 53 million and the 
60 million that CASP was giving for this particular project had not been 
allocated yet. 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You had not started having those discussions? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And that is just the contrast I am bringing.  I am 
simply saying and I am really looking at this letter ER43.  At paragraph 
20.1 at the 85 million minus 30 and really just asking in this context 
10 
knowing that Thabethe – he may have been wrong.  Mr Thabethe said 
there is a 17 million.  He said that to the Premier. 
The Premier signed off on that basis.  Gave him permission 
to go to India.  There was a 17 million for the plan/feasibility study.  At 
the same time you here have paragraph 9 that speaks of 30 million for 
Phase 1 which included a feasibility study.  At paragraph 20.1 we have 
got 85 million which includes the 30 million that has already been 
spent. 
This is what people are telling you.  Your oversight role, to 
what extent would you have to interrogate some of what you were 
20 
seeing and hearing?  I really do not know.  I ask the question because I 
have not worked in Provincial Government.  Otherwise I would have had 
some sense. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Thanks Chair.  The 2011/2012 budget was the limited 
one.  It was one amount – one source of funding was 6 million. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 122 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  There were two sources of 3 million, 3 million of which 
one was EPWP. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So the total for 2011/2012 would have been 13? 
MS ROCKMAN:  12 million - 12 million in total. 
ADV GCABASHE:  12 - 12 million? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja.  It was six million from ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  I have the 3.5 and the 6.5 and then another three. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Sorry.  That is the – are you in 2012/2013 now? 
ADV GCABASHE:  No, no.  I am simply working from memory because 
10 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I have been looking at these documents for a while. 
MS ROCKMAN:  2012/2013 from CASP there was 6 million. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Then from Ilima/Letsema there was 3 million 
...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And then from EPWP there was 3 million. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Okay. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  So that gives you 12 million. 
ADV GCABASHE:  12.5? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Okay.  Yes and that is for 2011/2012. 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 2012/2013. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 123 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  2012/2013? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  2012/2013.  Are you ...(intervenes)? 
MS ROCKMAN:  2011/2012 there was no delegated budget. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you. 
MS ROCKMAN:  There was no expenditure in respect of Vrede Dairy. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja.  Absolutely.  I am quite happy with that.  In fact 
you put that in your supplementary affidavit ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Because really Mohama Mobung was a concept 
10 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE: 
 
Vrede 
Dairy 
was 
hardly 
a 
concept. 
 
So 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE: 
 
In 
2011/2012 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And not for that project anyway.  For other projects 
but not for that project. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja.  So I am happy enough for that.  So we are 
talking 2012/2013, 12.5 million. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I must say please I am moving around a little simply 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 124 of 190 
 
because I have read your supplementary affidavit.  So if you want us to 
do this in a more structured fashion by going through that.  I am happy 
if you would prefer doing that because you actually set it out very 
nicely in that supplementary affidavit. 
Every year what was allocated and what was spent but I am 
quite happy with just doing high level - having a high level discussion 
about these amounts.  As the Chairman has indicated he is happy to 
drill down into the specifics at his leisure.  Are you comfortable with 
continuing like this? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja.  I am fine with whichever direction you want to 
10 
take. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I am – let us continue this way.  So we are again 
looking at a high level discussion about the amount that were made 
available.  I am really focusing on this report because you have brought 
it to the attention of the Chairman.  ER43 and the conclusions drawn at 
paragraph 20.1. 
I am also pointing to the information that is contained in this 
particular letter and maybe there is no answer to this because you are 
given information.  Different bits of information that do not really make 
sense when you look at it in composite form but you are reliant on the 
20 
people who are giving you this information? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Is this really what you are saying? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  My only question then is Oversight Section 18 of the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 125 of 190 
 
PFMA.  Would one person not necessarily the MEC or even the 
Accounting Officer, any official not sit down and say wait a minute.  
This does not make sense.  You do not do that type of thing in 
Provincial Treasury? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not at such an early stage at the start of a project.  
That would be not something we would be doing. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  In addition to the fact that we do not necessarily have 
the capacity.  If Agriculture comes and tells you we have planted X 
amount of hectare.  We have bought this, bought that.  This is where 
10 
the money has gone.  We do not have Agricultural economists in 
Treasury who is able to take an informed decision. 
We run into the same problem for example when we had the 
health crisis.  We had a situation where our health officials were telling 
us but National Department of Health has introduced a certain tablet 
that was 12 times more expensive than something that had been used.  
It is not decision Treasury can pronounce itself on because we have no 
clue. 
We do not have the expertise.  We do not have the capacity 
to say use this pill.  Not that pill because it is cheaper or not cheaper.  
20 
It is too specialised for us to have an informed position on.  We would 
then defer to say National Department there is provision in the PFMA to 
say if there is an unfunded mandate can you attend to it. 
In that specific case we had asked for them to attend to it 
and absolutely nothing happened subsequently.  So it did not matter 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 126 of 190 
 
whether we reported or not reported it.  There was no outcome.  So 
those anomalies in Government exists like in presume inherently to any 
other system it will happen. 
I think it is important to note the way Agriculture structured 
the agreement.  It made provision for phases of the project and money 
was going to be transferred X, Y, Z.  No one ever came back to say 
guys let us take a step back.  We are not comfortable with this.  We are 
not comfortable with that. 
The 
accounting 
responsibility 
remained 
with 
the 
HOD 
ultimately. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Of the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Of that department. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  You can also say the legislature has a specific role 
when it – to play.  When it comes to consideration of the annual 
performance plan.  This is part of – it is linked to the budget.  You table 
your annual performance plan before the budget vote speech is 
delivered. 
Now consistently throughout the years the State of the 
20 
Province Address spoke to the Vrede Dairy Project.  The ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  As of 2013?  As of 2012 actually. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think it …(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Mohama Mobung you see ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 127 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Because it is really two sides of the same coin? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The budget vote speech of the department then goes 
into further details.  Now the APP is, the Annual Performance Plan, is 
tabled before the budget vote speech.  It gets referred to the 
Legislature’s Committee on – in this case it would have been 
Agriculture and whatever other portfolios were linked into the 
Legislature’s Committee. 
They consider the APP.  They consider the budget speech.  
10 
They report back to the house.  Now I have not gone into those reports 
at all.  I am unable to say how did the Legislature look at the APP’s.  
What was the recommendations?  What was that oversight role because 
the oversight role cannot only be one entity or one party? 
The first line monitoring and evaluation should have come 
from Agriculture and Rural Development itself. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Treasury was looking at the funding.  The way it was 
budgeted.  It was also budgeted as transfer payments and I think I 
dealt extensively in the affidavit on the accounting treatment of transfer 
20 
payments. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And we are going to come back to that because the 
Chairman has a particular transfer payments. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But let us leave transfer payments – I am sorry 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 128 of 190 
 
Ms Rockman. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think you broke my train of thought there for a 
minute. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I am – I do apologise. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But - okay the – it was budgeted as transfer payments 
because at the time the accounting treatment was that a transfer 
payment becomes unrequited funds.  It ceases to be public money.  So 
you would have a limitation.  There was no way Treasury would go to 
Estina for example and say okay explain to us how you used this 
money. 
10 
It – the moment the transfer payment was affected it was 
unrequited funds and I think that is an important aspect that comes into 
it.  Now in the audit treatment I think the audit section of my affidavit 
goes to details of the engagements we had with National Treasury and 
the National Accountant-General and the fact that it took almost two 
years to get to a point to clarify is this a transfer payment or should it 
be reclassified as goods and services. 
So it may have looked that – I do not know what people 
expect the Treasury to do.  We were not going to jump up and down and 
say we are stopping this project right here.  That was not going to 
20 
happen.  It does not work like that in Government but our behind the 
scenes 
role 
on 
trying 
to 
assist 
Auditor-General 
and 
the 
Accountant-General to get a sense of finality around how to deal with 
the accounting treatment was – that was a critical part for us because 
had it been classified as goods and services it brought the whole Vrede 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 129 of 190 
 
Dairy Project and whatever was procured it would have brought it back 
into the public sector and we could then systematically start working 
through it but as it stayed a transfer payment and it was unrequited 
funds our role was cut off at that stage. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I really must say we are going to come back to this 
discussion.  We must ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was about to say it looks like cannot win to shift it 
to later. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she seemed to deal with it but I am happy to 
10 
– for us to deal with it later. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I think we should Chairman because it is a very 
discussion and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And Ms Rockman is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  It took them from 2016 to 2018 ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  To get a definitive ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Directive ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  From National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV GCABASHE:  And it is – it ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 130 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can deal with it later. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes and the impact was national.  It was not just 
...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In relation to the Free State.  So I think – it is an 
important aspect that we will come back to later.  In the meantime I 
hear what you are saying about the limitations or the constraints on 
your oversight role and I note those and will move on so that we get to 
10 
those transfer payments sooner rather than later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you are moving away from ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Not quite Chairman ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oversight role. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But you – please not ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you are still with the oversight role you may 
proceed but if you are moving away from it I want to talk – to ask her 
some questions. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman if you do not mind I just want to squeeze 
in one ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine. 
ADV GCABASHE:  If that is alright with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is fine. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 131 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  And that really is just a reference to with – t o 
Ms Elder Mtshiza’s evidence because when they went – I think it would 
have been in June/July 2013 to go and inspect the farm.  For one there 
were no cattle there.  They had been taken to another farm.  Did you 
find cattle on the farm when you were there? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  On every occasion. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Each time.  Oh, how many times did you go there? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was May 2013.  It was the first time. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Then in 2014 – I think it was 2014.  I was at the 
10 
Phumelela Municipality with an engagement that on municipal financial 
management ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And audit outcomes and Mr Odwa Dudu was the 
Business Executive for the AG in the Free State.  He was 
accompanying us together with Ms Alice Miller.  She was from the 
National AG’s Office.  In that meeting I suggested to the Mayor to say 
look everyone is here.  This is really like an elephant in the room. 
Let us just ask do they want to see the farm or not.  It turned 
out Mr Dudu had at that stage already visited the farm before.  
20 
Ms Miller had not been to the farm.  So that was the second time – the 
second like visit to the farm.  I will find the date. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Do you want to go to page 56, 5-6, of Volume A of 
your original affidavit paragraph 4.3.12?  I do not know if that is the 
visit you are referring to. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 132 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  There would also be at page 44 reference to the 
first visit – the 23 r d of May visit. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  At page 44. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was actually February 2015. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So that is the one on page 56? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Of Volume A. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But at both occasions there were cattle on - on the 
10 
farm.  I cannot – I really cannot say how many cattle, what kind of 
cattle.  There were cattle.  They seem to be a few.  We were told other 
cattle are in the fields – are in wherever but we saw cattle.  I took 
photos of cattle.  The numbers are – is obviously ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Give us a quick sense a 100, 50 ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  10.  This is a farm that was ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those that you saw.  Those that you saw. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja.  That big structure that I think there were photos at 
one stage in the Commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The – that whole structure was full from front to back. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Cows were being fed.  So ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What would be your estimate 100 - 50 or it is difficult 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 133 of 190 
 
to say? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I can show you the photos.  You can ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well because you were ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  You should estimate from that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you were ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  MEC for Finance I nearly said you a finance person.  
So you should know but that is not your background.   
MS ROCKMAN:  There ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were just MEC for Finance ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  There was not 800 in that ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  What we saw. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  500? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No.  Far less. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Far less? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  So that was the first observation Ms Mtshiza 
made.  The other observation was they too found in June/July 2013 
very little progress had been made.  They could not see where their 24 
million had made a difference which is one of the issues that informed 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 134 of 190 
 
their decision to withdraw – one of not the only one, one of the ones 
that informed their decision to withdraw the CASP funding. 
I just wanted to put that in Chairman but you had wanted to 
deal with some of the oversight or related matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MS ROCKMAN:  Could I comment ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Just before ...(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please do. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Do please. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think that is another example of the fragmented 
approach that Government had because as DAFF did that site visit we 
did not have information on those details.  They – for example they said 
that there is a technical report.  We never had sight of that technical 
report. 
So it made it very difficult and I – we know National Treasury 
is now investigating something this side.  DAFF is doing site visits that 
side.  No one is talking to us as Treasury at the time.  So that 
fragmentation really did not assist anyone.  Mr Jankielsohn is saying 
we did not do anything but realistically what else do you want us to 
20 
have done at that stage because exactly National Treasury had already 
initiated an investigation. 
We cannot initiate another investigation.  DAFF is doing site 
visits.  They are stopping their funding.  If we had stopped the funding 
at that stage then what.  Except for being technically right.  What was 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 135 of 190 
 
going to happen to the animals on the farm?  They were going to what - 
die.  It was not a solution. 
I think the focus at that stage was that everyone was trying to 
be right and no one was trying to find a solution to the problem and I 
think that to me was something that we really had to take into account.  
The animals were there.  They had to be fed.  They had to be 
medicined.  They had to be watered. They had to be milked.   
Simply stopping funding does not make all these other 
problems disappear.  I think it was November that – November 2013 
that a further submission came.  It was either November 2013 or 2014. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  From? 
MS ROCKMAN:  From Agriculture because we had not made available 
funding in the adjustment budget.  I think it was November 2013.  We 
had not made funding available because the funding was simply not 
there and yet afterwards another submission did come from Agriculture 
asking us for – to make funding available and the HOD Treasury – it is 
that letter with the long notation – handwritten notation to say though 
we agree that we will make this funding available it does not mean that 
we agree to the purpose of the expenditure. 
We do not intend to undermine the National Treasury 
20 
investigation but he took into account the possible consequences of not 
acting.  So it was – it is much more complicated than just to say you 
should have stopped the funding.  There were specifically practical 
reasons.  I think we should also point out that at no stage did anyone 
at a political level from National Government raise the matter with me 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 136 of 190 
 
as MEC of Finance. 
Not the Minister of Finance, not the Deputy Minister of 
Finance, no one, not the Minister, Deputy Minister Agriculture.  It was 
not raised with us and we had a practice in the budget council which is 
like the MINMEC  of the Finance MEC’s.  There was space where the 
Minister could raise specific issues directly with us and issues that was 
raised at various times included, for example, over committment on 
bursries as the Free State, it included Makufe so issues were raised.  
Vrede Dairy was never raised at that level.  It would have been 
appropriate that at such a political level, if there was this substantial 
10 
concern, the Ministers would sit with Premiers, not only in the National 
Executive Committee of the ANC, they could have discussed it there.  
They could have discussed it in the President’s co-ordinating council, 
they could have discussed it in any other number of inter-governmental 
forums. It was, to my knowledge, never discussed.  No one raised it 
with us directly so I think that it also illustrates that it  was not as easy 
as Mr Jankielsohn may make it out to be. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Can I say…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let’s go back to the limitations on oversight.  I 
thought that it’s part of the obligations that National Treasury has, and 
20 
I would imagine that what National Treasury is obliged to do at national 
level is the same thing that Provincial Treasuries apply to do at 
provincial level.  I thought that one of the obligations of National 
Treasury is to look after how different departments are spending tax 
payers money and to take measures – certain measures when they 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 137 of 190 
 
realise that a particular department might not be spending tax payers 
money in the right way.  I know that I’m putting that at a very general 
level.  Am I mistaken in that understanding, I’m talking about National 
Treasury on the basis that whatever National is supposed to do at 
National level, Provincial Treasury is supposed to do at Provincial level 
but you would be more informed and might be able to tell me that some 
of the obligations are the same but others are not, they apply to both 
but some don’t apply to both? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair the basic workings would be the same, we have 
for example what we call the July/August visits of National Treasury 
10 
where – but it happens at a technical level.  All departments or at least 
the …(indistinct) spending departments, your education, your health, 
your police, roads, transport, the bigger departments.  There would be 
engagements, it would also serve as benchmarking exercises for us.  It 
would flag certain issues where there would be concerns, under 
spending, over spending, over commitments, various issues.  Then 
importantly we would have the provincial medium term expenditure 
hearings.  That is sort of an assessment of where we are halfway 
through the financial year, it forms almost a foundation for your 
consideration of the adjustment appropriation bill as we begin to put it 
20 
together but it also informs priorities for the budget for the forthcoming 
financial year.  So literally departments are required to report 
extensively on what was in the APP’s, what have they done up to a 
certain point of the financial year, about halfway through the financial 
year.  Our funds committed, our funds likely to be under spent, it 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 138 of 190 
 
enables us also to see where funds are clearly not going to be spent.  
We would know, okay we are going to take money from X, Y, Z and 
reallocate to address pressures wherever else.  So that processes does 
happen and did happen consistently yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in terms of payments when Provincial Treasury is 
supposed to either make payments or authorise payments this might not 
be literally, technically correct but when it is supposed to do that in 
regard to the projects of any particular department, is it not obliged to 
check whether, for example, certain or rather procurement procedures 
have been followed even though the Accounting Officer of the 
10 
department is there to sit with that.  Aren’t they entitled to say, if you 
are asking for us to authorise this funding, you need to satisfy us that 
you are going to spend it properly and properly includes where you are 
supposed to follow procurement procedures, satisfy us that you have 
followed them because if we are not satisfied that you want money to 
spend on a project where you have satisfied or complied with 
procurement procedures, we will not authorise.  If you think you were 
justified not to follow procurement procedures for this project because 
you believe there should be deviation, satisfy us that this is a deviation 
case.  Isn’t that the position because we won’t be party in that way to 
20 
you spending money in breach of the PFMA and the PFMA, as I 
understand the position being basically National Treasury legislation 
therefore you would be the guardians of that piece of legislation? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Thanks Chair, the Provincial Treasury pays its own 
service providers.  Departments request cash on a monthly basis, they 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 139 of 190 
 
give us cash projections.  You have R120 for the year, so every month 
you get 10. If you project by December your spending is going to slow 
down you will ask for maybe R3 and in January you will ask for 7.  Then 
every month we give you the cash, what you asked for.  Your 
disbursement of the money we allocate on a monthly basis is between 
you, your procurement processes and your service providers, that is 
why the irregularity of expenditure that occurs happens at the point 
where the expenditure is incurred.  Where the procurement takes place 
and then in this case of agriculture where expenditure is incurred.  So 
we do not have sight on the details of invoices.  What comes to us is 
10 
cash projections, cash requisitions where you need so much money, 
this is in line with whatever the department would have projected for 
the year, we will check, do you still have money, have you over spent, 
do we have cash available and then we would disburse.  If a 
department suddenly wants two or three times the amount that we 
would have anticipated, there would have to be a motivation to say why 
would we need this money because it’s cash management we have to 
protect resources also, we are trying to make a little extra money with 
bank interest and so forth. 
 
It would also be influenced by, for example, conditional grants, 
20 
the relevant transferring department.  We would only release 
conditional grant funding if we had received it from the relevant 
National Department.  So the details of expenditure would lie with the 
Department of Agriculture in this case.  Those details would not be 
submitted to us we would not have sight of invoices or that type of 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 140 of 190 
 
procurement details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I heard evidence some time back in relation 
to this matter that National Treasury initiated an investigation and we 
also know that a Treasury issues what is it, instruction, I can’t 
remember I don’t know the full term but basically giving guidance as to 
– even with procurement as to what will be accepted as compliance and 
what will not be accepted as compliance.  So the National Treasury 
seems to play a very important role with regard to procurement and the 
compliance with procurement procedures at least at National level is 
that right? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes as National Treasury would issue either 
instruction notes or it would issue practice notes or Treasury 
regulations, at a provincial context we contextualise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   And then also subsequently issue a provincial 
instruction note to say this is how this Treasury regulation in the 
provincial context does this, this and this indications.  On cost 
containment measures for example this is the same.  You would not 
apply it equally across the country because of different dynamics, so 
we customise that into what is workable for us and we would issue 
20 
similarly such cost containment or relevant practice notes but the 
responsibility would remain that of the Accounting Officer and in this 
case, once the Accounting Officer had signed the deviation, he 
approved the deviation and stood by that deviation, I think we had a 
long conversation and engagement with the AG on – at which stage can 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 141 of 190 
 
this deviation be set aside.  If the Accounting Officer stands by his 
decision to deviate someone will have to approach court to set it aside, 
who is that someone in this case? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we’ll talk about that in due course because I 
found that part of the discussion quite interesting but you have said 
that the Provincial Treasury would issue the equivalent of provincial 
instruction notes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But who enforces them, is it not the provincial 
Treasury.  You issue them to say, departments must do A, B, C, D or 
10 
mustn’t do A, B, C, D is it not provincial Treasury who has the 
obligation to enforce those? 
MS ROCKMAN:   In our key control matrix reports somewhere in the 
affidavit and supplementary affidavit we outline all of those areas, that 
it’s also a monitoring tool to see what is our compliance of departments 
with relevant prescripts and so forth.  Those same instruction notes, 
practice notes etcetera would also be provided to the office of the 
Auditor General.  So in the audit, part of the audit would be – it would 
include the compliance with all relevant regulations, instruction notes, 
practice notes etcetera that would have been issued.  Then you would 
20 
also have the CFO forum that was chaired by the Provincial Accountant 
General, they would report against these issues and it would depend on 
the accuracy of their reports on the extent to which we were able to 
monitor, compliance or non-compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you referred to monitoring compliance that must 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 142 of 190 
 
be supervision that must be enforcement, why would you monitor if 
you’re not the enforcer, what’s the purpose of monitoring? 
MS ROCKMAN:   You would be able to say, department X you have not 
addressed, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but you cannot – we did not have the 
ability…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The power to issue a sanction? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Ja to issue a sanction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you would – part of the Provincial Treasury’s 
obligation was to monitor whether, in this case, the Department of 
Agriculture 
complied 
with 
PFMA 
procedures 
including 
whatever 
10 
provincial instruction notes may have been issues, isn’t it? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now did it monitor that? 
MS ROCKMAN:   To the extent it was able to yes, I think we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes why do you say to the extent, was there anything 
that prevented you from – when I say you, I mean the Provincial 
Treasury, was there anything that prevented the Provincial Treasury 
from monitoring the full extent of compliance or non-compliance, was 
there anything which it could not – were there any corners it could not 
go to, to check whether there had been proper compliance? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   In terms of all the standard procedures that would – 
any department would expect to be followed I think all of that was 
followed.  In the case of Estina, specifically the deviation, there was no 
recovery from the deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, just repeat there was no? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 143 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:   There was no way to recover from the fact that the 
Accounting Officer concluded the contract based on the deviation, there 
was no procurement process followed, no other procurement process 
followed.  We could not redo a procurement process, the contract was 
signed, Mr Thabethe was adamant he stood by the deviation that he 
had the power to approve the deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no, no I understand that I just want us to get 
there at the right time.  So, but in terms of – as a response to my 
question you accept that whatever it is you would have wanted to see in 
order to effectively perform your monitoring obligations, you would have 
10 
been able to see if you wanted to see it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes, we were not prevented from going to the farm, 
there was co-ordination if someone wanted to go to the farm they could, 
no one was prevented or instructed to say, no you can’t go to the farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:   That was never a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so is the position that you are saying what you 
did pick up as part of monitoring, maybe not necessarily as part of 
monitoring but what you did pick up as a matter of fact is that there 
was deviation.  Did you consider, and I would imagine you would have, 
20 
when I say you again, Provincial Treasury maybe you in particular I’m 
not sure, did you consider whether this was a case where deviation was 
justified, because I’m taking it that if you have an obligation to monitor 
you must have the obligation to satisfy yourself whether things have 
been done properly otherwise there’s no point in monitoring if you can’t 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 144 of 190 
 
– if you’re not expected to form a view whether things have been done 
properly? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Chair, yes then I must refer back to – I’m able to 
reconstruct how the MEC at the time and the HOD at the time applied 
their minds from the available documentation.  I think in other evidence 
before the Commission it came out that the Provincial Accountant 
General had advised that this is going to be a problem and the whole 
process that was then agreed upon arising from the Treasury 
Committee meeting to say, ultimately this – what is going to have to 
happen before the HOD Treasury at the time and the MEC Finance at 
10 
the time signed off on the request of Agriculture.  If you remember they 
said part of it was that the contract must be reviewed, there must be 
further discussions on securing the funding etcetera.  So at that time, 
I’m not aware whether there were other engagements between Treasury 
and agriculture or anyone else in the environment, I only know what I 
knew as DG at the time attending that specific Treasury Committee 
meeting and what was clear there was that Treasury at the time was not 
in possession of all the relevant documentation and part of what I had 
to do was to make sure that agriculture provide Treasury with the 
documentation.  Based on what they had they could not sign off and 
20 
there 
was 
that 
process 
of 
engagement 
and 
going 
through 
documentation, consultation with the state law advisors and so forth 
that then led to them – the HOD Treasury at the time and the MEC at 
the time, they both signed off on certain conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you, like Ms Gcabashe you must also remind me 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 145 of 190 
 
when I put you into matters where you were not MEC for Finance but at 
the time that you became MEC for Finance and you became involved 
with this, where was this whole project at that time.  I’m now trying to 
see what it is you may have had an obligation to check and what you 
might not have had an obligation to check in terms monitoring or your 
people under you? 
MS ROCKMAN:   The approval was June 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  June 2012? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes the Exco approval and then ja it was still when I 
was DG. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   I became MEC March 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   The first funding had been paid before I had started 
and then after I had started the funding was still made available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continuing? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but do you remember whether – when you 
became MEC for Finance the problem about deviation had been picked 
up by the Provincial Treasury or not? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes it was already in June 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it had already been picked up? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes it was picked up at the time that the request was 
made for the first funding of the R30 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and I guess that you are not in a position to 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 146 of 190 
 
justify or not justify how it was dealt with before you became MEC for 
Finance or are you able to – in terms of monitoring and what was done 
pursuant to monitoring? 
MS ROCKMAN:   From what is clear to me is that the Provincial 
Accountant General at the time this is what he did advise that this is 
going to be a problem it’s likely to constitute irregular expenditure.  
The MEC and the HOD at the time acknowledged, I think, that 
shortcoming in the procurement process but in mitigation agreed that 
whatever contract that was signed before this matter went to Exco that 
that contract had to be redrafted, that further funding solutions had to 
10 
be provided or had to be considered etcetera, etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright so – but I think that what we have 
established is that at least provincial Treasury has an obligation to 
monitor and that includes procurement issues even though the 
Accounting Officer of each department remains responsible for that. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Chairman I would like actually to go back to your 
visit, I know you’ve gone way beyond that but just to tidy that up 
because you are then there in May of 2013, it’s really relevant what the 
20 
Chairman’s been asking you about your oversight role and as you were 
speaking the comment I wrote down here that I want to pursue in the 
context of you saying there was very little that you could do because 
different investigating arms of government, whether it was staff or 
whether it was National Treasury, whether it was the department itself 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 147 of 190 
 
were not talking to one another, they certainly were not talking to 
Provincial Treasury.  The topic is still oversight – the oversight of 
Provincial Treasury and as you were responding the thought that went 
through my mind was, your difficulty really or certainly my difficulty with 
your answer is by going there on a site visit you placed yourselves as 
the Provincial Treasury squarely in the cauldron of the debate around 
what that R85 million may or may not have done for the project because 
you actually went there and you made certain observations.  You could 
have gone back to the department for instance and engaged with them 
further because you were aware that they do get monthly and quarterly 
10 
reports am I correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Those are a must those are part of what they have 
to get and I was just looking at – in fact my colleague just brought to 
my attention a quarterly report that we have been dealing with Mr 
Thabethe and it’s ER106.1 it’s at – I’m at page 1270 that’s C – Volume 
C 1270, really and I’m interrogating what you’re saying about your role 
– your oversight role, 1270 and it’s ER106.1, this is a quarterly 
progress report dated December 2012 and I concede this would have 
gone to the department and not to yourself but this information, 
20 
prepared by Estina, not by the department that was then filed with the 
department and if we go over the page to point number five as at 
December 2012 this is what Estina says, it’s at page 1271 paragraph 
five titled cow purchase they say and I quote, 
“We are planning to make the purchase of cows by the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 148 of 190 
 
end of March 2013. For that we have visited more then 
nine dairy farms and identified about 1 600 pregnant 
Heifer cows.  Their cost varies from R7 000 to R18 000 
per animal depending on their pregnant status and 
genetics.  They are quite careful in selecting the 
animals for their production potential, health other 
condition and age of the animals. Now we are going to 
start the negotiations for the purchase of cows.  
Meantime we have also contacted some insurance 
companies 
to 
insure 
the 
cows 
before 
their 
10 
transportation.  If everything goes well, cows will be 
purchased during March 2013.” 
 
Then over the page at page 1272 right at the bottom at (V) 
they talk about setting up a cattle feed plant and then over the page 
again at page 1273 (VI) purchase of cows in their report, I quote, 
“Keeping all the facts in mind the Estina will try to 
purchase at least 300 cows by the end of March 2013.” 
 
The rest of the report really speaks to what they say were 
limitations in getting this project going but if you were there in May – 
March, April, May – 23 r d of May, let’s say two months later I would like 
20 
to understand from this report that they would have purchased no more 
than about 300 cows, just from what they are saying here in this report, 
does that make sense to you because you speak of the number of cows 
you observed on the property? 
MS ROCKMAN:   That number of cows was when I was with Mr Duda 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 149 of 190 
 
and Miss Miller in 2015. 
ADV GCABASHE:  February 2015? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja.  At this first visit there was not that number of 
cows at the farm. There were some cows but not the number of cows 
that was there in 2015. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So you would estimate that when you were there in 
2013 in May having now paid the entire R114 million, roughly how many 
cows were there? 
MS ROCKMAN:  They were not in one place so you could not see all of 
them at the same time.  We were taken to the – where the calves were.  
10 
Others were in this veld, that veld. They were not in one place so you 
could not get a picture to say okay the first X number of cows’ looks 
like they have arrived and they are here. But as you indicate also Chair 
the – this is the report between Estina and – and Agriculture.  This 
would not be the level of details that Treasury would necessarily have 
insight to. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That is really the theme of your answer as I have 
understood it.  That at a certain level of detail the Provincial Treasury 
would not get involved.  But you expect to be informed of any hiccups 
or any difficulties that arise by the Accounting Officer. So the 
20 
Commission should really continue to look to the Accounting Officer for 
answers to various issues that are raised by witnesses who have been 
to these proceedings. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes simply because we would not be involved to that 
detailed level of operations on a daily basis. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 150 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  I am moving on Chairman if you have no other 
questions on this aspect? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us just – you know the visit to the farm I think Ms 
Gcabashe is probably right that demonstrates something and one I 
guess it demonstrates that you as Provincial MEC for Finance as 
Provincial Treasury you regarded it as your obligation to at least go 
and have a look whether certain things are in place.  And you probably 
would agree with me that even though you might not be expected – 
have been expected to deal with certain details but there would be set 
ball parks so that if certain things were not in place you would say, 
10 
hang on what is going on here?  Is that right?  Am I right? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so there have to be certain fissures that you have 
to look for.  If they are in place then maybe you are expected to go into 
finer details but if one or more is not in place that is supposed to be a 
red flag for you to say come on Department of Agriculture tell us more 
we are not happy.  That far we agree? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now I would think that if you had – as Provincial 
Treasury had an obligation to monitor that it cannot be right that the 
20 
Commission should only look to the Accounting Officer for the 
Department of Agriculture for answers.  I would think that what is – 
what would be correct is that in regard to certain things the 
Commission is entitled to look for answers both to the Accounting 
Officer of the department as well Provincial Treasury.  But with regard 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 151 of 190 
 
to some things that maybe only the Accounting Officer of the 
department.  Because at a certain level you have said finer details may 
be not but that means at a certain level you share certain obligations.  
Maybe you do not share but you are – you were as the Provincial 
Treasury the supervisor or the one who monitors whether there is 
proper performance.  Maybe supervisor is not the correct term but you 
are supposed to keep an eye whether things seem to be in order in 
terms of performance.  And if you see red flags you are supposed to 
intervene, is that right? 
MS ROCKMAN:  To a certain extent yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It just depend what ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What things would be red flags or what things you are 
supposed to look for? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes in as far as controlling revenue and expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That they did not spend more than ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  What was allocated that indeed that – there was never 
a question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That – what was outside the budget would be 
supplemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think we deal in detail in the affidavit and the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 152 of 190 
 
supplementary affidavit on the way Agriculture was also impacted when 
they received money and when money was taken away from the 
department.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm 
MS ROCKMAN:  Like I said also in the Provincial Medium tech 
expenditure hearings the PM Tech hearings the department had to 
report in detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  They had to meet the monthly reporting requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  The key control matrix reports.  Those reports were 
also sent to the relevant MEC’s of all departments not only Agriculture 
but Premier and all MEC’s received their reports.  Attention was drawn 
to certain areas that needed to be improved on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I know in 2013/2014 after the audit we did the 
analysis.  We said per department this was your main issues in your 
audit you need to know that you need to address this otherwise it is 
going to impact your next audit.  So all of those things were done in 
terms of the broader monitoring.  We simply did not have the capacity 
20 
to monitor project implementation at the level of the details of specific 
projects.  Also in the environment at the time Vrede Dairy is not a 
particularly big project.  It might sound big in the sense of R250 
million, R500 millions whatever how many millions it was but in 
comparison to other budgets.   
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 153 of 190 
 
 
When we had to intervene in the Department of Health we were 
looking at accruals of between R700 million and R1.2 billion.  Then 
obviously your focus shifts to where the bigger problem is in – and the 
cows in Vrede had to look after themselves for a while whilst we were 
busy dealing with health.   
 
The following education we had to intervene.  So we had two 
Provincial 
Departments’ 
Health 
and 
Education 
then 
under 
administration of Treasury.  So the environment was very complicated 
and took up quite a significant period of time that would not have 
enabled us to pay detailed minute attention to relatively let me say 
10 
small projects implemented by one department of Agriculture when we 
had the big hitters like education and health that had specific problems 
that had to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MS ROCKMAN:  So the capacity basically of our practical oversight or 
monitoring that capacity just is not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well we will come back to it when you talk about 
the deviation and the implementing agents and so on.  I do not know 
whether you were going to go there already or you still have some other 
topic. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman with your leave I had actually just like Ms 
Rockman to look at her supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And just at least enlighten the Commission on the 
funding sources.  Ms Anna Fourie did tell the Commission that all funds 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 154 of 190 
 
must be paid into the Provincial Revenue Fund.  You are looking for the 
– 13 – HH – Exhibit HH13.1.  It is the smallish file so it is 13.1 it is 
fairly small.  Supplementary affidavit so the new one you sent in day 
before yesterday.  Is that marked 13.1 the file? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No it is 13. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I think the big file on the – to your left is one top of 
your supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the smallest of the lever arch files. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That looks like the right file.  I am going to – you 
are going to take us through that material.  Can I just continue to say 
10 
that of course Ms Fourie did give us a sense of the sources of funding 
and she pointed out at the time that Section 21 to 25 of the PFMA 
which give effect to Sections 226 and 227 of the Constitution regulate 
provincial revenue funds?  That is correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Aha.  Briefly using your supplementary affidavit take 
the Chairman through these funding sources just so that he has a clear 
picture to where money comes from? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay.   
ADV GCABASHE:  For this province. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  For this province and any other province Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Feel free to do it quickly because I have read it and 
ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It is equitable share which every branch of government 
has a share of national revenue and then it splits between the national 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 155 of 190 
 
provincial and local governments whereas well.  That is equitable share 
it is unconditional funding.  It does not come with certain conditions.  
From the equitable share in the Free State the practice was developed 
that a percentage of equitable share was used for infrastructure 
enhancement allocation.   
That is almost like a provincial conditional grant.  It also gets 
published, it gets gazetted after the Appropriation Act gets passed and 
assented to.  You publish your allocations to hospitals, to schools, to 
municipalities and to departments.   
Now the infrastructure enhancement allocation is meant like 
10 
co-funding to where a national department allocates conditional grant 
funding but it is essentially to accelerate infrastructure development.  
Then you would have your provincial own revenue that is basically our 
traffic fines, money that we get from gambling licences and so forth.   
And then the next major source would be the conditional 
grants which comes with specific conditions from specific national 
transferring departments. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I ask you a question in relation to those 
conditional grants?  Is the responsible on the Provincial Treasury that 
dispenses these grants to monitor how they are utilised? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  No. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Does that responsibility lie exclusively with 
…(indistinct) with the national office? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It is between the National Transferring Department and 
the Provincial Receiving Department. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 156 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm.  Does that not open those conditional grants to 
– to abuse in the sense of shifting money from a conditional grant to an 
area that the condition does not cover? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Strictly speaking Chairperson that cannot happen.  
You cannot use ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot shift it? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No you cannot shift it. You cannot use conditional 
grant money for any other purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For anything other than. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Because that would then lead to almost immediate 
10 
withholding of further funds.  And in the case of local government we 
know – we have seen meek money for example utilised for operations.  
National Treasury immediately recovers that money.  So it should not 
happen. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Well this is what I want to interrogate.  Strictly 
speaking it should not happen, I hear what you are saying.  In practice 
does it happen? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I would be hesitant to say it happens at provincial 
government level.  I would concede that it happens at local government 
level far more often. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm.  Okay let us move on from that simply because 
I am trying to rush through the next section. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I wanted to say the answer you gave to Ms 
Gcabashe’s question about whether the Provincial Treasury would have 
a responsibility to monitor whether conditional grants are used by 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 157 of 190 
 
provincial departments for the purposes for which they were given.  You 
said that that responsibility is between the National department and I 
think the department concerned.  I think.. ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes more or less Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you mean that your monitoring obligation does not 
cover that? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Not in any particular detail.  For example we are not a 
party to the process where provincial departments bid for conditional 
10 
grant funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  We do not have insight into what projects get 
presented.  In the case of Agriculture for example.  They had a national 
assessment panel.  Whatever projects get approved and not approved 
the agreement is between that department and the Provincial 
Department.  There is no role that unless a department would ask 
Provincial Treasury must do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The reporting for example – reporting would go 
20 
directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the department. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The national department.  There might as a courtesy 
send us a copy? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 158 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  But it is not limited to Agriculture.  Human Settlements 
for example we have no insight into the Human Settlement system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would the explanation for that be because the 
money does not come from Provincial Treasury. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes I think mostly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be the explanation? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So because the money – that money does not come 
from you therefore you do not have a responsibility of monitoring 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the person or department that grants the 
money is the one that has the responsibility to make sure that the 
money is used for the right purpose? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The Division of Revenue Act annually would set 
out in details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The conditions for such conditional grants and it may 
assign certain responsibilities to treasury as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  But we would – our execution of that would be limited 
20 
by the information obviously we have access to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes but just to – without belabouring the point.  Just 
to make it clear.  Conditional grant funds are processed through the 
Provincial Treasury in that those monies are transferred into the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 159 of 190 
 
Provincial Revenue Fund and then Provincial Treasury dispenses those 
funds to the departments that those funds are supposed to go to? 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that way does the Provincial Treasury act as an 
agent of the national department or do you know whether it simply acts 
in its own right?  You might not know. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That is a – that would be an interesting question.  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  The provision is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But particularly ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Just that all funding have to be paid into the Revenue 
Fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  The departments give us their cash projections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  And we pass on the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might just be a conduit party? 
MS ROCKMAN:  We are basically a conduit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  For the funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But you are also the parties responsible for 
ensuring that the Supply Chain Management Policies and Procedures 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 160 of 190 
 
are complied with by various departments? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Well each department – each Accounting Officer must 
execute his responsibilities or her responsibilities as Accounting Officer 
in respect of Supply Chain Management but then yes as – from 
financial governance perspective of that unit of treasury they would 
exercise oversight over that – over that compliance. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to make sure I understand your answer to that 
question.  To the extent that conditional grants or the expenditure of 
conditional grants is supposed to be subject to PFMA procedures you 
10 
still have the responsibility of monitoring that PFMA procedures are 
complied with by the Provincial Department that receives conditional 
grants.  That part remains yours.  You are not involved in whether they 
should be granted these conditional grants or not but if they are going 
to do anything that falls within the mandate of the Provincial 
government it is your responsibility to monitor whether they comply with 
PFMA procedures? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  We have agreed that in the 2011/2012 financial year 
20 
while you were in the Premier’s office there was no allocation for 
Mohama Mobung or for Vrede made by the relevant department. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 161 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  We then looked at 2012/2013 and we have agreed 
that in that year R12.5 million was made available for Vrede? 
MS ROCKMAN:  So let me just find the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you tell her what you are looking for she might 
assist you. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja.   
ADV GCABASHE:  Maybe if you go to – well page 5 to 6 deals with 
2011/2012. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Then that is followed by 2012/2013.  2012/2013 
10 
starts on page 6?   
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And I suppose the question that I am asking relates 
to what you might have picked up that there is the R12.5 million that 
was allocated to the Vrede Dairy Project but in the same financial year 
a total of R30 million was allocated to Mohama Mobung.  Would that be 
correct?  2012/2013. 
MS ROCKMAN:  If you can give me the paragraph you are making 
reference to? 
ADV GCABASHE:  So we are on – let me just pick this up.  We are on 
20 
page 6 and it is IV where you say: 
“Additional funding from Provincial Owned Revenue 
adjustment amounting to R14.045 million for the 
implementation 
of 
Mohama 
Mobung 
Development 
Program. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 162 of 190 
 
V.  Additional funding from Provincial Revenue 
reserves amounting to R15.955 million for the 
implementation of Mohama Mobung Development 
Program.” 
Page 006 paginated 6.  Page 6 Chairman I should stop saying 
00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:    Paginated page 6.   
MS ROCKMAN:  Thank you.  Yes the ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  So when we total those two amounts Mohama 
10 
Mobung would have received R30 million. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes.  In the 2011/2012 adjustment budget. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ah let us just say that again.  In the 2011/2012 
adjustment ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Budget. 
MS ROCKMAN:  If you go to paragraph F on page 5. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes indeed.  I am there. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But that means that it would then be used in which 
20 
financial year? 
MS ROCKMAN:  In the 2011/2012 financial year. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In the 2011/2012 financial year? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  The year ending 31 March 2012.  So Mohama 
Mobung was not just Vrede Dairy. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 163 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  Correct. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was a lot of other initiatives was part of it.  So this 
indicates additional funding where it came from.  For example they 
received additional funding for disaster management grant for – of 
R4.736.  It is that improvement in condition of service of R1.5.  There 
is R300 000.00 relating to veld fires.  It was a roll-over of R3.4 from 
the previous year for CASP funding.  But then also a decrease in 
current payments of R49.344 million. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So it just sets out all the different changes in the 
10 
2011/2012 financial year. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  Can you do this for me please Ms Rockman?  
Can you keep that page open but can you also pick up your original 
affidavit and can you go to page 16 and 17 of that.  Are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Right. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think so. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So your reference on page 16 under the Mohama 
Mobung framework and I am assuming that we are here dealing with 
budget allocations as you say in 2.2.2 for the 2012/2013 financial year. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You make reference to Annexure ER6. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Please go to Annexure ER6 it is in the same 
document.  You will find it at page 231.  And keep your finger on that 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 164 of 190 
 
page 16.  I just want you to explain this to us.  Here you say at page 
16. 
“The Executive Council discussed the proposed budgets 
of the following departments and agreed to the 
summarised issues relating to these departments.” 
Over the page 3.1. 
“Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. 
D.  Provide more details and plans for dairy parlour and 
processing facility in Vrede at the cost of R13 million I 
presume that should be.” 
10 
Are you with me as far as that is concerned? 
MS ROCKMAN:  I think you lost me several minutes ago. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Do not worry I am bringing you right back to page 
17 or your original affidavit.  You made me read all these papers Ms 
Rockman.  You sent this supplementary through on Monday.  I read it.  
So let us have a look at – and it is a useful document quite frankly.   
I am glad that you did give it to us. Because it elaborates on 
some of the issues you raise in your original affidavit.  So do not think 
that it is not being on any use.  It has really been of use and I am sure 
the Chairman will find quite a lot of value just from having that to 
20 
supplement what you had written in the original document.  So page 17 
of the original document.   
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Then you move – keep your finger there.  You move 
to ER6 because you here refer to ER6.  ER6 is on page 231. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 165 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You are at ER6? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  If you have a look at ER6 for one these are minutes 
dated the 13 t h of June 2012.  
MS ROCKMAN:  ER6? 
ADV GCABASHE:  ER6. 
MS ROCKMAN:  I have it as the Record of Cabinet decision. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  And then it says Cabinet Minute Number. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Oh. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  It does not have a minute number. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  You are correct?  You are at the right document. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So for one the date is not the same date you 
mention in your paragraph 2.2.2 unless I am misreading this.  That is 
the first issue.  The second more material issue is I am really trying to 
locate that R13 million that you say is at paragraph 3.1 of ER6.  There 
is no 3.1.  3.1 D.  There is no 3.1 D at ER6. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair the paragraph 2.2.2 refers to the Exco meeting 
20 
29 February 2012 not to June 2012.   
ADV GCABASHE:  So 2.2.2 refers to an Exco meeting? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja during its deliberations on the proposed budget 
allocations for 2012/2013. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Ja. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 166 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  On 29 February 2012.  I think we might have referred 
to the wrong annexure here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well 2.2.2 refers to Annexures ER5 not ER6 isn’t it? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chair 5 is a completely different document.  It is a 
presentation September 2011 on the Mohama Mobung strategy.   
ADV GCABASHE:  But what I am saying is – is the position that there 
is reference to a wrong annexure there? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes probably. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I think that the issue I can – I would like to think I 
10 
can still raise the issue with you Ms Rockman because you worked is 
with these documents and you are familiar with them.  My real interest 
is in that 13 million under 3.1 D.  I am assuming that minute exists. 
I have no difficulty with that and here you say that the dairy 
parlour and processing facility were going to be put up at a cost of R13 
million. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  That is correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Good.  That minute is February 2012 minute? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Would be and my question really is if the Vrede 
Facility was going to cost 13 million I am assuming it is the same – it is 
working off the 12.5 million we talked about earlier on that had been 
budgeted for ...(intervenes). 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 167 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Because it is the closest to that? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But the entire Mohama Mobung budget for 
2012/2013 was 30 million? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  I think that is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  This 12.5 ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just make sure that you speak loud 
enough that ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your answers will be recorded.  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE:  This 12.5 is it part of the 30 million that was 
allocated to Mohama Mobung because after all Vrede falls within the 
basked of Mohama Mobung Project? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE:  It would? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  When did this 13 million balloon into the royal sum 
of about 572 million – if you take all those 114 million over three years?  
I am really just paraphrasing.  I understand that the facility was doing 
20 
to cost 13 million in February 2012 but as at June 2012 it would appear 
Mr Thabethe thought it was going to cost the department 114 million 
per annum over three years or per financial year over three years.  I do 
not if you have insights into this. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Thank you Chair.  I think we subsequently – I also 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 168 of 190 
 
raised it in the supplementary affidavit that there was a further 
presentation during April where the amount of 13 million was confirmed 
of Vrede Dairy because initially we thought it was a typing error but 
unless it was a consistent typing error throughout a period of time. 
It seems the cost was 13 million but I am not aware how from 
the February presentation, the March presentation or the April 
presentation how it grew from the 13 million to the big mega project 
...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Presented ...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  At Exco in June 2012 which needed additional funding 
of at least 84 million for the first year and then the overall funding. I 
have no insight into how and where that quantum changed and what 
motivated it. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Fair enough you have no idea? 
MS ROCKMAN:  No.  I do not. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Much as you have made inquiries. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Nobody has been able to explain it to you? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  There is no records in Treasury that says there 
was engagements.  It was motivated this way that way.  It is in entirely 
possible that this matter was discussed in the economic cluster and I 
did not attend that cluster meetings. 
It is possible but I have not gone into those kinds of records 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 169 of 190 
 
of – Mr Thabethe probably presented also in these clusters – he did a 
number of presentations but the – that it speaks to elevating the project 
from a relatively small project under Mohama Mobung to the scope that 
was presented in June 2012.  There I have no insight to share. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But what ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it have been – would it be correct to say 
Provincial Treasury would have been expected to keep an eye on such 
things?  Any project within the Provincial Government, any department 
within the Provincial Government that there were – they would have to 
keep an eye if a project was initially said to require a certain amount 
10 
and then at some stage it – as Ms Gcabashe put it balloons into a much 
bigger amount? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  I am sure Chair that this would have taken 
Treasury by surprise almost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they would have asked questions? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It was ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least you would have expected ...(intervenes). 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Them to have done so? 
MS ROCKMAN: 
 
Yes. 
 
Well 
it 
happened 
after 
the 
fact 
but 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Certainly the – in the annual performance plan the 
project was taken up at an affordable level of 13 million.  It states 13 
million.  When the submission came to Exco it did not have – there was 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 170 of 190 
 
previously – it was standard procedure that Exco memorandums with 
financial implications should go to Treasury first for comment and have 
their comments already included before it comes to Exco. 
In this case the – this was not done.  So I think Exco – 
Treasury would have been taken by surprise that there is now suddenly 
a project three months after the start if the financial year that is at a 
much higher – that needs much more funding than what was allocated.  
So I think it would have been obviously a matter of concern. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Can I ask was that a directive that projects with 
financial implications must go via Treasury – Provincial Treasury before 
10 
they are placed before Exco? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair yes.  Exco memorandums – it was my 
understanding by the time I joined Government that it even came from 
the previous term ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Okay. 
MS ROCKMAN:  That it was standard operating procedure that a 
memorandum does not go to Exco without it passing through a cluster 
and if it has financial implications that are not accommodated in the 
budget.  It would go to Treasury to enable Treasury to comment.  To 
say we have funding.  We do not have funding.  This may be possible.  
20 
This may not be possible. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So this is yet another directive that the HOD of the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development did not comply with? 
MS ROCKMAN:  He was not an HOD in the previous term of 
Government that ended 2009 but it would have been I think a standard 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 171 of 190 
 
procedure but it was often not followed. 
ADV GCABASHE:  No.  Maybe I should rephrase the question.  Was 
that particular directive operative in the 2011/2012 financial year? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It would have been. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Good.  So if it was operative and he was employed 
as of August 2011 he would have been able to familiarise himself with 
this particular directive? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  I think so. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Certainly his CFO, Ms Dlamini, would have known 
about it as the CFO? 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:  Senior management in Government should have known 
about it. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So again ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And certainly an Accounting Officer of a department? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  It ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  It would make sense Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:  In the sense of you would not want to take your 
colleagues by surprise ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  In an Exco meeting to say I am coming with this 
project whether or not there is funding or there is funding.  You would 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 172 of 190 
 
consult ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Before you ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  Before you go to Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ROCKMAN:  So I am just not able to comment on whether there 
was that kind of engagement but certainly the Exco memorandum that 
went in June 2012 is silent on that kind of engagement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  So what you are really saying is Exco itself ought to 
have inquired in the debate whether that particular memorandum that 
committed the Departure of Agriculture and Rural Development to this 
huge sum of money had gone via the Provincial Treasury? 
MS ROCKMAN:  (No audible reply). 
ADV GCABASHE:  It ought to have been debated at Exco on the 13 t h 
of June 2012? 
MS ROCKMAN:  It should have been noticed at the very least that it did 
not contain the comments of Provincial Treasury or for that matter I 
think the comments of the State Law Advisors because a standard Exco 
20 
memorandum format provides for legal implications to be set out. 
ADV GCABASHE:  So what we have is as at the 5 t h of June 2012 is this 
– there is this directive that prima faci was not complied with by the 
HOD Agriculture and Rural Development.  Two, Section 38(2) of the 
PFMA says: 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 173 of 190 
 
“You do not commit a department to a liability unless 
you have made provision for it.” 
No provision has been made for this particular project at that 
point in time.  Can I rephrase that? 
MS ROCKMAN:  (No audible reply). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Inadequate provision had been made because 30 
million was sitting there under Mohama Mobung but inadequate 
provision had been made when you look at the 114 million that 
Government was now committed to pay to Estina.  Am I correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Chair I think you are correct.  Accept to say that when 
10 
the HOD Treasury and the MEC Treasury then ultimately signed off that 
fulfilled the requirements of the committing the revenue fund. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But they signed off on the 5 t h of July 2012 
agreement because the 5 t h of June 2012 agreement was found to be 
invalid? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:  And you are saying that the 30 million that was then 
allocated to the Estina Project or the Vrede Dairy Project would have 
come from the Provincial Equitable Fund? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:  I think that is  
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  What you say in - in your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Gcabashe  ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:  Hm. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 174 of 190 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at nine minutes/10 minutes past four.  Let us 
talk about the way forward. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How – at this stage how much more time do you think 
is necessary in terms of hours before we finish? 
ADV GCABASHE:  Chairman I would like to think ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you finish with her. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I would like to think we will be done by lunchtime 
tomorrow.  If you will permit us to run till half past four today unless it 
is not convenient. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV GCABASHE:  The reason I ask Chairman is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  I think I want to squeeze into this area of inquiry 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE: 
 
Just 
a 
question 
whether 
the 
104 
million 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  We know it was not properly budgeted for 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  In the first year that it was supposed to be paid 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 175 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:  And all I really want to know without going into the 
detail budgeting process ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Is whether it was then properly budgeted for and if 
so where.  If we just have a clear indication as to what.  That really is 
the essence of this area Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  We can deal with it in the morning of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We can - maybe we can - we can go up to 16:30 
or if we take a break now then go up to 16:45. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:  My feet are killing me Chairman.  So 16:30 I think is 
about as long as they are going to keep me standing ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GCABASHE:  But I am also trying to - to cut out some of the other 
questions which I know really are ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Not contentious ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Or does not cover contentious material. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  That is fine.  It is just that if we continue 
20 
I think I – we should just take a short break and I am thinking if you 
need 20 minutes – if we take a short break we must compensate for 
that but if you say whether we take a break or not let us stop at 16:30 
our we will because I understand your situation. 
So let – maybe let us take a break now for five minutes and 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 176 of 190 
 
then – but sometimes I say five minutes and five minutes is not 
adequate when you are supposed to start.  So shall we say 20 past - 
we resume at 20 past?  It is now about 11 minutes past. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Yes.  Chairman that is in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and then we can take it from there how far we 
go whether half past or 25 to, ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will – Ms Rockman we normally finish at 
16:00 but we would like to continue.  Is that fine with you? 
MS ROCKMAN:  Yes.   It is fine Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think it is fine with your counsel as well. 
ADV ROELOFFZE:  We have no difficulty Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will adjourn for – and resume at 20 
past.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s continue.   Are you going to prefer half 
past or a little ...(intervenes)  
ADV GCABASHE:   Just a little beyond Chairman it is just a section 
20 
that I am trying to concertina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And just deal with so that tomorrow we just deal 
with one or two areas then we finish earlyish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 177 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:   Thank you Chairman.  Ms Rockman the section I am 
dealing with now really speaks to the budgeting process I suppose but 
the relevance for this inquiry is back to Section 38(2) of the PFMA 
whether in the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015 financial years, I will 
just stop there for current purposes, provision was made for the Vrede 
Dairy project, because that’s what the law requires – the PFMA 
requires. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Thank you Chairperson.   Yes in 2012/2013 financial 
year, I am at the supplementary statement, page 6, there was 
infrastructure enhancement allocation was made available of 41 851 
10 
000 ...(intervenes). 
ADV GCABASHE:   Sorry I – which page are you on?   
MS ROCKMAN:   I am now on seven. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Page 7? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes of the supplementary. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Paragraph B? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes IEA’s okay, I am with you. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, so Agriculture did receive 41.8 for infrastructure 
enhancement allocation. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   The overall budget made provision for – the overall 
budget was R579 482 000, prioritising amongst others Mohama Mobung 
development of an agriculture master plan and refurbishment of 
veterinary laboratories.  Then there was the presentation dealing with 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 178 of 190 
 
the infrastructure projects, that was on 7 March and 4 April respectively 
2012 now. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Agriculture only presented on the 4 t h of April and that 
supplementary, the next year is 5A which confirmed the budget of R13 
million. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes, what I would like to understand is where the 
114 million for the 2012/2013 financial year came from, I don’t know if 
you are able to lead us to those particular numbers.   If it’s something 
you would rather do first thing in the morning again I am quite 
10 
comfortable with that, because I think the information is spread 
between the two affidavits. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, between the two affidavits ja, if we can deal with 
that in the morning it might be easier. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Okay, let’s do that.  Can I then ask you to please 
take the Chairman back to your original affidavit, that is Volume A, take 
the Chairman through what you refer to as the critical decision points 
of an annual budget process, and I assume you mean by this that it 
should be regular and within the framework of the law these are must 
do’s, and I point you here to paragraphs 1.8.1 to 1.8.4 possibly of your 
20 
affidavit if I have it right. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Thank you Chair.  Essentially there is prioritisation 
stage which happens between April to September where we determine 
priorities to be implemented over a forthcoming financial year and the 
MTF that gets drawn from your national priorities, your outcome based 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 179 of 190 
 
priorities, what was in your strategic framework and so forth.  Then its 
preparation and review of – for the medium term expenditure 
framework, that’s between April and August, National and Provincial 
Departments.  July/August it’s what I’ve referred to previously as the 
July and August National Treasury visits.   We look at a macroeconomic 
fiscal framework, there’s a division of revenue between the three 
spheres of government.   
 
During I think it’s around August every year that is where 
there’s a special cabinet meeting which considers the recommendations 
of National Treasury, it would have gone through the whole process 
10 
now of consultation within the different MINMEC’s, within the different 
inter-governmental forums, relating to different sectors.  The Budget 
Council would have met, that’s the Minister of Finance with all the 
MEC’s Finance, SALGA is represented there, we also meet as Budget 
Forum then with the MEC’s of COGTA.  Then there’s a special cabinet 
meeting that gets called, it’s every year, and Premiers and MEC’s 
finance are invited to attend a part of that, so cabinet more or less 
finalises then Premiers and MEC’s come in, the Minister of Finance 
does the briefing indicating these are our challenges, this is the 
direction we want to take, Premiers, MEC’s can make input to say but 
20 
we can’t continue carrying the impact of improvement of conditions of 
service, we have this priority, that priority, but fundamentally that is the 
overall allocations is decided, and in that meeting. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And you have to then go back to your Provinces 
and work within that framework? 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 180 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes.  If you thought you were going to get R100 and 
you only got 75 it was now your job to go back, start cutting back 
projects, informing departments, unfortunate we cannot accommodate 
this, that and whatever so go back review, make your adjustments, 
defer projects, scale down projects, look at different phases, look at 
different implementation models, see where we can gain efficiencies 
and so forth and so forth, it becomes a very, a technical process but 
you need political buy-in from all your MEC’s, not only in the Free State 
but in every other Province I am sure the Minister of Finance had that 
battle at National Government level to get everyone on board, to 
10 
understand that there really is an end to money.  We don’t have 
unlimited sources of funding.    
 
Then we would go through the MTEC hearings.  In our case 
National Treasury in all provinces participates in Provincial MTEC  
hearings but we would also if there were specific areas of concern like 
in our case we would standardly invite the National Department of 
Health for Health session, the Department of Basic Education for 
education, Human Settlements for human settlements, so you would 
invite your National counterparts to get a broader understanding of 
what our challenges are but also from their perspective what they think 
20 
we should be doing better, or more efficiently, it’s quite a dynamic 
process then. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Without cutting you short can I ask you to skip 
through some of the other material and go down to 1.8.10 which I think 
directly relates to the Provincial Treasury. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 181 of 190 
 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And that fits in with the oversight issues that we 
have been dealing with today. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, Chair just to conclude that process of the budget 
would then culminate after PMTEC hearings you go through your 
adjustment budget process and that concludes almost a financial year 
in our case we still gave room around December for departments, 
everyone protects their money and we would bring either a second 
adjustment appropriation or a second adjustment appropriation where 
we cleaned out any possible under spending and reallocate it.  That 
10 
concludes then the whole budget process by a certain financial year. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Can you correct me if I’m wrong, the most 
important thing about any reallocation or readjustment of the budget is 
it can only be done in terms of Section 31 of the PFMA? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes ...(intervenes).  
ADV GCABASHE:   Those are the bases on which you can ask for more 
or shift monies around etcetera, etcetera. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes the PFMA spells it out quite clearly, unforeseen, 
unavoidable expenditure, emergency funding, money that may have 
become available to the Province, conditional grant rollovers which 
20 
usually happens after the main budget is approved and then your 
technicalities, your defraying of expenditure between votes and savings 
and you can shift money within your budget in terms of the Act.  It 
would not be expected that you introduce an entirely new project in an 
adjustment budget, because that undermines the purpose of why you 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 182 of 190 
 
did your annual performance plan.  It is systematic, government likes 
systems and processes and we walk smoothly until we reach a stage 
where we can properly plan and make budget provision. 
ADV GCABASHE:   You know I am sure I misunderstood Mr Thabethe 
but my recollection seems to be that, and I will check this Chairman, 
that he said that the Estina Vrede project, the shortfall was brought to 
one of these adjustment budget processes, but that can’t be right if you 
say you can’t bring a new project into an adjustment process, unless I 
am just not understanding something very well. 
MS ROCKMAN:   I think it was that first year. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes, correct.  It would have been the first year. 
MS ROCKMAN:   It would be the first year where it was under-funded. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Correct. 
MS ROCKMAN:   So it was not an entirely new project but to come up 
with the difference in the funding required that was a quantum that 
would have been challenging for Treasury. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Oh so they were quite entitled as Department of 
Agriculture and Rural Development to come to the adjustment process 
and say we have a project, we had under-budgeted for it and if there is 
money available can you move something around and make sure that 
20 
we have sufficient funds. 
MS ROCKMAN:   That is correct, because at the time the submission 
was approved in June 2012, they had amended their Table B5 
infrastructure project list Chairperson so if those – if that project on 
that project list is not created on the system you are unable to allocate 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 183 of 190 
 
and transfer funding in respect of those projects, so the problem was 
that it was substantially underfunded, but they did bring it in 
marginally, for the R13 million issue. 
ADV GCABASHE:   And they were entitled to do so, so his evidence 
was actually quite consistent with what you are saying, that they were 
able to bring it and they got whatever you were able to give them. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, he could not have done it if it was not in the APP 
or nowhere at all. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Ja, no that helps clear that particular issue up.  
Then I was then just asking you to very briefly look at 1.8.10 on page 
10 
12, which I believe is consistent with the oversight issues we’ve been 
raising. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes that is now a financial governance process, that 
process is led by our Provincial Accountant General, at the time that 
was Ms Fourie.  I think I have made reference to the key control matrix 
reports, the engagements with the Auditor-General, engagements with 
the CFO Forums, we do reviews of the draft annual financial 
statements, give feedback to departments to say you need to amend, 
adjust, correct, whether they do or don’t has a direct impact on your 
audit process. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE:   If they ignore your advice there’s nothing you can 
do about that? 
MS ROCKMAN:   They pay the price in audit. 
ADV GCABASHE:   In audit? 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, in audit outcome. 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 184 of 190 
 
ADV GCABASHE:   But of course, anyway we will talk about that 
tomorrow, they then engage audit and tell audit why they believe they 
have complied and agreed to differ with audit. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE:   I really am talking about facts that relate to Estina 
but we will deal with them in the morning. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So that is not a particularly effective stick because 
they can literally just argue and say we are right, if you think we are 
wrong tough cookies. 
10 
MS ROCKMAN:   A lot of is technical interpretation and there is a lot of 
constructive engagements Chairperson with the office of the Auditor-
General, Treasury and the Department but if a Department is adamant 
that they are right there is little we can do to force an Accounting 
Officer to reclassify for example expenditure, that we don’t have that 
capacity or power. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So again by way of example this is precisely why 
National Treasury had to intervene and issue a new directive in relation 
to how to classify goods and services and how to classify transfer 
payments? 
20 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV GCABASHE:   So it came from the top to be able to regulate what 
happened at Province. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Yes, because ultimately we – the ultimate authority is 
the National Accounting and General Accounting Standards Board, so if 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 185 of 190 
 
all of us small people here sit and disagree with each other you defer 
to the proper authority. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Absolutely.   The last couple are that the asset and 
liability component that’s the same one that Mr Myburgh for instance 
was a part of that went to do the inspection – the site visit at Vrede? 
MS ROCKMAN:   I am not 100% sure whether at that stage, there was a 
small restructuring internally in Treasury.  I think at one stage the 
budget component overlapped with asset and liability but later it 
separated, so sustainable resource management became our budget 
division and Mr Myburgh was part of that and assets and liabilities was 
10 
about provincial asset and liability management.  They for example 
would take care of transversal contracts and so forth, which had 
nothing to do with the sustainable resource management unit. 
ADV GCABASHE:   But again just to make this a practical example 
when we get to dealing with the assets of the Vrede Dairy Project as at 
August 2014 when the Free State Development Corporation took over 
this is the unit that ought to be involved in discussions around who 
those assets belong to, would that be correct? 
MS ROCKMAN:   No that would be between the relevant asset divisions 
of departments that are affected but with us the Provincial Accountant 
20 
General played a much stronger role.   That is why when the agreement 
was finally cancelled Provincial Accountant General was the one 
coordinating with Public Works to say this agreement is cancelled, 
make sure that you disclose the land of, that was part of this land use 
agreement, or the 99 year lease agreement, that was taken up in the 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 186 of 190 
 
Asset Register of Public Works.  Our Provincial Accountant General and 
the State Law Advisors made sure that that was done.  It had little to 
do with our asset and liability unit.   We treated it as a matter arising 
from Audit and the Audit Intervention Committee and therefore the PGA 
and the State Law Advisors was driving that process, together with the 
CFO of Public Works, Agriculture had no role to play because Public 
Works own all land on behalf of Government, we would not transfer the 
land to Agriculture. 
ADV GCABASHE:   That clarifies the point on land, but if you look at 
tractors, cattle, buildings at the Vrede Dairy Farm there is a debate, or 
10 
there was a debate about who those assets belong to, we will deal with 
it in detail tomorrow, I just want to understand Provincial Treasury’s 
role in helping clarify who those assets would actually belong to. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Our advice at the time is that – because it’s almost 
inventory items, it’s not assets-assets, that the Department of 
Agriculture and Rural Development should bring it into their annual 
financial statements as work in progress, until the beneficiaries had 
come on board or whatever matters were finalised and it would then be 
transferred to the beneficiaries, but the vacuum that then was created 
is that there’s all these assets lying around after the termination of the 
20 
Estina agreement but no one is disclosing it anywhere.   It was not 
FTC’s responsibility because they were not appointed to take over the 
assets, they were there to manage the assets, so the feeling and the 
advice from Provincial Treasury was Agriculture bring this into your 
financial statements, at least disclose it as work-in-progress.  For 
16 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 181 
 
Page 187 of 190 
 
various reasons they did not accept that advice. 
ADV GCABASHE:   We will debate that tomorrow, particularly in the 
context of implementing agents, what their functions are, who they are, 
whose assets they are handling etcetera, etcetera, and I think that will 
fit into that particular – if you don’t mind you will go back to giving us 
this example, we will deal with it in that manner. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Chair that takes us to page 15 of this document and 
I can safely stop here because we then deal with other issues that 
covers that budgeting process adequately. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we will stop here.  Tomorrow you said you think 
we will finish by lunch time.  I would like us to finish within one and a 
half hours, at the most two hours.    
ADV GCABASHE:   I think it can be done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not because of anything, just because of my 
thinking that a lot of things are not in dispute, okay, alright. 
ADV GCABASHE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, we will adjourn now and we will start at 
10:00? 
ADV GCABASHE:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will start at 10:00, we will resume at 10:00 
tomorrow. 
MS ROCKMAN:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
