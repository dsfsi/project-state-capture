PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 14 MAY 2021 
DOROTHY:  Chair the first witness to testify this morning is 
Dorothy.  She has taken the oath before you in chambers 
and an application 
has been 
granted 
by yourself in 
chambers under Application Number SEQ27/2021.  The 
order should be on your desk before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just for the benefit of the public we 
are starting late because the witnesses who are going to 
give evidence today are witnesses whose identity needs to 
be protected and the delay is connected with the logistics 
10 
that needed to be attended to in order to make sure that 
they have taken the oath and are able to testify.   
 
I have considered an application for an order aimed 
at protecting the identity of the witnesses concerned in 
regard to each witness and I have been satisfied that in 
each case a proper case has been made out for an order 
protecting their identity. 
 
I am going to read out one order and not all three 
because they are basically the same except for the names.  
That is correct Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if I may just place on record the 
orders that you have granted in chambers and will announce 
now are in respect of Dorothy, Frank and Steven. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 4 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes I see that one is under the 
number that you gave earlier plus 01.  Another one – are 
they all under 01 – that gave their applications. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The other one is SEQ26 and the 
third one is SEQ04/2021 just for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   I am going to deal with the 
one for Frank.   
 
The order I grant in respect of Frank is the following. 
1. The application – this application may be heard in 
camera and without notice to affected parties. 
10 
2. The 
witness 
– 
the 
witness 
referred 
to 
in 
this 
application and who is scheduled to testify today is to 
be referred to as Frank during his testimony before the 
commission and thereafter insofar as matters relating 
to the commission are concerned. 
3. The witness identity all not be disclosed or published 
in any manner. 
4. The names and initials of the witness shall be 
redacted 
from 
all 
affidavits 
and 
documentation 
presented in evidence – presented in evidence. 
20 
5. When the  witness testifies before the commission  
5.1 
No photograph or video or other image of the 
witness may be taken or published or broadcast. 
5.2 
No 
person 
may 
photograph 
or 
publish 
any 
photograph 
or 
other 
image 
of 
any 
person 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 5 of 133 
 
engaged in and or responsible for the protection 
of the witness when he gives evidence. 
5.3 
The 
witness 
need 
not 
be 
present 
at 
the 
commission’s hearing venue – that is the hearing 
venue and give evidence but he may instead give 
his evidence from a separate and undisclosed 
location – the protected witness location. 
5.4 
No camera will be permitted in the protected 
witness location. 
5.5 
No person other than the Chairperson, members 
10 
of the commission’s legal team, the commission’s 
safety and security advisor those necessary to 
assist or protect the witness when he give 
evidence 
or 
another 
person 
specifically 
designated by the Chairperson will be permitted 
to enter the protected witness location without 
the prior written permission of the Chairperson. 
5.6 
The oath or affirmation 5.6 is to be deleted. So 
5.7 becomes  5.6. 
5.6 
An audio link from the protected witness location 
20 
will be provided so that the witness evidence can 
be heard in the commission’s hearing venue 
when such evidence is given. 
5.7 
Subject to the usual rules applicable to the 
conduct of the commission’s proceedings. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 6 of 133 
 
5.8.1 Members of the public including the media 
may be present in the hearing venue in such 
numbers as may be directed by the Chairperson. 
5.8.2 Sound reaching the hearing venue via the 
audio link from the protected witness location 
may be broadcast and proceedings in the hearing 
venue may be filmed and 00:07:30.   
I think the old 6 does not seem to be necessary Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Not necessary Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Okay. And then to the old 7 
becomes 6. 
6. This order may be amended or supplemented by the 
Chairperson at any time if in his opinion that is 
necessary to protect the witness or any person in 
connection with the witness evidence or to ensure then 
as to any implicated person. 
That is the order and that order is also granted in relation 
to witness referred to as Dorothy and where in this order it 
says Frank it will say Dorothy in the case of the order 
20 
relating to Dorothy.   
 
And the same order is granted in regard to – in 
relation to a witness to be referred to as  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Stephen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Stephen and where reference is made to 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 7 of 133 
 
Frank the reference in the case of the order relating to 
Stephen will be a reference to Stephen. 
 
So all those orders have been granted. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair as you are 
aware Dorothy is now available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To begin her testimony.  She is 
legally represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And may her representative place 
10 
himself on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please. 
ADV RENDANI: Chair Advocate Vumbe Rendani.  Chair I 
must just note that previously I have been appearing under 
instruction of P G Maseko.  I must just note the Chair that 
there have been some change.  I am formally now on

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV RENDANI:  However I must note that Ms Palesa 
Maseko is here. She will also note appearance on behalf of 
20 
Dorothy and with that regard she will further address the 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well are you appearing for Dorothy? 
ADV RENDANI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if you are appearing you are the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395

ADV RENDANI:  Chair Ms Palesa Maseko will continue to 
receive correspondence on behalf of Dorothy and she will 
also be communicating with Chair.  Also with the employer

ADV RENDANI:  With the secretary of the commission 
correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV RENDANI:  Myself I will be on brief from the State 
Attorney officially from today.  The issue has been on the 
pipeline but it has been resolved and I can confirm that I 
have got instruction formally from the State Attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  I do not know what 
the issue is but I probably do not need to know as long as 
you confirm you are appearing for Dorothy you have – you 
have been instructed by attorneys that is – that is fine. 
ADV RENDANI:  Thank you Chair.

have enquired insofar as the client is concerned and the 
documentary evidence that was presented to me.

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well we will see how matters turn

14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 11 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair.  I am glad to hear there is no 
conflict. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  According to my learned friend but 
when we get to the detail it may turn out differently.

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the documentation relevant to 
Dorothy’s evidence appears in Exhibit YY12 in Bundle 
10 
SSA02(a). 
ADV RENDANI:  Chair I am sorry to interfere.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV RENDANI:   Chair if I am correct I think Mr Pretorius 
did mention the fact that the oath has already been taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it has been. 
ADV RENDANI:   Yes and my client just asked me to humbly 
request that she would like to address the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV RENDANI:   Before anything else.

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV RENDANI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay – no, okay that is fine.  Yes Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Dorothy are you there? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 12 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes I am here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you wish to say anything to the 
Chair before you commence your evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her picture does not appear we just see 
her name. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes I would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We just see her – oh no her picture is not 
supposed to appear.  No, no that is alright I forgot that she 
– her picture is not supposed to appear.  Dorothy are you 
ready?  I understand that you would like to address me 
10 
before you start giving your evidence. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes I am ready Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh please go ahead. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  Thank you for allowing me – okay 
thank you for allowing me to put my version forward and 
speak out against the old allegations that have in the 
course of the commission been said against me. 
 
I have over the years served my country with great 
20 
pride and joy.  Never at once with any malicious or personal 
saving intent.  Taking into account the nature of the work 
that I did I have further had to compromise on my personal 
life because the code of conduct that all served by was that 
the safety of the state and those under our care was always 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 13 of 133 
 
above our own personal lives. 
 
This 
led 
to 
me 
suffering 
a 
great 
deal 
and 
compromising much of what being human encompasses. 
 
As I sit here today I can confirm that I carried out all 
my duties to the best of my ability.  Following all the rules, 
procedures and observed protocols that were set in place 
and never serving my own personal interests. 
 
Given the nature of the sector that I worked for I 
would like to point out that in keeping in line with the one 
principle 
that 
governs 
our 
behaviour 
that 
being 
10 
confidentiality. 
 
I carried out every single one of my duties on a need 
to know basis careful to never cross lines or go beyond my 
scope of which – of work which was a doctrine that I 
understood from day 1. 
 
Any questions asked were always only in line with 
gaining and understanding of what I was being tasked to do 
and thus subsequently coming out – carrying out that task.  
It is safe to say that I was always careful not to ask for 
more. 
20 
 
It 
is 
my 
intention 
in 
sitting 
here 
today 
and 
participating in this commission to testify to the best of my 
ability and work through with the commission to ensure that 
all questions are answered and endeavours of today are 
met.  I thank you.   
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 14 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Dorothy.  I have 
already expressed the commission’s appreciation when you 
were taking the oath privately for your making yourself 
available to the commission to assist it.  We understand 
from what I read in the affidavits that it is not easy but I 
appreciate that nevertheless you – you and others are 
making yourselves available to assist this commission.  So I 
just want you to repeat that publicly that we appreciate that 
you have availed yourself to assist the commission. 
MS DOROTHY:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Chair the exhibit which 
contains all the documents relevant to Dorothy’s evidence is 
Exhibit YY12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There are a number of documents 
including more than one affidavit attested to by Dorothy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Over a period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I – with your leave may I ask the 
witness to identify each relevant document when we get to 
it? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 15 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  But for the 
moment may the documentation contained in Exhibit YY12 
be put before you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – there are – there are two or more 
affidavits by Dorothy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair they are all – referred to 
in the index. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which is at page 419.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 419.2 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  SSA04. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Now to the extent 
that any document or affidavit is an annexure to the main 
affidavit they would fall under the main affidavit as an 
exhibit.  But to the extent that there are affidavits that are 
standalone then they would need to be separate exhibits we 
can admit them as and when we get to them. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is fine Chair.  The affidavit that 
we will commence with is the affidavit that appears at page 
12 to 26. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 16 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  12 to  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of the exhibit but of the bundle 
black number 431 to 445. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja I think – I think if you use the 
bundle number or the pagination of the bundle that will 
make life – my life easier. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We use the black numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  431. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 431 that is where it starts. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you want her to identify that 
affidavit and… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes perhaps we should start there 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us do that so that I can admit it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Dorothy… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Properly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you please go to page 431 of 
the bundle – SSA02. 
20 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the first page of your affidavit 
in that bundle? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if you could go please to page 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 17 of 133 
 
445 whose signature… 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes I confirm that is me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that your signature? 
MS DOROTHY:  That is mine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you attested to this before 
a Commissioner of Oaths on the 2 n d of March 2021 is that 
correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And as far as you are 
concerned are the contents of this affidavit to the best of 
10 
knowledge true and correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair may this affidavit then be 
admitted? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be Exhibit YY 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  12.1 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  12.1 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  The affidavit of Dorothy that 
starts at page 431 will be admitted as an Exhibit and will be 
20 
marked as Exhibit YY12.1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Dorothy if you could go to page 420 
please and we at all times referring to the numbers in the 
top left hand corner of each page.   
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 18 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is it correct that on the 20 t h January 
2021 the commission addressed to yourself a request for an 
affidavit to deal with various matters and that is the 
document 
that 
appears 
– 
appears 
at 
page 
420 
and 
following? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the affidavit that has just been 
admitted by the Chair is the affidavit that you provided to 
the commission in response to that request for an affidavit, 
is that correct? 
10 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So – so what we are going to do is 
to go through your affidavit and at times refer back to the 
questions that were asked giving rise to your answer in the 
affidavit.  If we could just do it that way please.  The 
questions are set out in Annexure A to the request for 
affidavit at page 422 to 424 can you just confirm that 
please? 
MS DOROTHY:  I confirm true. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so if we go now to page 431 
20 
which is your affidavit I am not going to refer to your 
previous 
positions 
at 
the 
request 
of 
your 
legal 
representatives to avoid ease of identity of yourself. So if 
we can go – your background is however set out there.  You 
have a long experience of employment within the SSA, is 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 19 of 133 
 
that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we will leave the detail in the 
written affidavit.  But if we could go briefly to describe the 
system of dealing with cash because it becomes relevant 
later in your testimony and in the testimony of other 
witnesses. There is a process that you set out in paragraph 
4 that applies when cash is withdrawn from the SSA for 
special operations through the use of temporary advances.  
You set that out in paragraph 4.  You see that? 
10 
MS DOROTHY:  Is that at para 4? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No it at para 3. 
MS DOROTHY:  Or 3? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph number 4 on page 432. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  AT para 3. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay at para 3 okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you could just briefly describe 
step by step please the various steps you set out in 
paragraph 4. 
20 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You can … 
MS DOROTHY:  Cash was withdrawn from the SSA for 
CDSO through the temporary advance system.  A TA 
required that the member taking the advance to compile a 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 20 of 133 
 
memorandum 
known 
as 
a 
submission 
requesting 
the 
advance and motivating the use of the funds for the 
specified operation of project. 
 
Once a submission has been approved by the person 
with the delegation of authority to do so which was 
dependent on the amount requested the member would then 
make an application on a green TA form and hand this to the 
finance chief directorate with the authorised submission to 
process the payment. 
 
The chief directorate finance would then issue a TA 
10 
number to enable the member to withdraw the agreed 
amount of funds in the form of cash and or electronic funds 
transfer. 
 
After the funds had been withdrawn and used the 
member was then required to settle that advance which 
required that he or she provide the finance directorate with 
a signed receipt of funds and or invoice when services were 
rendered. 
 
Establishing 
that 
the 
funds 
been 
utilised 
as 
contemplated in the submission settlement advance… 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just before you go on. 
MS DOROTHY:  Also required that part A – okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Dorothy before you go on I would 
like to just ask you one question.  When you say in line 3 of 
the second part of the paragraph which required that he/she 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 21 of 133 
 
provide the finance chief directorate with a signed receipt of 
the funds or an invoice when services were rendered the 
receipt of the funds would be signed – would that be by the 
for example a source who received the funds?  Who would 
sign the receipt of the funds? 
MS DOROTHY:   It would be the service – it would vary.  It 
would either be the service provider, it could be anybody 
because when you signed receipt it varies whatever service 
that that member was going to provide – whatever project 
that – so it would vary.  It cannot – I cannot specifically say 
10 
it is a source or it is – it could be anyone. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright it could be a source? 
MS DOROTHY:  It could be a service provider to a 
company. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes or it could be a source I 
presume.  In other words the final recipient of the funds. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would sign the receipt is that 
correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Excuse me Chair I did not hear that part. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright presumably when cash is 
withdrawn and goes out. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of the SSA to its final destination. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 22 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is the final destination whether 
that be a service provider or a source or any other 
destination that would sign the receipt, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like there is a delay in whenever 
anybody speaks then she takes long to respond. Dorothy 
can you hear me? 
MS DOROTHY:  Chair.  Hello. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I can hear you.  Do you hear us 
quickly when we speak 
MS DOROTHY:  Oh okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or does it take time before you hear what 
we are saying? 
MS DOROTHY:  No there was a slight – there was a slight  
CHAIRPERSON:  Delay. 
MS DOROTHY:  Interference just little bit but I heard what 
he said.  I think you said that the signed receipt would be 
signed by the – by the source.  I did not – can you please 
just repeat it one more time for me. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Oh. 
That 
was 
the 
evidence 
leader 
speaking to you.  It is the Chairperson speaking to you now.  
20 
So I am just checking whether there is a delay in you 
hearing what we are saying.  I see you do take a little bit of 
time before responding so I do not know whether it is the 
delay or what. 
MS DOROTHY:  I heard you now Chair. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 23 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DOROTHY:  Clearly.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you feel like there is a delay or you do 
not think there is a delay? 
MS DOROTHY:  So I do know if Mr Pretorius will start – I 
hear him but 00:30:40. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you feel like there is a delay or you do 
not feel that there is any delay before you can hear us? 
MS DOROTHY:  There is a delay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is not long but if it – if the 
10 
technicians can attend to it that would help.  I will assume 
that they can attend to it while we are – we continue.  So let 
us continue.  Yes Mr Pretorius had asked you to confirm 
whether the source or the service provider or the final 
destination of the cash would be required to sign the 
receipt.  That was his last question. 
MS DOROTHY:  Definitely they would be expected to sign 
the receipt. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Dorothy if you would then 
go.  That receipt then would establish that the funds had 
been utilised as contemplated in the submission.  You say 
then at the end of that sentence. If you could just continue 
then settling an advance. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 24 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  Settling an advance also requires 
that part B of the TA form be completed by the member for 
approval by way of the line manager.  Once part B of the TA 
form had been signed the claim would be settled by the 
chief finance directorate and the TA was then removed from 
the member’s name. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it by way of the signature of the line 
manager – the approval. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now if you could just explain I 
understand that when the temporary advance is removed 
from the member ’s name the member would no longer be 
responsible for that amount and will therefore not be 
required to repay it if called upon to do so. Do I understand 
that correctly? 
MS DOROTHY:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  If you could on then to 
paragraph 5.  You continue with the process that is 
required. 
MS DOROTHY:  Here it is in relation to cash withdrawals.  
All cash TA’s requested had to be any withdrawal thereof.  
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 25 of 133 
 
On any TA requested and approved if the amounts and fell 
short of the amount taken no cash was returned the amount 
of the unpaid funds would be loaded on the system and 
deducted from the member’s salary. 
 
Should there be monies outstanding or not settled by 
the member they would not be allowed to take out any 
further money until the advance taken by them is fully 
settled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right if you could just read the first 
sentence again please of paragraph 5.  There was an 
10 
interruption in the transmission. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  All cash temporary advance 
requested had to be authorised by the CFO before any 
withdrawal thereof. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay if we could… 
MS DOROTHY:  On any TA requested and approved if the 
amount of money spent fell short of the amount taken and 
no cash was returned the amount of the unpaid funds would 
be loaded on the system and deducted from the member’s 
salary.  Should there be monies outstanding or not settled 
20 
by the member they would not be allowed to take out any 
further money until the advance taken by them is fully 
settled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now Dorothy there has been 
substantial evidence in regard to the required procedures 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 26 of 133 
 
within SSA for the use of cash and in respect of the use of 
temporary advances.  I am not going to take you to all that 
evidence I just want to highlight one issue and that is where 
a 
member 
has 
not 
settled 
a 
temporary 
advance 
in 
accordance with this procedure or at all that member is not 
allowed to withdraw further monies.  That is what you say 
here, is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that system can be circumvented 
avoided if that member says look I do not have authority 
10 
now to withdraw money or cash but I can ask someone else 
to do it for me.  There is evidence that that happened. Do 
you know of that? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes it has happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. If we could then go on please 
to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius just before you go 
– or let me just get clarification. Dorothy so the process of 
obtaining cash which you have described it starts with the 
member who feels that he needs or she needs cash, is that 
20 
correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that member must prepare what is 
referred to or must prepare a memorandum that you say is 
referred to as a submission, is that correct? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 27 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in that memorandum or submission he 
or she will state how much they need and for what purpose 
and they will motivate for the grant of that cash, is that 
correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who does he or she submit that 
memorandum to?  Is it their line manager or is it somebody 
who may not be their line manager but who has certain 
responsibilities? 
10 
MS DOROTHY:  It is the line manager and line management 
from the chief directorate finance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do they submit it to two places? 
MS DOROTHY:  They do – to the line manager of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the member. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the chief directorate of finance. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes.  It would be the line manager of the 
chief directorate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay please just repeat that 
20 
MS DOROTHY:  Hello.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat your answer. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  It would be line manager of the 
member requesting the funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 28 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  And to a certain extent the line manager of 
00:37:54 depending on the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh will he – will he or she submit the 
memorandum to two people? 
MS DOROTHY:  It is quite a number of people Chair it is not 
only two people it is quite a number of recommenders and 
finally to the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but in terms of the person to whom 
the member submits the memorandum is it to one person 
who must then escalate it if to various people must all 
10 
recommend or the member must go from one office to 
another to submit it? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes in our case it is the member that takes 
it from office to another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS DOROTHY:  Because we did not have systems at 
00:38:47. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And – but ultimately did say the – 
the final person is – is a finance person who must give 
approval? 
20 
MS DOROTHY:  The approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is it the CFO or is it somebody else? 
MS DOROTHY:  No, no it is – okay the CFO only comes in if 
the member is requesting cash.  It is the CFO that can 
authorise.  Right you can receive cash or not. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 29 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay the – we only talking about a 
member who – who wants cash. So are you saying that in 
all cases where a member requires cash the CFO must 
approve before cash can be withdrawn? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. And is the CFO the final 
authority to approve? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes on the green form there is a portion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  There is a portion for the CFO. 
MS DOROTHY:  On the green  form there is a portion that 
10 
allocates 00:40:06.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Thank you.  If we could go 
over the page please to paragraph 6.  There was in the SSA 
a directorate responsible for ensuring the protection of the 
then President Mr Jacob Zuma and the then Deputy 
President Mr Ramaphosa.  Is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you set out the duties of 
the directorate within the SSA in that regard in paragraph 6 
20 
but I would like to go onto paragraph 7 please on page 435.  
You refer there to two groups of individuals referred to as 
co-workers. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who were recruited and trained to 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 30 of 133 
 
be utilised by the SSA.  Would you tell the Chair about 
those two groups please? 
MS DOROTHY:  Two groups of individuals whom we refer to 
as co-workers were recruited and trained and utilised by 
SSA.  The first group was recruited by Mr Dlomo when he 
was then General Manager at Special Operations. 
 
The second group was recruited by him after his 
appointment as the DDG upon his request for Curricula 
Vitae of potential recruits. 
 
These with my knowledge they were contracted 
10 
between them and SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so you have left out some 
words there if I can just fill them in. 
MS DOROTHY:  (Inaudible.) 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The first group was recruited by Mr 
T Dlomo when he was General Manager at SO. The second 
group was recruited by Mr T Dlomo after his appointment as 
the DGG upon his request for Curricula Vitae of the 
potential recruits.  These were not SSA members however 
to my knowledge there were contracts between them and 
20 
SSA.  Have I read you affidavit correctly? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes if you could go onto the next 
paragraph please or the next sub-paragraph. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  On the – on the instruction of Mr T 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 31 of 133 
 
Dlomo we at SO utilise individuals from these groups 
including the PSS.  To my knowledge the co-workers 
employed in Special Operations were paid monthly salaries 
through one of our companies by our HR consultant at 
CDSO. 
 
May I continue? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja I think leave out the next 
paragraph because it refers to your office but read the 
paragraph 
begging 
with 
the 
words 
“About 
fourteen 
members” please. 
10 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Or tell the Chair about that. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  About fourteen members from the 
second group who were sitting at home after their training 
were then assigned to assist us at PSF. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright now the point that you are 
making here I think and this evidence must be regarded or 
had regard to in connection with other evidence that has 
been given but co-workers recruited and trained to be 
utilised by the SSA in various tasks were not members of 
20 
the SSA but were paid by the SSA salaries to do their work.  
Is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  If we could go then to 
paragraph 10 over the page please on page 436.   
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 32 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just announce Mr Pretorius that we will 
not be taking the tea break because of the time we lost 
earlier. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sure thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ja.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you go please to paragraph 
10 on page 436. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now you will see there a 
spreadsheet format of references to the questions in the 
10 
request for affidavit that we referred to earlier and your 
comments in relation to those question in the box on the 
right hand side.   
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now if we can deal with the first 
box. It says in the left hand column ad para 9a. That is a 
reference to the request for an affidavit sent to you on the 
20 t h of January and if we could go to annexure A and look at 
paragraph 9 on page 422 please.   
 
Paragraph 9 says and I am going to read it. 
20 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you can confirm to me if I have 
read it correctly. 
“It is pointed out that the electronic TA record provided to 
the commission by SSA reflects that you were involved in 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 33 of 133 
 
the withdrawal of R38.5 million in cash over the period 
March 2014 to September 2016.  You are required to 
provide a full account of the aforementioned withdrawals 
including the amount of – and then we get to  
a. R1 million allegedly used to pay MK veterans at the 
rally 
held 
by 
the 
ANC 
on 
8 
January 
2016 
in 
Rustenburg.” 
And in answer to a request for an explanation in relation to 
that expenditure you make a comment.  What is that 
comment and we are back at page 436? 
10 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  By instruction of Mr Dlomo this was 
in relation to the rally held by the ANC on the 8 January 
2016 in Rustenburg.  We used MK veterans who were 
deployed to the Royal Bafokeng Stadium to assist with 
identifying and reporting on potential disruptive behaviour 
of attendees at the events.  The funds were utilised to cover 
their 
expenses 
such 
as 
00:37:22 
student 
deployment 
transport 
fees, 
accommodation 
and 
meals. 
Requested 
supporting documents for person settling the account 
internally whilst duly submitted. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think that – so are you confirming 
that you used – or R1 million was used to pay MK veterans 
at the rally held by the ANC on 8 January 2016 and that this 
was done 
on the instruction of Mr 
Dlomo. Are 
you 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 34 of 133 
 
confirming that Dorothy? 
MS DOROTHY:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Correct.  Okay and Mr Dlomo referred to 
here is… 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Dlomo that you referred to here is 
Mr Thulani Dlomo or not? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes Thulani Dlomo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If I may just ask Dorothy you can 
10 
answer the following questions as a general rule one would 
assume that the ANC would be responsible for its own 
security or that would be the responsibility of the South 
African Police.   Why was it decided to use MK veterans to 
deal with the issues here to identify and report on potential 
disruptive behaviour?   
 
Firstly they would not be trained.  Secondly one 
would assume that the duty should rest upon trained 
persons if anyone at all as members of the SSA – why was 
this outsourced to MK veterans? 
20 
MS DOROTHY:  Chair Mr Thulani Dlomo would be the better 
person to answer this question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You – you have no 
explanation for why MK veterans were used rather than the 
ANC’s own security, the police or members of the SSA. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 35 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what we do know however that 
is that funds from the SSA were used to transport MK 
veterans to the Royal Bafokeng Stadium for the rally and 
their transport fees, accommodation and meals were paid 
for by the SSA.  Is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  If we could go then please… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry 
Mr Pretorius.  Subject 
obviously to ensuring that her identity is not indirectly 
10 
disclosed I am not sure that the – her evidence or her 
answer indicates how she gets to know about this. Whether 
she was involved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In this. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  She withdrew the money so that is 
apparent from the introductory part of the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At paragraph 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In other words you were involved in 
the withdrawal of that R1million is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you would have known what it 
was for? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 36 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes as stated in my comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay do you have an idea more or less 
how much this stipend was that was given to them per 
individual is that something you do not know? 
MS DOROTHY:  I do not remember Chair because I do not 
have copies of that – the settlement – the document in 
relation to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us go then back to page 
10 
422 if you will and look at page – well paragraph rather 9b 
which refers to another question put to you by the 
investigators.  It reads: 
“R1.85 million was withdrawn in September 
2016 allegedly used to pay MK veterans 
used for #occupy Luthuli House.” 
If we can go back to page 436 the second block your 
comment appears on the right hand side.  What is your 
comment in relation to that withdrawal in which you were 
involved?  Well perhaps before we go there what is occupy 
20 
Luthili House?  What was that event? 
MS DOROTHY:  Occupy Luthili House was – it was a # that 
was created by certain individuals who wanted to come and 
occupy the offices of Luthili House on the day when the 
President and Deputy President were to be – for the weekly 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 37 of 133 
 
meetings. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that was the former President. 
MS DOROTHY:  That take place on the specific day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and you referring to the former 
President and the former Deputy President, is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  The former and the current. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so the current in his capacity as 
Deputy President at the time, is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:  No current (inaudible) in his capacity as 
President. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In other words Mr Zuma and Mr 
Ramaphosa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Dorothy are you referring to a time 
when Mr Zuma was the President and Mr Ramaphosa was 
the Deputy President? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So there was a plan I 
20 
suppose you could put it that way that certain individuals 
wanted to occupy Luthili House at that time or on that 
occasion and what were the funds referred to that is the 
amount of R1 850 000.00 – what were those funds used for? 
MS DOROTHY:  The funds were utilised to cover expenses 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 38 of 133 
 
such as stipends, transport fees, accommodation and meals 
of the MK veterans who were deployed then.  I worked with 
the head of the ANC security which I will not mention his 
name Mr T Dlomo instructed me to make requisition and pay 
for all the expenses related to the operation above. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you confirm that you were involved in 
the withdrawal of that amount of R1 850 000.00? 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now what… 
10 
MS DOROTHY:  I confirmed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now what – why were the MK 
veterans deployed as you say at Luthili House on funds paid 
for or funds provided by SSA. Was that to defend Luthuli 
House? 
MS DOROTHY:  I think Chair – I think my answer is going to 
be the same as the one for the Rustenburg rally wherein I 
think Mr Dlomo being the person that had requested that we 
utilised these people he is the best person to explain what 
was the rationale behind having the MK members come to 
20 
Luthuli. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  But the MK members whose 
transport fees, accommodation, meals and a stipend were 
paid for by the SSA they were not the persons going to 
occupy Luthuli House I presume? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 39 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes they were not the person to occupy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us then go to paragraph 
9c if I can take you back please to page 423. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  R1.5 million withdrawn in February 
2017 allegedly used for the State of Nation Address related 
expenses and which was transported to Cape Town by a 
SSA member and handed to you – that is Dorothy which you 
allegedly 
handed 
to 
Minister 
Mahlobo 
at 
his 
official 
residence in Cape Town.  That is the question.  It is referred 
10 
to at the top of page 437 in the table.  What is your 
comment? 
MS DOROTHY:  Chair I did not hear what it –  
CHAIRPERSON:  The question was whether you were in 
involved in the withdrawal of R1.5 million in February 2017 
allegedly used for SONA related expenses and which was 
transported to Cape Town by a SAA member and handed to 
you which you allegedly handed to Minister Mahlobo at his 
official residence in Cape Town.  It may be that you were 
not involved in the withdrawal but it was handed over to 
20 
you, you can clarify what you know about this. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you deal with it Dorothy at the 
top of page 437 in the right hand column – the top of the 
page under the head comment. 
MS DOROTHY:  Okay.  Can I just correct something here 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 40 of 133 
 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DOROTHY:  These expenses were not related to SONA 
in terms of my work.  I – what I said there was that I was 
deployed in Cape Town for SONA and then I was called in 
relation to this amount.  Because I hear Pretorius talking 
about it is SONA expenses.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DOROTHY:  I do not know what the money was meant 
for but nonetheless during my deployment – I was deployed 
10 
to Cape Town from- for the SONA event.  During my 
deployment I was instructed by Mr Fraser to receive a bag 
of money from one security employee of SSA and to take 
the same to Mr – Minister Mahlobo. 
 
 I met the SSA member and collected the bag of 
money as was instructed from him.  I then handed the 
money to the Minister Mahlobo personally as his – at his 
official residence.  I cannot recall if he signed for it or not 
nor how the TA was settled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Where was this residence?  
20 
Was it in Cape Town or Pretoria? 
MS DOROTHY:  In Cape Town in Cape Town the official 
residence in Cape Town. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Alright but you say you have 
no knowledge of what this money was intended for and you 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 41 of 133 
 
cannot say that is was a SONA related expense. 
MS DOROTHY:  Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct. 
MS DOROTHY:  I am saying I am not sure if it was SONA 
related.  I was deployed there for SONA but I am not sure if 
the funds were for SONA related expenses. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And you say that you were 
instructed by Mr Fraser to receive a bag of money from one 
security of employ of SSA and to take the same to Minister 
Mahlobo. What that instruction given verbally, in writing, 
10 
how was it given? 
MS DOROTHY:  Verbally. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right an you then met the SSA 
member.  Was this a SSA member referred to by Mr Fraser 
in his instruction to you? 
MS DOROTHY:  Mr Fraser would not have known who 
specifically the member would be. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.   
MS DOROTHY:  That is bringing the money. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So money – when you say bag of 
20 
money how do you know there – it was a bag of money? 
MS DOROTHY:   Because I was told he is bringing money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you give ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   ...amount 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 42 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember?  Were you given a 
bag by the member? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you get a chance to see whether 
there was money in the bag? 
MS DOROTHY:   I do not remember Chair the part that I 
opened the bag or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but you were told that it was 
money that was in the bag? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When you handed ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...it to minister – when you handed 
the bag to Minister Mahlobo, you actually say here in your 
comment:  I then handed the money.  Was any mention 
there made of money? 
MS DOROTHY:   [Speaker unclear] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, I did not hear the answer. 
MS DOROTHY:   I said, did he mention anything?  [Speaker 
unclear] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  From all the circumstances 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Sorry, I did not hear that part? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry.  When you handed, as you 
say here the money to the Minister Mahlobo personally at 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 43 of 133 
 
his official residence, did you hand it to Minister Mahlobo 
himself? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And from all that you were told 
then, 
the 
instructions 
that 
you 
were 
given 
and 
the 
circumstances of the receipt and transfer of the money to 
Minister Mahlobo, are you satisfied that you handed 
R 1.5 million, as mentioned, to Minister Mahlobo? 
MS DOROTHY:   I cannot be – I cannot say that I am one 
hundred percent satisfied that I handed one point five.  I 
10 
have relied on the instruction that I was given that there is 
an amount of one point five that is coming and then I need 
to take it Minister Mahlobo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Are you satisfied from all 
the 
circumstances 
that 
you 
were 
handing 
money 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...if not the exact amount.  Is that – 
can we assume that from your evidence? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, you can. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you handed the ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you handed the money or bag to 
Minister Mahlobo, did he open the bag in your presence? 
MS DOROTHY:   I cannot recall.  I cannot recall Chair if we 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 44 of 133 
 
opened the bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you cannot recall whether you ever 
saw that there was indeed money in the bag? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just try and remember as far as you can 
what Mr Fraser said to you and just try and repeat the gist 
of what he said to you in regard to this issue. 
MS DOROTHY:   Mr Fraser informed me that there will be 
an amount of one point five coming and that I should take 
it then to Mr Mahlobo himself.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, was he speaking to you over the 
phone or were you with him when he gave the instruction? 
MS DOROTHY:   We met personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And where was this? 
MS DOROTHY:   We met personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where was this? 
MS DOROTHY:   In Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   In Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at an office or not in an office? 
20 
MS DOROTHY:   It was not in an office but I do not recall 
the exact – I am not very familiar with Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DOROTHY:   Ja, I am not very familiar with Cape Town 
but it was in Cape Town, not in an office, it was at – in a 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 45 of 133 
 
parking somewhere.  I do not remember where.  I drove 
there and he – I waited for him and he came there with his 
car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DOROTHY:   [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it just the two of you? 
MS DOROTHY:   Obviously, he came with his protectors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So he said a certain member, 
and I assume he mentioned the name, would come – would 
bring money to you about R 1.5 million that he said you 
10 
should take ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to the Minister.  I just want you to tell 
me how your conversation with him went.  I just want you 
to try as far as you can remember, to say this is how our 
conversation went. 
MS DOROTHY:   Okay.  The conversation was that there 
will be money coming.  He did not indicate who the person 
is who was going to bring the money.  I was to receive a 
call.  So he would not have known who is bringing the 
20 
money 
because 
he 
issues 
an 
instruction 
and 
then 
somebody delegates a member to bring the money.  So he 
would not have known who brought the money.  But I am 
going to receive a call and there is money that is going to 
be coming.  I must take it to Minister Mahlobo. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 46 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so he did not tell you who the 
member is who was going to bring the money to you? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He just said you were going to receive a 
call and he did not say from whom and that after that call 
you would then be given money which you should take to 
Minister Mahlobo. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he specifically say you would be 
given money or did he say you would – somebody would 
10 
bring you a bag and you must take that bag to Minister 
Mahlobo and you assumed that in the bag there was cash? 
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, I knew it was money because he 
informed me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He told you it was money? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he tell you the amount? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What amount did he tell you? 
MS DOROTHY:   One point five million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  And when you – had you been 
to Minister Mahlobo’s official residence in Cape Town at 
the time before that or was this your first time? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had been? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 47 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:   No, it was to my first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I had been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me how the conversation between 
you and Minister Mahlobo went when you came to his 
residence. 
MS DOROTHY:   I would not recall that, Chair.  It has been 
a while back.  I would not recall ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   ...what conversation we then had. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember whether you just gave 
him the bag and he took the bag or whether you told him 
that you had been asked by Mr Fraser to bring this money 
and it was supposed to be R 1.5 million or whether you did 
not mention that?  Can you recall whether you mentioned 
that? 
MS DOROTHY:   I do not remember but – I do not recall 
but sensible it would – I would have that conversation to 
say:  Minister, I have been requested by – instructed by 
the DG to bring this to you.  I would not just walk in and 
20 
leave the bag and leave.  Definitely a conversation would 
ensure where I would be informing him that I was tasked to 
bring this to him but we would not discuss figures with him 
because that was not my place to ask.  For me it was just 
to do the drop-off. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 48 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So in the conversation between 
you and Minister Mahlobo there was not any mention of 
cash or money or was there? 
MS DOROTHY:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
MS DOROTHY:   There was not any conversation.  I just 
informed him that I was tasked to bring this bag to him.  I 
knew what was in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  If we can move on to 
10 
the next issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe before you do so, Mr \ 
Pretorius.  With regard to the earlier amount that you 
testified about of one million rand.  So that one you know 
quite well because you withdrew that amount.  Is that 
right? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The one relating to the MK Veterans in 
Rustenburg. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after you had withdrawn it, how do 
you know that it ultimately was paid to the MK Veterans?  
Obviously, I do not want you to say anything that might 
directly or indirectly disclose your identity but obviously 
somebody listening to this.  Yes, you saw you withdrew it.  
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 49 of 133 
 
Yes, you say it was used for the MK Veterans.  But were 
you involved in the actual handing over of cash to the MK 
Veterans or did you give the money to somebody else who 
you understood would be giving it to the MK Veterans? 
MS DOROTHY:   No, I personally was involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were involved? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In actually giving the money to the MK 
Veterans? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And was the handing – 
was the actual giving of the money to the veterans, did it 
take place in Rustenburg? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the day of the event or after or 
before? 
MS DOROTHY:   It would – the stuff(?) is usually paid after 
the event and obviously the food is on a daily basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DOROTHY:   And the accommodation is once-off.  Ja, 
20 
so it varies.  It depends on the days because the food – 
they eat on a daily basis.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  For how long were they there, the 
MK Veterans in Rustenburg in connection with the event of 
the 8 t h of January? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 50 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, I do not recall.  As I said that the 
documents would actually guide me in the sense of when 
did they come and when did they leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
MS DOROTHY:   ...from different venues.  So I would not 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS DOROTHY:   ...when they came and when they left.  
Whether it was the day before or two days before.  I do not 
10 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then in paragraph (small) “d” on 
page 423, another topic is drawn to your attention and you 
were requested to provide an explanation of certain 
transactions.  Sub-paragraph (d) on page 423 reads: 
“R 500 000,00 which was paid into your bank 
account in December 2014, allegedly for a 
safe house situated at [blank] Western Cape, 
providing full details for the purpose for which 
20 
the house is or was used and details of the 
occupants thereof...” 
 
And your explanation appears in the second box 
on page 437.  Would you place that before the Chair, 
please? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 51 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:   Do I read from:  “I met...”? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS DOROTHY:   Okay. 
“I 
met 
Mr 
Alan 
Nickson 
on 
the 
19 t h of November 2020, where he asked me 
about the R 500 000,00 that was transferred 
into my bank account. 
I said to him that I am not sure about this but 
we will go and get a printout of my bank 
statement to verify this transaction. 
10 
I received my statement and called Mr Nickson 
on 
the 
very 
same 
day 
of 
the 
19 t h of November 2020 to inform him that I can 
confirm receipt of this money. 
I further informed him that it was for furniture 
and other expenses which were related to the 
rental of the safe house at Bloubergstrand. 
Mr Nickson asked for the physical address of 
the safe house which I had forgotten. 
I 
then 
called 
Lilly 
who 
also 
could 
not 
20 
remember the exact address ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do not give the address. 
MS DOROTHY:   “...but it was in [redacted]  Excuse me? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I am sorry.  I came too late to 
say you should not mention the address but be that as it 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 52 of 133 
 
may. 
MS DOROTHY:   Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The last paragraph. 
MS DOROTHY:   “Mr T Dlomo instructed me  
to make a requisition and pay for all expenses 
related to the above...” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was that claim settled and the 
expenditure of that amount settled by way of receipts 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...as you set out in your affidavit? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The name Lilly, of course, that you used 
there is a pseudonym name.  You say: 
“Mr T Dlomo instructed you to make requisition 
and pay all the expenses related to the 
above...”   
 
What is the above?  The expenses related to 
what? 
MS DOROTHY:   The house. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The safe house. 
MS DOROTHY:   The expenses related to...  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was in 2020 – November 2020, is 
that right? 
MS DOROTHY:   No, Chair. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 53 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
I 
thought 
that 
is 
what 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   In November 2020 is when I had the 
discussion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I was saying I see that you say: 
“I 
met 
Mr 
Alan 
Nickson 
on 
19 t h of November 2020 where he asked me 
about the amount of R 500 000,00 that was 
transferred into ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He is the investigator concerned, 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The R 500 000,00 had been 
deposited into your account.  Is that right? 
MS DOROTHY:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the – who had deposited that 
amount into your account if you are able to say? 
MS DOROTHY:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where was that money coming from? 
MS DOROTHY:   It is an EFT from SSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From SSA? 
20 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what were you supposed to do with 
that amount? 
MS DOROTHY:   It is to pay the expenses related to the 
acquisition of the rental of the house which is inclusive of 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 54 of 133 
 
furniture and other ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DOROTHY:   ...and other things related to the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there a safe house that was to be 
obtained or rented and you were to pay the rent and to pay 
for furniture for that safe house? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  Rented safe house. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, 
Mr 
Pretorius, 
I 
can 
understand the previous transactions but I am not sure – it 
is not apparent to me whether there would be something 
10 
irregular about this one? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No.  She was asked to explain and 
an explanation was given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And her evidence says that it was 
done in accordance with proper procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
No 
point 
will 
be 
made 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...by the Legal Team on that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If we could go on, please, to 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 55 of 133 
 
paragraph 10 which appears on page 423 of Bundle SSA-
02.  If you could go back to page 423, please, Dorothy.  
You 
were 
asked 
certain 
questions 
about 
Project 
Construção.  That project has been detailed in evidence 
that has been given before the Chair before but essentially 
you say that you were not aware of co-workers who 
performed protection services and were part of Project 
Construção.  That is apart from what you have already told 
the Chair in relation to the two groups of co-workers that 
you referred to earlier.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS DOROTHY:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   10.3 says – asks for your explanation, 
rather, in relation to the withdrawal of cash for Project 
Construção referred to in the documentation attached, 
marked Annexure C10 including details of to whom and for 
such purpose the cash was provided.  Chair, if I may just 
say?  The annexures that are referred to here are all 
collated in Bundle 1 which is before you and they will be 
referred 
to 
only 
when 
necessary. 
 
Your 
explanation 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...for comment, Dorothy, appear on 
page 438 at the bottom of the page.  Did you sign an 
omission in respect of funds to be utilised for Project 
Construção and do you have any comment in that regard? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 56 of 133 
 
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, you will bear with me.  I have hive- 
fever.  So my voice would – if you do not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DOROTHY:   ...have a glitch.  I signed this submission 
in my capacity as the acting General Manager. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And ...[intervenes]  
MS 
DOROTHY: 
 
 
So 
when 
this 
submission 
was 
developed(?), I was acting General Manager. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And you say in the second 
paragraph: 
10 
“My signature and recommendation was guide 
by the fact that Lilly would have vetted and 
verified content of the submission before same 
was 
presented 
for 
my 
recommendation 
thereof...” 
 
Is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:   Correct, Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us go on to paragraph 
11, please.  You are asked to comment on the following 
statement which appears at page 423 at paragraph 11: 
20 
“With 
regard 
to 
Project 
Mayibuye, 
please 
indicate your knowledge or and/or role and/or 
involvement in: 
11.1 
Operation 
Justice, 
Operation 
Commitment and Operation Lock.

Page 57 of 133 
 
11.2 
The withdrawal of cash for Project 
Mayibuye reflected in Annexures M5, M6, M17, 
M18 and M19, indicating in each instance for 
what purpose the funds were withdrawn and to 
whom payment was made...” 
 
Your answer appears at page 439.  You say in 
paragraph 11.1: 
“I was not involved in the conceptualisation of 
Project Mayibuye nor played any role in the 
operations 
of 
Justice, 
Commitment 
and 
10 
Lock...” 
 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS DOROTHY:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is of course to what is said 
below. 
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, I did not get that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dorothy.  Okay, maybe Mr Pretorius, you 
can put the question.  Let her answer. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Put the question and let her answer. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 11.1 asks for – or let us 
go – start again so that it is clear.  On page 423 in 
paragraph 11, you are asked of your knowledge of certain 
operations and your answer is at page 439, paragraph 
11.1.  What is that answer?  So go to paragraph 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 58 of 133 
 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   I was not involved in the...  11.1? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja. 
MS DOROTHY:   Okay. 
“I was not involved in the conceptualisation of 
Project Mayibuye nor played any role in the 
operations 
of 
Justice, 
Commitment 
and 
Lock...” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Dorothy, where you are sitting, 
have they provided you with water or tea or something to 
10 
help you? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I am drinking.  As I said I do have a 
bout of flu which is hay fever.  So. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, if you need anything 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DOROTHY:   That is my voice is... [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Pretorius, I had said we would 
not take the tea break but maybe we should have five 
minutes or ten minutes break. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, perhaps Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Perhaps – I...  Okay, we will take a ten 
minutes break.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 59 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Dorothy, can 
you hear us? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I can hear you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Let us then move to 
the question which appears on page 423 in paragraph 11.2.  
You 
were 
asked 
in 
that 
question 
to 
give 
detail 
or 
explanation in relation to the withdrawal of cash for Project 
Mayibuye reflected in Annexures M5, M16, M17, M18 and 
M19, indicating in each instance for what purpose the 
10 
funds were withdrawn and to whom payment was made.   
 
Now those annexures appear in a bundle which 
should be before you, Bundle 1, and I am going to ask you 
to turn now to page 439 where your comments in relation to 
those documents are contained, okay? 
MS DOROTHY:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So do you have Bundle 1 in front of 
you? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could go to page 384 of 
20 
Bundle 1, please? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I do.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [No audible reply]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is Annexure M5 which is one 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 60 of 133 
 
of the documents referred to in the question put to you. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   and if you could go, please, just 
briefly through, from page 385 to 386.  The signature at the 
bottom of page 385 above the date 15 November 2015, 
whose signature is that? 
MS DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if you go to page 386, there is 
another signature next to the date 15 September 2015, 
whose signature is that? 
10 
MS DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The approval by line 
management appears to be a S T Dlomo.  Do you confirm 
that? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...a page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Is S T Dlomo 
the same person as Thulani Dlomo or is it somebody else? 
20 
MS DOROTHY:   It is Thulani Dlomo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then if you go over the page, 
there is an acknowledgment of receipt.  It reads: 
“It is hereby certified that I...” 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 61 of 133 
 
 
And it loos like Moses.  Do you know that 
person? 
MS DOROTHY:   No, I do not who Moses is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   “...received R 5 million, an  
amount(?) 
[background 
noise 
interference] 
R 5 million only for the purpose of...” 
 
And it reads: 
“...for the Project Mayibuye. 
2.5...” 
 
I presume that means million rand and the word 
10 
appears to be commitment.  
“...OPS Justice, R 1.8 million.  Save return, 
R 700 000,00...” 
 
Do you see that and those words?  Do you 
confirm that? 
MS DOROTHY:   [Speaker unclear – interruption in 
transmission]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Want do you know about these 
20 
transactions? 
MS DOROTHY:   Okay.  As I have indicated on the 
comment section:   
“I accept copies of the application documents 
would be necessary to enable me to verify this 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 62 of 133 
 
transaction.   
Lilly would have to give an account to this 
transaction as in all instances where there is 
any transaction outside of my scope of work, 
would be a request to assist in taking money in 
my name...” 
 
And then I eluded to the fact of the receipt at the 
back, saying that: 
“The receipt is in Lilly’s handwriting. 
However, this is not her signature on the 
10 
document. 
I am not aware as to whose signature this is. 
I cannot explain on Lilly’s behalf as I have no 
clue where or to whom this money was taken 
to...” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  let us take a few questions 
step by step, please.  The receipt in Lilly’s handwriting, on 
what page does that appear in Bundle 1?  Is that 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   387. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   387?  You say that is Lilly’s 
handwriting? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 63 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say that that transaction 
was outside your scope of work but your name could have 
been assist in taking money.  Is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Why would your signature appear 
on those documents? 
MS DOROTHY:   Okay.  My signature would appear in the 
sense that I am taking the money in my name.  So I have 
to be the one that signs for it on the green form. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you are taking it for someone 
10 
else who is actually dealing with the project, is that right? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would that be necessitated, for 
example, if Lilly had outstanding TA’s which had not been 
settled?  Would that be a circumstance which would require 
this? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that right? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that the case in regard to this 
20 
transaction?  Why did you on this occasion ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, it would ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, let me repeat. 
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, with this transaction... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us start again.  Let me put the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 64 of 133 
 
question.  Why did you on this occasion sign for the 
amount and allowed the amount to be taken out in your 
name? 
MS DOROTHY:   The only time, Chair, that I would take 
money out in my name which is outside of my scope of 
work is when I am assisting them to take money if 
somebody within – the project managers or Lilly herself 
have 
outstanding 
TA’s 
that 
need 
to 
be 
settled 
at 
headquarters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in that situation, why would it be 
10 
right to take – to allow somebody else to take money in 
your name?  Should they not settle their TA’s timeously if 
they have taken cash out of SSA for legitimate projects for 
operations? 
MS DOROTHY:   That is true, Chair, but in some instances 
the explanation would be that maybe a service provider 
had not supplied them with the invoice as yet and the work 
needs to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why would the person who must 
authorise, if the money is taken out in that member ’s name 
20 
in those circumstances, not understand that?  In other 
words, if I have unsettled TA’s in my name and I need cash 
for legitimate purposes.  Why should I not follow the 
normal process with a view to taking money out in my name 
even if I have TA’s that have not been settled but on the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 65 of 133 
 
basis that the explanation that I will provide will be 
acceptable to the person who must approve? 
MS DOROTHY:   Ja, unfortunately, Chair, it will be finance 
that needs to responds to that because that rule came with 
finance that a person cannot have two TA’s under their 
name.  One needs to be settled before they can take 
further advances in their name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So does that mean that the relevant 
authorities would not accept any explanation and give an 
approved withdrawal of cash in favour of a member who 
10 
has got a TA that has not been settled? 
MS DOROTHY:   Chair, I do not know.  I cannot answer on 
their behalf but I am assuming, if the person a way to 
explain something would have come out of it but in this 
instance I am not aware what was the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, I am asking because I am 
hearing evidence of a lot of irregularities that were 
happening at the agency, SSA, and some of it seems to be 
criminal and so on.  So if, as I understand the position, the 
policy of the organisation is:  We will not give you – we will 
20 
not approve cash withdrawals in your favour as a member 
if you have a TA that has not been settled.   
 
If that is the official position and there are – one 
would expect that there would be exceptions if you provide 
and acceptable explanation why you have a TA that has not 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 66 of 133 
 
been settled.  And then if your explanation is acceptable 
then you would have cash allowed to be withdrawn in your 
name but if they do not allow any exception, then it must 
be that they regard it as a good reason to say settle first 
the TA before we can give you – can approve cash.   
 
So why should you go to another colleague and 
say:  Get it out in your name for me?  Because it is for 
work.  If your superiors do not think you have a good 
reason to have that unsettled TA, then you will not do that 
work.  Then they know it is because of their rule.  So why 
10 
should you circumvent that process and go to a colleague 
and say:  Take it out in your name but it is for me.  That is 
my concern. 
MS DOROTHY:   I understand your concern, Chair.  
Mr Dlomo signed this green form, the TA, knowing the fact 
– fully know that I do not deal with projects and this money 
was not for my work that I was doing.  So I would not be 
able to really answer in terms of the question that you 
asked but they went to finance to settle(?) the second TA 
or not.   
20 
 
But the fact that Mr Dlomo signed the green 
form, for me it says he was aware that I am taking the 
money and the person that was supposed to take money 
why they did not take the money.  Hence, I think I said that 
I would not be able to account but I think Lilly would be the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 67 of 133 
 
best person, really, to talk to this transaction specifically.  
But I understand your concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, what comes to my mind is 
that if you have a valid reason as to why you have a TA 
that has not been settled that is in your name.  If you put 
that advance to the authorities, one, they should accept 
and then should approve that you get cash for a legitimate 
purpose.  Or, if they do not approve, then they should 
accept that you cannot work with the cash until that TA has 
been settled. 
10 
 
Once you have a situation where a member who 
is in that situation goes to another member and ask that 
that member should take the money out in their name, that 
seems to be me to be irregular.  That seems to me as if 
that member seeks to get that money for an illegitimate 
purpose because if it is for a legitimate purpose, there is 
no reason why it should not – the authority should not 
approve that the cash be given to him or her even if he has 
got a TA in his name because they are satisfied that there 
is a good reason for the fact that the TA has not been 
20 
settled and they are satisfied that it is for a legitimate 
purpose.  You understand that/ 
MS DOROTHY:   I understand, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just in 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 68 of 133 
 
summary, Dorothy.  It seems that two issues arise out of 
the evidence you have given and what you are about to tell 
the Chair.  The first is that a member of the SSA may have 
not settled a temporary advance.  That person then, in 
terms of the rules, would not be authorised to withdraw 
further cash but that system or that rule was avoided by 
asking someone else who was authorised to do it for the 
person who was not authorised.  Is that correct? 
MS DOROTHY:   Correct, Chair.  But Chair, it is like...  
[Speaker unclear – break in transmission] ...something. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, your line seems to be breaking but 
just try again. 
MS DOROTHY:   As I said now.  When you said illegally.  
When you have taken the money illegally.  I beg to differ 
with him because in the submission – hence I have said 
here: 
“Copies of the application documents would be 
necessary...” 
 
In the submission – the submission does not talk 
to a person, it talks to a pretence(?) [Speaker unclear].  
20 
They could use that submission to request anybody to 
withdraw the funds.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, are you saying there is nothing 
wrong in a person – in a member who is, as I understand 
the 
position, 
disqualified 
from 
receiving 
cash, 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 69 of 133 
 
circumventing that rule by going to a colleague and saying:  
Obtain cash, not for yourself but for me. 
MS DOROTHY:   No, Chair, I am not saying that.  I am 
saying the statement that Advocate Pretorius eluded to 
earlier to say that I took the money under my name 
illegally.  So I just wanted just to justify that by saying.  In 
the submission it does not talk to a name.  So the person 
could go and ask anybody in assist in taking the money.  I 
am not talking about the process itself of me taking the 
money.  I am talking about the submission.   
10 
 
The sense that the submission does not have a 
name attached to it.  I did had some as illegal, in the 
sense, that I cannot take money when that submission has 
got somebody else’s name written.  But I understand the 
fact that he says:  How do a person take a money on 
behalf on another who has not settled?   
 
Hence, I am saying.  It is Mr Dlomo’s signature 
on the green form.  He would have known by then.  I would 
have asked Lilly why are you making [redacted] take the 
money.  Sorry...   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of course.  Yes, I am taking a 
general point to you, Dorothy.  And that general point is 
that, at times, the rule that a person who has not settled a 
temporary advance may be evaded or avoided by asking 
someone else to do it for them.  That is all I am putting to 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 70 of 133 
 
you.  That has happened and you confirmed that. 
MS DOROTHY:   [Speaker unclear – break in transmission] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct? 
MS DOROTHY:   Noted.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You agree that that has happened 
as opposed to just noting what I am saying? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And the second issue that 
arises is that it seems that the documents authorising 
withdrawals of cash and documents confirming that cash 
10 
has been expended by way of a receipt or other documents 
are often signed by people who do not know what was done 
with the money.  Is that correct, generally, not to a specific 
case here? 
MS DOROTHY:   Can you repeat the question? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have said that there is a trail 
of documentation ...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...which authorises the withdrawal 
of cash, the expenditure of cash and the accounting for the 
20 
expenditure of cash.  You described that earlier in your 
evidence.  Do you recall that? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that process requires various 
persons at various stages to sign authorisation or receipt, 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 71 of 133 
 
correct? 
MS DOROTHY:   Authorisation of receipt? 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
No, 
authorisation 
for 
the 
expenditure of money on the one hand.  Well, the 
withdrawal and expenditure of money on the one hand and 
its receipt at the end of the process, different people 
signing at different stages. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right? 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But on occasion, and it seems 
...[intervenes]  
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...on more than isolated occasions, 
persons would sign without knowing what the money was 
for or how the money was spent. 
MS DOROTHY:   True, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us then go to the next 
box which is M16.  I am not sure if it is necessary for us to 
go to the document, but M16 is a submission dated 
20 
5 September 2016, requesting authorisation to pay the 
related expenses for Project Mayibuye for the months April 
to August 2016.  It was recommended by Dorothy.   
 
Part 
B 
of 
the 
temporary 
advance 
that 
R 13.15 million 
was 
taken 
by 
Darryl 
and 
the 
claim 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 72 of 133 
 
settlement was approved by Dorothy and certain invoices 
are attached and they – it goes over the page and a 
company 
called 
Nay-washer-ways(?) 
[phonetically] 
is 
mentioned.  Now, perhaps it is better that you go to SSA 
Bundle 1 at page 468, please. 
MS DOROTHY:   Yes, I am there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the page, Mr Pretorius, page 
number? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   468 of Bundle 1 but you can start 
at page 469.  And if you could just go, please, to page 472.  
10 
You see there: 
“The request for authorisation payment to 
related expenses as per the approved Project 
Mayibuye recommended...” 
 
And then there is a signature.  Whose signature 
is that?  
DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And if you go to page 476. 
DOROTHY:   476? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, in the middle of that page, 
20 
this is one of the green forms, Section 1, Approval of 
Incurred Expenses by Line Management.  Whose signature 
is that there? 
DOROTHY:   It looks like my signature.  It is my signature, 
Chair. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 73 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, is that the one under 
Section 1 that you were asking about? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then there are further documents 
which refer to a company whose pseudonym is Napa, N-a-
p-a, they are appear on page 478, 479 and 480.  Do you 
see that?  These are documents in relation to these 
expenditures provided by the SSA about which you were 
asked questions, but I just want to draw your attention to 
10 
the fact that on page 478 it is indicated the professional 
fees as per the approved contract were paid in relation to 
project Mayibuye, do you see that?  R5 300 000.   
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then over the page. 479, R5 
million, again professional fees for Mayibuye.  Do you see 
that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And on page 480, professional fees 
as per the approved contract project Mayibuye, R2.850 
20 
million.  Do you see all those documents? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  What do you know about 
this documentation?  You will see that your signature 
appears in respect of that documentation on some pages. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 74 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   Chair, when this submission was done I was 
acting general manager  then and Darryl was acting – I 
think Darryl was Acting DDG, if I am not mistaken.  Yes.  
And it would seem that he took the money and then came 
to me to sign off his settlement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
DOROTHY:   Which I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you know anything about the 
services to be provided or provided that appear in this 
documentation? 
10 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you signed as part of the 
authorised …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Darryl would be better suited than me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Darryl would know, Darryl 
brought it to you but he did not tell you what the money 
was for, as I understand your answer. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, it was only for project Mayibuye, but 
what specifically, no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  But was it normal practice 
20 
for someone in a senior position to sign without knowing 
what the money was for? 
DOROTHY:   It was not normal practice but I assume 
because I was acting general manager then that he would 
have come to me, not looking that he is a senior person 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 75 of 133 
 
than me, I would rather my acting capacity at that point. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, it would seem unusual, to 
put it at its lowest, for someone to authorise expenditure in 
these amounts of several million rands without knowing 
what the money was to be used for or what the money was 
used for.  Do you agree with that?  In fact it would be 
irregular.   
DOROTHY:   Chair the money …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I am talking about what 
happened in practice.  I am sorry, I interrupted you. 
10 
DOROTHY:   You got cut, I did not hear that.  I am sorry, 
you got cut, I did not hear the last part. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes I stopped myself because I 
was interrupting you.  Please answer. 
DOROTHY:   No, I am saying the environment that I worked 
in, we worked on a need to know basis.  So as long as 
there is a submission that is approved for the project I 
would not question as to what the money is for because it 
was not in my place to know that.  So the need to know 
principle was always applied within my environment. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so someone may authorise 
the expenditure of funds but because of the application of 
the need to know principle in these circumstances that 
person would not know whether the money was going to be 
spent in accordance with the submission, whether it was 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 76 of 133 
 
going to be spent properly, whether it was going to be 
spent at all.  Is that how the need to know principle works 
in these circumstances? 
DOROTHY:   True, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us then go to – well, 
there 
are 
further 
examples 
in 
relation 
to 
reference 
document M17 and M18.  The circumstances are similar but 
let us go to M18, if we could.  Well, perhaps for the sake of 
completeness we should just mention M17.  That document 
appears in SSA bundle 1, page 481.  The documentation is 
10 
summarised as follows: 
“Submission 
dated 
3 
October 
2016 
requesting 
authorisation 
to 
pay 
the 
related 
expenses 
for 
project Mayibuye for the month of the September 
2016.  Part B of the temporary advance reflects that 
R4.51 million was taken by Darryl and the claims 
settlement was approved by Dorothy.” 
And then attached were certain invoices.  What is your 
knowledge of that as stated in the comments column to the 
right? 
20 
DOROTHY:   It would be the same as the M16. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
DOROTHY:   Where I say that I signed the settlement for 
Darryl at the time because I was acting GM but have no 
knowledge as to where or who or what the money was 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 77 of 133 
 
meant for. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Can you confirm, though, 
that R4.51 million was withdrawn or taken by Darryl in cash 
for 
the 
purposes 
at 
least 
as 
appeared 
on 
the 
documentation of the execution of project Mayibuye?  
DOROTHY:   I am relying on the documentation and that is 
what it says, Chair, so… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
DOROTHY:   I am assuming that that is the amount. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, it is the documentation 
10 
you signed, correct?  Or you signed the settlement at 
least.  Correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   M18. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is a similar circumstance, the 
document appears in SSA bundle 1, page 494 but I am just 
going to read the summary: 
“Submission dated 26 October 2016 requesting 
authorisation 
to 
pay 
the 
related 
expenses 
for 
20 
project Mayibuye for the month of October 2016.  
Part B of the temporary advance reflects that R4.51 
million was taken by Darryl and the claim settlement 
was approved by Dorothy.” 
So it seems that on a monthly basis, at least in this period, 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 78 of 133 
 
R4.51 million was withdrawn in cash for the purposes of 
the 
execution 
of 
project 
Mayibuye, 
is 
that 
correct?  
According to the documentation at least. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And your explanation in the 
right hand column, what is that? 
DOROTHY:   Is that – that is M18, am I correct? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
DOROTHY:   I signed the settlement as Mr Fraser had 
approved the withdrawal of the cash.  Darryl was my senior 
10 
at the time as I as acting GM at that point. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let us go to M19 because 
you do know about that.  M19 appears at page 504 of B1.  
If we could go there please? 
DOROTHY:   Okay, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On page 505 is a request for 
authorisation payment of related expenses as per the 
approved project Mayibuye and at the bottom of page 506 
is a signature.  Do you know whose signature that is?  Can 
you recognise it?  It is cut off slightly.  Do you recognise 
20 
that signature? 
DOROTHY:   506? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 506. 
DOROTHY:   Under compiler? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 79 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   That is Lilly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that Lilly’s signature.  Okay.  
You will see that under the head, paragraph 3, Financial 
Implications, that same amount, covert action expenses, 
R4,510 million.  Do you see that?  Same amount as the 
previous two months.  Do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And on page 4 of that document, 
which is at page 508, there is a signature against the date 
1 December 2016.  Whose signature is that? 
10 
DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And on page 509 at the 
bottom of the page under cost implications.  It is very 
unclear but one can make it out: 
“The amount required, R4,510 000, that is four 
million, five hundred and ten thousand rand, under 
the head Section 3, Cost Implications on page 509.  
Do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And at the bottom of that section is 
20 
a signature above the date 5 December 2016.  Whose 
signature is that? 
DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The amount appears clearly in the 
right hand column, R4 510 000.  Do you see that? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 80 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then, over the page, page 510, 
there is another signature.  Whose signature is that in the 
middle of the page? 
DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is first of the two signatures, hey?  
It looks like there are two signatures or is it one, Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is one signature next to the 
date 5 December 2016. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That Dorothy confirms, as I 
understand it, as her signature.  Underneath that, there is 
the name A J, and you cannot read the initial, Fraser and 
the date 2/12/2016.  Do you recognise that signature? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whose signature is it?  Are you 
able to identify …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Mr Fraser’s signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Fraser’s signature.  And then 
20 
there is receipt – and we will explain this in a moment, 
R470 000.  Do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   No, I do not see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Do you see at the bottom 
of page 510? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 81 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   There is a receipt? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Receipt, yes.  The words four 
hundred and seventy thousand rand appear.  Do you see 
that? 
DOROTHY:   510? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, bottom of page 510. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is written in where it is …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Oh yes, I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
10 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then on page 512 at the top of 
the page in handwriting above the green print is a word 
settlement, do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in the middle of the page, 
Signature by Claimant.  Whose signature is that? 
DOROTHY:   That is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then on page 513 is an 
invoice: 
20 
“Professional fees as per the approved contract, 
project Mayibuye.” 
And the amount of R4 510 000.  Do you see that?  I am not 
going to mention the name of the company. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 82 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  That document then is 
described in the left hand column at page 440 of your 
affidavit and your comment is on the right hand side.  What 
is your comment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is page …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And please do not mention the 
…[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   In my comments, this is one of the 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, can I stop you there for a 
10 
moment? 
DOROTHY:   I must not mention? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The name of the company. 
DOROTHY:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, Mr Pretorius, for the 
transcript, it is page 440 of the bundle, bundle 2. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I apologise, did I not mention 
it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 440 of the affidavit?  Okay, 
alright. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Are you there, Dorothy? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The bottom of page 440, you 
provide 
an 
explanation 
for 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
documentation that you have just been shown, M19.  What 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 83 of 133 
 
is your explanation?  But please do not mention the name 
of the company in the last line. 
DOROTHY:   Okay.  Okay: 
“This is one of the instances where I took the 4,51 
million in cash to Minister Mahlobo at his residence.  
I do not know how the invoice from this company 
was generated for the settlement or how it was 
provided to by Lilly.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And then there is an 
explanation for why the amount of R470 000 appears that 
10 
we have just referred to.  What is the explanation for that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, okay.  It appears that I initially took 
470 000 and then the balance later as sometimes there 
was insufficient cash available. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Now did you withdraw 
R4.51 million in cash or R470 000 in cash? 
DOROTHY:   I do not remember very well the specific 
transaction how – whether I took the 470, waited and then 
there must have been a delivery on that same day and then 
I took the balance. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But did you have money in your 
possession on that day?  Leave aside the amount for the 
moment. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Cash? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 84 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was it in a bag?  Did you put it in 
a bag? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, did you push the cash in the 
bag? 
DOROTHY:   Are you saying did I specifically put the cash 
in the bag? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright and what did you do, where 
did you go? 
DOROTHY:   I took the money to Minister Mahlobo’s official 
residence.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and to whom did you give the 
money? 
DOROTHY:   I gave it to him personally. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, in which room in the 
residence, can you remember? 
DOROTHY:   In the study. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And what happened in the 
study, if you would just tell the Chair please what you 
recollect of what happened when you walked into the 
study? 
DOROTHY:   When I walked into the study I then informed 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 85 of 133 
 
that I brought the money, would take it out, I would count it 
so that he is satisfied that it is the specific amount and 
then I put it back in the bag and leave. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So is it correct that in his 
presence you counted out the cash in the amounts, 
whatever amount was specified and supposed to have been 
handed to him?  Is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you take this money to him on 
somebody’s instruction? 
10 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On whose instruction? 
DOROTHY:   Darryl. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and when was this?  Was it 
November 2016?  I am looking at your document here.  
When was this? 
DOROTHY:   I do not remember the specific date when he 
informed me that I am going to having to do that.  He 
informed me – when he was Acting DDG he informed me 
that I would have to take over the role of taking the money 
20 
because he has been doing it prior to me.  So it could not 
have been that specific day when I took the money.  The 
specific day would have been that this is the day when I 
(sic) said you need to take the money, go and take it but 
he had informed me beforehand. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 86 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but are you tell which year it was 
when you took the money to Minister Mahlobo on this 
occasion? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, the date of withdrawal of the money 
would be the same date that the money is delivered.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
DOROTHY:   Immediately I withdraw the money I would 
immediately take it to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but are you able to say whether that 
was 2016 or 2017 or when it was? 
10 
DOROTHY:   2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2016.  Towards the end of the year? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, according to the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You withdrew the money and you 
put it into a bag and then on the same day you delivered it 
to Minister Mahlobo’s residence, is that right? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This particular residence to which you 
delivered it, was it in Pretoria, was it in Cape Town or 
where was it? 
20 
DOROTHY:   In Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when you arrived at his 
residence was he the only person that you interacted with 
or did you first have to speak to somebody else who then 
told you where he – in which room he was an you went 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 87 of 133 
 
there? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, since he – when I arrive at this house, 
the protectors would obviously be outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DOROTHY:   So that was my first point of contact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DOROTHY:   And they would then inform that I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And would they have then told you 
to go into the study? 
DOROTHY:   They would not have told me to go into his 
10 
study, they would have said he says that I must come in.  
They would not come into the house with me because 
obviously when I enter the door he would be there waiting 
for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he was waiting for you when you 
entered the door? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, the protectors would have informed him 
that I am here to see him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DOROTHY:   Then I would wait for them to come back to 
20 
me to tell me that I could go in an see him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there a conversation that took place 
between you and Minister Mahlobo other than you saying I 
have brought you money, this money or something to that 
effect?  Did he say anything himself? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 88 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair, I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not say anything or you cannot 
recall whether he said anything? 
DOROTHY:   I do not recall – yes, ja, I do not recall our 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you counted the money in his 
presence and when you were done you then left? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?  I see we 
are at five past one. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is a convenient time, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV RENDANI:   No, Chair, maybe I will take the 
opportunity to, during the break to discuss with the legal 
team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV RENDANI:   It is around the evidence in particular the 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV RENDANI:   I will address it with the evidence leader. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is alright. 
ADV RENDANI:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the lunch adjournment then 
and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 89 of 133 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Dorothy, are 
you there?  Can you hear us? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I am here, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  I would like to go back 
to margin number M18 on page 440 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, I am sorry, I notice that 
these two bundles that we are using or we were using just 
before lunch, they both have numbers that are more or less 
10 
the same, so it is important to say which bundle each time 
we refer to a page otherwise somebody reading the 
transcript might go to a wrong bundle for a particular 
reference. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, you are correct 
because bundle 2 is bundle 2(a) and bundle 2(b).  so if you 
could go to bundle 2(a) the bundle we have been referring 
to, Dorothy, at page 440. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Against the exhibit number in the 
20 
margin M18.   
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I could just take you to SSA 
bundle 1.  The documents that form part of M18 on 
contained there and I just want to take you to specific 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 90 of 133 
 
pages please.  If you go to page 494. 
DOROTHY:   Okay.  Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, that is the cover page, so 495 
is the request for authorisation.  It is for project Mayibuye, 
do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it is dated the 28 October 
2016.  Sorry, the 26 October 2016 and on page 496, the 
signature that you have identified or a similar one which 
you have identified is that of Lilly.  Do you see that? 
10 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
it 
is 
a 
request 
for 
authorisation of that amount which we have seen before of 
R4.51 million.  You see that at paragraph 3 of the letter on 
page 496. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now we know from other evidence 
and you have referred to a written entry on a document 
earlier 
this 
morning 
that 
project 
Mayibuye 
involves 
Operation 
Justice, 
Operation 
Lock 
and 
Operation 
20 
Commitment.  Do you recall that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now if you go please to page 498 
of bundle 1. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 91 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a series of signatures 
related to the request for authorisation, all recommended.  
At the bottom of page 497, do you recognise that 
signature, right at the bottom? 
DOROTHY:   The green form? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, page 497, it is not a green 
form, page 497, before the green form. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whose signature is that?   
DOROTHY:   Mr Arthur Fraser. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And then on page 498 at 
the bottom, it reads – there is a handwritten note reading: 
“Funding of the project was approved by the 
Minister, 
see 
attached 
approval. 
 
Operational 
reports must be submitted to…” 
And then I cannot read those words.   
“…DBO1 and DG01 to justify continued expenditure 
on the project.” 
Do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you know that to be correct 
that the Minister had approved the project or the funding 
for the project? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, I do not recall but no funds can be 
withdrawn from a particular project without having the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 92 of 133 
 
project being approved in the first instance because this 
submission is to withdraw funds but there would have been 
a submission to establish the project.  So I am assuming 
this is what Dwayne was talking about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, that is Dwayne’s signature? 
DOROTHY:   It is the bigger submission, the principal 
submission. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but he is saying funding of 
the project was approved by the Minister …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Excuse me? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know whether that is 
correct or not? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is correct? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Dorothy, 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
…[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   I am not sure.  I am not sure, Chair, I cannot 
hundred percent confirm that it is correct, I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you will go to page 500 please?  
There is a signature below the words – on the green form 
20 
now. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Approval by line management.  
Whose signature is that?  You have identified it before. 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  Mr Fraser.  Mr Fraser. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 93 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  And on page 502 
under: 
“Approval 
of 
incurred 
expenses 
by 
line 
management” 
Whose signature is that? 
DOROTHY:   It is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then there is an invoice on the 
next page 503.   
“Professional 
fees 
per 
approved 
contract, 
R4 510 000.” 
10 
Do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, if we could go back please 
to page 441 of bundle 2A. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will recall that there was 
documentation reflecting the approval for withdrawal of 
R4.51 million and you said a first delivery of cash would 
have been in the amount of R470 000 and you said you 
would have made up the difference via delivery at a later 
20 
time.  Do you recall that evidence? 
DOROTHY:   No, I did not say that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did you say? 
DOROTHY:   Can I clarify? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 94 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   I said I would have taken that 470 and waited 
for the difference which would have been the same 
particular day and then took the whole amount. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so you did not take the 
amount in two batches, you say you would have taken the 
amount drawn …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You said you would have taken the 
full amount of R4.51 million. 
DOROTHY:   Fully. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  Sorry, I misunderstood you, 
but I just do, in any event, want to take you to a document 
provided to the investigators by the SSA.  It appears at the 
back of bundle SSA02, page number is 522.137.  If you 
could go there please?  It is a schedule of expenses or it is 
a schedule …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Which bundle is that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bundle 2, the same bundle in 
20 
which your affidavit appears but at the end of the file, back 
of the file.  Do you see there is a schedule …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Which one is that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is page 522.137 but it is not the 
large document, it is a single spreadsheet, it is the first 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 95 of 133 
 
document with that number on it.  Do you see it? 
DOROTHY:   522.13..? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it the last document on bundle 2. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a schedule prepared by the 
investigators or by the SSA, I am not sure which, but it is a 
summary of the temporary advance records of the SSA and 
if you look at the dates in the left hand column and you go 
down to 8 December 2016. 
10 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will see two entries on 8 
December 2016. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For – and you look at the right 
hand column, for project Mayibuye.  Do you see that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I see that, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the two amounts of R470 000 
and R4 040 000 which would total the amount that we have 
spoken about. 
20 
DOROTHY:   Yes, will go to 4.1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   4.1, 510, yes.  So that seems to 
…[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Yes, it is, exactly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   …coincide with your evidence that 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 96 of 133 
 
there would have been two withdrawals on the same day. 
Correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  Now if we can go onto 
paragraph 13 of your statement on page 441 please?  You 
say in paragraph – well, what do you say in paragraph 13.1 
regarding deliveries to any person, deliveries of cash? 
DOROTHY:    
“I can confirm that I have on three occasions 
withdrew 4.5 million by instruction of Mr Darryl to 
10 
hand the money over to Minister Mahlobo.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now you gave a description of the 
first occasion next to the entry M19 on page 440 that you 
delivered 
cash 
to 
Minister 
Mahlobo. 
 
On 
the 
other 
occasions, what did you do, did you deliver the money 
personally? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I delivered the money personally and I 
was accompanied by Lilly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us just for clarification get this 
20 
right, Dorothy.  You are not including in the three 
occasions the occasion you talked about earlier where you 
delivered a bag to Minister Mahlobo but you had not 
checked whether there was money inside.  You are not 
including that one, is that correct, or are you including it? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 97 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   As excluding it, the 1.5, it is excluding that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excluding that one.  Okay, 
alright.  So you have told us about another one where you 
withdrew the cash yourself and you delivered it to Minister 
Mahlobo. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said you found him in his study.  
So that is the one.  So you will tell us about the other two.  
Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Please describe what 
10 
happened on the other two occasions? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  The same would happen, we would get 
to the residence, inform the protectors that we are there 
and then we will wait until we get the green light to go into 
the house.  We went in and we went his study, with Lilly 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Dorothy. 
DOROTHY:   He came, we counted the money and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Dorothy, hang on, Dorothy, 
20 
take one at a time.  Tell us about one of the two occasions. 
DOROTHY:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you will tell about another one.  
Tell us about one at a time. 
DOROTHY:   Okay.  Okay, I spoke about the first occasion.  
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 98 of 133 
 
The second occasion, it is the same scenario, where I 
would get to the gate, inform the protectors to inform the 
Minister that I have arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, hang on. 
DOROTHY:   I would wait in my car and then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Dorothy, sorry, sorry.  You see, 
the earlier one you told me somebody instructed you to go 
and withdraw the cash, how much you – you told us you 
withdrew the cash. 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much it was and that you then 
proceeded 
on 
the 
same 
day 
to 
Minister 
Mahlobo’s 
residence.  Start at the beginning.  Whose decision was it, 
were you carrying out somebody’s instruction, was it your 
own decision and did you withdraw it yourself, how did you 
carry it, was it in a bag and so on.  Okay, start. 
DOROTHY:   I understand, Chair.  The instruction to 
withdraw the second amount of 4.5 was given by Darryl.  I 
withdrew the money in my name, went to the cashiers with 
Lilly, the money was counted there by the cashier, packed 
20 
into the bags and we would call – I would call Minister 
Mahlobo to say I will be coming.  When I get to the house I 
would then inform the protectors to inform him that we 
have arrived.  We would wait in the care and then we would 
then get the green light to say we can come in.  We would 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 99 of 133 
 
come in and he would usher us to the study where the 
money is counted, put back into the bags and we leave. 
 
The second time I was with Lilly.  The first time 
when I went I was alone. 
 
And the third time the same applies, Darryl gave me 
the instruction to take the money to Minister Mahlobo.  I 
would call him to say that I am coming, then get to the 
gate, speak to the protectors who then in turn inform him.  
They would come back to me, if I would wait – I would wait 
if he has got meetings.  They would then come back and 
10 
say I could come in and then Minister Mahlobo would usher 
me into his study.  The same applies, we would count the 
money and I would put it back into the bags and leave. 
 
On both occasions – on the last two occasions I 
was with Lilly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, on the first occasion you were 
alone.   
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the two occasions you were with 
Lilly, is that right? 
20 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was the amount the same on each 
of these occasions? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And on each occasion you had been 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 100 of 133 
 
instructed by Darryl.  Is that right? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay on each …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And on each of the three occasions 
when you delivered – when you say delivered money to 
Minister Mahlobo you did see the money? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, the money was in my name, I withdrew 
in my name.  So from the cashiers it is counted and put 
into bags.  I am there, I sign for it.  From there we get to 
10 
the house, I then take the money out, count it again to 
make sure that it is the money that he is expecting, then I 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And on each occasion – well, you 
told us about the first occasion, that there was not much 
conversation between yourself and Minister Mahlobo.  On 
the other two occasions was there a conversation of any 
kind or it was just greeting and saying you brought the 
money or whatever?  How did the conversation go? 
DOROTHY:   It was – no, it is just greeting and that we 
20 
brought the money and then we would count and then say 
thank you and we would leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Dorothy, two 
questions.  In paragraph 13.1 your mention an amount of 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 101 of 133 
 
R4.5 million and on page 440 against the exhibit number 
M19 you mentioned 4.51 million.  Is the amount of R4.5 
million in paragraph 13.1 correct? 
DOROTHY:   I am sorry, that must have been a – yes, I am 
sorry, Chair, it must have been a typing error, it is 4.51. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And secondly, on any of these 
three occasions was any receipt given to you for having 
received the money? 
DOROTHY:   When I dropped the money off I did not make 
Minister Mahlobo sign anything. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just to make sure I 
understand the clarification …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   So I would drop the money off and leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make sure I understand the 
clarification in relation to paragraph 13.2, Dorothy, did you 
say that where it says R7 million in paragraph 13.2 at 
bundle 2, page 441, it should be R4,5 million or how 
should it read? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I may just explain the question, 
Chair?  The amount of R4.51 million appears on page 440. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in the documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, not …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But in 13.1 it is R4.5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 102 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is the correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if you could confirm that, 
Dorothy, please? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, I am confirming that it is 4.51 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that is the amount that should 
appear 
in 
paragraph 
13.1. 
 
Do 
we 
understand 
you 
correctly? 
10 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and then 13.2 you refer to 
another occasion.  What is that occasion? 
DOROTHY:   Which one? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, before we go there, I would 
need to ask you just one more question.  You say that Mr 
Mahlobo did not give you a receipt for the money or you 
did not request a receipt for the money on any of the three 
occasions that you have now referred to.  Did anybody else 
give you a receipt, a protector or anyone in Mr Mahlobo’s 
20 
house or anyone else? 
DOROTHY:   Okay.  Chair, when I deliver the money Mr 
Mahlobo does not sign for it.  I would deliver it and leave.  
A week or two an envelope would come which I would give 
to Lilly but I cannot confirm that it is receipt based on the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 103 of 133 
 
money that he received or receipts in terms of whatever 
activities that money was intended for. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So do I understand you correctly, 
you have not …[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   But it was in an envelope, (indistinct – 
recording distorted) 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do I understand your correctly that 
you have not seen a receipt for those three amounts of 
R4.51 million that you delivered? 
DOROTHY:   No. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then 13.2 you mention another 
incident.  What was that? 
ADV RENDANI:   Chair, sorry to disrupt.  Chair, can I ask – 
my learned colleague had asked, even though we will have 
record, there was a question and answer and the answer 
was almost not completed or at least my understanding, if I 
may seek clarity.  She testified that a week or two an 
envelope will come from Lilly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV RENDANI:   That statement was incomplete when my 
20 
learned colleague interrupted.  I did not get that.  If we 
may… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, we can clarify.  I understood 
her to say ja – I think, I do not know whether a week or 
two, but an envelope would come from, as I understood it, 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 104 of 133 
 
from Minister Mahlobo to Darryl but she would not have 
seen whether it contained receipts or not for the money 
that she would have delivered.  Dorothy, is that what you 
were saying? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair, that is what I was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV RENDANI:   Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, if we could get 13.2.  What 
is the incident there described, if you could tell the Chair 
10 
please? 
DOROTHY:   Okay.   
“Lilly together with Frank requested me to take out 
cash in the amount of 7 million under my name but 
nevertheless utilising the name of this project.  The 
reason for the request was that Frank could not 
take the money as he had an amount that he 
needed to clear at finance before he could take 
further monies.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, what – do you know what 
20 
the project was that was the name of the project justifying 
the amount of the withdrawal of the amount of R7 million? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, I do not recall but I am assuming it 
would have been under Mayibuye.  Without the documents I 
cannot really ascertain exactly but the documents would 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 105 of 133 
 
have reflected my signature in terms of the green and the 
attachment would have been related to Frank’s activities. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the question at least – and 
that appears at page 423 and 424, seems to indicate at 
least form the investigator’s point of view – and this we 
could clarify later, reflects the amount of R7 million as 
being related to project Mayibuye.  Do you see that on 
page 423 and 424? 
DOROTHY:   423 and 424?  Which bundle? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, if you look at the top of page 
10 
424. 
DOROTHY:   423. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The bottom of the page, you see 
there is question 12? 
DOROTHY:   Okay, yes, I see, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And at the top of page 424. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You do not – you have no reason to 
think that that is incorrect, do you, as I understand from 
your answer? 
20 
DOROTHY:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
DOROTHY:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now before you delivered the 
R4.51 million on three occasions to Minister Mahlobo, do 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 106 of 133 
 
you know whether such deliveries were made and if so, 
who would have made them? 
DOROTHY:   Darryl. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So what did Darryl do? 
DOROTHY:   When Darryl asked me to assist in taking the 
money when he was acting as a DDG he said to me he was 
the one that was taking the money before, since I am 
acting in his position I should now be the one taking it but I 
do not know how many times he took it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And after your three occasions that 
10 
you delivered money, as you have said?  Do you know 
whether the deliveries continued and if so, by whom? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, I do not have proof that the monies 
were indeed delivered after my three occasions so I cannot 
honestly and with confidence say that it indeed is true that 
he was receiving the monies after my three deliveries to 
him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, we may come back 
…[intervenes] 
DOROTHY:   I would have to have proof to show that he 
20 
was receiving still. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  We may return to that issue 
later in relation to another document but let us go then to 
page 424.  Once again the questions that were put to you.  
Paragraph 13: 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 107 of 133 
 
“With regard to any cash withdrawn…” 
And I am reading the question put to you. 
“…and taken to the office or residence of Minister 
Mahlobo, please indicate for what purpose the 
money was taken to the Minister, by whom the cash 
was withdrawn, to whom the money was provided, 
the Minister’s involvement in operations and the 
person to whom the money was disbursed, if any, 
by the Minister or any other person.” 
Now some of those questions have been answered already 
10 
but really the essence of the question that remains is do 
you know what the money was intended for and to whom 
the money was disbursed, if at all by the Minister, or 
anyone else? 
DOROTHY:   I bear no knowledge what the money was 
intended for or to whom he was giving the money to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And does the same apply to the 
amount of R7million, the two amounts of R6million and 
R1million respectively. 
DOROTHY:   Yes Chair.    Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That amount of R7million Dorothy 
referred to in paragraph 13.2. 
DOROTHY:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you deliver that money deliver that 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 108 of 133 
 
money, anywhere? 
DOROTHY:   No, I did not deliver the money anyway, at the 
cashiers once it was signed off by my name, it was taken 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was taken by who or too where, do 
you know? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, I – Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DOROTHY:   Lily and Frank were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
DOROTHY:   Lilly and Frank, were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so okay, I was under the impression 
that they sent you there.  So they were there when the 
money was withdrawn, it was just withdrawn in your name, 
but they were the ones who were going to need it, is that 
right? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
the 
reason 
for 
this 
arrangement…[intervene] 
20 
DOROTHY:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry, I interrupted you. 
DOROTHY:   I was agreeing to what the Chair was saying 
that it is correct to what he said.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, and the reason for that 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 109 of 133 
 
arrangement Dorothy, as I understand your statement, was 
that Frank could not draw money because he still had to 
account or clear money at finance before he could take 
further monies.  Is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, in paragraphs 16, 17 and 
18 of your affidavit, you refer to amounts relating to 
Project 
Hollywood, 
Project 
Accurate/Construcao 
and 
Project Tin Roof, right.  You say in respect of Project 
Hollywood, that you cannot recall this advance and you 
10 
cannot respond meaningfully in the absence of receipts. Is 
that – do I understand it correctly? Even though you 
approved it according to the documentation. 
DOROTHY:   Chair you got cut, Chair you got cut I did not 
hear a word.  Just the last part, I did not hear anything. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am so sorry, alright.  If you go to 
page 442 of Bundle SSA 2A, paragraph 16.  
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is documentation referred to 
there in relation to Project Hollywood and it appears that 
20 
you approved a settlement of R 107,766, 96.  Do you see 
that?  
DOROTHY:   I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Approved by yourself. 
DOROTHY:   107 thousand? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 110 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 766 96.  Do you see that, the 
figure that appears in the box? 
DOROTHY:   You said 107 million? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I know but I was wrong.  So I 
have corrected myself maybe that had got cut out.  It is 
R107,766,00. 
DOROTHY:   Okay, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. Now according to the 
documentation, you approved the settlement but you say 
you cannot recall that advance and in the absence of 
10 
receipts, you cannot respond meaningfully.  Is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then in paragraph 17 there is 
an amount referred to in the documentation of R16,370,000 
recommended by Dorothy - we can go to the documents if 
you like, but you say that you cannot recall what Project 
Accurate was about that is the project for which the 
amount was approved or Project Construcao, correct you 
say you were neither project manager nor a participant of 
Project Construcao? 
20 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so you cannot really assist 
in respect of that amount and that project, it is safe to say 
that you really did not know much about the use of the 
monies or for what the use for which the money were 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 111 of 133 
 
intended, is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  
DOROTHY:   Except for Construcao and the toxicology 
salaries, that is all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, so you were involved in the 
chain of authorisation for the withdrawal of the money in 
relation to Project Hollywood and Project Accurate and 
Construcao but you have, as I understand it, very limited 
knowledge of how that money was used.  Is that correct? 
10 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And does the same apply to the 
statements made in regard to Project Tin Roof on page 
443, 
where 
you 
say 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
R3,677,200,00 that amount you have limited knowledge of 
its use, except that it was for Project Tin Roof.  Am I 
correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair, as I have indicated, I said my role 
was limited to recommending the submission.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, then in paragraph 19 I would 
20 
like to ask you to exercise some caution here in the first 
five lines of paragraph 19.  What do you what do you wish 
to say to the Chair? 
DOROTHY:   When you say I must exercise caution in 
terms of names? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 112 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You need not mention any names, 
but just deal with the first five lines, please, in paragraph 
19. 
DOROTHY:   Okay, in December 2017, I was asked by a 
gentleman…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, it does not matter you can 
mention his name.  I am sorry, I am interrupting you, you 
can mention that name. 
DOROTHY:   Can I mention the name? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you can. 
10 
DOROTHY:   Or just the title? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Both.  
DOROTHY:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That person is not – sorry before 
you go on Dorothy sorry perhaps I had better check.  The 
person whose name is mentioned in the first line of 
paragraph 19.  He is not an operative or a member of the 
SSA, is he?  
DOROTHY:   No, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so you can mention his 
20 
name. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, okay.  In December 2017 I was asked by 
Paula the head of the ANC security to assist him at 
NASREC.  I then advised him to seek permission from my 
seniors to utilise me.  Mr Langer informed me that he had 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 113 of 133 
 
obtained consent from Mr Fraser to utilise my services at 
NASREC.  To protect myself I wrote a submission to SSA 
management who gave me permission to assist the ANC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now without going any further in 
your document, and I will explain to the Chair why in a 
moment.  Did you withdraw any money for these purposes? 
DOROTHY:   Money was for SNT and accommodation for 
myself. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And was there any other money 
withdrawn by yourself for the purposes of assisting the 
10 
ANC at the conference? 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what did you do, can you say 
that or is that something you should not say? 
DOROTHY:   No, I was assisting the ANC in monitoring the 
movement of buses that were coming from the provinces, 
coordinating that movement and checking if there are any 
glitches along the way and reporting back to them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, the remainder of the 
paragraph deals with an allegation which I have asked our 
20 
investigators about.  It is an allegation Chair, which is 
hearsay 
upon 
hearsay, 
and 
we 
have 
absolutely 
no 
confirmation that this was contemplated or done, I do not 
feel it appropriate to put it before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, know that is fine, can I ask you this 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 114 of 133 
 
question Dorothy, you say that you were asked by the head 
of the ANC security, Mr Paul Langer to assist him at 
NASREC and you asked him to seek permission from your 
seniors to utilise you and you subsequently wrote a 
submission to SSA management who gave you permission 
to assist the ANC.  Was this about assisting the ANC or 
doing some work for the ANC or the benefit of the ANC as 
opposed to doing your normal work as part of SSA? 
DOROTHY:   Okay, Chair by then when the conference 
started, I was not doing anything else, I was sitting at 
10 
home since the activities of SO were stopped by the former 
Director General, so I was not doing anything at home. 
Hence, Mr Langer then called me to request me to come 
and assist them because they had a shortage, but because 
I am an employee of SSA, I felt it necessary that I should 
have authorisation to be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I am trying to establish is whether 
the work you were doing whatever it is, you were doing 
that you regarded as assisting the ANC was not SSA work.  
You were not performing – were you performing SSA 
20 
duties? 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were performing none SSA duties to 
assist the ANC? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 115 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What actually were you were you doing? 
DOROTHY: 
 
 
I 
was 
coordinating, 
assisting 
in 
the 
coordinating of the movement of buses should there be any 
glitches along the way, the busses that are coming from 
the different provinces.  So I was asked to monitor that 
there is no glitches along the way, until they reach 
Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were not…[intervene] 
DOROTHY:   So we were providing alerts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it some kind of intelligence kind of 
10 
duty?  
DOROTHY:   No, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, was it like what traffic cops would 
do? DOROTHY:   No, traffic cops with lead the buses, but 
with us to check if bus number 50 has left in Mpumalanga 
for an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is the position…[intervene] 
DOROTHY:   Is everybody on board and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you were doing what a member of the 
ANC would have done to make sure that the buses 
20 
departed on time and that all that had departed where they 
were supposed to depart from that kind of thing. 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair so I worked with the transport unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Transport unit of the ANC? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 116 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Pretorius.  Were you 
going to be paid by the ANC for that or what was the 
position?  
DOROTHY:   No.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not going to be paid by the 
ANC? 
DOROTHY:   No, I was not going to be paid by the ANC 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you go please to page 460 of 
10 
Bundle SSA 2A, please, Dorothy.  
DOROTHY:   Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is another affidavit which 
appears to have been attested by you.  Is it correct that 
you attested to more than one affidavit for the purposes of 
the Commission? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if you go to page 468, is that 
your signature? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As far as you are concerned are 
the …[intervene] 
DOROTHY:   No, 467 is my signature not 68? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you are quite correct, my 
apologies, 467 is your signature and the signature of the 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 117 of 133 
 
Commissioner of oaths appears on page 468, is that 
correct? DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good, as far as you are concerned, 
are the contents of this affidavit true and correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This will be Exhibit YY 12.2, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, she confirmed the correctness of 
the contents? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and she's drawn my attention 
to the precise - is on page 467, where her signature 
10 
appears. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  The affidavit of Dorothy 
that starts at page 460 will be admitted as an exhibit and 
will be marked as Exhibit YY 12.2. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, as I understand it Dorothy 
this affidavit was prepared in response to a Rule 33 notice 
that you received in respect of the statement to affidavit of 
Lloyd Mhlanga, is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, we are not going to deal in 
20 
detail with its content save that I would like you please to 
refer to paragraph 2.2.  What do you say there? 
DOROTHY:   “I have never told Mr Lloyd Mhlanga that I 
had  
given the alleged cash withdrawals to Mr Mahlobo.” 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 118 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alight, and if you could then just 
read on to the record, please or just - yes, I think it is 
important that you read the detail from paragraph 2.3 to 
paragraph 2.21. 
DOROTHY:   So I must start from 2.3? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please. 
DOROTHY:   “In the absence of schedules of the cash  
withdrawals of R4.51million, I am only able to recall 
having done so on three occasions.” 
10 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Sorry, 
before 
you 
go 
on…[intervene] 
DOROTHY:   “For all material times I made the” -  okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry, Dorothy, for interrupting 
you.  That R4.5million, do I understand that should read 
R4.51million? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That does that also apply to the amount 
in paragraph 2 at page 460? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And while we are about it, 
paragraph 2.21? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, apologies for interrupting, 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 119 of 133 
 
if you could continue, please. 
DOROTHY:   “At all material times, I have made the  
Temporary 
advancements 
in 
my 
name. 
The 
documents 
for 
settlement 
and 
preparation 
for 
settlement of each temporary an advancement was 
done by my colleague known as Lily in the State 
Capture Commission.  I would sign off the request 
with the temporary advance in my name, though 
prepared by Lily and also sign off the settlement 
documents in my name, though prepared by Lily 
10 
too. I would then go to finance section with Lily and 
the cashier would count the money in front of me 
and Lily, Lily always brought the bag where the 
money would be packed by myself and Lili.  The 
money would then be taken to the official resident 
in Waterkloof of former Minister Mahlobo.  On the 
first occasion, I delivered it alone.  On the second 
and third occasion I was accompanied by Lily. I got 
involved in the cash withdrawal, because I was told 
by Mr Darrell that I should do so because I am 
20 
acting in his position and he used to do the same 
and take the money to former Minister Mahlobo.  I 
was acting in the position of Mr Darryl because he 
was acting in another senior position.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Please continue. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 120 of 133 
 
DOROTHY:   “I was made to inherit all that he used to do  
and continue to do it.  I was specifically instructed 
by Darryl to agree that my name be used and also 
to collect and deliver to Minister Mahlobo.  At no 
stage did Darryl or Minister Mahlobo inform me of 
the purpose and objective of the withdrawal and 
delivery of the cash.  At no stage did Mr Mahlobo 
asked 
me 
to 
make 
the 
temporary 
advance 
withdrawal.  At no stage did Darryl or Minister 
inform me of the objective and ultimate destination 
10 
of the cash I had to deliver and as an intelligence 
officer, one of the cornerstone values of intelligence 
is always working on a need to know basis, only on 
the need to know principle.  The environment in 
which I was working in is covert operations and 
offices were unknown to many SSA members.  On 
the delivery of the money I would be ushered by 
them to his home office where I would remove the 
money and count it, having countered it in front of 
him 
and 
having 
satisfied 
himself 
that 
it 
is 
20 
R4.51million I would leave the money and the 
suitcase with him.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, you go on in the statement, 
Dorothy to talk of an occasion when you were asked to 
collect arms, firearms from the Musanda Armoury that is 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 121 of 133 
 
the SSA Armoury, is that correct? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Who gave you that instruction? 
DOROTHY:   Okay, I received a call from a colleague, 
which I cannot name for obviously operational reasons, on 
the 28 t h of January 2015, that I need to come and collect 
arms and ammunition.  I was not aware because nobody 
had for warned me that I am going to be collecting arms.  I 
then called a late colleague of mine, which also I cannot 
divulge his name for security reasons, asking him if it 
10 
indeed it is true that I have to collect arms at Musanda.  
He then confirmed that yes, I am the one that needs 
to collect, my instruction of Mr Thulani Dlomo.  The letter 
that I have also states, a letter that came from Mr Thulani 
Dlomo to the security chief director at requesting for these 
for these guns.  I then drove to Musanda for collection of 
those arms and ammunition. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you collect the arms and 
ammunition?  
DOROTHY:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And where did you take them? 
DOROTHY:   I was informed by the late colleague that the 
VIP protector of Mr Dlomo would come to my house to 
collect the arms.  So I drove home, parked the car in the 
garage and waited until he came, I sent him a code to 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 122 of 133 
 
access the place where I stay.  He came, opened the boot, 
assisted him to carry the steel suitcase and he left. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Is this normal practice for 
an operative such as yourself to be told to go and collect 
arms for someone else? 
DOROTHY:   It's definitely not normal Chair.  Hence, I 
wrote here that driving from Musanda to my home was the 
longest trip ever because I had never been involved in 
carrying any firearms.  So it was the longest trip that I had 
to take to ensure that the safety of the States guns are 
10 
secured at all times until I reach my destination.  
So it was a bit weird, hence I called my late 
colleague to say, I received a call saying I must fetch guns 
but 
nobody 
forewarned 
me 
about 
this 
and 
then 
he 
responded back to say no Mr Thulani Dlomo is the one that 
instructed that I need to fetch those firearms. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were the arms collected from you, 
the arms and ammunition? 
DOROTHY:   Yes, Mr Thulani Dlomo’s protector came that 
same – within - I do not remember the time but I know 
20 
because I sent him a code to access where I stayed to 
come in and collect.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did - after this, well, did you have 
any idea of what the firearms were to be used for? 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair, I had no idea. 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 123 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you later raise this event or 
the facts related to this event to anybody at SSA, anyone 
in authority at SSA? 
DOROTHY:   I raised the issue of the firearms with the 
former DG Mr Fraser and why I did that was word was 
circulating that Mr Dlomo is leaving and I was worried that 
there were firearms that were taken out of Musanda in my 
name.  So I then informed him that there are firearms that 
are out in my name, and I am very worried about it and he 
instructed that all SO firearms are to be returned. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and were all or some 
returned? 
DOROTHY:   All they were returned except for I discovered 
I think, early this year or late that there are three still 
outstanding from the batch that I took. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that in paragraph 3.19 on page 
465? 
DOROTHY:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you say there: 
“I 
compared 
the 
inventory 
delivered 
with 
the 
20 
inventory of collection.” 
That means the arms you took out and the arms that were 
returned: 
“From armoury control and found that three pistols 
and two R4 rifles were outstanding.” 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 124 of 133 
 
Is that correct?  
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, what happened in relation to 
these missing rifles and pistols? 
DOROTHY:   I do not know but in February this year, I went 
to a specific police station to do a statement.  So there is a 
case opened in relation to this missing firearms. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say in your affidavit that you 
saw a document indicating that two more pistols had been 
recovered and that outstanding was one pistol and two R4 
10 
rifles, you say that in paragraph 3.26.  Is that correct?  
DOROTHY:   Yes, I learned that from the police station. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then you refer to evidence of 
Ms K but you need not go there we can get the evidence 
directly from her.  Do you have any training or competency 
qualification in relation to the handling of firearms? 
DOROTHY:   No, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know why you were asked 
to do this collection and delivery? 
DOROTHY:   I have no idea, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, if you would just bear with 
me one moment please to check that I have dealt with 
everything.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have spoken Dorothy of three 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 125 of 133 
 
occasions on which you delivered R4.51million relation to 
Project Mayibuye to Minister Mahlobo.  Do you know why 
you stopped taking the money, whether money was taken 
after you did it? 
DOROTHY:   It's I think it's when SO’s activities or SO was 
closed when we were told that Mr Fraser's SO. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I could ask you please to go to 
page 522. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that in Bundle 2? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bundle SSA 02A, Chair.  This 
10 
appears to be…[intervene] 
DOROTHY:   522? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, point 2, SSA 02A 522.2.  This 
is a transcript obtained from the SSA of an interview you 
had with investigators in an internal investigation at the 
SSA on the 3 r d of July 2019.  Do you recognise this just 
have a look at the names and the first page? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you conduct an interview in the 
internal investigation at SSA? 
20 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I do not want to go into too much 
detail about that but if you could go to 522.68, please.  
DOROTHY:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 126 of 133 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, I am just checking I am not 
sure that I need to go to this, is there any detail here about 
the Luthuli House incident that would help you recollect the 
expenditure of monies in relation to the Luthuli House hash 
tag occupy Luthuli House incident?  Have a look at those 
pages, I do not think there is.  
In fact, if you go to page 522.70, we see that you 
were questioned about the Luthuli House matter and you 
appear to have said, yes, they signed for this money. We 
settled and gave finance, and finance takes all our things. 
10 
So 
the 
reason 
for 
that 
operation 
was 
because 
the 
President was there or the Deputy President was there, 
yes.  Or was it for the ANC question, and say no, no, no, it 
was for the principal, who was the principal? 
DOROTHY:   I am talking about the President and the 
Deputy President, those are the principals, that is what we 
call them.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was for his protection was it, that 
you got MK people there, is that right? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, the Deputy President and the President 
20 
attend meetings at Luthuli at a specific day on that specific 
day.  On that specific day the hash tag Luthuli, people who 
were going to occupy the building as an inside, and that 
posed a danger for the two principals, hence, we call them 
principals there.  So I am talking about both President and 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 127 of 133 
 
Deputy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but the question, I suppose 
really is not whether those two persons did not deserve 
protection.  The question is, whether it was appropriate to 
pay MK veterans to do so, what do you say about that? 
DOROTHY:   Chair, as previously said, Mr Dlomo as I have 
previously stated that Mr Dlomo would be the best person 
to answer this question since he is the person that 
instructed that these people be activated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and you do confirm that on 
10 
page 71.  Right, if you just bear with me a further moment, 
Chair. In the same document, would you go to page 522.62 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   522.62, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 522.62.  Right, at the top of 
page 522.62 on the fourth line, in the same interview, 
internal investigation at SSA next to the name, Dorothy 
agreed, that is the part I forgot to ask. 
“But I can get December, January, she said March 
remember, I do not remember how long hence I 
20 
called 
her 
and 
I 
asked, 
are 
you 
sure 
about 
February?  She said no.  She said no, February 
looks like I did not. Then it was March I think last, 
but then after that, I think it was this girl taking it.  
What's her name?” 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 128 of 133 
 
And the name Helen is typed in there, that is not her real 
name, it is a pseudonym.  
“I met the Minister one time and he was like, I do 
not see you anymore.  I said, Minister, I am busy.  
He said, I see they sent Helen to come, I do not see 
you anymore. I said everything is now with Mr 
Fraser.” 
What was being said there, can you explain to the Chair? 
DOROTHY:   If you can recall earlier you asked me this 
question and I said to you, I cannot 100% confirm that 
10 
somebody else was taking the 4.5 to Minister Mahlobo.  If 
you can see the conversation there he does not say, what 
was brought to him.  He just said to me, I do not see you 
anymore.  I see they sent Helen to come, so I do not know, 
what was Helen doing there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, good thank you and then I 
must just point out something to you on page 522.63 where 
the question of receipts is discussed and the envelope that 
you said in your evidence came after the delivery, if you 
could just refer please to a third down the page of 522.63.  
20 
it reads: 
“So 
later 
on, 
then 
an 
envelope 
with 
acknowledgement receipt forms and then it would 
be submitted sent to Lily to do the settlement or 
would you be settling?” 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 129 of 133 
 
That is a question put to you.  The answer that Dorothy 
gives here: 
“I would be settling but she does the green form 
and all.” 
And then Demi says to you, that is the interviewer: 
“Okay, so you would settle and Ozzy would clear.” 
Ozzy is a pseudonym.  Dorothy: 
“Yes, remember, I was assisting so she knew I 
would not take my time and sit on a computer and 
draft a green form.  So she would do it.” 
10 
Demi:  
“Okay, have you ever seen the receipts yourself 
that would come back from the Minister?” 
Dorothy: 
“Yes, I have seen them because when I sign I must 
go through, I cannot just sign a blank.” 
Demi: 
“Was it his signature that was there, would he write 
his full name as the recipient?” 
Dorothy: 
20 
“I do not remember seeing his name.” 
Demi: 
“So how would those be signed when you say you 
have seen it?” 
Dorothy: 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 130 of 133 
 
“I think the receipts that we get it is not his 
signature, it is the people getting those funds.” 
Dorothy: 
“Yes, the money receipts of the people that are 
getting the funds.” 
So can you comment on that please and whether it is 
accurate or not?  
DOROTHY:   Chair, earlier on we were talking about sorry, 
receipts that the Minister would have signed and I said to 
you I have not seen those, sorry for that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you said that. 
DOROTHY:   We were talking about receipts that the 
Minister would have signed, and I said to you I have not 
seen any receipts that bear the Minister ’s signature and 
when I talk about Lily submitting and me going through it is 
the invoices or receipts that are related to this company 
that I would not be able to name. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I see, and do you remember that I 
showed you those receipts? 
DOROTHY:   So from my understanding and so on - excuse 
20 
me Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Kay, let me not interrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius was saying to you, 
do you remember that he showed you those receipts? 
DOROTHY:   Mr Mahlobo has never showed me any 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 131 of 133 
 
receipts. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yeah, you say you did not see any 
receipt signed by Mr Mahlobo but you may have been 
referring and I think you are now referring to a documents 
such as the one on page SSA 01503.  Can you confirm 
that? 
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So is it that you were telling them 
about on page 522.63?  
DOROTHY:   Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you that clarifies that.  
DOROTHY:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Dorothy we have 
come to the end of your evidence. Once again, we 
appreciate you availing yourself to try and assist the 
Commission.  Thank you very much, you are now excused. 
DOROTHY:   Thank you so much, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Dorothy. 
DOROTHY:   Thank you, Mr Pretorius. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, it is decision making time I 
am not sure that any purpose would be served by calling a 
witness for the 20 minutes that we had planned would 
remain but may I consult with the investigator.  
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395 
 
Page 132 of 133 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   They may say that it is worthwhile 
to spend, say, 15 minutes from half past or quarter 
to...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   …on the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want me to adjourn or you want 
to talk?  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, would you adjourn, please 
Chair because the witness would be a witness who would 
10 
need to take the oath, they did not take the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay act alright, we will adjourn for 
five minutes, we adjourned. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
have 
taken 
instructions 
Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair because the witness 
whom we intended to call next would be required to give 
some detail in his evidence it would not be advisable to 
20 
break it up.  So if we may Chair, adjourn and reschedule 
the other witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will adjourn for the day then 
today and I cannot remember which work stream is on 
Monday but the public will be notified in due course or over 
14 MAY 2021 – DAY 395

the weekend.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.
