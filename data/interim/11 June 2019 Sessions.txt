reference to page 97 under bundle CV14. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  A supplementary… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you understand that?

For the audit of 2015 I was one of the partners together with Mr Andre 
Dennis being the signing partner.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Mr Vaghela can you please move

ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  What do you currently do?

Page 8 of 165 
 
MR 
CHETAN 
CHHAGAN 
VAGHELA: 
 The 
persons constituting 
management were Mr Joshi as CEO, Mr Whiley as CFO, Mr Theko as 
company secretary, Mr R Bucks as acting CFO and Mr Memani as 
director in charge. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes let us then turn to page 4 of your 
statement.  From paragraphs 8 to 14 of your statement you introduce 
the background to what you have titled the Homix transaction.  In which 
year was this transaction audited? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  During the – Chair during the 
course of the audit for the year ended 31 March 2015. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what brought about the audit of this 
transaction? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair during the audit of Neotel 
for the year ended 31 March 2015 there were significant accounting and 
auditing issues that we were engaging management on.  They were also 
subject to an acquisition by Vodacom and as a result of the 
circumstances management had put us under a tighter timetable for the 
audit compared to previous years.  As a result of the timelines we seek 
to amend the timing of our audit procedures particularly around the 
verification of trade creditors.  We ordinarily test trade creditors in 
20 
April based on the 31 March balances.  For the 31 – for the 2015 audit 
we moved the timing to test creditors in March based on the 28 
February balances.  During the performance of these procedures we 
perform a routine test in analysing trade creditors and in specifically 
we compare the current year balances to the prior year. We look for 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 9 of 165 
 
significant movements.  We look at a new creditors or creditors not 
recurring as well as a new significant debit balances.  During this 
review we identified Homix as a new vendor that had a significant debit 
balance to the amount of approximately R41 million. In review the audit 
documentation documented by our trainees they referred to this amount 
being relating to a commission that was payable in terms of the binding 
Transnet deal.  In line with the terms of the agreement a certain 
percentage of the deal was payable to Homix by the end of February 
2015.  As at the end of February Neotel had not yet received an invoice 
for the amount yet payment had to be made in terms of the contract.  
10 
On the 27 February 2015 an amount of R41 million was paid to Homix.  
These circumstances and the nature of this creditor made us very 
sceptical around this balance.  And the reason we became sceptical is 
because it was new to the company the vendor was not known.  It had 
never been disclosed to us in our conversations with management and 
they were unusual.  And we had just – ordinarily we performed quarter 
review procedures in December and we were aware of the Transnet 
contract being concluded and awarded to Neotel but there was no 
mention of Homix used in previous discussions.  And so when we 
picked it up in our March testing it seemed very unusual to us.  Chair to 
20 
just sketch the scene Transnet was a customer of Neotel and the 
contract – the existing master service agreement was ending in that 
year and Neotel needed to – Neotel and Transnet both needed to 
conclude the contract and they were – we were aware that they were 
under negotiation.  So when we – when we picked up the matter I 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 10 of 165 
 
escalated it to Mr Dennis because we were quite sceptical around the 
nature of this vendor.  And he suggested that we use our forensics 
departments to do some background checks and due diligence.  And 
that is because you know this information was withheld it was not fully 
disclosed and we did not know who they were.  We also called for the 
vendor on-boarding documentation which is a process that the company 
Neotel has when they use vendors and when they on-board them and 
do their own background checks.  When we looked at that information it 
was incomplete and raised a number of red flags and that together with 
our own internal checks left us with quite a bit of concern around the 
10 
Homix transactions.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now at this point of the audit process what 
information or documentation did Deloitte rely on? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At this point in time we had relied 
on the age analysis, enquiries made of finance staff, the vendor on-
boarding documentation and we did have at the time the new – the 
consultancy agreements.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes from what follows in your statement is 
set out from paragraphs 15 to 31 which is Deloitte’s investigation into 
the Homix transaction and you have stated that this relates to the 2015 
20 
financial year and what in particular did the audit seek to establish? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair the audit seeks to establish 
the commerciality around the fees paid to Homix.  We wanted to know 
who Homix was, what did they do and what was their mandate in 
concluding the Transnet contract?  We wanted to understand the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 11 of 165 
 
commerciality of the fees paid for the services – the alleged services 
rendered.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in your audit did you meet anyone – did 
you meet with anyone rather from Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair following our concerns 
we met with various members of management in our enquiries around 
the transaction.  We met with Mr Whiley on the 9 April and we asked – 
and we raised our concern around the Homix transaction.  We wanted 
to know who Homix was, who had engaged with Homix and what did 
they do?  As well as who their shareholders and directors were?  In that 
10 
meeting Mr Whiley did not know who Homix was but he did mention that 
there were two payments made to Homix in the 2015 financial year.  Mr 
Whiley then explained that during early December the negotiations with 
Transnet around the master services agreement had come to an 
impasse.  Members of management within Neotel got together and Mr 
Joshi the CEO suggested that they engage with Homix the agent to help 
them overcome this impasse.  Homix was known to them because they 
previously had brought a Cisko deal earlier in the year.  Mr Whiley they 
went on to explain that the company had done their own background 
checks and there were no red flags noted around the payments and 
20 
Homix.  He then explained that should we need – sorry – Deloitte then 
contested that our background checks indicated otherwise as the 
company was in deregistration.  Mr Whiley also then pointed out that if 
we needed further information around Homix we would need to see the 
CEO Mr Joshi.  We then subsequently met Mr Joshi on the 11 April at 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 12 of 165 
 
the Fire and Ice Hotel in Melrose Arch.  Mr Joshi reiterated the same 
fact pattern as Mr Whiley in that they had reached an impasse and they 
had engaged Homix to assist them resolve the impasse and conclude 
the deal. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes before you go on further just to remind 
ourselves Mr Whiley was the Chief Financial Officer of Neotel, is that 
correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  I would also like to refer you back to page 4 
of your statement at paragraph 10 where you read out the findings of 
10 
your trainees during the early stages of the audit.  In the second last 
sentence of the quotation on page 4 at paragraph 10 you read there 
that this has been raised as a debit balance until such time that the 
invoice is received.  Just in simple layman’s terms what would a debit 
balance refer to in this context? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair in this context the payment 
had been made before the invoice had been received which resulted in 
a debit balance in the creditors. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  You were then going to take the 
Chair through the meeting that took place with officials of Neotel or 
20 
rather employees of Neotel and as I have it that appears from 
paragraph 32 of your statement.  On what date did this meeting take 
place? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair sorry if I can draw the 
counsel to paragraph 25 because that is where we had the meetings 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 13 of 165 
 
with the CEO.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Paragraph 25 that appears on 
page 7.  On what date did this meeting take place? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The meeting with the CEO took 
place on the 11 April 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what was the purpose of that 
meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The purpose of the meeting was to 
understand more around what – who Homix was and what did they do in 
resolving 
the 
alleged 
impasse 
and 
to 
further 
understand 
the 
10 
commerciality of the fees. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now was this meeting recorded in writing? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes we do have Minutes of our 
meetings that we took as our evidence for our audit files. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you to page 30 of the bundle 
which is under folder number 1 Chair.  Would that be a copy of the 
Minutes of your first meeting with Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who recorded these minutes? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  These recorded – these minutes 
20 
would have been recorded by my – the senior manager on the job 
Michelle Viljoen and myself. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes please take the Chair through the 
minutes of this meeting starting with who was in attendance at this 
meeting? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 14 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair in attendance at this 
meeting was Andre Dennis as the LCSP, [indistinct] Magellan as an 
engagement partner, Michelle Viljoen as the senior manager and Mr 
Whiley as the CFO. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you just clarify what LCSP stands for? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  He is the lead client service 
partner.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you and what was discussed at this 
meeting 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So at that meeting we explained 
10 
our concern around Homix.  We wanted to understand the commerciality 
and what Homix did and we were unaware of the use of an agent in 
concluding the master services agreement.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The payments that you were questioning what 
were the amounts of these payments? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The amount that was under 
question was R36 million excluding VAT. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And was there any other amount that you 
were considering? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At the time no however the CFO 
20 
did mention that there was a previous payment made to Homix 
regarding the Cisco deal which we then subsequently went and 
investigated. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did you discuss the involvement rather of 
Homix insofar as who introduced Homix to Neotel?And did you discuss 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 15 of 165 
 
the involvement rather of Homix insofar as who introduced Homix to 
Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We did discuss Homix however the 
information was very limited in that the CFO did not know who Homix 
was.  He was aware that they had brought a previous deal to Neotel 
and on the recommendation of the CEO they engaged Homix and Homix 
helped them close the deal. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And was there any other discussion insofar 
as the payment to Homix in relation to the authority to make such 
payment? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Not at the time with the CFO 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did the CFO Mr Steven Whiley say he did not know 
who Homix was? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair the CFO did not know 
who Homix was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you deal a lot with CFO’s and companies as an 
auditor. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you look at the amount that had been paid to Homix 
20 
and you look at the size of Neotel did it strike you as strange that the 
CFO of the company would not know who Homix was even thought a lot 
of money had been paid to Homix as I understand the position? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair it would – that is correct 
it would strike us as unusual. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 16 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That the CFO would not know who 
Homix is particularly for the quantum and the nature of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The activity in relation to the 
Transnet MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you were having that meeting in April 2015 
and according to the minutes that we were looking at in October 2014 
approximately R30 million had – payment had been made and in 
February of that year 2015 R36 million had been paid.  That is – those 
10 
seem to be quite high amounts that the CFO of a company of this size 
would not know the entity to which they were paying such a lot of 
money? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair that  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It would be of a concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Paragraph 10 of your 
statement which appears on page 4 the quotation you were reading 
insofar as the trainees findings makes reference to an amount of just 
20 
over R41 million having been paid on the 27 February 2015 and in 
these minutes and the Chair has just pointed out there was reference 
made to two payments of R30 million and R36 million which on my 
calculation is a total of R66 million.  So can you please just clarify what 
exact amounts were paid as discovered by Deloitte? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 17 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair.  The – when we 
identified Homix the payment under question was the R36 million ex 
VAT which amounts to the R41 million noted on page 4.  In the inquiries 
with the CFO he then mentioned that a previous payment was made 
which we had not picked up in our routine testing.  And when we further 
went and investigated that payment there was a payment of R30 million 
relating to a Cisco deal done earlier.  So that is the two differences.  
The R41million related to the Transnet MSA and the R30 million which 
was paid earlier for a deal regarding sale of equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the normal duties of CFO in a company of 
10 
this size as Neotel would the CFO not have had to satisfy himself 
before payments of this size were made to anybody?  Would he not or 
she have had to satisfy themselves that there was a proper reason for 
the payment of the money if they had done work that they had actually 
performed work and that that work had been done to Neotel’s 
satisfaction and so on? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair yes we would expect a CFO 
to understand who their – who they are dealing with.  What is the 
nature of the service that was rendered to command fees of such 
magnitude?  What work was actually done?  We would expect some – 
20 
some understanding and interrogation around that on behalf of the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would a CFO not have had to approve that kind of 
payment normally for this kind – this size of company or is it something 
that could have gone without his authorisation that payments of this 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 18 of 165 
 
size? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes it would need to be approved 
by the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And in this case as well as the 
CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And in this case did you establish whether the 
CFO had actually authorised these payments that had already taken 
place? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It had been authorised under his 
10 
finance department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So he would need to take responsibility for it? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But when you say under his department is that 
because you are not sure whether he personally got involved in the 
authorisation or is that because you do know that he did not get 
personally involved but somebody else did get personally involved? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair it is the latter in that if you 
look at the evidence his signature will not be on the payment approval.  
But it is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  His signature was or was not on the… 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  On the second payment on the 
R36 million payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  His signature is not on the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 19 of 165 
 
payment approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  But it is within his department so 
he was aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In the first payment on the R30 
million both the CEO and CFO had approved that payment as a once off 
vendor payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So at least in regard to the first payment he 
knew and approved of the payment and therefore it would – it is quite 
10 
strange that he could approve payment of R30 million to an entity that 
he said he did not know much about.  He did not know anything about. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I being unfair to him? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No your – your question is valid 
and we had the same questions ourselves. Hence the concern around 
Homix and the inquiries that we made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Of the CFO and CEO, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – did you say you asked him what exactly 
20 
Homix had done.  Is that right? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And all he said was something along the lines that 
Homix helped them to break an impasse with Transnet? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is right and – and they 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 20 of 165 
 
concluded the deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he did not tell you exactly what it is they - they 
did? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair and Mr Vaghela you deal 
with issues relating to the delegation of authority in parts of your 
statement.  The meeting that you have just taken the Chair through or 
the minutes of the meeting you have taken the Chair through you 
summarise at paragraphs 17 to 23.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  16 to 23 Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you and did you hold another meeting 
with Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair we then after the 
meeting with the CFO we then had a meeting with the CEO and as the 
CFO had said that if we wanted more information on Homix we need to 
engage with the CEO.  We met with the CEO on 11 April 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the CEO was? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The CFO was – the CEO is 
Mr Joshi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and you - when did this meeting take 
place? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  On 11 April 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who was in attendance at the meeting? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 21 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In that meeting - in that meeting 
was Mr Dennis, myself, Mr Whiley and Mr Joshi. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I refer you to page 32 of the bundle 
under Folder 2 of that EXHIBIT BB9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Page 32 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  It appears under Folder 2.  What is that 
document that appears on that page? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is the minutes of our meeting on 
10 
that day. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who recorded these minutes? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It was myself. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can you then take the Chair through the 
discussion that took place at this meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair at – at this meeting 
Mr Dennis raised the matter around the Homix transaction and we 
wanted to know who Homix was and further information around what 
they did.  The CEO at the time reiterated the same fact pattern as was 
told to us by the CFO.  He mentioned that in – in early December the 
20 
tensions with Transnet escalated and they came to a halt and there was 
an impasse and Transnet were not prepared to negotiate any further on 
the Transnet MSA. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Sorry if I may just interject.  When you refer 
to early December is that early December 2014? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 22 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Please continue. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So the – the negotiations came to 
an impasse and as a result of that the members of management of 
Neotel came together and in that meeting they needed – they needed 
help and Mr Joshi was reminded of Homix and he suggested that they 
engage Homix to assist them resolve the impasse.  He then – he 
advised us in the meeting that Homix wanted 10 percent of the deal and 
– and they could not afford the 10 percent and they negotiated it down 
to 2 percent.  In that meeting Mr Dennis asked Mr Joshi who engaged 
10 
Homix?  With whom did Neotel deal at Homix?  What was the mandate 
and who were Homix supposed to engage with at Transnet and did 
Mr Singh - the Transnet CFO at the time - know who Homix was and 
that Transnet was engaging with an agent and the extent of the fee 
paid to the agent.  The CEO – Mr Joshi - responded that he did not 
know who Homix was and he did not engage with Homix in any manner.  
He also mentioned at the time that the company had done their own 
background checks into the payments made to Homix and in their view 
the payments were valid and the reasons for the payments were valid.  
He then – the CEO said he was introduced to Homix by Neotel’s 
20 
General Manager Strategic Customers Mr Francois Van Der Merwe and 
the communication between Neotel and Homix took place through 
Mr Van Der Merwe as the key contact person within Neotel in respect of 
Homix engagements.  Mr Dennis also asked Mr Joshi at the time that 
did he have Board approval and Mr Joshi replied that he did and he 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 23 of 165 
 
would send a note to Mr Dennis.  Mr Dennis indicated further that 
Deloitte had concerns about the payments made to Homix and that the 
Deloitte Audit Team needed to understand the commerciality of the fee 
paid and required to – required support that the payment was not a 
facilitation payment which could bring the Transnet Master Service 
Agreement into question.  Because of the above inquiries we became 
highly – we – we were highly sceptical about the Homix transactions 
and we were suspicious about the commercial validity of those 
transactions and we needed – we needed more evidence to support 
these fees paid. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At the stage of your interaction with Neotel 
had you been furnished with any invoices upon which these payments 
had been made? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We did – we did have the invoice.  
We also did have the contract and the contract was dated in February – 
February 2015.  Whereas the service – alleged service was rendered in 
December.  So the contract was put after the event but we did – we did 
have that documentation but we – we looked – we were very sceptical 
and we increased our professional scepticism because we really wanted 
to know what they did.  We were looking through the documentation to 
20 
see what Homix did.  We had an impasse on 11 December.  We 
engaged them on 12 December and Neotel had signed the contract on 
14 December.  Transnet signed it on the 19 t h.  So when one looks at 
that timeline we really wanted to understand what Homix did to warrant 
the payment of such fees. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 24 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what was the nature of work or services 
set to have been done or provided on the invoices? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair so I cannot answer that 
without recollecting the invoice which I am not sure if it is in the pack. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  We will deal with that at a later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that – so you have a situation where you ask 
the CFO who is Homix and the CFO says I do not know them and then 
you meet with the CEO.  You say who is Homix.  He also says he does 
not know them.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And at this meeting with Neotel was there 
ever any discussion in relation to the Board of Transnet? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair can you rephrase the 
question? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At this meeting which you have recorded at 
page 32 was there any discussion between yourselves and Neotel in 
relation to Transnet’s Board? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair no – no discussion in 
relation to the Transnet’s Board.  We only raised the question that was 
20 
Transnet aware that an agent - that Neotel had engaged in an agent 
and the reason for that question is because in general knowledge and 
understanding of transacting with such an entity.  Generally there – 
there is a clause that prohibits the use of agents unless disclosed and 
therefore based on that knowledge we – we raised the question. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 25 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the CFO could not tell you what exactly Homix had 
done other than to say they have to break the impasse between Neotel 
and Transnet.  Did you ask the CEO the same question and what was 
his answer if you did? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair we did ask him the same 
question and he answered in the same way as the CFO … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And he resolved – they resolved 
an impasse. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  But they cannot … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not ask for details or did you ask for 
details (intervenes)? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We did ask for – we did ask for 
details Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what was the answer? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  They could not tell us what they 
specifically did other than resolving the impasse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you and they said the person at Transnet 
20 
that 
you 
could 
talk 
to 
who 
was 
dealing 
with 
Homix 
was 
Mr Van Der Merwe? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Mr Van Der Merwe was the person 
at Neotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 26 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  He was the Neotel General 
Manager that looked after the Transnet account … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And he – he engaged with Homix 
on behalf of Neotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought you also asked them according to the 
minutes who at Transnet has been dealing with Homix or did I misread 
the minutes? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We – we did ask that question but 
I think … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I think Chair in the minutes when 
we talk about Francois Van Der Merwe he – he is a Neotel employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The – the minutes – the minutes 
when it says GM Transnet it is actually – he is the General Manager but 
he looked after the Transnet account for Neotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so the minutes are not correct in – in attaching 
him to Transnet? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is – it is just – it may be 
20 
misleading but he is the General … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh … 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he – he is at Neotel.  He was at Neotel but 
dealing with Transnet? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 27 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On behalf of Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You never go to know who at Transnet knew 
about Homix. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No, they could never tell us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Who – who they dealt with at … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At Transnet but we did ask the 
10 
question that did the Transnet CFO … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Know about Homix and we can 
come later to – there is a Transnet letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That will indicate a – will give 
more facts around that that Transnet did know about Homix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  Let us – we proceed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Can I refer you to page 199 
of the bundle?  It is the last page in the exhibit.  Are you able to 
20 
identify that document? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair.  It is the invoice from 
Homix on R356 million. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And is this the invoice you were furnished 
with during your engagement with Neotel? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 28 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the description provided in that 
invoice? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “For Master Services 
Agreement’s success conclusion success fee”. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the amount there is 36 million? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the date of that invoice? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The date is 2 January 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You have summarised detail regarding your 
10 
second meeting with Neotel from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I say – I see that it says success 
fee there.  Is that right? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that suggests that the R36 million that Homix was 
demanding payment of from Neotel was a succession – a success fee? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair it would appear so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In one of your meetings with Neotel either with the 
CFO only with the CFO and the CEO you asked or your colleague asked 
whether this payment was not a facilitation fee and I think there was a 
20 
denial that it was a facilitation fee if I recall correctly.  One, am I 
correct in saying there was a denial that it was a succession - a 
facilitation fee.  Two, irrespective of the answer to that question what 
will be the difference in your experience between a success fee and a 
facilitation fee in the context of the conclusion of a contract? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 29 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I think a fee needs – any fee 
needs to have some sort of activity and one needs to have done 
something in order to earn those fees and the last thing is no – there 
was no acceptance around the facilitation – alleged facilitation fee.  
The management could not articulate what was done to earn those fees 
and we raised – we raised our concern that it – it would appear – we 
needed more evidence to negate that this is not a facilitation fee 
because based on what we were seeing it – it appeared to be as such 
and – and I think it – it boils down to between success fees or 
facilitation fees.  One needs to deal – deal – one needs to dig deeper 
10 
as to what activity and what tasks did the service provider perform and 
understand the commerciality behind that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what I am seeking to establish is whether in 
terms of your understanding and experience with these matters as an 
auditor there would be a distinction between what is called a success 
fee and a facilitation fee in the context of the conclusion of a contract.  
Here we do know that there is a contract that was concluded between 
Transnet and Neotel and – and that the CFO and CEO of Neotel told 
you that the role of Homix was to help break an impasse which led to 
the conclusion of the contract between Transnet and Neotel.  So when 
20 
you asked them that is the CEO and CFO or one of them whether the 
payment was not a facilitation fee you obviously had in mind certain 
features by which you identify a facilitation fee.  So I am asking 
whether the features of a facilitation fee are different from the features 
of a success fee. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 30 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I guess to – to answer that 
question when - when looking at it – it is not just the – the invoice.  It 
was all the – the facts surrounding the vendor and whether one calls it 
– I mean – ordinarily no one would call it a facilitation fee.  You would 
always rename it something else either a commission or a success fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  They might not call it a facilitation fee but you 
know … 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How you identify facilitation fees even if it is called 
by another name and my question is whether there is a difference in the 
10 
features of a facilitation fee and in the features of a success fee. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair in our mind to answer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether it is one and the same thing just different 
names being used – different words being used. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes I think irrespective of what it 
is called then I guess that is where we were – irrespective of what – 
what it is - what the fee is termed on the invoice we needed to 
understand what the service provider did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but what is it that you identify in the transaction or 
in a payment that makes you conclude this is a facilitation fee?  As I 
20 
understand in my own understanding is that most of the - or many times 
a facilitation fee is like an agency fee but that might not be the case in 
all cases.  It might not apply in all cases.  I am not sure.  So I am just 
wondering whether since you did ask this question to them whether you 
knew what the features are for the facilitation fee so that even if they 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 31 of 165 
 
deny that it was a facilitation fee you would still be able to say we can 
see the features of this transaction.  This was a facilitation fee.  This 
denial is disingenuous. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair to – to respond I think there 
were various flags.  When we looked at Homix the entity – you know - 
there were discrepancies in the vendor onboarding documentation.  The 
directors of that company were different to the people who they had 
engaged with.  No one could articulate – when we looked at their 
website there was an invalid webpage.  No one could articulate – no 
one could say who they actually dealt with.  You could not name an 
10 
individual.  One could not articulate which elements of the MSA they 
did.  So it appeared as if – you know – it is just a shelf company and 
when we did our own background searches you could not get to a 
corporate entity that had an – an identity that could resolve an 
impasse.  So I guess it is all those elements that were - that we 
working through at the time that led us to believe – we – we had 
suspected that it was a facilitation fee at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is a facilitation fee?  That is what I am trying to 
establish. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Paying a fee for no value or no 
20 
service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Paying a fee for no value or no 
service would be - in my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a fee paid somebody who has not rendered any 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 32 of 165 
 
service … 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or who has not given you anything of value? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair.  That would be in my 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the normal understanding – is that the normal 
kind of definition? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It – it is - Chair it is – it is based 
on circumstances.  I guess one needs to look at each – each case in its 
- in its - based on its merit and then the circumstances. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there must be something you have done which 
falls under facilitation.  If – if you just give me money when I have done 
nothing.  Why would facilitation come in there if I have not – I am not 
alleged to have facilitated anything? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I will – I would – in your 
view I would imagine that where one has not rendered a service and 
cannot substantiate the fees earned it – it may allege to a facilitation 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I facilitate a transaction and I – or maybe a sale 
and I charge a fee to one of the parties or – or both would that not be a 
20 
facilitation fee? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It maybe but we need to go into 
what activities did that person perform in order to earn the fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Vaghela in your years of 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 33 of 165 
 
practice as an auditor have you ever come across a facilitation fee 
arrangement except the one under reference? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  This would be my first one. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  At paragraph 20 of your statement you 
state there that: 
“Mr Whiley indicated that the first payment to Homix 
related to the Cisco equipment – equipment deal to 
Neotel.” 
And you have given that evidence.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair – counsel which 
10 
paragraph are you referring …? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Paragraph 20 on page 7. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And – and the question is? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The first payment that is said to have been 
made to Homix what was that payment? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is for the Cisco equipment deal. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you back to page 199 of the 
bundle which is the invoice we were looking at a few minutes ago and 
we are going to cross reference that with paragraph 10 of your 
statement at page 4.  The date of this invoice as you have told the 
20 
Chair is 2 January 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And as you have earlier testified a debit 
balance would relate to payment made before invoice.  Do I have that 
correct? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 34 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please then just explain insofar as 
the date of this invoice your paragraph 10 in relation to the debit 
balance and what Mr Whiley told you to have been the first basis of the 
first payment – the first payment to Homix?  Was this the first payment 
to Homix?  Let me ask it differently. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair no this was not the first 
payment to Homix. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now at paragraph 10 you speak of a payment 
being made on 27 February 2015 and you say that it was for an amount 
10 
of just over 41 million.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You also say that this payment was made 
before invoice.  Is this correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  However the invoice that you have referred 
us to at page 199 is dated 2 January 2015? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please just explain how that would 
be a debit balance if just by virtue of the date it would have preceded 
20 
this date of 27 February 2015? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Well it depends on when it was 
actually received … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  By Neotel … 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 35 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And … 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And how many versions there were 
because there were – there was another version of it … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  But in Neotel recording it at the 
time they had not recorded this – this invoice.  So it – it is quite 
possible that the invoice has not been received although it is dated an 
earlier date. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did Neotel ever confirm when this invoice 
10 
was actually received from Homix? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I cannot answer that 
specifically.  I do not recall the noting of the receipt of the invoice. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  From paragraphs 32 to 38 of your statement 
you then set out details relevant to further investigations conducted by 
Deloitte.  At the outset of that topic you speak to events that took place 
on 13 April 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What happened on this day? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Following our inquiries with the 
20 
CEO we were advised to engage with Mr Van Der Merwe who was the 
primary contact between Neotel and Homix.  Myself and Ms Viljoen at 
the time had a meeting with Van Der Merwe who we – where we 
inquired about Homix and – and their role in the Transnet MSA 
Contract. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 36 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I refer you to page 34 of the bundle 
which appears under the Folder 3?  Can you please identify what 
document appears on page 34 of the bundle? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair it is the minutes of meeting 
with Francois Van Der Merwe. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who recorded these minutes? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
Michelle Viljoen, 
the 
Senior 
Manager and myself. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the date on those minutes? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is 13 April 2015. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  2015, thank you.  Who was in attendance at 
the meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
Michelle Viljoen 
the 
Senior 
Manager, Francois Van Der Merwe the General Manager at Neotel and 
myself. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what was discussed at this meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We inquired about Transnet.  
There were various transactions with Transnet and we wanted to 
understand Homix as he had engaged with Homix and we wanted more 
information around who Homix was and what they did and so it was a 
20 
third conversation following the CFO/CEO and – and now the direct 
person. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now in the minutes just under the second 
bullet point starting with: 
“FVDM …” 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 37 of 165 
 
There are certain contracts that are discussed there.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please just read those sub bullets 
under the second bullet? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Okay. 
“FVDM provided an overview of all the Transnet 
transactions that took place in the current year.  
(Indistinct) switches transaction in March 2014.  
CCTV1 in June/July 2014.  The MSA, sale of assets 
mobilisation and CCTV2.” 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And on the sixth bullet there is discussion 
round the MSA process.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please take the Chair through that 
discussion? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So in our – in our discussion Chair 
Mr Van Der Merwe provided an overview of the MSA process. 
“He indicated that in November 2013 Neotel had 
lost the Transnet tender and the tender was 
awarded to T-Systems.  Neotel and Transnet signed 
20 
an 
extension 
agreement 
that 
terminated 
in 
December 2014.  In January 2014 Homix sent a 
letter to FVDM notifying Neotel of a deal at 
Transnet that Neotel was not invited to tender for.  
That is how Neotel became aware of the routers and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 38 of 165 
 
switches deal and how they became aware of 
Homix.  Neotel was made aware by their two people 
at Transnet Gerrie and Yousuf that Transnet has an 
exit plan from Neotel being dimension data.  
According to Mr Van Der Merwe Transnet had trust 
issues with Neotel.  CV asked Mr Van Der Merwe 
who Homix were and their background.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Sorry if – if – when you refer to – to the 
initials CV please just confirm who that would be? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chetan – myself Chetan Vaghela. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you please proceed. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
“He 
asked 
Mr Van Der Merwe who Homix where and their 
background.  Mr Van Der Merwe answered Homix is 
a Dubai based company.  They offered specialised 
consultancy services with staff of 100 employees.  
They have offices in South Africa and their offices 
are 
based 
in 
Pretoria 
Silverton 
where 
Mr Van Der Merwe has visited before.  However he 
usually meets Homix at Melrose Arch.  Homix does 
20 
a lot of work for Transnet and Government.  They 
play at board level.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now what did – what was your understanding 
of what you have just stated there where it says that they play at board 
level? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 39 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It – it alludes to influence in – 
influence in higher levels of management. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Which management? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At – at a Transnet level. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE: 
 
Was 
this 
explained 
specifically 
by 
Mr Van Der Merwe to you? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No.  We just recorded what he told 
us. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did you ask him what he meant by “they play 
at board level”? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  Please proceed. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “CV …” 
Which is myself. 
“…asked Mr Van Der Merwe who he deals with 
specifically at Homix.  Mr Van Der Merwe replied 
that his contact person at Homix is Ashok.  He does 
not recollect this name but he would send his 
details to me.  According to Mr Van Der Merwe 
Ashok is the President of Homix Middle East and 
20 
African Business.  Mr Van Der Merwe also indicated 
that he could arrange a meeting for myself if we 
would like to meet him.  I indicated that there was 
no need to meet him.  Homix was able to swing the 
MSA deal for Neotel because Transnet did not sign 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 40 of 165 
 
a legally enforceable with T-Systems.  As the MSA 
stipulates the supplier needs to be the sole supplier 
which T-Systems at that point was not.  The actual 
contacts at Transnet with regards to the MSA are 
Gerrie Van Der Westhuizen and Yusuf Mohammed.” 
Shall I continue? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes on – on the following page – page 35. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The first sub bullet that appears there can 
you please take the Chair through the discussion that – that took place 
10 
in that respect. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At the - is that at the top of the 
page Chair? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Page 35.  The sub bullet that appears – the 
first sub bullet appears at page 35 starting with: 
“The wheels …” 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “The wheels …” 
“The 
wheels 
can 
move 
on 
the 
10 t h 
and 
11 December 2014.  No one at Transnet was willing 
to talk to Neotel anymore.  Neotel management 
20 
tried to make contact with Transnet and they were 
not taking their calls.  The information received by 
Neotel through their sources was that there were 
talks 
with 
(indistinct). 
 
A 
meeting 
between 
Sunil Joshi, 
Steven Whiley, 
Tracy Cohen 
and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 41 of 165 
 
Mr Van Der Merwe was held during this impasse 
when the decision to use Homix was made by Sunil.  
Sunil Joshin sent an email to the Neotel people 
involved in this transaction suggesting making use 
of Homix.  Neotel negotiated with Homix a fee of 2 
percent of the MSA.  Initially they wanted 10 
percent which was consistent with the previous deal 
terms.  However this pricing was not acceptable to 
Neotel as it would make the deal unprofitable.  
Mr Van Der Merwe is expecting another payment of 
10 
20 million based on the asset sale.  Dependant on 
Transnet 
and 
Neotel 
signing 
the 
operational 
agreement.  Neotel’s new primary contact at 
Transnet is Helen Welshinger.” 
But that is an error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Van Der Merwe according to the minutes of – to 
facilitate a meeting between you and Ashok from Homix and according 
to the minutes you declined that invitation.  Why did you decline it? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I declined the – the meeting 
because it – it was not in my ambit to make those inquiries at that 
20 
level.  It was for management to engage with Homix and understand 
what they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but you wanted to understand because as auditors 
you wanted to see what you were dealing with.  Is it not?  That is my 
understanding.  That is why you had a meeting with the CFO.  That is 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 42 of 165 
 
why you had a meeting with – with the CEO.  That is why were now 
having a meeting with Van Der Merwe because you were told by the 
CEO that Van Der Merwe was the contact person with Homix.  He would 
be the one who has information. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now you have a chance you meet with 
Van Der Merwe and he tells you what he tells you and he says the 
person at Homix that he was dealing with because you wanted to know 
10 
who he dealt with at Homix.  He says that person is Ashok and he 
offers to arrange for a meeting between you and him and you would 
have got a chance to say to Ashok what exactly you did that justifies 
this fee and then you decline.  That is what I do not understand. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair at the time we were still 
making our inquires and so we – I did not take – take the opportunity to 
engage Ashok at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you were going to a meeting with Ashok and 
make same inquires that you have been making with the CFO, the CEO 
and now with the Van Der Merwe.  You want to know something and 
20 
from what I gather the answer they were giving you were not – were not 
satisfactory.  Am I right? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not getting what you were looking for from 
the CFO, from the CEO, from Van Der Merwe and now Van Der Merwe 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 43 of 165 
 
says I can arrange a meeting for you to meet with Ashok and that is the 
person who at least should be able to tell you what he did or what his 
team did to justify this fee and you decline. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not understand why you declined that 
opportunity. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair at the time he just referred 
to it as Ashok and he said he would send us the full details of the name 
later.  So once he had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but he said I can arrange.  He knew – he knew 
10 
Ashok.  It is not like he – he would not because he did not remember 
the surname.  He could not pick up the phone and say I want you to 
meet my auditors – our auditors.  He knew Ashok.  He had met with 
him.  He was dealing with him and you were – you were seeking certain 
answers and he says I can arrange a meeting and you decline. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair for us it was – at the time it 
is quick answer to say I can – I can let you met Ashok.  In that instance 
we were not necessary at that point in time take up the opportunity 
because there – you know – otherwise I am - we wanted – we wanted 
the Neotel Board and – and management and articulate to us.  So it is – 
20 
it is an element of one – one can further the inquiry but it is a matter of 
timing during the audit process that one would take up the opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you later take that opportunity? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The opportunity was later taken up 
by Neotel when the commissioned the investigation. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 44 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  It was taken up by…? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  By the company Neotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
When 
they 
– 
when 
they 
commissioned an independent investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not take it? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  In … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I can just say part of the reason why you were 
10 
asking these questions to the company was to enable you to decide 
whether what was happening was something that was reportable in 
terms of your obligations as an auditor.  Is it not? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And speaking to somebody from Homix could help you 
to get information that would help you decide is this reportable or not. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  It is 11:15.  I do not know 
if this is an opportune time to take the short adjournment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment and we will resume 
at half past 11. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 45 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  ...which you’ve recorded at page 34 of your 
bundle, from 34 to 35.  Earlier the Chair asked you why you did not 
meet with Mr Ashok when the opportunity was presented to you and you 
sought to explain to the Chair why this was not necessary.  At this point 
of your engagement with Neotel what was the basis upon you engaging 
Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair at the time we were still – our 
audit was a routine audit, a company audit and in such circumstances 
we wouldn’t necessarily engage with creditors directly.  Homix was a 
creditor of Neotel and we were still in the fact finding process of our 
10 
audit. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And as I understand it the audit you were 
conducting was an audit on Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes the audit we were conducting 
was the audit of the company and not necessarily an investigation into 
their actual contracts.  As part of our audit we identified these 
contracts that we looked into further. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And in the normal course of an audit of a 
company would you engage that company’s creditors? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   No we would not directly engage 
20 
the company’s creditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if you must satisfy yourself whether the 
transaction is reportable or not and if your client, Neotel is happy for 
you to speak to a creditor and you have no reason to think the creditor 
has any problem, what would be wrong with saying, let me take this 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 46 of 165 
 
offer and talk to Ashok and see whether I can reach – see what 
conclusion I can reach about whether this transaction is reportable or 
not? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair there’s nothing stopping that 
it’s just we were going through our process where at that point in time 
we didn’t take the need to engage Ashok directly…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that’s my difficulty unless your position is 
you didn’t have to satisfy yourself or that the transaction was 
reportable or not, number one, or unless you say there’s nothing that 
Mr Ashok could tell me that could help me make that decision, that’s 
10 
how I see it but there may be something I don’t understand I’m not an 
auditor so feel free to explain to me your thinking if there’s anything 
other than what you’ve already told me that you can tell me to make me 
understand. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair I’ll take you through my 
thinking at the time.  We were making inquiries of the different levels of 
management.  To us Homix was an unknown entity and we couldn’t 
understand what they had done.  There were a lot of red flags as I had 
mentioned earlier in my testimony and the entity did not appear to have 
substance and at the time of our inquiries Amir gathered information 
20 
around who he had engaged with and at the time Mr van der Merwe 
only quoted Ashok, you know, I don’t know who that individual is and 
we wanted to go back and do our own background checks, investigation 
around that.  We further wanted to understand what the company had 
done in forming their background checks which I had a subsequent 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 47 of 165 
 
discussion on Tuesday the 14 t h of April and so we were going through 
our own process in collating information in unpacking who were we 
dealing with and what information had the company had done around 
Homix and therefore I didn’t take up the need.  Subsequent to our 
background checks and once we had received the information as to who 
Ashok was in paragraph 33.1 Ashok he was referring to was Ashok 
Narayan Buthenveedu and when we, Dennis and myself were doing our 
own background checks, Ashok that was identified was linked to the 
Sahara Group of companies which is linked to the Gupta family.  So we 
were going through our own process at the time prior to engaging 
10 
directly with creditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the end of that meeting did you have an 
understanding of what Homix had done to be – to deserve these 
payments? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   No, we were no further – we had no 
further knowledge of exactly what they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you agree with me that somebody from Homix 
certainly would have to answer that question to say, this is what we did, 
that person couldn’t say I don’t know what we did to deserve that 
amount? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes I agree with you Chair 
someone would need to answer that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   But after that meeting we did not 
have answers to the questions as to what they did. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 48 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see my understanding is – is that if in your 
meeting with Mr van der Merwe, you got satisfactory answers then that 
would explain why you didn’t – wouldn’t want to waste time and see 
somebody else, you know but if you did not get satisfactory answers 
and he offered you somebody else that related to Homix, who could – 
who should know what Homix did, it seems natural to say, yes let’s see 
him.   It might be different if he is not prepared to be seen. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair in this situation we were 
getting the same fact pattern from the CFO, the CEO, the General 
Manager, Strategic Projects and we were – the matter was significant 
10 
and it wasn’t getting the attention that it deserved and our subsequent 
steps was that actually Mr Dennis escalated the matter to the Board of 
Neotel. So it wasn’t for us to resolve the matter through our inquiries 
directly with Homix, it was for the Board of Neotel to understand what 
they commissioned Homix to do, what did they do in resolving the 
impasse and how Neotel satisfy themselves that the fees were 
commensurate with the services and therefore in order to take the level 
of inquiry to another level the inquiries were formalised in a letter to 
the Board of Neotel and therefore that was our approach in dealing with 
the matter rather than, I myself engaging with Ashok. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair can we go to page 35 of 
your bundle at the second sub-bullet which you, earlier read out to the 
Chair which says that, Neotel negotiated with Homix a fee of 2% of the 
MSA, initially they wanted 10% which was consistent with previous deal 
terms, what were the previous deal terms, referred to? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 49 of 165 
 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair the previous deal referred to 
is the Cisco switchers and routers deal. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And did you discuss when this negotiation 
with Homix took place? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Not specifically with Mr van der 
Merwe but we – in our discussions with the CEO we were aware that it 
took place on or approximately the 12 t h of December. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Of 2014? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  2014 yes Chair.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And how did this meeting conclude? 
10 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The meeting with Mr van der 
Merwe, he just articulated further information around CCTV1 and 
CCTV2 and as our meeting was a sort of a discussion around Transnet 
as a whole as part of a routine audit discussion we left the meeting as 
such and we did – Mr van der Merwe needed to give me the full name 
of Ashok and if there was any information that we needed, we would 
reach out to him. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And were you eventually provided with the 
full details with the person referred to as Ashok? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes I was Chair. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what detail was provided? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   He provided his full name in an 
email to me which was Ashok Narayan (indistinct) as described in 
clause 33.1. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can you please spell then name and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 50 of 165 
 
surname of Mr Ashok. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Ashok -  A-s-h-o-k Narayan -  N-a-r-
a-y-a-n – Buthenveedu -  B-u-t-h-e-n-v-e-e-d-u. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what did you do with these details once 
you obtained them? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Once we obtained them we did 
some background searches on the internet to try and identify who the 
person potentially may be. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and who did you find the person to be?  
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair through our searches we 
10 
potentially identified him as a Director – Ex-Director or Sahara Group 
of Companies. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and what did you do with this 
information. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair I was with Mr Dennis and we 
shared the information between ourselves and that’s where we left that 
information, but we remained concerned – it increased our worry 
around the commerciality of the fees. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   What increased your worry? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The person who Homix was linked 
20 
to just caused more doubt around the fees being paid and whether 
there was actually substance behind Homix. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And why is that? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Just by virtue of who the party is, I 
mean you know that party or the persons in our view we struggle to 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 51 of 165 
 
understand what they would have done and based media knowledge 
and inferences you know there was a concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say in paragraph 34 of your statement that Mr 
van der Merwe said that Joshi had suggested to him that Neotel engage 
Homix in respect of the Transnet MSA, is that right? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think in one of the minutes Joshi had said to 
you he didn’t know Homix, and now, according to van der Merwe he’s 
the one that suggested they use Homix, is that right? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand that to be rather contradictory or 
you understood it differently.  The CFO said he didn’t know who Homix 
was, Joshi said he didn’t know who Homix was, as I understand in the 
minutes in the meeting that you had but now Mr van der Merwe says it’s 
actually Joshi – Mr Joshi who suggested that Neotel should use Homix. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair, yes that is correct, the 
sequence of events is, at the time of the impasse Homix had brought a 
previous deal to Neotel which was in March/April 2014 and so he was 
aware of Homix bringing a deal to the company and when they were at 
this impasse Joshi then – he was reminded by van der Merwe of Homix 
20 
and then he said, okay well let’s – he suggested that, let’s get that 
agent to assist us.  So he didn’t now – when we asked him who Homix 
was he couldn’t give us details but he just knew of the reference point 
that Homix was an agent that brought a deal to us, so we are told 
based on the inquiries that we had with management. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 52 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He knew of Homix and he knew that Homix had, had 
dealings with Neotel before, what he might not have known might be 
certain details about them but he knew of them at the time he met with 
you, Mr Joshi. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair that’s right, he knew that 
Homix had brought the Cisco deal to Neotel and he recommended that 
Mr van der Merwe engage with Homix for the impasse but when we 
asked him who Homix actually is, you know who are the individuals who 
deal with – he doesn’t have that knowledge of the entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair, from paragraph 36 on page 
10 of your statement you deal with further engagements that Deloitte 
had with Neotel, that is paragraph 36, please take the Chair through 
these engagements. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair, I then further engaged 
with the company secretary, Mr Calvin Theko as the CEO had advised 
that he had done background checks on Homix and there were no flags 
raised in terms of their own background checks. I wish to draw the 
Chair to page 95…(intervention).  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Before you do so, on what date did you have 
20 
this engagement with Mr Theko? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The engagement was on the 14 t h of 
April 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And just to confirm the spelling of Mr 
Theko’s names you said that his name is Calvin, that would be C-a-l-v-
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 53 of 165 
 
i-n. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And the surname T-h-e-k-o for Theko. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes you were referring the Chair to page 95. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair, under paragraph 13, and 
this was the response we had received from Neotel on page 
95…(intervention). 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what is the date of that response? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The date of that response is 5 t h 
10 
June 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair under paragraph 13 the 
response from Neotel, the company was that,  
 
“concerns were raised by Tracy Cohen and Steve Whiley 
 
about Sunil Joshi about Homix and whether there was 
 
knowledge of untoward engagements of facilitation fees to 
 
anyone in Transnet.  On 20 March Joshi got the team together 
 
to discuss the concerns and asked if anyone knew of any such 
 
conduct.  Each member was asked and each replied in the 
20 
 
negative, members were also asked if anyone was aware of 
 
money changing hands involving employees and the response 
 
was also negative.  After the meeting Theko was asked to do 
 
checks on Homix to assess if any red flags were raised but 
 
none were reported by him”.  
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 54 of 165 
 
 
That was the company’s response in relation to the background 
checks that they had done and was in line with our inquiries of the 14 t h 
of April 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and we will go to correspondence that 
preceded that letter, did you know the nature of investigation that was 
said to have been undertaken by Mr Theko? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   No. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Did you enquire with him as to the nature of 
the investigation undertaken? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   At a higher level yes but not in 
10 
detail 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Now at paragraph 37 you then set out the 
processes or further processes that Deloitte pursued in it’s audit.  What 
did Deloitte do in this respect? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Subsequent to us concluding our 
inquiries on the 14 t h of April Mr Dennis raised a letter, a formal letter to 
the Board of Neotel making specific inquiries around the Homix 
transactions.  If I can draw the Chair to Annexure…(intervention). 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Before doing so Mr Vaghela can I refer you 
first to paragraph 37 which is on page 10, that is where you set out the 
20 
further audit process that was undertaken by Deloitte, you then go 
further to set out the concerns that Deloitte had at this juncture, can 
you please take the Chair through these two aspects first? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair during this – during the audit 
process, we reviewed various pieces of information around the on-
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 55 of 165 
 
boarding process, the contract with Homix and other supporting 
documentation.  We had various concerns noted by us as the Deloitte 
team and these included the CIPC search on the registration number of 
Homix as per the Homix contract, returned no result.  Telephone calls 
made to the specified contract details were unanswered, these were 
telephone details noted on the on-boarding information as well as on 
the invoice. An internet search on the registered address of Homix 
returned an address as being a registered – registered to a 
charity…(intervention). 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Sorry Mr Vaghela before you proceed I’m 
10 
informed that the mic is too close to you could you please put it slightly 
forward, thank you. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Forward or back? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Forward, away from you thank you, please 
proceed. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The website address mentioned in 
Homix contract did not return a valid web page, the on-boarding 
documentation did not contain all the standard information that was 
required, such as registration documents, proof of banking details, 
copies of ID’s.  The Homix contract, signed by Joshi was also without 
20 
Board approval and the invoice submitted to Neotel’s finance 
department for the first Cisco deal was a payment for a once-off 
vendor.  All these elements in our process of inquiry and in reviewing 
the information were of concern and were red flags for us. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Then from paragraph 39 you then deal with 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 56 of 165 
 
Deloitte’s engagement with the Board, the Audit Committee and other 
parties and in doing so did you engage any further assistance to assist 
you in your audit? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair, at this point in time Mr 
Dennis engaged external legal counsel – external attorneys Cliffe 
Dekker Hofmeyr to assist us as him as a signing partner and us as a 
firm, with the legal aspects of the matter due to the significance and 
complexity around this matter.  So we had the external legal attorneys 
assisting us. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes you deal with a letter that was sent from 
10 
paragraph 40 of your statement, to whom was this letter sent? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   This letter was sent to the 
Chairman of the Board of Neotel, Mr Shunat, it was dated the 17 t h of 
April as we were not satisfied with the information and the explanations 
provided by Management.  In this letter we posed a number of 
questions to the Board of Neotel in the hope that the answers to these 
questions would assist us to conclude on whether or not there was an 
acceptable commercial basis for the Homix transaction. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And you said that it was the 17 t h of April 
would this be the 17 t h of April 2015? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair, that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can I refer you then to page 40 of the 
bundle which appears under folder number four. Page 37, pardon me, 
it’s on page 37, is that the letter that Deloitte sent to the Board? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that is correct Chair. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 57 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what are you – what contents are 
addressed in this letter to the Board? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   So we specifically outlined the 
Homix contract and the agreement that was signed on the 19 t h of 
February and we specifically asked the management and Board to 
provide information around the commerciality and substance of the 
arrangement with Homix.  In the letter there are a number for bullet 
points asking key questions, such as the selection criteria and he 
reasons for appointing Homix, other service providers considered, the 
credentials and expertise which Homix possesses, what- did Neotel’s 
10 
management or the Board know exactly what would be done by Homix 
or implemented by Homix in carrying out the mandate.  The terms and 
conditions relating to Homix’s involvement in the price negotiation, the 
mandate in terms of reference that Neotel provided to Homix, the clear 
explanation of what Homix brought to the table, which individual at 
Homix did Neotel deal or engage with.  Did Neotel require Homix to 
engage with any particular individuals at Transnet and if so, who they 
were.  Was Transnet made aware that Neotel was going to engage or 
had engaged Homix or any other agent in connection with the 
negotiation and conclusion of the Master Services Agreement.  
20 
Documentation showing the compliance with the levels of authority as 
per the Board approval’s framework and/or showing that there was 
authority from the Board of Neotel to transact with Homix, example the 
Board resolution or minute.  As well as Neotel’s own assessment of the 
Homix relationship as this was indicated by the CEO on the Saturday 11 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 58 of 165 
 
April that a process was followed by his team during March to ensure 
that the payments to Homix are not irregular by nature.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and how does that letter conclude. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The letter concludes in that, 
 
“We require the above information to assess the commerciality 
 
of the arrangement and to support the fee paid and/or payable 
 
to Homix as part of our general duties under auditing  
 
legislation.  This is required before we can (indistinct) to the 
 
Annual Financial statements”.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And following this letter, what then took 
10 
place?  
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Following this letter a special Audit 
Committee was called for on the 21 s t of April 2015 in order for us to 
discuss our concerns relating to the Homix transaction and the 17 t h of 
April letter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Who called this meeting? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Neotel, the company called the 
meeting. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can I then refer…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who in the company? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who in the company called the meeting? you were 
asked who called the meting what was your answer? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   I said, Neotel the company called 
it. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 59 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can I then refer you to page 40 of the 
bundle which appears under folder number five.  What document 
appears at page 40 of the bundle? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   It’s the minutes of the emergency 
Audit Committee meeting on Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And is this the same meeting you’ve just told 
the Chair about? 
10 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And on what date did this meeting take 
place? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   21 April 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this was a meeting of the Audit Committee of 
Neotel. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that included you and Mr Dennis. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair and Michelle Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair and who else was in 
attendance at that meeting? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   It was Mr Andre Dennis, myself, 
Michelle Viljoen and the Audit Committee members Mr Memane, Mr 
Ophner and Mr Fam. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 60 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Please provide the full names of the 
Committee members. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Mr Kennedy Memane, Mr Peter 
Ophner, Mr Tri-Lou Fam. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And did you attend the meeting at it’s 
commencement? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes we did. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Okay can I refer you to the top of page 
40…(intervention). 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Sorry Chair, sorry we attended into 
10 
the meeting, so the meeting was scheduled for three we attended at ten 
past four, sorry for the correction. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And who led the discussions that took place 
at the meeting? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Mr Dennis led the discussions at 
the meeting on behalf of Deloitte. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and what in particular was discussed at 
this meeting…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I just want to understand this, was it a 
meeting of Deloitte and a committee of Neotel or members of Deloitte 
20 
such as yourself and Mr Dennis, although coming from Deloitte are 
members – were members of the Neotel Audit Committee together with 
people internal at Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair we are not members of the 
company’s committee.  We as auditors are invited to the committee 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 61 of 165 
 
meeting, the audit committee meeting was a Neotel audit committee 
meeting…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   An internal committee meeting? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes it’s a sub-committee of the 
Board and obviously financial statements and the financial reporting 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they were having their own meeting the audit 
committee and at a certain stage you came to meet with the audit 
committee?  At a certain stage of their meeting. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You came to attend their meeting so that that part of 
their meeting was a meeting between yourselves and the audit 
committee? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so that one was not just a meeting of the audit 
committee but it involve people from Deloitte and it was a meeting 
between the two? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair but the meeting was 
called for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. No that is fine. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  And just so to remind ourselves 
this meeting was – where you joined the meeting at least as Deloitte 
was as a result of your letter dated the 17 April 2015 wherein you 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 62 of 165 
 
asked certain questions or sought clarification from the chairman of 
Neotel – Neotel’s board? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair the meeting was – the audit 
committee had called a meeting for us to take them through our 
concerns and the letter to brief them about the letter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And at this meeting was there any response 
given to any of the concerns or questions you had raised in your letter 
of the 17 April 2015? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The meeting was a briefing 
meeting where we took them through the enquiries and the responses 
10 
that we had with management.  It was clear from that meeting that the 
directors were enquiring more into the transactions in – than they 
possible should have.  Because it was communicated to us that they – 
the matter had been approved by the board so if it had been approved 
by the board the members would have more knowledge of the matter.  
So that was unusual to us.  We walked through the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get the impression that they were – those 
members of the board who were – those directors were asking more 
questions which you say was unusual?  Did you get the impression that 
they were pretending not to know much about the transaction? 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I do not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that your concern or no – is your concern 
something else when you say it was unusual? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Well we do not know.  Either they 
did know and were pretending or they actually did not know. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 63 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  There are two elements to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We took them through the 
transactions.  There was debate around accounting.  There was a 
debate we raised around our concern around authority and we kept 
asking you know who – what Homix did and what was their mandate?  
And I think it was more an investigate – it was more an inquiry meeting 
from the audit committee members and we presented the facts as we 
understood it at that point in time and we then left the meeting.  I think 
10 
– I think just to make the Chair aware one of the bullets on the minutes 
regarding this transaction … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you just confirm which bullet point? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is the second – it is the second 
last bullet. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  On page 40? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  On page 40 yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The second last from the bottom, yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Regarding this transaction Mr 
Dennis AD which is Mr Dennis therefore explained that no one in 
20 
management can provide a clear answer as to who Homix is.  What is 
there scope of work agreed upon?  Who does Homix engage with at 
Transnet?  Does Transnet know that an agency involved?  What their 
mandate was?  What the terms of authority of the price negotiation they 
had?  I.e. the questions raised in the letter to the board. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 64 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the point that follows speaks of the 
amount in question.  Can you please take the Chair through the – the 
last bullet point on that page? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  TLP which is Tri Luu Pham asked 
whether we would have a different view if the amount was a fixed 
amount rather than a percentage of the contract value. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what was your response to that? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Mr Dennis said it is not relevant 
because the question remains what did the agent do for the fee and 
what was the commerciality for engaging the agent?  The question in 
10 
the letter – the questions in the letter would have remained the same. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I.e. whether it is a percentage or a 
fixed fee.  We needed to understand what they did. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did the audit committee respond to your 
stance in that respect? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  There were various comments 
made KM – Mr Kennedy Memani said making use of agents and paying 
an agents fees is not abnormal and so we had discussion around that 
as noted in the minutes.   But there was not a conclusive answer. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and you earlier said that at this meeting 
you also discussed the issue of authority and that would appear on 
page 41 where that discussion is set out.  Can you please give detail 
around this discussion? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes we raised with the audit 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 65 of 165 
 
committee that we felt that the CEO did not have the board’s authority.  
The reason for that was the agreement was signed by Neotel on the 14 
December.  We engaged Homix on the 12 December.   The note he had 
provided to the board was dated the 16 December and when we look at 
the delegation of authority the delegation of authority talks about 
unbudgeted expenditure, having a limit of R10 million.  And budgeted 
expenditure having a limit of R40 million.  And the MSA fee of R36 
million was in our view unbudgeted because you had an impasse in 
December and that value exceeded the R10 million.  We also in the 
extreme circumstances if you had to take the R36 million and the R25 
10 
million asset sale and add the two together you will get to an amount of 
R61 million and that R61 million exceeded the R40 million limit.  So in 
either way we did not believe he had authority, explicit authority as 
required. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and you deal with the issue of authority 
in paragraphs to follow in your statement.  Now on page 41 of the 
minutes there was some discussion around the payments and payment 
dates, is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair is there – can you 
repeat that? 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Was there any discussion insofar as the 
payment dates?  Perhaps let me refer you to the fifth last bullet point.  
Please take the Chair through that discussion? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair the – Mr Pham asked Mr 
Dennis why Mr Dennis felt comfortable with the first transaction but not 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 66 of 165 
 
the second. Mr Dennis responded that the first payment occurred in 
April 2014 which was in the current financial year.  The first transaction 
was not selected as part of our audit testing and we came to find out 
about the engagement with Homix during our creditors testing in 
February 2015.  Therefore the second transaction was included in our 
testing. The transaction remained to be investigated but we understand 
that management said this was a finder’s fee based on a deal that was 
brought to them and we will still investigate these.  So the payment he 
is referring to is the payment on the Cisko transaction.  It was still in 
the financial year and we would investigate it subsequently. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and the discussion appears to have 
continued please take the Chair through that? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Mr Dennis also indicated that 
there was an additional payment that was due of R5 million which we 
are unclear as to which part of the deal it relates to.  CV – Mr Vaghele 
explained that the R25 million and that the client CFO indicated that it 
was part of the conclusion of the operating agreement.  Whereas the 
CEO indicated it was part of the concluding sale of assets agreement 
which agreement had taken place in December 2014 and which should 
therefore be accrued. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did you gain any clarity as to what the 
R25 million payment would relate to? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The R25 million payment would 
relate to the sale of assets agreement which – which was concluded as 
part of the MSA and which was subsequently accrued in the 31 March 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 67 of 165 
 
2015 accounts. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And were you able to establish that as a 
matter of fact as according to this discussion it was the CEO of Neotel 
who would – who had indicated that the R25 million payment was part 
of the concluding the sale of assets agreement. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair there was a disconnect 
between the CEO and CFO and the disconnect was because based on 
the CEO fact pattern you would need to have accrued it based on the 
CFO fact pattern one would delay accrual to a bit later so that was the 
disconnect in the fact pattern.  On looking through the evidence we 
10 
concluded that it needed to be accrued however we did not get 
comfortable with the commerciality with that fee as well.  It is part of 
the R36 million fee paid in that we could not understand what Homix did 
and was there a commercial basis for the fee arrangement. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And how did that meeting conclude? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The audit – after we presented our 
fact pattern we left the meeting and the audit committee members 
would have their own internal discussion on their own and that is how 
we left that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one thing that Mr Dennis kept on going back to in 
20 
that meeting was what did Homix do and what authority was – what was 
their mandate, is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And each time was he not getting any satisfactory 
answers or answers at all? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 68 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We were not getting satisfactory 
answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you being told what the CFO, CEO and Mr Van 
Der Merwe had told you namely they helped to break an impasse 
between Neotel and Transnet or were you not being told that at this 
meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In this meeting we were not told 
that.  We were actually giving our… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what were you… 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Version of our enquiries. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was happening when these questions were put?  
The board of directors or the committee just kept quiet or what?  
Because he went to that question quite a few times it seems to me, 
what did Homix do?  What was their mandate?  They were mandated to 
do what? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair at the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the committee members just keep quiet or they 
avoided answering that question – those questions or what happened? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  They could not – if one – if we 
look at the minutes that are not – that question is never… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Answered. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Answered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And subsequent to that the board 
commission and independent investigation. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 69 of 165 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  As the – inter – as their process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it must have been quite a very strange thing that 
here was a company that paid very, very large amounts to another 
company and the CFO could not tell you what this was for in any 
satisfactory way.  The CEO could not, Mr Van Der Merwe could not.  
Now the audit committee could not.  It must have been quite a strange 
thing? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair that is why we were 
concerned. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  At the end of this meeting did you and Mr Dennis 
come to any firm conclusion as to your suspicions or not yet? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair after that meeting we did 
come to a conclusion that the audit committee members were not fully 
aware of the Homix transaction and therefore it formed the basis for 
reporting our first reportable irregularity around the breach of 
delegation of authority as well as the commerciality – and for the 
directors to not act in the best interest of the company. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And just for completeness sake insofar as the 
audit committee’s response or – to your questions can you just go 
20 
through the last two bullet points on page 41? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The audit committee said they will 
discuss this matter further without the attendance of Deloitte or 
management.  Deloitte subsequently left the meeting for the audit 
committee to discuss on their own. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 70 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Can we then return to page 12? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that.  You know the third bullet point at 
the top of paragraph – of page 41 says KM asked AD why his letter is 
addressed to the board.  Why was that an important issue, do you 
know?  Was he taking objection to something KM? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair in our view if one – if a 
matter is addressed to the board it highlights the severity or the 
significance of the matter.  And Mr Dennis responded there that you 
know the CEO, The CFO, Mr Theko, Mr Van Der Merwe could not 
provide answers or responses to our questions and that the CEO said 
10 
to him that board approval was obtained for this transaction.  And the 
board approved the Transnet MSA transaction.  And therefore that is – 
that is – because of the – because we were not getting responses to 
our enquiries the next logical step was to escalate it to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that explanation seemed to satisfy him?  Or you 
do not know? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I would not be able to answer that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And we turn to page – return to your 
statement at page 12 and paragraph 43 where you set out events that 
20 
took place subsequent to your meeting with the audit committee of 
Neotel, can you please take the Chair through this? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So subsequent to the 21 April 
2015 meeting with the audit committee Deloitte then evaluated the 
information it had obtained from management in response to the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 71 of 165 
 
queries addressed to management in relation to the Homix transaction 
and payments made to Homix.  I am referring here to all our enquiries 
the on-boarding information, the contracts that we had reviewed and 
based on the meeting with the audit committee we then concluded our 
first RI as required by the Act the Auditors Professions Act.  Chair and 
RI is the act of governing auditors requires us as auditors to act in a 
certain way and it became – and we have a statutory obligation to 
report matters where we have reason to believe that management has 
committed an unlawful act that would have resulted in material financial 
loss or is fraudulent to amounts to theft or is a material breach of 
10 
fiduciary duties.  So in those instances where we have reason to 
believe we would need to report an RI.  And at this point in time we had 
reason to believe that we had a RI regarding – I just want to – I just 
want to –  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you to page 46 please of that 
bundle?  May – page 43 my apologies.  Page 43 not 46.  You earlier 
said to the Chair that based on your engagement with the audit 
committee you then issued your first RI, is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes.Mr Dennis issued the first RI. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now at page 43 what document is that? 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  This is the first RI letter issued by 
Deloitte addressed to Urber on the 28 April 2015.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is Deloitte reporting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So in this RI letter we articulate 
the success fee of R36 million paid to the agent.  We record that the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 72 of 165 
 
commerciality of this transaction remains unclear and we reporting that 
the contents of our investigation suggest that Section76(3) of The 
Company’s Act as well as the common law duty of the directors of the 
company to act in the best interest of the company may have been 
breached.  In our opinion this constitutes an unlawful act or omission 
committed by any persons responsible for management of an entity 
which is likely to cause material financial loss to the entity or to any 
partner, member, shareholder, creditor or investor of the entity in 
respect of their dealings with the entity is fraudulent or amounts to 
theft and represents a material breach of any fiduciary duty owed by 
10 
such person to the entity of any partner, member, shareholder, creditor 
or investor of the entity under any law applying to the entity or conduct 
or management thereof. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  That is fine and when this first report was 
sent to Urba in preparation of this report.  Did you engage the 
assistance of CDH attorneys whom you earlier said you had engaged in 
assisting you with this audit process? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair.  We had engaged CDH 
in our correspondence from the first letter of the 17 April. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and did Neotel receive a copy of this 
20 
report? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Subsequent to your reporting to 
the – to Urba the board of Neotel would have received a copy of this 
letter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What then happened after the issuance of 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 73 of 165 
 
this letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Subsequent to the issuance of the 
letter the board commissioned an investigation – an independent 
investigation into the Homix transactions through Werksmens Attorneys 
and the investigation commenced on the 4 May 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Before that detail around the investigation at 
paragraph 51 of your statement on page 14 you deal with events that 
took place on the 16 May 2015 which relate to a previous occurrence as 
set out in the preceding paragraph.  Please take the Chair through 
these two paragraphs that you have at page 14? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair during the time there were 
various accounting matters that were impacting the audit and I had 
asked one of my trainees to obtain the waiver letter on the [indistinct] 
governance which had been received from the lenders agents from the 
general manager corporate finance treasury Ms Albie Van Der Merwe.  
During – when = at the time Ms Van Der Merwe made some disparaging 
comments around the Deloitte partners and said that Deloitte is – 
Deloitte partners were pedantic and that we would be the reason for 
Neotel going down.  She went further with comments around myself 
specifically which are concerning.  She is quoted as having said that 
20 
Chetan must know of zenophobia and that we know that he is a Zimbo 
and we know people that can sort him out. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What – what happened following that – that 
paragraph 51? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Mr Dennis raised this threat on a 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 74 of 165 
 
Deloitte partner with the chairman on the board on the 16 May 2015.  
An apology was received from the chairman and a disciplinary enquiry 
was followed by Neotel.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Would you say that Deloitte was being 
hampered in its investigation or audit by the employee in question? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I would not say hampered or – it 
was a bit hostile and non-cooperative. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  You then deal with the Werksmans 
investigation from paragraph 52 to 58 of your statement.  Who initiated 
this investigation? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The Werksmans investigation was 
initiated by the board of Neotel in order to address the contents of the 
17 April letter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And on what date did this investigation 
commence? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It commenced on the 4 May 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Then on paragraph 53 you deal with events 
that took place on the 20 May 2015.  What happened on this day? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair in terms of the – there was 
correspondence between Neotel and Deloitte and the first RI was 
20 
issued on the 28 April 2015.  In terms of the RI process we would have 
a responsibility to issue our second report within 30 days from that 
date meaning there was a deadline of 28 May 2015 to issue the second 
report.  Through that process there was correspondence between 
Transnet – oh sorry between Neotel and Deloitte which is articulated in 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 75 of 165 
 
paragraph 53.  So in paragraph 53 we received a letter on the 20 May 
which articulated that the investigation was in process and not 
complete and that Transnet had been approached by Neotel to assist 
Neotel with this investigation in relation to the Homix matter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes can I then refer you to page 97 of the 
bundle.  Are you on that page? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Are you able to identify this document? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair.  It is a letter from 
Transnet to Neotel that we had received as part of the 20 May letter 
10 
from Neotel to us. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And – and what is the date of this letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The date of this letter is 19 May 
2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who signed this letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The letter is signed by Siyabonga 
Gama the acting Group Chief Executive. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  It is a very short letter can you just read the 
letter into the record? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   
20 
“Dear Mr Srinath Neotal Private Limited Master 
Services Agreement with Transnet SOC Limited.  
Your letter dated 16 May 2015 and delivered to my 
office on the 18 May 2015 refers.  I have read your 
letter with great concern regarding its content and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 76 of 165 
 
alleged implications to both Transnet and Neotel.  As 
you know Transnet is a public owned entity that is 
governed by the Public Finance Management Act 
among others.  As a result Transnet must ensure that 
its 
procurement 
practices 
are 
fair, 
equitable, 
transparent and cost effective.  Therefore any 
allegation that purports transgression of the PFMA 
has to be taken very seriously.  Depending on the 
outcome 
of 
your 
investigation 
the 
possible 
consequence could include the termination of the 
10 
contract and the caption and the blacklisting of 
companies involved.  Transnet is comfortable and 
confident of the voracity of its procurement process 
and that [indistinct] would have been breached in the 
award of the contract to Neotel.  This is because the 
process of award of such high value contracts is 
subject to review by both our internal and external 
audit process.  Should you have any concrete 
evidence against Transnet, any Transnet executive 
having committed any wrongdoing I invite you to 
20 
immediately make the evidence of such available to 
me so that we can conduct an internal investigation.  
The result of which will determine whether we agree 
to your request to interview Transnet executives.  In 
order to assist you in the client investigation we can 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 77 of 165 
 
confirm that it is normal practice for Transnet to 
engage business consultants or advisors to navigate 
complex, financial, technical and commercial aspects 
of transactions.  In this regard we can confirm that 
Transnet had employed the services of such advisors 
and we are aware of Homix’ similar role on behalf of 
Neotel.  Please be guided accordingly.  Kind 
Regards.  Siyabonga Gama.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you say that this letter was attached to a 
letter that Neotel had addressed to you? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you to page 70 of the bundle 
which is under folder number 8.  Is that the letter that was sent to 
Deloitte from Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the date of that letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is the 20 May 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who from Neotel had sent this letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  This came from the chairman of 
the board. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now in essence this response from Neotel did 
it confirm or refute your first report on the reportable irregularity that 
you had reported to Urba? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair can you repeat the 
question? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 78 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did this response from Neotel confirm or 
refute the reportable irregularity that you had reported to Urba in 
respect of Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  This letter disagreed with our view 
on the reportable irregularity. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And on what basis did this letter disagree on 
your view? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In their view they – in the view of 
the directors they said – they were of the view that the investigation 
does not confirm the breach of a director in terms of Section 76(3).  So 
10 
that was their view in terms of how they were reading the transaction 
and we had to clarify that in subsequent letters. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  And what is the conclusion of Neotel’s 
letter to Deloitte? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In this letter, this is the first letter 
where we have correspondence with Transnet and because part of the 
accounting considerations was that we ask Neotel whether Transnet 
had known and they needed to seek a waiver from Transnet and this 
letter indicated that Transnet did know of Homix but was quite non co 
operational with Neotel in this regard. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did Deloitte then respond to this letter that 
was sent by Neotel in which they attach Transnet’s letter and in that 
particular letter Mr Siyabonga Gama having stated that they are aware 
of Homix?  Did you …? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Hm. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 79 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did you Deloitte respond to this letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We responded to this letter on – in 
Annexure CV9 which is on page 73. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the date of this letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The letter is dated 22 May 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And to whom is it addressed? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is addressed to the Chairman of 
Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what was your response in essence 
to Neotel? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In this letter we – our response is 
essentially that in our view there was a breach of the delegation of 
authority because when we look at the delegation of authority – sorry – 
can I just have two minutes to just clarify … - in – in this letter we – we 
responded to the – the Board confirming that the CEO did not have the 
requisite authority.  The transaction needed the Board approval and we 
had not seen a Board minute or a resolution authorising the CEO to 
transact with Homix and therefore we believe that the reportable 
regularity was still continuing.  We further – we further state that: 
“The investigation and inquiry into the Transnet 
20 
side of the transaction and the Transnet interaction 
with Homix is still underway but yet there – there – 
we are still awaiting definite answers and what was 
strange to us was that Neotel cannot provide 
readily answers to some of the questions on 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 80 of 165 
 
17 April.  They were awaiting completion of the 
investigation and ordinarily some of those questions 
could be answered at the time and that seemed 
strange to us.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and those questions that you stated 
could be easily answered you had set out from paragraphs 5.1 to 5.5 of 
your letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you just take the Chair through that list? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We said for example: 
10 
“The selection criteria and reasons for appointing 
Homix as a consultancy firm agent.  Other service 
providers which were considered by Neotel in this 
process.  The credentials and expertise which 
Homix 
possesses 
and 
which 
warranted 
its 
engagement by Neotel in connection with the 
Master Services Agreement with Transnet.  Did any 
member of Neotel’s management or board at any 
stage inquire from Homix what exactly would be 
done undertaking and/or implemented by Homix in 
20 
carrying out its mandate in connection with the 
negotiation 
and/or 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Master 
Services Agreement?  If so how did Homix respond 
to the above inquiry?  What did it communicate to 
Neotel and that it would do, undertake or implement 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 81 of 165 
 
in carrying out its mandate in connection with 
negotiating 
and/or 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Master 
Services Agreement.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and – so in essence as at 22 May 2015 
Deloitte had still not received satisfactory answers to their letters or 
concerns raised as early as April 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did Neotel respond to your letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair they did on 26 May 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I refer you to page 78 of the bundle 
10 
which appears under the Folder 11?  Can you please identify that 
document? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
It 
is 
a 
letter 
from 
Neotel 
addressed to Mr Andre Dennis. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and is this the letter that was sent in 
response to Deloitte’s letter of 22 may 2015? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what was Neotel saying to Deloitte in 
response? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In this letter they were still 
20 
disputing the authority that the CEO had and – and their view was that 
it was within his day to day operations – day to day operations 
authority. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Which we – we disagreed with. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 82 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in reply and stating that this was within 
the day to day operations did Neotel apply itself to any threshold 
limitations that might apply in line with any delegation of authority? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No they did not in this – in this 
letter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did Neotel refer you to any resolution 
that might have been passed by the company in line with entering into 
the Master Services Agreement? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No.  No resolution or minute had 
been provided. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I refer you to page 79 at paragraph 3.6 
of that letter?  Can you please take the Chair through that paragraph? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “On 24 October 2014 the 
Board passed a resolution authorising the company 
to enter into the Master Services Agreement with 
Transnet SOC Ltd upon the terms set out in 
paragraph 8.6.5 of the Board Minute.  The authority 
concluded 
with 
the 
following 
statement 
that:  
Mr Sunil Joshi 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
Managing 
Director/CEO be and is hereby authorised with the 
20 
power substitution to take all necessary steps to 
give effect to the above resolution including the 
authority to sign all documents and contracts for 
and on behalf of the company.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And so if one – is one to understand that 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 83 of 165 
 
Neotel’s stance in this letter was that a Board had – the Board had 
passed the resolution authorising the company to enter into the MSA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that was the – that was their 
defence. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE: 
 
And 
that 
authority 
was 
given 
to 
Mr Sunil Joshi? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes in their view. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and the letter then goes on to respond to 
some of the concerns that you had raised.  Can you please summarise 
these – these – the reply that Neotel provided to Deloitte? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair in which – in which – 
which letter are you referring to? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  We are still on the same letter of 
26 May 2015 which is sent – which was sent by Deloitte – by Neotel 
rather to Deloitte and you have just taken the Chair through their 
response relative to a resolution that has said to have been passed.  
The letter then goes on to speak to certain concerns that you had 
raised and I was requesting you to summarise the response that Neotel 
provided to Deloitte. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The letter then continues to just 
20 
outline the steps that had been taken.  So on 30 November the CEO 
had provided an update to the Board.  On 16 December 2014 the CEO 
had reported to the Board on the successful conclusion and in that 
paragraph there is mention of an increase cost.  So it says that: 
“This resulted in an interest cost due to (indistinct), 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 84 of 165 
 
increased SLAs as well as the engagement of the 
consultant Homix to assist us with negotiations and 
closure of the contract.  We were also made aware 
that Transnet have been negotiating with the 
competitor in order to reduce the risks should the 
negotiations with Neotel fail or not conclude and we 
understand that a parallel offer was made by them 
to Transnet as an alternative to Neotel.  This was 
considered a threat.” 
This is the – this is the reference and the CEO had made in terms of 
10 
his Board approval of – of Homix. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And as at this point when you received this 
letter was Deloitte satisfied of all the concerns that they had raised in 
their earlier correspondence? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No we were not.  We – we would 
expect but more specifics around Homix – you know – the pointing of 
the finger, scope of the services and this was an – an update and note 
to the Board noting them on the conclusion of the contract and the 
timing of it was also after the event. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And so did you engage Neotel any further in 
20 
response to their letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We did Chair.  We issued a letter 
dated 27 May 2015 which is on page 82 – Annexure CV12. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what were you raising in that letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In this letter we – we raised that 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 85 of 165 
 
we were not convinced that: 
“The conclusion of the mandate was a day to day – 
was within the day to day management of – of 
Neotel and the rationale behind that was that if – if 
the CEO had the requirement to obtain approval for 
the Transnet Master Services Agreement that was 
the extent to the Homix mandate based on the 
(indistinct) value.  We then articulate that in terms 
of the DOA expenditure outside of the annual 
operating plan which cannot be wait for Board – 
10 
which cannot wait for Board approval.  Has a limit 
of R10 million and expenditure in line with the 
annual operating plan which exceeds 40 million 
requires Board approval.” 
So it does – even if it is argued that the mandate is in line with the day 
to day management the amounts are exceeded by some R21 million if 
you take the R36 million and R25 million Homix fees. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and in respect of the mandate that was 
referred to by Neotel in its letter you address yourself to saying from 
paragraph 5 of your letter.  Is that correct?  It appears on page 83. 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair.  Can you repeat the 
question? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At paragraph 5 of your letter which starts at 
page 83 your reply to Neotel’s response in relation to the mandate.  Is 
that correct? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 86 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you make reference to the amount in 
question.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now at 5.3 to 5.5 that is where - to 5.6 rather 
– that is where you speak to the issue of the mandate relative to the 
amount.  Can you please take the Chair through those paragraphs? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sure.  5.3 says: 
“However the mandate is clearly a standalone 
significant contract in its own right with a third 
10 
party 
involving 
a 
very 
substantial 
payment 
obligation to that third party of R61 million.  R36 
million of which has been paid and R25 million of 
which remains payable as at the date of this letter.  
Nowhere in the Board Resolution is the mandate 
referred to.  Further the Board Resolution in 
questions deals with the subject matter in rather 
specific detail with specific items and amounts in 
connection with the Transnet agreement been 
mentioned and approved.  Example:  the conditions 
20 
that revenue of 900 million or more is reached over 
three years.  Capex does not exceed 140 million 
over three years of which 120 million will be spent 
in year one.  There will be a mobilisation fee of R50 
million for year one.  This level of detail in its 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 87 of 165 
 
entirety is inconsistent with the notion that the 
Board granted the CEO a wide and general power to 
conclude all and any agreements on the contrary.  It 
suggests that the resolution would have specifically 
minuted and approved the mandate if that was 
indeed the Board’s intention.  Therefore in our view 
the Board Resolution quite simply cannot be 
interpreted 
as 
authorising 
the 
mandate 
even 
implicitly or indirectly.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what was said in conclusion in that 
10 
letter?  You may paraphrase it.  You do not need to read it. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In conclusion I mean we – we 
disagreed with the – the Board in that the CEO had the authority to 
execute the Homix mandate and our – our RI remained – we report it as 
continue. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Now following … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Even at this stage they is still could not 
tell you what Homix had done.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
Yes 
Chair 
because 
their 
investigation was still in – in process. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and it is quite strange this when even the Board 
cannot tell you what somebody that their company has paid a lot of 
money did.  They have to get people from outside to just answer that 
simply question and did they answer the question what mandate was 
given to Homix to do?  By this time had the question been answered … 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 88 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When given the mandate to Homix? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At this stage no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now following all this correspondence that 
was exchanged with Neotel at paragraph 57 of your statement on page 
15 you then speak about a meeting that took place.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  When did this meeting take place? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  This meeting took on 26 May 2015. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who was in attendance at that meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I cannot recall all the parties but it 
was a meeting at Norton Rose Fulbright where we had the Audit 
Committee members and Mr Dennis and myself.  Ja, but I cannot 
confirm all the parties in that meeting together with Neotel’s attorneys. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what was the purpose of this meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The purpose of this meeting was 
to – to discuss the information around the Werksmans – Werksmans 
investigation, being legally privileged and the lawyers and the Audit 
Committee were assessing what Deloitte would require in order to 
20 
conclude on – on the audit. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you can just confirm who the law firm 
Norton Rose Fulbright was representing? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
Norton 
Rose 
Fulbright 
was 
representing Neotel.  The investigators were Werksmans. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 89 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you say that the discussion was in 
respect of documents that you were seeking pursuant to the Werksmans 
investigation? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes.  As part of the Werksmans 
investigation there would be a report that would get issued which we 
would need to review and assess in order to conclude on this matter 
and at this point in time the – the issue that was being raised was this 
information is legally privileged. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And when you say the issue being raised one 
would assume that it would be Norton Rose phrasing this issue? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Norton or the company Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and was there any specific document 
which was said to be legally privileged or were – was it – were you to 
understand that all the documents that were used in the Werksmans 
investigation were legally privileged? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In our view it would be all the 
documentation in the Werksmans investigation. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And for what purpose did you require these 
documents? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So Mr Dennis and I indicated that 
20 
we required the results of the investigation that had been initiated by 
the Board in order to conclude on the Homix matter and – and if such 
information was not forthcoming our audit opinion would have been a 
disclaimer of opinion. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and you would have relayed this to 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 90 of 165 
 
Norton Rose or Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We communicated this to the Audit 
Committee of Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And how did that meeting conclude? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The meeting was just one of the – 
it – we did not have a conclusion because there was an – there was – 
between Neotel and Deloitte there were various correspondence that 
would engage on matters.  So there is not a definite conclusion on it 
but we – we – what we – what we took away from that is that the 
information was being restricted and we potentially would not have 
10 
access and so we – the impact of that would result in a disclaimer 
opinion and – and the Audit Committee of Neotel needed to consider 
the impact and how they would want to resolve that. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Before moving on to what happened after this 
meeting can you just briefly explain what a disclaimer opinion would be 
in simple terms? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  A disclaimer opinion is one which 
does not give any assurance and the users of the financial statements 
would not be able to rely on those financial statements and you get to a 
disclaimer opinion where you have a material and a pervasive issue 
20 
that impacts financial statements as a whole in getting to a disclaimer. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Now at this meeting was – did it ever 
become clear or were you ever informed by Neotel or the attorneys 
Norton Rose what Homix had done to be paid the amount that they were 
paid? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 91 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No we still do not have answers to 
that question. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What happened after that meeting? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  After that meeting we reported the 
– the first RI as continuing in our – in the letter dated 28 May 2015 as 
required in terms of the Act. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you to page 87 of the bundle 
which appears under Folder 13 in EXHIBIT BB9?  Are you there? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What document appears at page 87? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  87 is the second report on the – 
on the first RI dated 28 May 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is contained in that report? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In that report we articulate that: 
“The 
Board 
of 
Neotel 
and 
its 
commission 
investigation and that that investigation is ongoing.  
However the success fees of 26 million and further 
25 million that – that needed to be accrued still 
remains 
unsupported 
and 
unclear 
and 
the 
commerciality of this transaction remains unclear 
20 
and at that stage we had reason to believe that the 
RI is still continuing and that the agreement with 
the agent was not duly authorised in terms of the 
delegation of authority and nor was it subsequently 
ratified by the Board.” 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 92 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Now subsequent to the issuance of the 
second RI did Deloitte engage Neotel any further? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Deloitte did not engage Neotel and 
Neotel responded on 5 June with further information. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what further information was provided? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So Deloitte received a letter on 
5 June which is on page 90 and it is CV14 which outlines Neotel’s 
summary of findings of the Werksmans investigation and answering the 
questions that Deloitte had posed in CV4. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what is then communicated to 
10 
Deloitte in that letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  In that letter it is communicated 
that 
Mr Francois Van Der Merwe 
had 
engaged 
in 
a 
clandestine 
relationship with Homix and it articulates the responses to our 
questions raised on 17 April. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in this letter is this clandestine 
relationship described or the extent of that relationship? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair if I can just – if I can quote 
from the letter. 
“By way of general background to the detail 
20 
response set out in this document Neotel records 
the 
information 
has 
become 
available 
as 
a 
consequence of forensic analysis of data over the 
last two weeks.  This provides prima facie evidence 
that Mr Francois Van Der Merwe General Manager 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 93 of 165 
 
Strategic Customers has engaged in a clandestine 
relationship with Homix and person related to that 
entity for a period from at least February 2014 
through to the time of the conclusion of the 
negotiations between Neotel and Transnet SOC Ltd 
and probably through to the present time.  Francois 
has consistently maintained and continues to 
maintain his discussions with the investigators that 
these 
interactions 
with 
Homix 
or 
any 
representatives of the entity were limited to two 
10 
periods.  The first of these was in respect of a 
transaction for the sale of equipment by Neotel to 
Transnet in February/March 2014.  He maintained 
that thereafter he had no further contact with Homix 
until he was requested by Sunil Joshi to reach out 
to 
Homix 
on 
the 
afternoon 
of 
Thursday 
11 December.  The purpose was to seek the 
assistance of Homix in resolving the impasse which 
had arisen between Neotel and Transnet in regard 
to the conclusion of the Master Services Agreement 
20 
between Neotel and Transnet because of the 
breakdown in the negotiation process.  The analysis 
of data however reveals ongoing contact between 
Francois and Homix representatives during the 
course of 2014.  More particularly on the morning of 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 94 of 165 
 
11 December 2014 Francois provided Homix with 
confidential internal emails of Neotel.  These were 
briefing documents prepared by Neotel management 
for Joshi who had curtailed his trip to India and 
returned to South Africa early that morning.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you to page 91 of that letter 
where from the second paragraph from the top …? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Neotel is reporting what the full import of this 
clandestine relationship and dealings between Mr Van Der Merwe and 
10 
Homix were.  Can you briefly take the Chair through this aspect? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “So the full import of this 
clandestine relationship and the dealings between 
Francois and Homix remained unclear.  In order to 
get clarity on that pending disciplinary proceedings 
were initiated by Neotel.  However Francois had 
resigned with immediate effect on 4 June 2015 and 
Neotel sought advice in regard to this exercise of 
civil remedies against Homix and the nature of 
basis for any reporting obligations it may have 
20 
under applicable legislation arising out of this 
matter.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and the letter goes on to address the 
questions that were raised by Deloitte still on page 91.  Paragraphs 1.1 
and 1.2 of that letter sets out the background to the MSA contract.  Is 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 95 of 165 
 
that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And at paragraph 1.3 that is where the letter 
starts to address the background of the involvement of Homix in 
relation to – to Neotel.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you take the Chair through paragraph 
1.3 of that letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So: 
“On 5 December Harris Nupen Attorneys who were 
10 
part of the Transnet Negotiation Team advised that 
Transnet were not prepared to negotiate any further 
and that Neotel either sign …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I missed where you – what page you 
said? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Pardon me Chair.  We are at page 91. 
CHAIRPERSON:  91. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Paragraph 1.3 on that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You may – you can start from the beginning – 
paragraph 1.3. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “On 5 December Harris 
Nupen Attorneys who were part of the Transnet 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 96 of 165 
 
Negotiation Team advised that Transnet were not 
prepared to negotiate any further and that either 
Neotel sign the agreement in its present format or 
the negotiations would be at an end.  Whilst 
negotiating fatigue was acknowledged to be present 
the reasons for Transnet in transience was not 
apparent to the Neotel team or management.  The 
fact that Gerrie Van Der Westhuizen the leading 
technical member of the Transnet Negotiation Team 
had resigned but remained on after he was due to 
10 
have left Transnet’s employ on 30 November was an 
added concern.  Tensions were further escalated by 
the unintended consequences of the rendition by 
Neotel to Transnet of an invoice for services which 
produced an irate response from Transnet on 
8 December.  At this junction Mr Joshi was away 
overseas and due to return on 12 December 
arranged to cut short his trip to return in the early 
morning of 11 December.  Francois had travelled to 
Durban on 8 December to meet Anoj Singh in 
20 
Durban to deal with the fallout in regard to the 
December invoicing and to endeavour get the 
negotiations to recommence.  Thereafter a meeting 
was set up for Singh to meet with Joshi on 
Thursday 11 December in the early afternoon.” 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 97 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  It then continues on the following page 
– page 92.  Chair it is now 1 o’ clock.  I do not know if we can take the 
long adjournment now or conclude on this letter first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us take the lunch adjournment now and we will 
resume at two.  We adjourn. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s proceed. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair. Mr Vaghela before the long 
adjournment you were still taking the Chair through Neotel’s response 
to the reportable irregularity letter which you had issued and you were 
referring to paragraph 1.3 of Neotel’s response which appears at page 
91 of the bundle.  Overleaf at page 92, paragraph 1.4 there is a 
discussion about a meeting with Mr Singh please take the Chair through 
paragraph 1.4. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:     Chair paragraph 1.4 indicates that 
Joshi met – Mr Joshi met with Mr Singh on the 11 t h of December, 
  
“the meeting left him concerned in a contemptuous report to 
20 
 
his management team he stated that Singh seemed distracted 
 
and also changed his tune from the phone conversation I had 
 
with him on Saturday and I’m not sure why.  I mentioned to him 
 
that if we can not reach resolution when the LOI will expire 
 
and then what.  He said we will see over the next day or two 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 98 of 165 
 
 
and then figure out what needs to be done.  It was a strange 
 
meeting but without an outcome, a meeting agreeing to meet 
 
again in short, not sure what to make of it.  At the same time 
 
Joshi received a report from a (indistinct) who has led the 
 
negotiating team to the effect that Transnet was engaged in 
 
parallel discussion with Dimension Data which have been the 
 
third and unsuccessful bidder in the original MSA bid process”.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And the paragraph that follows paragraph 
1.6 details a discussion that Mr Joshi had subsequent to his meeting 
with Mr Singh, please take the Chair through that paragraph. 
10 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “When Joshi returned to the office 
 
after the meeting with Sigh, he discussed the position with 
 
Stephen Whiley the CFO, he had formed the view that Neotel 
 
required assistance in getting the negotiations back on track 
 
and recollected that Homix had successfully introduced Neotel 
 
to Transnet in regard to the transaction for provision of Cisco 
 
equipment at the beginning of 2014.  He could not remember 
 
the name of the intermediary and Whiley reminded him that it 
 
was Homix.  He then called a meeting with Abid and Francois, 
 
according to his contemptuous note to his management team 
20 
 
he reported that, I’ve been rattling my brains on how to 
 
overcome this stalemate we may think the issues are trivial but 
 
Transnet may think they are big.  We can make out how 
 
sensitive they are with Gerrie’s last email on the December 
 
invoice.  As we discussed it could be deal fatigue or just 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 99 of 165 
 
 
inertia or both.  Reality is we need some help to now broker an 
 
outcome, so I’ve separately spoken to Francois and Abid just 
 
now, I’ve asked them to explore the route of the consultant we 
 
used who brokered the Cisco deal at Transnet and see if he is 
 
willing to help and at what cost.  We don’t have a lot of time, 
 
so time is of the essence”. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and one of the concerns or questions 
you had raised with Neotel was whether other services – service 
providers were considered by Neotel and that is addressed in 
paragraph 2.1 of that letter where Neotel sets out their answer to that 
10 
question. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair in the letter they articulate 
that they are not aware of any other service provider that could be 
contacted given the severe time constraint with the imminent expiry. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And one of the other issues that you had 
raised with the credentials and expertise which Homix possessed and 
that is addressed at paragraph 3.1 on page 93 of that letter. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair they indicate that 
management were aware of a successful engagement with Homix during 
the Cisco transaction, the fact that this opportunity was brought to 
20 
Neotel and the obvious inference that Homix had a business 
relationship with Transnet which rendered such a transaction possible, 
led to the conclusion that in the absence of alternative and with the 
time constraint Homix should be invited to indicate whether they were 
able to undertake the assignment. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 100 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Now with reference to that, paragraph 3.1, 
were you aware of the background of the interaction between Homix 
and Transnet in relation to the Cisco transaction? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair at this stage of the inquiries 
we were aware that the Cisco deal was a finder’s fee arrangement in 
that Homix brought the Cisco deal to Neotel and that’s how the 
transaction was explained to us.  However, when we go through – 
further to the Werksmans investigation we then come to understand 
that the Cisco transaction was actually awarded to Neotel prior to any 
involvement of Homix in that Mr van der Merwe actually interjected and 
10 
put Homix into the picture and made it out to be a finder’s fee.  So in 
the company’s reporting – PRICA reporting the company alluded that Mr 
van der Merwe had defrauded the company. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And did you pick this up during your audit 
process, maybe let me clarify, did you pick up the payment to Homix in 
relation to the Cisco equipment deal in our audit process. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair the payment was one of the 
transactions however the first one we picked up was during the MSA 
period, through our inquiries management made us aware of the Cisco 
transaction which was still within the reporting period 1 April 2014 to 31 
20 
March 2015 so it was one of the payments that was subject to further 
investigation and inquiry and it does flow through in our reporting 
irregularities in the further reporting – in the subsequent reporting. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes one of the issues that you had also 
raised with Neotel’s management or the Board was what exactly Homix 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 101 of 165 
 
had done, undertaken and/or implemented in carrying out it’s mandate 
in connection with the negotiation and/or conclusion of the MSA, that 
response is set out in paragraph 4.1 of Neotel’s letter, please take the 
Chair through the response in this regard. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair the response from the 
company indicated that,  
 
“Francois was the only party who communicated directly with 
 
Homix at the time of the appointment.  Management had 
 
characterised the understanding of the assignment for Homix 
 
as requiring them to engage relevant executives at the CPO 
10 
 
offices and the CFO offices at Transnet present the value 
 
proposition of Neotel RFP, assist with the resolution of 
 
unresolved issues with Transnet causing the impasse resulting 
 
in the conclusion of the MSA and the asset sale operational 
 
agreements respectively.  The services are described in the 
 
consultancy agreement signed by Neotel and Homix described 
 
the activities as, Homix to analyse the requirements of both 
 
Neotel and Transnet SOC to find a workable solution to the 
 
impasse in negotiations between Neotel and Transnet SOC.  In 
 
regard to their Master Services Agreement and the related 
20 
 
asset sale”.  
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes now this letter goes on to say that – at 
paragraph 5.1 that the written response from Homix dated the 12 t h of 
December 2014 is annexed, did you receive this letter? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes we did Chair. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 102 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And in this letter are the objectives of this 
agreement between Homix and Neotel set out. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair the letter is very simple in 
nature and it really outlines the fees to be paid.  Chair the document 
you are referring to is on page 96, that letter doesn’t contain the 
specifics that one would require and talks to resolving an impasse and 
finding a workable solution and then outlines the fees to be charged.  
So in our review of this documentation there isn’t sufficient detail 
around what activities they are actually doing. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And this letter is at page 96. 
10 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Of the bundle and it is dated the 12 t h of 
December 2014. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And in the opening paragraph of that letter it 
speaks of today’s engagement is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And the engagement is with Neotel 
pertaining to the MSA? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it further says, as well as the related 
asset sale negotiation with Transnet? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   At the second sentence of that first 
paragraph states that, 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 103 of 165 
 
 
“The talks have reached an impasse and Neotel wishes to 
 
engage the services of Homix to analyse both entities’  
 
requirements to find a workable solution’, 
 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   The letter then goes on to say, 
 
“The work is to be carried out on a pure risk basis and Homix 
 
shall not bill for any time and material nor any out-of-pocket  
 
expense”, 
 
Is this correct? 
10 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   It further goes on to say, 
 
“if successful Neotel shall pay Homix and (indistinct)for the 
 
asset sale a full and final once-off fee of 25million payable 30 
 
days after signature’, 
 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   It goes, 
 
“Secondly for the Masters Services Agreement a fee of 2% of 
 
the value of the contract (currently at 1.8billion)”, 
20 
 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thirdly it says, 
 
“These fees are excluding VAT”, 
 
Is that correct? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 104 of 165 
 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   The letter then goes on to say, 
 
“These fees are success fee commissions payable because of 
 
the assistance and expertise provided by Homix enabling 
 
Neotel to close these two deals that are currently agreed to be 
 
lost business as confirmed by both Neotel and Transnet”, 
 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   In conclusion the letter says, 
 
“please concur the above together with the success fee 
10 
 
structure where the latter shall become binding on Neotel”,  
 
Is this correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   From the reading of this letter do you have 
any understanding of the specific service that Homix would have 
provided to Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair we don’t have any 
understanding of what Neotel is providing, specifically we would want 
to know the assistance and expertise provided by Homix and that’s not 
clear from this letter. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And so the commerciality of this agreement 
is not clear to you? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair it continues to remain 
unclear despite receiving this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you look at how Homix defines their role namely 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 105 of 165 
 
that the success fee would be payable because of their assistance and 
expertise provided by Homix enabling Neotel to close these two deals 
that are currently agreed to be lost business, does that help you in any 
way to say whether if that is true that would or wouldn’t be a facilitation 
fee, that success fee? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair a facilitation fee would 
probably be a legal determination, however, the circumstances would 
indicate…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you mean it would have to be a legal 
determination? 
10 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair because one would need to 
prove – in our engagement and through our engagement with lawyers 
and lenders to get to a facilitation fee one needed – one needs it to be 
proven, so for us to conclude…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but there is something that, if you are told you 
would be able to say, that’s a facilitation fee, if you are told something 
else you would be able to say that’s not a facilitation fee. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair I would put it differently, we 
had a payment without substance, whether we call it a success fee, a 
facilitation fee…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you wanted, at one of the meetings, to find out is 
this a facilitation fee, so that’s why I keep on going back to it and 
partly because facilitation – so-called facilitation fees have a certain – 
have acquired a certain meaning on the market.  So I’m saying if you 
asked you could be told a certain answer and that answer could enable 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 106 of 165 
 
to say that’s a facilitation fee or that’s not a facilitation fee.  So here 
they purport, that is Homix to say what they would give in order to be 
paid this so-called success fee, so I thought you might be able to say, 
well, with this paragraph of what they say they will be doing, yes that 
would be a facilitation fee or not it will not be because of A, B, C, D. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair I would look at all the facts in 
it’s totality and if we look at this letter and where one cannot articulate 
what they were – what Homix did do and if we look at the timeline of 
the impasse and in resolving the MSA it would appear so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well they say they provided assistance in order to 
10 
make sure that Neotel and Transnet reached an agreement. Now 
assistance, I can imagine would be talking to both parties and getting 
them to resume negotiations and being able then to reach agreement. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Agreed Chair but in that instance, 
you know, I guess both parties will be able to say that they met with X, 
Y and Z from Homix, they assisted us with the following clauses, they 
did this, they have specifics…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but on their version they say what they were 
going to do is give assistance and use their expertise to help the 
parties to reach agreement, does that fall within a facilitation fee? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair if they cannot articulate the 
activities that they perform then I would say yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Vaghela at paragraph 
62 of your statement you deal with the letter addressed by Homix to 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 107 of 165 
 
Neotel and that details the work that they had allegedly done but before 
we go to that paragraph at the preceding paragraph, paragraph 60 you 
deal with Deloitte’s response to Neotel’s letter of the 5 t h of June 2015, 
what, in essence, was Deloitte’s response to Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:    Chair our letter of the 9 t h of June 
indicated that we had no further clarity on the commerciality of the 
transactions.  If I can draw the Chair’s attention to page 100 Annexure 
CV15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Annexure? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Annexure CV15 on page 100. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 100. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes what document appears at page 100? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   It is a letter from Deloitte dated 9 t h 
of June addressed to the Chairman of Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what are you communicating to Neotel in 
that letter? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   We are communicating our 
response to the information they provided to our inquiries of a letter 
dated 17 t h April. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and you – can you just take the Chair 
20 
through your conclusion in that letter which starts with, “as pointed 
out”.  You don’t need to read it you can just paraphrase what the 
conclusion was in that respect. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair – counsel can I just make the 
Chair aware to the – some elements in the first paragraph? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 108 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes please go ahead. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   I think just – in the first paragraph 
it says, 
 
“furthermore the clear reluctance of Homix to disclose 
 
information around the presentations made and/or who the 
 
relevant individuals at Transnet are whom they met with leaves 
 
us with more questions around whether there is, in fact, any 
 
commercial substance 
behind 
these 
transactions.  
The 
 
response further does not clarify why the prescribed officers at 
 
Neotel did not question who Homix is, what Homix would do or 
10 
 
did to convince Transnet to conclude the deals with Neotel and 
 
what the payments would be used for.  We must question why 
 
these inquiries were not made at the time, despite the 
 
implications or risks to the company that might arise from such 
 
payments.  It seems to us that persons in authority at Neotel 
 
ought, reasonably to at least suspect that the payment may 
 
have been a facilitation payment and/or to have considered 
 
their obligation to report such suspicion to the authorities 
 
under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act 
 
Section 34.  Failure to do so may not only be an offence under 
20 
 
the Act but would in itself constitute a reportable irregularity in 
 
terms of the Auditing Profession Act.  Given the lack of 
 
specific and detailed information, you have not convinced us 
 
that there should not at least be a suspicion in this regard.    
 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 109 of 165 
 
 
Your Messrs. Fam and Ophner have offered us to meet with 
 
Werksmans as a next step, however we are of the opinion that 
 
Neotel and the Board have to address the matter as described 
 
above. 
We 
will 
then 
consider 
the 
evidence 
and 
the 
 
appropriateness of the Board’s actions in our consideration of 
 
the matter and perform procedures as considered necessary in 
 
the conclusion of the matter and our audit. As pointed out to 
 
you previously the potential impact of payments to Homix is 
 
pervasive to the company’s business. Based on your response 
 
and the lack of information we are in no better position than 
10 
 
we were before in relation to the commercial substance of the 
 
transactions.  For this reason, we cannot issue an audit 
 
opinion  that is any different to the one included in the Audit 
 
Committee documentation submitted to you on the 25 t h of 
 
May”. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and at paragraph 61 you set out what 
then happened after the exchange of the letters of 5 June and 6 June 
2015 respectively, please take the Chair through what then transpired. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair subsequent to that letter we 
were invited to meet with Werksmans where, Werksmans then took us 
20 
through their findings and no report was issued other than the two- 
page document include – under Annexure CV16. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And that would appear at page 102 Chair. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   We were advised that Neotel 
reported suspicions to the relevant authorities in terms of PRICA and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 110 of 165 
 
we were provided with a summary of this report, this report is on page 
102. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   You don’t need to read that report but you 
can paraphrase for the Chair what, in essence, were the findings of this 
report. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair the report in its essence 
concludes that Mr van der Merwe, the former General Manager 
Strategic Customers committed fraud against Neotel potentially 
exceeding them – an amount in excess of the statutory minimum, he 
had a relationship with Homix and he misled the company which 
10 
resulted in these payments to Homix prejudicing Neotel and its 
negotiations with Homix and the MSA.  So if I draw the Chair to the 
second page, paragraph 17 it summarises the conduct of Mr van der 
Merwe. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes then at paragraph 62 therein you deal 
with a letter addressed by Homix to Neotel, is this correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes it is Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can I refer you to page 105 which appears 
under CV17.  Is this the letter that was addressed by Homix to Neotel? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes it is Chair. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what is the date of that letter? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The letter is the 2 n d of July 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Now if you start at page 105 of this letter at 
the outset the letter refers to two letters date June 25 of the year 2015 
regarding the agreement between Homix and Neotel pertaining to the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 111 of 165 
 
asset sale and MSA between Neotel and Transnet is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s what the letter indicates yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it then goes on to discuss these two 
agreements in the paragraph that follows, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can you paraphrase what is stated in that 
paragraph. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   “At the outset we wish to advise 
 
you that both the asset sale and MSA were covered under a 
 
single agreement between Homix and Neotel and we’re 
10 
 
responding to both your letters which are identical in content 
 
through this letter”.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The letter then goes on to respond to several 
queries that were raised by Neotel and it states there that Mr van der 
Merwe was the single point of contact in Neotel, is that correct?  
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And that they have routed all research 
related findings and recommendations that led to the successful 
conclusion of both agreements through Mr van der Merwe, is that 
correct? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   If we turn over to page 106, from the outset 
on that page, Homix provides a timeline of what they did in relation to 
these contracts, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 112 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it starts off with the 11 t h of December 
2014, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   The timeline provides that on the 11 t h of 
December 2014 Mr van der Merwe met with the Homix representative 
being Mr Mandla at JB’s corner to advise of the status quo at Transnet 
and requested consulting assistance with a fresh perspective to help 
Neotel close the deal, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s what the letter says yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   It says that thereafter both agreed to meet 
10 
the next morning being Friday the 12 t h of December 2014, is that 
correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes Chair that’s correct 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And this was dependent on Homix being able 
to assist, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   The following item on the timeline is 
December 12 t h 2014, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   It states there that Mr van der Merwe met 
20 
with Mr Mandla as agreed at approximately 7 o’clock in the morning. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it says that Mandla informed van der 
Merwe that they might be able to assist and the fee would be the same 
as before, namely 10% of transaction value, is that correct? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 113 of 165 
 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And Mr van der Merwe then said that he 
would return later that morning to confirm if this was acceptable to 
Neotel. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Still on December 12 t h 2014 being a Friday, 
it states there that they both met again, this would be Mr van der 
Merwe and Mandla, as I understand it, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it says there that Mr van der Merwe said 
10 
that they could only agree to 2% on MSA and a fixed fee on the assets 
sale, both done on full risk to Homix, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it said that – which meant that if the 
contract did not materialise Neotel would be under no obligation to pay, 
is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it further says that after due deliberation 
of the pros and cons we took the decision to agree to these terms and 
instructed Mandla to accept on behalf of Homix, is that correct? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Then just below that date of the 12 t h of 
December 2014 it stated there – and this is directed to Neotel as I’ve 
earlier stated, 
 
“I wish to inform you here that I made a judgement call based 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 114 of 165 
 
 
on the possibility of the deal materialising immediately when I 
 
heard about it and put my team on the job from December 11 t h 
 
itself”,  
 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s what the letter says. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it says here, please find below a 
chronological sequence of the actions undertaken by our team to assist 
Neotel in securing the deal.  December the 11 t h, in the year 2014 would 
have been on a Thursday, it then goes…(intervention). 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Sorry Chair just on accepting the 
10 
instruction on behalf of Homix that Mandla accepting the – on behalf of 
Homix is contrary to the person that signed the letter, just to note. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes when – the letter goes on further with 
this timeline it says, December 11, 2014 which would be on a Thursday, 
it says there that Homix did…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, there’s a technical problem – 
oh okay let’s continue. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair.  Just under actions taken 
at what seems to be at a high level it says there, 
 
“on December 11 t h, 2014 which would be on a Thursday Homix 
20 
 
deputed senior consultants with a high level of telecom 
 
expertise to quickly deconstruct the deal with a view to  
 
understand both parties’ view of the transaction.  After the 
 
team reported back it became evident to Homix that the  
 
conceptual understanding from the Transnet negotiation team 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 115 of 165 
 
 
(senior manager) was not the same as the view given by 
 
Neotel.  This Homix immediately realised that they could add 
 
value by finding a lever that could possibly help Neotel to  
 
negotiate an agreed position”,  
 
Is this correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That’s what the letter says yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  And it then goes on to set out events of 
December 12 t h, 2014 being the following day on a Friday.  It says there: 
“Subsequent to receiving verbal confirmation from 
Francois Van Der Merwe we immediately assigned 
10 
our senior consultants who were on standby to work 
around the clock and conduct intensive research 
from various sources with a view to find the lever 
that would Neotel get back to the negotiating table 
with Transnet and bring all on the same page on the 
real issues.  Fortunately our team was successful in 
coming up with a tangible solution which pinpointed 
several key factors and a principle lever [as detailed 
below] that Francois Van Der Merwe could use.” 
It further goes on to say: 
20 
“Francois Van Der Merwe subsequently used the 
material provided to interact with Transnet.  We also 
advised Francois Van Der Merwe to adopt an urgent 
approach with Transnet citing the grounds that 
Transnet executives were scheduled to go on leave 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 116 of 165 
 
and if this matter was not urgently resolved the 
extension provision would kick in and Transnet would 
immediately be liable for wasteful expenditure which 
would be reported to Parliament.” 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct per the letter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  As per the letter on page 107 the letter 
goes on to say: 
“Using this approach Francois Van Der Merwe was 
able to convince the Transnet negotiation team and 
10 
executives to agree on a course of action and 
minimum terms with deadlines no later than Monday 
the next week.  This was Homix first step to get both 
parties back to the negotiating table.” 
Now just at this juncture of the 12 December 2014 on a Friday do you 
have any understanding or comment on the work that Homix states to 
have undertaken as up until this date? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair the – to us you know this is 
a letter, it is a one sided letter from Homix.  We could not corroborate 
this with the individuals mentioned.  I mean for example Francois – Mr 
20 
Francois Van Der Merwe did not articulate these elements that he did 
or allegedly did.  So it is a one sided recommendation on what 
happened but if we had to validate this or seek evidence to prove these 
facts we could not do it. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The letter then goes on to say: 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 117 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry and secondly we received 
this letter in July which is after the period where Neotel has reported 
that Mr Van Der Merwe has defrauded the company so we would not 
take any reliance on what Mr Van Der Merwe did. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:    Yes.  Lastly in this timeline still cited as 
December 12, 2014 which is on a Friday it states there that: 
“Homix advised Francois Van Der Merwe to facilitate 
a meeting between Transnet’s CFO and the Neotel 
CEO which he did.  The meeting took place and both 
stakeholders agreed that their respective teams 
10 
would meet on December 13, 2014 and not leave 
until they address all issues outstanding in this 
context Homix strongly advised Francois Van Der 
Merwe to ensure that the Neotel executive decision 
makers be present in the meeting to ensure 
immediate decisions could be taken.  Finally due to 
Homix interventions both parties understood each 
other’s positions and now that the executives were 
on the same page agreement was reached on the 
outstanding points of dissention.” 
20 
Do you understand what then happened on December 13, 2014 being a 
Saturday? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We understand that the team are 
said to have met through the Werksmans investigation report and the 
matters were resolved and Neotel had signed the contract on the 14 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 118 of 165 
 
December. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And according to this timeline Homix 
intervention was from the 11 December 2014 which was on a Thursday 
and according to this letter by Saturday December 13, 2014 they had 
performed some of other duties as they set out which they have stated 
to be the basis upon which an agreement was entered into with Neotel 
and payment made to Homix? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair we still remain – we still 
remain unconvinced because no one could articulate what – what 
changed in the agreement?  Which aspects of the MSA did they engage 
10 
on?  What were the fundamental issues?  And who at Homix engaged 
with the Neotel team and the Transnet team?  You know we will not be 
– we were not offered the opportunity to – well no information around 
who assisted them in the deal was forthcoming.  So whilst a fact 
pattern is articulated to give evidence to some activity we could not 
verify that against credible evidence. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And having gone through this timeline from 
the 11 December 2014 to the 13 December 2014 do you have any view 
on the commerciality of the agreement between Neotel and Homix? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We currently do not have any view 
20 
on the commerciality between Neotel and Homix and it remained 
unsupported until the finalisation of the financial statements. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  From paragraph 65 of your statement at page 
17 you then set out what Deloitte did following receipt of this 
correspondence from Neotel.  Please take the Chair through these 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 119 of 165 
 
events? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair following receiving this 
information in Deloitte’s view the information did not address our 
concerns around the commerciality of the fees paid to Homix.  
Therefore post the investigation and our opportunity to make enquiries 
we raised an RI in respect of the – sorry.  So neither – so if I refer the 
Chair to paragraph 64 where we say: 
“Neither the CEO nor the CFO of Neotel conducted 
any due diligence investigation into Homix prior to 
Homix being engaged nor did they ask any questions 
10 
about what actions Homix intended to take in order 
to resolve the impasse between Neotel and Transnet.  
In Deloitte’s view this conduct was not in the best 
interest of Neotel and caused the company to sustain 
a considerable financial loss.” 
Chair in this instance we raised a RI on the 14 July as –  
“If the CEO and the CFO considered all this 
information 
that 
was 
made 
available 
to 
them 
subsequent to the enquiries the dismissing of 
Francois, the clandestine relationships they did not 
20 
exercise due care, skill or diligence in authorising 
the consultancy arrangement. They did not make 
adequate – due or adequate enquiries with respect to 
the actual activity to be performed by the agent 
having regard to the nature of the consultancy 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 120 of 165 
 
arrangement and the magnitude of the payments 
committed thereunder or adequately interrogate and 
or question the fees payable for the required activity.  
The officers having nevertheless proceeded to 
approve an implement the consultancy agreement 
without adequate information as to what exactly the 
agent would do pursuant thereto must in our view 
have 
reconciled 
themselves 
with 
the 
improper 
conduct of the agent and the ramifications and 
consequences thereof.” 
10 
Chair I think that in this instance we considered that management could 
not be wilfully blind in considering what Homix was about. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the RI that you have referred to issued 
on the 14 July 2015 is that what appears at page 117? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that… 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Under CV18? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What then happened after Deloitte issued this 
report? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  After the issuance of the report we 
20 
were engaging with Neotel at the time and in respect of the opinion that 
Deloitte had on the March 2015 audit of Neotel.   
“Neotel sought a means to move away from the 
disclaimer that Deloitte had indicated it would issue 
based on what Deloitte considered to be pervasive 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 121 of 165 
 
effect of issues created by the Homix transaction on 
Neotel’s financial statements.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can we turn to page 121 of the bundle?  
Annexure CV19.  Is that the letter that Deloitte received from Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair that is a letter that Deloitte 
received from Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the date of that letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The letter is the 7 August 2015. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And this letter is it in response to the 
reportable irregularity reported by Deloitte? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  They do acknowledge the letter – 
the reportable irregularity letter and they go on to various actions that 
the company has been taking in the engagement between Deloitte and 
Neotel.  Chair this letter is also issued subsequent to the suspension of 
the CEO and CFO on the 31 July 2015 after an article broke the press 
relating to the Homix transactions. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  If you turn to page 122 of the bundle. The 
paragraph – the fourth paragraph from the top speaks to the 
investigations that were conducted by Neotel, is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And it also replies to the report that was 
issued by Deloitte relative to the dishonesty of officers of the board, is 
that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No Chair it – we have not issued a 
letter around dishonesty.  It says that their investigations have not 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 122 of 165 
 
found dishonesty on the part of the officers. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And the board is unable to 
conclude that there is appropriate evidence to support your conclusion 
of deliberate or reckless conduct on the part of the officers.  That is in 
response to the RI where we said they did not make sufficient enquiry 
exercise due care skill in engaging with Homix. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in the paragraph that follows Neotel 
makes comments on the board’s recognition of noncompliance with 
internal procedures, is that correct? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes they do highlight sort of 
breakdown internal controls and that improvements would need to be 
actioned in that regard. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The letter then goes on to the following page, 
page 123.  And at the bottom of page 122 is the conclusion in Neotel’s 
letter can you just summarise the conclusion made by Neotel in this 
letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Sorry Chair on what page are you 
referring to? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At the bottom of page 122. 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes at the bottom of that letter 
Chair the board effectively had ratified the CEO’s authority but however 
it did not endorse or – it had limitations to it – its authority but it seek 
to ratify the Homix mandate.  If I read: 
“With limited exception of the ratification of authority 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 123 of 165 
 
as described in point 2 the confirmation and 
ratification 
will 
not 
detract 
from 
the 
board’s 
continuing review of the circumstances surrounding 
the Homix engagement and matters and salary 
thereto.  Including but not limited to any failure on 
the party of any party or person to comply with the 
applicable law and without any restriction in respect 
of 
any 
of 
the 
company’s 
rights 
or 
remedies 
concerning the Homix engagement.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Can we then return to your statement at 
10 
paragraph 67 on page 18 of the bundle?  At paragraph 67 you introduce 
the Vodacom transaction, is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair at the time during the 
2015 audit Neotel was subject to a – to an acquisition by Vodacom and 
that – that deal process was in play. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And for what purpose do you introduce this 
transaction at this point? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  At this point it becomes relevant 
because in terms of the order process we required Neotel to disclose 
the matter to a number of stakeholders.  Those would have included 
20 
Transnet to actually formerly disclose it and obtain a waiver.  To the 
lenders as well as to Vodacom in terms of the sale and purchase 
agreement. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Then in paragraph 68 all the way to 
paragraph 76 you introduce a topic you have entitled “Waivers and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 124 of 165 
 
Disclaimers”, is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the nature of these waivers and 
disclaimers to which you refer? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So currently the – based on the 
evidence that we had our – the – our audit opinion on the Neotel 
financial statements was a disclaimer opinion.  Neotel sought a means 
to move away from the disclaimer opinion and asked Deloitte what was 
required to – in order to move away from the disclaimer.  So in order to 
move away from the disclaimer we required a waiver from Transnet to 
10 
withdraw of its right to withdraw the MSA so that they will not cancel 
the contract as that had a material impact on the financial statements.  
We also required in terms of the long term funding common terms 
agreement which is a lending agreement with the banks we required a 
waiver from the Neotel’s lenders around the Homix transactions as the 
engagement of agents or potential – maybe a potential sanctionable 
practice and it may breach the lending agreement and as a result we 
said we required a waiver from the lenders and furthermore we required 
a waiver from Vodacom as there was a potential sale transaction and 
the matter needed to be disclosed in terms of the sale and purchase 
20 
warranties. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Just so that we clarify in respect of the MSA 
between Neotel and Transnet can you just clarify how the contractual 
matters or issues would arise in your audit process? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So currently the contract was 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 125 of 165 
 
concluded between Transnet and MSA – and Neotel and that MSA gave 
rise to revenue that was recorded in the financial statements of Neotel.  
If the contract was cancellable and there was found to be any 
wrongdoing of Neotel they then may – needed to be a refund of the 
revenue recognised the cancellable contract had a significant impact on 
the future viability of the business and it pervasively impact and there 
was a cash element that would have impacted the going concern.  So 
these elements around the Transnet contract were quite significant and 
the resolution of that was quite a critical matter to resolve in 
concluding the 2015 financial statements. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And at paragraph 69.2 of your statement on 
page 19 you then set out the discussion between the Neotel’s audit 
committee and Deloitte.  Can you take the Chair through this please? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair we communicated to the 
audit committee that to move away from a disclaimer opinion a waiver 
from Transnet was required – a waiver from Transnet of its right to 
withdraw from the MSA based on Neotel’s breach of the MSA by using 
an agent.  The waiver from Neotel’s lenders around the Homix 
transaction and a waiver from Vodacom in respect of the Homix 
transaction.  The Neotel audit committee had advised us that the 
20 
lenders had been briefed and they were managing a waiver process.  
They – the audit committee advised us that they were seeking a waiver 
from Transnet however it was unlikely that a waiver from Transnet 
would be received.  And therefore Neotel was seeking legal counsel – a 
legal counsel opinion on the validity of the contract as a result of the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 126 of 165 
 
breach of the terms of agreement.  Following the legal advice Neotel 
was advised that the matter had been fully disclosed to Transnet.  
Transnet continued to – Neotel continued to trade with Transnet under 
the contract and vice versa and they had to wait 90 days from 
notification to Transnet for any action or termination from Transnet.  If 
these three activities had happened then the contract would – and there 
was no action from Transnet the contract would remain valid.  The 
matter required full disclosure in the accounts in the absence of a 
waiver which was complied with.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  If I might just take you back to paragraph 
10 
69.2 where the audit committee is asking Deloitte for their view and the 
disclaimer opinion could be resolved and Deloitte’s view is set out at 
paragraph 69.2.1 until 69.2. and you have given evidence on this 
opinion. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Would this be an audit opinion or a legal 
opinion because you had earlier – sorry let me just complete. Earlier 
you had said that you had engaged CDH attorneys to assist you in this 
audit. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The opinion we talking to in 
20 
paragraph 69.2 refers to an audit opinion.  The opinion referred to in 
paragraph 71 refers to a legal opinion around the rights of Transnet 
and Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  From paragraph 72 on the page that 
follows page 20 you then speak to the waiver relative to Vodacom.  
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 127 of 165 
 
Please take the Chair through this? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair at the time we requested a 
waiver from Vodacom however we were in discussion as to the impact 
of not receiving a waiver from Vodacom and so the audit committee 
asked us to consider what would that do to our opinion.  And so we – it 
was an open item.  The matter effectively went away because a 
Vodacom transaction was abandoned and therefore there was no further 
need for a waiver. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can you just confirm who Neotel’s 
lenders were from whom waivers would have been required? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I do not have the list of all 
the lenders.   The lenders agents were represented by Nedbank and 
Investec.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and you deal with that at paragraph 76. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  76. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Were these waivers eventually received from 
Nedbank by Neotel? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes Chair they were received.  The initial 
waiver was received on the 14 December 2015.  It is included in pack 
CV20 Annexure CV20.   
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what in essence is – does the waiver 
contain? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So Chair…. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The first – pardon me – the first waiver of 14 
December 2015? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 128 of 165 
 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair if I draw your attention to 
CV128 and CV129 the waiver letter has a response to various clauses 
that are in the lender’s agreement and effectively what we asking is 
based on the knowledge around the Homix transactions either the 
lender waives their rights around that there is a sanctionable practice 
early termination of the Transnet MSA, breach of representations under 
the Transnet MSA, invalidity of the MSA, illegality or invalidity of the 
MSA, compliance with laws, compliance with the Transnet MSA, 
termination of the Transnet MSA. All these matters were requested in 
the waiver.  Some of these were granted and some of these were – the 
10 
lenders believed that there was no breach yet that needed to be 
waived.  
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can you be specific as to still on the first 
waiver by Nedbank which aspects did they say did not amount to any 
breach? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair is I can draw your attention 
to page 22 of my statement. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Page 22. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Or let us go to page 21 and I can 
read what is actually disclosed in the financial statements.  At the 
20 
bottom of page 21 we say: 
“The lenders have acceded to certain waiver of 
certain rights which the lenders may now – may have 
now or in the future under the LFCTA in connection 
with the payments to Homix.  The waivers were 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 129 of 165 
 
requested because the present facts together with 
the facts as may possibly emerge in future could 
indicate a breach of certain warranties by the 
company under the LFCTA and also have an impact 
on the enforceability and or possible rescission of 
the Transnet MSA which in turn may trigger certain 
rights of the lenders under the LFCTA.  The company 
requested the lenders to waive their rights under 
clauses 1.190A, 1.190A3, 1.190A5, 30.16.5, 30.18, 
35.4 and 36.63 of the LFCTA.  The lenders have 
10 
indicated that they did not think it is appropriate to 
grant waives for the potential breaches of these 
clauses of the LFCTA as it appears to them based on 
the information provided that no default has occurred 
and or is continuing in respect of these clauses. 
Thus it remains within the lenders rights under the 
LFCTA to call an event of default should further 
adverse information come to the fore in relation to 
these matters in addition to those that existed as at 
the date of approving these accounts.” 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And just for completion sake at page 128 
through to 130 of the Nedbank’s waiver letter the matters that you have 
spoken to which the lender did not find to constitute a brief – a breach 
rather the first would be at 9.1 is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 130 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And it is stated there it relates to sactionable 
practices? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The second would be early termination of the 
Transnet MSA/ 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The third would be breach of representations 
under the Transnet MSA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The fourth would be the invalidity of the 
10 
MSA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The fifth would be the illegality or invalidity 
of the MSA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The sixth would be compliance 
with laws? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the seventh would be compliance with 
the Transnet MSA? 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes and the eighth is… 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the eighth would be termination of the 
Transnet MSA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You have made reference to two letters of 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 131 of 165 
 
waivers that Nedbank issued.  The second one. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The second one was… 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Appears at – pardon me – under Annexure 21 
as you have earlier stated. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And why was there a second letter of waiver 
issued? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Due to the timing of the matter 
rolling we requested an update letter in June 2016. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  And this letter appears from page 132? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  To 135. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Was there any significant difference 
between this letter and that which was issued earlier by Nedbank 
pardon me? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  No they just continued to say that 
there has been no breach of two clauses and that we do not think it is 
appropriate to provide the waivers requested in paragraph 9.2.  So it is 
on page 134. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  And is there anything of material 
significance in respect of the waiver letters that you wish to bring to 
20 
the Chair’s attention? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  There is no other fact other than 
that you know the lenders were aware of the matter and until the matter 
was proven the view that there was no breach and therefore we took 
the lenders letter – the waiver plus disclosure in the accounts would 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 132 of 165 
 
inform the user on the matter. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  And then from paragraphs 77 or your 
statement at page 22 you deal with the events that unfolded following 
the receipt of the waiver letters from the lenders.  Please take the 
Chair through these events? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair during the – following the 
receipt of the lenders waiver and the disclosure of the validity of the 
Transnet MSA as outlined in paragraph 77 we were busy with the 
closure of the accounts being finalised in December 2017.  Deloitte had 
requested that each of the Neotel directors sign a management 
10 
representation letter in their individual capacity.   
 
Chair it is important to note that ordinarily we would request a 
management representation letter from the CEO and the CFO.  However 
given the circumstances and the nature of the matter that we – we are 
dealing with we extended that – that representation to each of the 
Directors to – to provide that representation to us and the reason we 
did that is because we – we did not know if some Directors knew and 
some Directors did not and if there was full disclosure of information 
from – from the Directors.  So each Director was requested individually 
to provide a representation letter – a management representation letter. 
20 
“The 
letter 
was 
provided 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
11 November 2015 for the Directors to review.  A 
meeting was called by Mr Memani on 23 December 
to discuss this representation letter.  In attendance 
at that meeting were Memani and myself at the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 133 of 165 
 
Neotel 
offices 
and 
Mr Pham, 
Mr Reynolds, 
Mr (indistinct), Mr (indistinct) and Mr Dennis via 
conference call.  We also at the time discussed the 
Vodacom transaction as well as the representation 
letter.  A line by line review of the representation 
letter took place during the meeting.  Amendments 
to the letter were agreed upon except for the 
disclosure of information.  Mr Reynolds indicated 
that the Directors were unable to sign the letter as 
there was apparently privileged information which 
10 
they were unable to share with Dennis and me.  I 
indicated in the response that if the information 
related to Neotel the company then we as auditors 
would require sight of the information.  Failing that 
Dennis and I would need to consider the impact of 
this on our audit opinion.  The matter was left on 
that basis and that Deloitte would consult on this 
matter.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now at paragraph 80 you speak about the 
discussion that took place relevant – relevant to Vodacom.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you also speak of another meeting that 
took place on 15 January 2016.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 134 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And as you have testified it related to the 
Vodacom transaction? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct Chair.  At – Chair 
at that meeting we were debating some accounting issues around the 
Vodacom transaction and at the same time we raised the privilege 
information with Mr Memani and in that instance Mr Memani instructed 
Mr Michael Hart from Norton Rose Fulbright to make the information 
available to Deloitte for the purposes of the audit.  The privilege 
information that was made available included files and reports arising 
out of the Werksmans investigation that was not previously provided to 
10 
Deloitte. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And this information that was provided to you 
– you have set out at paragraphs 83.1 to 83.7 of your statement.  Is 
that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now given where in the state of the audit 
process you were as Deloitte did you find this information to be useful? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair yes the – the information 
was useful to us in that one it was – it was – on it was withheld.  
However the information was concluded around 31 July and the 
20 
information – on reviewing that information it further confirmed the 
suspicions that we had around the Homix fees paid. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did you act upon your suspicions? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We did Chair.  On reviewing the 
information we then reported a further five additional reportable 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 135 of 165 
 
irregularities which are outlined in Annexure C22 to C26. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what was the date on which these five 
further reports were issued? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  These reports were issued on 
8 February 2016. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  If we turn to page 138 of the bundle would 
that be one of the reports that were subsequently issued by Deloitte? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the basis on which this report 
was issued? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair so in this report we – we 
articulate the success fees of R61 million as well as the Homix fee of 
R30.3 million relating to the Cisco agreement.  That is R91.3 million of 
which the commerciality and business lawful purpose remained unclear.  
We then indicate that: 
“The 
Chairman 
of 
the 
company 
mandated 
Werksmans Attorneys to conduct an independent 
investigation into the facts and circumstances 
relating to the transactions with Homix.  From our 
inspection which was completed on 5 February 2016 
20 
of the second preliminary report from Werksmans 
dated 
30 July 2015 
and 
other 
supporting 
information and specialist reports obtained by 
Werksmans 
Attorneys 
we 
concluded 
that 
the 
Directors 
and/or 
prescribed 
officers 
after 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 136 of 165 
 
themselves having considered the report and such 
information ought reasonably to have known or 
suspected that the payments to Homix had no 
business or lawful purpose as referred to in Section 
29 of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act and that 
the Directors had failed to report this fact to the 
Financial Intelligence Centre within 15 business 
days as required in terms of Section 29 of FICA.” 
So our duty was to report that the Directors had failed to report their 
suspicion. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and if we can then turn to Annexure 
CV24. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  23. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  23 – thank you, pardon me.  That appears on 
page 141 of that bundle. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair and this RI relates to the 
same fees in question. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  When you say the same fees are you 
referring to the consultancy arrangement being the success fee of 61 
million and the second payment of 30.3 million in relation of the Cisco 
20 
fee arrangement? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So what is the difference between this report 
and the second report that Deloitte issued? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So this RI relates to another – a 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 137 of 165 
 
breach of another Act.  So we would – we would report each RI in its 
own instance and this one we concluded that: 
“The Directors and/or prescribed officers after 
themselves having considered the report and such 
information ought reasonably to have known or 
suspected that the offence of corruption as defined 
in Part 1 Section 3 of the Prevention and 
Combatting of Corrupt Activities was committed and 
failed to report this offence to any police official in 
terms of Section 34 of PCCA.” 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So as I understand it the first report related 
to a breach in terms of FICA and the second report related to a breach 
in terms of PCCA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can we then turn to page 145 of the bundle 
please? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair this report relates to further 
transactions that we introduce.  In this letter we introduce: 
“The 
company 
entered 
into 
back 
to 
back 
transactions albeit with margin and with their 
20 
customer in this instance Transnet and a supplier 
regarding CCTV transactions.  A success fee of R45 
million relating to the CCV transactions was made 
by 
Homix 
to 
the 
supplier 
of 
Neotel. 
 
The 
commerciality and business lawful purpose of the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 138 of 165 
 
fees to Homix and other transactions relating to the 
same customer brings into question the CCTV 
transactions and the related success fees proposed 
and/or paid.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and it goes on further to speak about the 
relevant legislative prescripts which you say Neotel acted in breach of.  
Please carry on at the following paragraph. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair yes so we – we then 
continue that we concluded that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That sentence a success fee of R45 
10 
million relating to CCTV transactions was made by Homix to the 
supplier of Neotel.  Which supply of Neotel was that? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The supplier in question was 
Techpro. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Was Techpro? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Please proceed with the 
paragraph that follows. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So we in – in this instance we 
20 
concluded that: 
“The Directors and/or prescribed officers ought to 
have reasonably known or suspected that the 
offence of corruption was committed and failed to 
report this offence to any police official in terms of 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 139 of 165 
 
Section 34 of PCCA.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Can we then turn to page 149 of the 
bundle? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes Chair.  This RI relates to the 
same R45 million referred to previously around the CCTV transactions 
and we concluded that: 
“The Directors ought reasonably to have known or 
suspected 
that 
the 
transactions 
entered 
into 
between the company and the customer may have 
arisen due to a fee proposed or paid by the supplier 
10 
to Homix and that no business or lawful purpose as 
referred 
to 
in 
Section 
29 
of 
the 
Financial 
Intelligence Centre Act and failed to report this fact 
to the Financial Intelligence Centre within the 15 
business day period.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  So again the two reports that you have 
just referred to differ only insofar as the violation of the applicable 
legislation.  The first being in terms of PCCA and the second being in 
terms of FICA? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes and – and the violation is in – 
20 
in the Directors or prescribed officers failure to report. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Can we then turn to page 152 please? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair the reportable irregularity 
under page 152 results in the – in the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2015 which had not been prepared and approved within 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 140 of 165 
 
six months of the financial year as required in terms of the Companies 
Act. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and after – can you just confirm the 
dates on which all these reports were issued. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  All the RIs – there were five RIs – 
were all issued on 8 February 2016. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And were these RIs brought to the attention 
of Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We would have first issued the RIs 
to the – the Board and then we would have issued it to the Board of 
10 
Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And was there any response received from 
Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We received a response … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I refer you please to paragraph 92 of 
your statement on page 27? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes.  There were responses 
received on 9 March. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Of which year? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Oh sorry - 9 March 2016. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did you receive individual responses to 
each of the RIs or did you receive a comprehensive response in 
relation to all the RIs that were issued? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  There was – the responses was 
not – there was a response but it was combined.  So we received on 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 141 of 165 
 
CCV27. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  That would be at page 155. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  155. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We received a response in respect 
of the CCTV transactions. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And if I can refer you to the third paragraph 
of that letter starting with: 
“It appears …” 
Can you please take the Chair through that paragraph? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “It appears to be a 
common cause following such discussion that there 
is no direct evidence in the Werksmans report 
establishing agreement between Homix and Techpro 
for the success fee in the amount of R45 million or 
any other amount relating to the CCTV transaction.  
They refer to differences in profit margins between 
the two versions of the quotations directed by 
Neotel to Transnet in respect of the CCTV2 
transactions in March/April 2015 as reflecting as a 
20 
possible source of funds which might be used to 
make a payment to Homix.  This information does 
not emanate from 30 July Werksmans report and 
there remains no evidence of any direct payment to 
Homix.” 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 142 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and can you then read the two 
paragraphs that follow after the paragraph you have just read? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
“Following 
our 
discussions which were conducted in terms of 
Section 45(3)(A) and (B) of the APA we were 
advised 
that 
the 
company 
would 
out 
of 
an 
abundance of caution make a report in respect of 
the CCTV transaction based upon the suspicion of 
an offence corruption under Section 34(1)(A) of 
PCCA and a copy of such report will be provided 
10 
under a separate cover.  The absence of any 
evidence of an unidentifiable payment of the parties 
making and receiving such payment or of an actual 
contract between such parties means the difficulties 
exist in populating a report to be made under 
Section 29 of FICA particularly upon the basis of 
information set out in your letter dated 8 February 
address to (indistinct).  Out of an abundance of 
caution the company will report to FICA in terms of 
Section 29 and a copy of the report will be provided 
20 
under separate cover.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes please continue. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
“The 
company 
will 
instruct its legal advisors to consider and advise 
whether there is any recoverable loss arising out of 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 143 of 165 
 
the matter set out in this letter and will take 
adequate steps to actin in accordance with such 
advice.  We therefore respectfully request your 
confirmation 
that 
you 
were 
advised 
that 
the 
suspected reportable irregularities relating to the 
CCTV transactions are no longer taking place.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now this from Neotel it would appear that 
Neotel only addresses itself to the success fee of 45 million that was 
paid by Homix to Techpro.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair we had not – we had not 
10 
seen a payment but we suspected that there was a – a payment arising 
out of the relationship between Homix and Techpro. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  On what basis did you suspect? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Based on evidence where we saw 
in the Werksmans investigation that there was a letter that Francois 
had on forwarded to - I stand to be corrected – but I think Techpro at 
the time.  There was some evidence inferring and a – an arrangement 
to – for Homix. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And based on that information we 
20 
raised the suspicion around a fee payable on the CCTV transactions. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And that fee (intervenes). 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The – the other – the other 
concern for us was that every transaction with Transnet had a Homix 
element.  You had the Cisco deal.  You had the AMSA.  You had the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 144 of 165 
 
asset sale and we had two significant CCTV transactions that did not 
have a Homix element.  We just had not found it. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and in relation to Homix and Techpro the 
success fee concerned there would be or was R45 million? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now in respect of the other reports that you 
had issues did Neotel respond to those?  Can I refer you to page 164 
which appears as Annexure CV28? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  They responded on 7 March. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Who is they? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Neotel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
Relating 
to 
the 
Cisco 
fee 
arrangement. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what in essence is Neotel’s response in 
relation to the Cisco fee arrangement? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair can I just have some time to 
go through the letter? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Might I refer you to the third paragraph of 
that letter which starts with: 
20 
“The Directors …” 
Please take the Chair through that paragraph and those that follow. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “The Directors were 
advised that the circumstances referred to in your 
letter relating to the consultancy arrangement and 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 145 of 165 
 
the Cisco fee arrangement were not reportable on a 
proper interpretation 
of 
Section 
29 
of 
FICA.  
Payments made to Homix arising from these 
transactions are devoid of any element of money 
laundering or transfer of proceeds of unlawful 
activities.  The FICAs own guidance note records 
that Section 29 of FICA refers to reports being 
made in connection with the proceeds of unlawful 
activities and money laundering or terror financing 
offences as opposed to criminal activity in general.  
10 
FICA does not require reports to be made on 
suspected crimes or unlawful conduct by a person 
apart from money laundering and terror financing 
activities.  On receipt of your letter the Directors 
sought legal advice which confirmed the view set 
out above but recommended that senior counsel be 
consulted in regard to this matter.  After detail 
consultation in regard to the interpretation of 
Section 29(1)(B)(ii) senior counsel agreed that the 
section is ambiguous in its terms and maybe 
20 
interpreted in the manner set out above or on a 
literal basis which will require a report such as you 
suggest which would involve reporting in regard to 
every transaction involving unlawful activity or 
having no apparent business regardless of the 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 146 of 165 
 
absence of any element of money laundering or the 
transfer of proceeds of unlawful activities.  Having 
regard to this uncertainty counsel expressed a view 
that the company should file a Section 29 report in 
regard to these arrangements indicating that the 
report is made out of an abundance of caution.  The 
Directors have accordingly resolved to file a report 
with FICA which is required to be undertaken by 
electronic means and you will be provided with 
confirmation of the filing of such report.  The 
10 
Directors have acted prudently in seeking advice 
upon what you acknowledge to be a complex legal 
issue and have acted in accordance with such 
advice.  They respectfully suggest that there is no 
basis for assertion.  They have acted in breach of 
their fiduciary duties and this view is consistent 
with the advice of external legal counsel and senior 
counsel.  The company has already directed a 
demand for an accounting of the funds paid to 
Homix.  We draw your attention to the fact that the 
20 
success fee paid in respect of the consultancy 
agreement arrangement amounts to 36 million and 
not 61 million.  No payment was made in respect of 
the assets.  So no accounting or any payment has 
been received in response to the demand.  The 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 147 of 165 
 
company has now formally instructed its attorneys 
to initiate proceedings for the recovery of the 
amounts disbursed by it.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now just on the last paragraph that you have 
read where Neotel insists that the success fee relevant to the 
consultancy agreement was 36 million and not 61 million.  What was 
Deloitte’s view in that respect? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Well it is – it still is 61 million it is 
just that they had not paid the 25 million. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The 25 million which would add up to 61 
10 
million? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And was there any other further response by 
Neotel to the reports that were issued by Deloitte? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  There is a further letter on CV29 - 
Annexure CV29. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And that would appear on page 167? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is Neotel’s response to the – one of 
the reports? 
20 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Can I – they also in substance 
they – they resolve to file such a report however they worked through 
the – the legal aspects of it and I will take the Chair through it. 
“Your letter records your conclusions following an 
inspection of a report received by this company 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 148 of 165 
 
from its attorneys dated 30 July 2015 together with 
supporting 
information 
and 
specialist 
reports 
obtained by the attorneys.  The inspection took 
place 
during 
the 
period 
26 January 
to 
5 February 2016.  The inspection was for a specific 
and limited purpose of enabling you to perform your 
audit of this company’s financial statements and 
you acknowledged that the disclosure and making 
available to you of the privileged, private and 
confidential documents did not constitute a waiver 
10 
of the legal professional privilege which inheres in 
the report.  We confirm these terms for the record 
that the Directors upon legal advice filed the 
existing report in regard to fraudulent conduct in 
relation to the consultancy arrangement and the 
Cisco fee arrangement in June 2015 under Section 
34(1)(B) of the Prevention and Combatting of 
Corrupt Activities Act.  They were not advised to file 
any further report following the receipt of the 
supplementary report dated 30 July 2015 which 
20 
confirmed that the matter had been so reported.  On 
receipt or your letter and the reply they sought 
advice from the attorneys in regard to the matter.  
In view of the complexity of the legal issues they 
were advised to consult senior counsel.  The advice 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 149 of 165 
 
received was that an additional report should be 
made on the basis of reasonable suspicion in terms 
of Section 34(1)(A) of PCCA in relation to the 
offence of corruption as defined in Section 3 of that 
Act.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You do not need the paragraphs that follow 
but do you confirm that the last two paragraphs are the same as what 
was contained in the previous response relative to the Directors 
resolving to file a report and secondly relative to the company having 
directed a demand for an accounting of the funds? 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can we then turn to Annexure CV30 on page 
170?  This is the second last response by Neotel to the reports made 
by Deloitte.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And to which report is this letter addressing 
itself? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  It is in response to the CCTV 
transactions in respect of PCCA and FICA. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Can you please take the Chair through 
20 
paragraph 2 of that letter? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “In response to the 
management’s discussions with you and the inquiry 
as to the evidence upon which you base your belief 
that the relevant officers ought reasonably to have 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 150 of 165 
 
known or suspected the offence of corruption you 
advice that your belief was based upon the content 
of paragraph 25 of the first preliminary report from 
the attorneys dated 19 May 2015.  The paragraph in 
question deals with the discovery as part of the 
analysis 
of 
electronic 
communications 
of 
Francois Van Der Merwe of a draft letter apparently 
prepared by Van Der Merwe which appears to be an 
adaption of the original letter dated 6 January 2014 
alleged to have been addressed by Homix to Neotel 
10 
in relation to the Cisco transaction.  The adaptation 
of the draft is to change the addressee to Techpro 
and 
to 
change 
the 
subject 
matter 
to 
the 
replacement of CCTV equipment and the value of 
the project is estimated to be between 100 million 
and 200 million excluding VAT.  The fee amount has 
changed to R45 million.  Minutes later the same 
mail was sent by Van Der Merwe to another Homix 
related email address with the invitation to please 
adjust and paste.” 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  It then goes further to discuss 
Werksmans report. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
“There is however no evidence in the Werksmans 
report the draft letter or any revision thereof was 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 151 of 165 
 
ever forwarded by Homix to Techpro nor is there 
any basis for the conclusion reached by you in your 
letter that a success fee arrangement of R45 million 
related to the CCTV transaction was made by Homix 
to the supplier of Neotel.  The Board of the 
company 
has 
no 
knowledge 
of 
any 
such 
arrangement and enquiries made on its behalf with 
Techpro produced a denial of the existence of any 
such arrangement or the payment by Techpro of any 
amount by that company to Homix.  The company 
10 
itself has not paid any such amount to Homix or to 
Techpro.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Then the letter addresses itself to 
commerciality aspect from page 171.  At the second paragraph on that 
page speaks to the company having – having been advised in relation 
to the reporting obligation.  Is that correct? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Please take the Chair through that aspect 
and the paragraph that follows. 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  “The company has been 
20 
advised and accepts that a reporting obligation 
based upon reasonable suspicion requires a critical 
analysis and assessment of the information and 
evidence upon which the suspicion is to be based.  
In the absence of any evidence that any letter was 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 152 of 165 
 
in fact addressed by Homix to Techpro or that any 
agreement was entered into between Homix and 
Techpro or that any payments past between those 
entities there is no reasonable basis for your 
proposition that the commerciality and business 
lawful 
purpose 
of 
fees 
to 
Homix 
in 
either 
transactions relating to the same customer brings 
into question the CCTV transactions and related 
success fees proposed and or paid.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Next. 
10 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA: 
 
“We 
respectfully 
suggested in the absence of any evidence in the 
records of the company of any payment of a fee in 
respect of either of the CCTV transactions the 
absence of any evidence that any contract was in 
fact entered into between Homix and Techpro and 
the outright denial by Techpro of any knowledge of 
or payment to Homix reflect that your assumption 
does not meet the requirements of reasonable 
suspicion in a manner which justifies the report 
20 
under Section 34(1)(A) of PCCA.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Now all these responses that Neotel 
wrote to Deloitte in response to the reports … 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 153 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did Deloitte take the matter any further with 
Neotel? 
MR CHETAN CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  We did Chair.  However the letter 
of – the letter of 7 March where they dispute they CCTV transactions 
they subsequently agree to on 9 March out of abundance of caution and 
so we – we had suspicion around the transactions and - and it was a 
matter to report them and to investigate them.  Not to – not to negate a 
fact that we are raising – you know – that there’s this information.  The 
onus on the company is to go and further investigate in a bit more 
detail given the circumstances that arose, and therefore in our opinion 
10 
Neotel had failed to report those transactions timeously by the 9 t h of 
March, and as a result Deloitte had reported all RI’s as continuing. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what was the repercussion in that 
respect? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The repercussion is that the matter 
is disclosed in the financial statements as continuing and then IRBA 
has the ability to act and inform the relevant authorities that they 
believe need to be informed based on the second RI. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, can we then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It would change your view on whether the matter was 
20 
reportable? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair we didn’t change our view, 
we believed it was reportable and the correspondence from the 
company does tend to agree with that view because there were differing 
legal views in the correspondence and so we didn’t change our view, 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 154 of 165 
 
and the company actually did report it but late, so it didn’t help 
resolving the RI. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So didn’t the company seek to persuade you to 
change your view on that? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   They did but they wrote to us on 
the 7 t h of March seeking to change our view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   We remained firm in our view, and 
they sought legal advice again and the legal advice concurred with our 
view and therefore they decided to report out of abundant caution, 
10 
however they reported late, we received the reports late and therefore 
the IR’s remained continuing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought you were saying something to the effect 
that in regard to the CCTV matter you changed your view or something. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   No Chair we didn’t change our view 
there was – the 7 t h of March correspondence was disputing that and 
then the 9 t h of March correspondence conceded with us and therefore 
we remained firm that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You stood your ground on all of the matters? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes on all RI’s yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair.  Can we then return to your 
statement at paragraph 94 on page 27.  In that paragraph you speak to 
events that took place during the period 9 March 2016 to the 30 t h of 
June 2016. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 155 of 165 
 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   So during this period we were busy 
with the 2016 audit and a significant outstanding matter that was 
required was the funding of approximately 1.5 to 2.1billion to conclude 
on the going concern of the company.  In the absence of further funding 
from the shareholders or the lenders this delayed the finalisation of the 
financial statements for 2015/2016, so the company required further 
funding in order to continue.   
 
At the same time the company was subject to an acquisition by 
Liquid Telecoms and that acquisition was concluded on the 26 t h of June 
2016. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and then at paragraph 96 you then 
speak to events that took place on the 15 t h of September 2016. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes on the 15 t h of September I 
received approval from the audit committee of Neotel to engage with 
Kay 
Tennessee 
the 
Group 
Financial 
Director 
of 
Liquid 
Telecommunication.  In order to consider the impact of the sale 
transaction and the new shareholder funding on the going concern 
basis of conclusion.  The resolution of the funding shortfall was 
considered through the sale transaction and this would require the sale 
of the company to the new shareholders to be effective and all 
20 
conditions precedents in the agreement to be met in order to sign the 
financial statements on a going concern basis.   
 
The sale of the company to Liquid Telecom was completed on 
the 10 t h of February 2017, with the conditions precedent to the sale and 
purchase agreement being complete and on this date the financial 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 156 of 165 
 
statements for the 2015 and 2016 were signed by the auditors. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, and what was the status of the audit of 
the financial statements? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   The audit was completed, however 
the 
audited 
financials 
remained 
qualified 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
commerciality of the Homix transaction, and disclosure of this matter is 
noted in the financial statements as well as in the audit report.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, then you last deal with what transpired 
after the financial statements for them to be qualified by Deloitte? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Chair there I mean at that stage the 
10 
audit is effectively complete, so on the 10 t h of February we had 
concluded the 2015 and 2016 audits, but the commerciality of the fees 
paid to Homix remained unanswered and supported. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, can I refer you back to page 155 of the 
bundle, which is Annexure CV 27.  Earlier you referred the Chair to a 
letter by Neotel which you state had been dated the 9 t h of March 2016, 
is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Would that be the letter that appears at page 
155? 
20 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And where in the letter does Neotel appear 
to have changed its stance in comparison to its previous letter? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   So following our discussions which 
were conducted in terms of Section 45 it’s the fourth paragraph. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 157 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   “Following our discussions which 
were conducted in terms of Section 45(3) (a) and (b) of the APA you 
were advised that the company would out of an abundance of caution 
make a report in respect of the CCTV transaction, based upon the 
suspicion of offensive corruption under Section 34(1)(a) of FICA.  A 
copy of such report will be provided under separate cover. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and you have taken the Chair through 
this earlier? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   You then conclude your statement in relation 
to the copy of the contracts that Homix entered into, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Sorry Chair if you just go further on 
to page 156 in the first paragraph it also then says at the end of that 
paragraph: 
“Out of an abundance of caution the company will report to 
FICA in terms of Section 29 and a copy of the report will be 
provided under separate cover.” 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes thank you.  And the last paragraph, it’s 
stated there that the letter supplements the earlier letter of 7 March 
20 
2016, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And it further says that it replaces the 
conclusions set out therein, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   Yes that’s correct. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 158 of 165 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   At paragraph 99 of your statement you make 
reference to the contracts that Homix was, had entered into, is that 
correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   You made reference to Annexure CV32 and 
33, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you go back to page 156 the second paragraph 
from the end of the letter, from Neotel, where it says we therefore 
respectfully request your confirmation that you will advise the 
10 
regulatory body that the suspected reported irregularities relating to 
the CCTV transactions are no longer taking place, what does that 
mean? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:   It means the company was asking 
us that they – they were going to report the transactions and therefore 
in our second report we should report them as the IR not continuing.  
The issue that we had was that we received the – they reported late, so 
they had provided the information past our deadline and we had a 
deadline of the 9 t h of March, so we had got the information subsequent 
to us reporting it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The irregularity that they were saying you must 
advise the regulatory body that it was no longer continuing was the 
failure to report? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So once they have reported even though late they 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 159 of 165 
 
were saying just confirm that there is no longer a continuing 
irregularity. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  So Chair had they reported on the 
8 t h of March then we would have been able to accede to that but they 
hadn’t at the time of us providing our second report we had not 
received evidence that they had reported. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  And therefore we could not report 
that it was not continuing, we had to report that it is continuing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  The copies of the Homix 
contracts you have attached as CV32 and 33, and those annexures 
appear from page 175 of the bundle, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is there anything in particular you wish to 
draw the Chair’s attention to in respect of those agreements. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair the only aspect to draw here 
is that the agreements were separated to split the 36million and the 
25million to be under the threshold of 40million, the agreements were 
dated 19 February, if we contracted we contracted in December so it’s 
20 
after the event and the person signing these contracts is not mentioned 
in any engagement with Homix. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in the first agreement at page 178 of the 
bundle, paragraph 4 thereof, sets out the consultancy services, is that 
correct? 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 160 of 165 
 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And it says there that the consultant agrees 
to undertake to analyse the requirements of both Neotel and Transnet 
SOC to find a workable solution to the impasse in negotiations between 
Neotel and Transnet SOC in regard to the Master Services Agreement, 
is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And with regard to the second agreement you 
have attached if you go to page 190 at paragraph 4 from 4.1, well 
paragraph 4 is entitled consultancy services and 4.1 states there that: 
10 
“the 
consultant 
undertakes 
to 
facilitate 
the 
successful 
conclusion of the asset CL referred to in the Master Services 
Agreement concluded between Neotel and Transnet SOC 
Limited (Transnet)” 
Is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  It then goes on further at 4.2 it says: 
“For the purposes of this agreement a customer means 
Transnet SOC Limited” 
And it says there: 
20 
“(b) that project means the successful conclusion and 
signature of the assets forming part of MSA concluded 
between Neotel and Transnet SOC Limited.” 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And on the following page, page 191 (c) it 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 161 of 165 
 
states there that Neotel representative means Francois van der Merwe, 
is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And if you go further down to paragraph 6 of 
that agreement on page 191 it states there at 6.1: 
“that for satisfactory performance of the consultancy services 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement 
Neotel shall pay to the consultant the fees as follows: 
6.1.1 
For the successful implementation and finalisation of 
an operational agreement relating to the future maintenance, 
10 
insurance, and operating of the assets bought by Transnet ....” 
And there’s a correction from “for” to “from” and it therefore reads: 
“of the assets bought by Transnet from Neotel a full and final 
once off fee of R25million payable 30 days after signature of 
the operational agreement between Neotel and Transnet SOC 
Limited currently anticipated for 18 March 2015 or any other 
later date agreed by the Neotel and Transnet SOC Limited.” 
Is that correct. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  It then further goes on to say at 6.1.2 that 
20 
the fees contemplated in 6.1 above are excluding VAT, is that correct? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And if I may just revert back to the first 
agreement which starts at page 177 under Annexure ...(intervention)  
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair if you – what you’ve just read 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110 
 
Page 162 of 165 
 
is in contradiction of the original  Homix letter which talked about the 
asset cell. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes, now on page 180 of the first agreement 
paragraph 6 which speaks to fees states in 6.1 that for satisfactory 
performance of the consultancy services in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the agreement Neotel shall pay to the consultant a 
fee as follows and it says there 6.1.1 for the successful conclusion and 
signature of the Master Services Agreement, a fee of 2% of the value of 
the contract, and in brackets it says there (currently at R1.8billion). At 
611.2 it says that the fees contemplated in 6.1 above are excluding 
10 
VAT. 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Then at paragraph 7 of that agreement it 
states there payment of fees ...(intervention)  
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair it would be if I refer you to 6.3 
and that clause comes out of the Homix submission back to us. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes, which is the letter that you took the 
Chair through earlier? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Yes, which the Chair, the wording is 
very similar. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes, and at paragraph 7 where it speaks of 
payment of fees 7.1 states: 
”there that the consultant will invoice Neotel for consultancy 
services rendered on completion of the above set out in 
Clause 6.  7.2 states for the avoidance of doubt all amounts 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110

due and payable under this agreement will be paid in respect 
of the Master Service’s agreement after signature of the 
Master Services agreement and after mobilisation fee has been 
received by Neotel from Transnet SOC Limited.” 
And lastly at 7.3 it says that: 
”payment to the consultant of the fee shall constitute the entire 
and sole liability of Neotel for performance under this 
agreement.  The consultant shall not be entitled to any 
additional fee or other compensation for any Neotel business 
facilitated through the services of the consultant unless 
10 
expressly agreed in writing to the contrary.  Neotel shall not be 
liability for any expenses or costs incorrect incidental to the 
performance of this agreement.” 
Do you have any comment on the consultancy services as set out in the 
agreements and the fee arrangements that are also set out in these 
agreements? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  The only comment I would have is 
that the 7.2 paragraph implies that a payment would have been 
received from Transnet first and then subsequently Neotel would make 
a payment.

ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in respect of the other agreement? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  I mean the agreements were – this 
is part of our concern around these agreements, it’s that they are quite 
inconsistent to the fact that – so when you talk to the CEO he talks 
about an asset cell and when you look at the letter you have an asset

cell, when you look at the agreement you talk about an operational 
agreement, the CFO refers to that, so you have various inconsistencies 
in the agreement.  This is also a Neotel agreement whereas – and the 
supplier or the vendor is actually Homix, but it’s not a Homix agreement 
to us.  So there are various elements that do raise questions around 
the agreements and – but this was I think you know the our view you 
initially had the 12 t h of December letter, and then these were put 
together in February to address any risk. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes, and in respect of the commerciality of 
these – of the Homix transactions, is there anything further you wish to 
10 
bring to the Chair’s attention? 
MR CHETA CHHAGAN VAGHELA:  Chair I think as auditors we are 
required to be highly sceptical and the more inconsistencies we get the 
more evidence we require, and therefore when we look at the evidence 
there was back and forth, however the more questions we had we did 
not more evidence and we never – that was never resolved and that’s 
resulted in the commerciality remaining qualified in the nature of 
financial statements. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Chair we have no further 
questions for Mr Vaghela.

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much, you are excused.  Do you know 
anything about tomorrow’s arrangement, how many witnesses are 
scheduled for tomorrow is it one only? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Chair as far as I know it is only one witness 
who is coming tomorrow. 
11 JUNE 2019 – DAY 110
