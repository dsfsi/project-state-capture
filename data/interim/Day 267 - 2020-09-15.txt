Page 4 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you DCJ.  DCJ before I proceed, 
I wish to place on record for the purposes of clarity 
because there has been great interest shown in the 
testimony of Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I wish to explain DCJ that the – this – 
this round of testimony of Ms Daniels will relate mainly to 
the suspension of the executives. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The issues pertaining to transactions 
relating to Tegeta, Trillian and McKinsey have not been 
forgotten.  They will not be touched in this time of her 
testimony but they are deferred to the second round of the 
Eskom hearings which will come in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Daniels just for home keeping 
aspects you will have before two lever arch files.  Let me 
place them on record.  The set of lever arch files that will 
be used Chairperson is Eskom Bundle 08[a] Exhibit U18.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 5 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  You are present?  Yes.  Okay 
thank you.  Oh I think he forgot.  Ja maybe for the sake of 
completeness if there are other Counsel you can just 
indicate or they can just place themselves on record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  You may Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just switch on the microphone.  Yes. 
ADV 
HEFFERMAN: 
Sean 
Hefferman 
from 
Hefferman 
Attorneys appearing on behalf of Suzanne Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not think there is any more Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No there is not.  You see when Mr 
Nguckaitobi was talking, I could not see where he was 
talking from. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is because I think this light puts 
him in a dark… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But I do not think much can be done 
about the light and he does not need to move.  You do not 
need to shift Mr Nguckaitobi it is okay.  It is just that I took 
20 
some time trying to see where the voice was coming from.  
Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If I may proceed that is – ja I was 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 6 of 224 
 
placing on record Eskom Bundle 08[a] Exhibit U18 and 
Eskom Bundle 08[b]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The [b] one is a smaller one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Daniels do you confirm you have the 
two files? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do.  Thank you.  Just quickly Ms 
Daniels if you go to the index in the – in Bundle 08[a] 
10 
which is the bigger of the two files there is an index and in 
the interest of time I wish to – I would like you to confirm 
that you have already made a statement or submitted a 
statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee way 
back in 2017 when it was doing its investigation.  Correct 
that statement is Item 1.3 in the index.  Submission by 
Suzanne Daniels to the Portfolio Committee on Public 
Enterprises. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That statement is on – contained on 
20 
page 58.  Page 58 in this bundle to page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you talking about the red and the 
black ha? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The red – the red Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 7 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The red – the pagination Ms Daniels is 
the red one at the right hand corner – top right hand 
corner.  So that is the numbers I will only be referring you 
to.  To page 83. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that.  And then you also 
testified before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  
They have produced a transcript which you find on page 84 
of this bundle to page 127.  It is dated 8 November 2017. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have provided two affidavits to this 
commission. 
 
You 
have 
the 
main 
affidavit 
and 
a 
supplementary affidavit for purposes of what I have taken 
you through.  I want to refer you to your supplementary 
affidavit which is contained on pages 50 of the same 
bundle to 57.    The 57 you see that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm your signature? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I confirm my signature Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the date of the supplementary 
20 
affidavit being 1 September 2020? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you please go to page 52 – 52 
paragraph 7.2.  There you state in your affidavit  
“I stand by the testimony in Parliament save for the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 8 of 224 
 
correction of the date on meeting with Mr Salim Essa In 
Melrose Arch for the first time on 10 March 2015.” 
The testimony you are referring to is the one contained in 
your – in the transcript that we refer to. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.  The 
commission’s investigators actually when we consulted 
pointed out to me by virtue of phone records that we got 
the date wrong in Parliament. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that – is that the only change you 
wish to make in regard to your testimony in Parliament? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Other than that you stand by what you 
said in Parliament? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Ms Daniels.  So Ms Daniels 
you have agreed to assist the commission insofar as the 
Eskom Board took decisions to suspend the top executives.  
Correct? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chairman 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just before we go into that you can go 
20 
back to the main affidavit which you will find on page 1 of 
your bundle.  I simply want to place on record your career 
progression within Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 9 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want me to admit this affidavit 
because she has confirmed that she – it is her signature 
there on the affidavit is it not and that this is her affidavit 
previously commissioned? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want me to admit that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ms Daniels.  Sorry Chair.  Ms 
Daniels let us do likewise in respect of this affidavit as we 
did in respect of the supplementary.  On page 21 the 
affidavit runs from page 1 to 21.  Page 21 that is the last 
10 
page with the signatures on it.  Do you confirm the 
signature of the deponent that it is your signature? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chairman I confirm that that is my 
signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the date you signed is 17 August 
2020? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this is indeed your affidavit? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes indeed it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then you – thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you request that it be admitted and 
marked as Exhibit what U18?

August 2020 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Should – while we are at it – ja I think

ADV SELEKA SC:  It is U18.2.

Ms 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 11 of 224

ADV SELEKA SC:  1 September 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 1 September 2020 is admitted and 
will be marked as Exhibit U? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U18.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U18.2.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair then it is her written submission 
10 
to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 58. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To 83 to be admitted as Exhibit U18.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – Ms Suzanne Daniels’ statement 
appearing at 50 – at page 58 will be admitted as an exhibit 
and will be marked as Exhibit U18.3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then we have also referred to her 
transcript at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  That 
20 
starts on page 84. 
CHAIRPERSON:  84. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  84 and we ask that it be admitted as 
Exhibit U18.4 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transcript of the evidence of Ms 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 12 of 224 
 
Suzanne 
Daniels 
before 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
in 
Parliament will be admitted and marked Exhibit U18.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The others will be admitted as we go 
along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Admitted with – as we go along. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Daniels page 1 of your affidavit 
10 
deals with your personal details.  Paragraph 3 with your 
qualifications which included Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of 
Laws and Post Graduate in – Port Graduate Diploma in Law 
you see that at that the end of that page? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to – I [00:16:03] that you 
will not lead her evidence in regard to everything? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she has given evidence under 
oath in Parliament. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have got the transcript in front of us. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 13 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is – we have got her statement in 
Parliament, we have got two statements from her but that 
you will focus on certain issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is – that I was going to touch 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But now that the Chairperson has 
reminded me Ms Daniels and for the sake of the viewers as 
10 
well 
since 
– 
because 
of 
taking 
you 
through 
your 
submissions at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, 
referred to your transcript the purpose for that was to have 
that placed on record before us so that we do not have to 
traverse your evidence as it is already given.  So we will in 
this – in this hearing be focussing on the issues that we 
need clarity on for the purposes of this commission so we 
may not touch on everything but for context you are at 
liberty if you want to tell the Chairperson so that he 
understands the context to elaborate on certain things. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thanks.  You understand that ja.  Thank 
you Chairperson.  The – the information will in any event 
be 
made 
available 
on 
the 
Commission’s 
website 
so 
whoever needs to have access to it Chairperson will find it 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 14 of 224 
 
there.  So quickly Ms Daniels looking at your job projection 
within Eskom you say you were employed at Eskom for the 
first time 1 May 2006.  You joined Eskom as Chief Legal 
Advisor in Generation Primary Energy.  You will just 
indicate. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct.  April 2007 you were 
appointed into the position acting Contracts Manager 
Primary Energy Fuel Procurement. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  April 2008 you became a senior 
manager of Contracts in Coal Water and Gas? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct [00:18:36]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that a division Coal Water and Gas? 
MS DANIELS:  It was still in the Primary Energy division 
Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You remained in that position until 
January 2010? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct.  Eskom underwent a re-
structuring at that time and I moved across to Group 
20 
Commercial. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You then became a Managing Director 
in Primary Energy Division. 
MS DANIELS:  That is incorrect Mr Chair.  It is not a 
Managing Director.  I was the senior manager in the office 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 15 of 224 
 
of the Group Executive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Senior Manager.  I see.  Just correct it 
again.  You say you were the senior manager? 
MS DANIELS:  In the office of the Group Executive for 
Group Technology and Commercial. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that is February 2010? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes but… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who did – say it sorry. 
MS DANIELS:  It could have been from 2010 onwards. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Who did you account to? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the statement says in 2011 senior 
manager office of the Group Executive in 2011. 
MS DANIELS:  Oh my apologies.  It – Primary Energy I 
then moved to Group Commercial.  My first boss was Dan 
Marokane.  We moved together from Primary Energy to 
Group Commercial. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then 11 April 2015 you became a 
senior manager in the office of the Chairperson of the 
Board? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was that a formal appointment? 
MS DANIELS:  At the time it was not a formal appointment 
Mr Chairman I – I do go into it a bit later but I – you wish 
me to answer it now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 16 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  I just want to find the –  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you want the paragraph dealing with 
this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The relevant page. 
MS DANIELS:  It is paragraph 47 of my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  The main affidavit and it is on page 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can just – you can just say what 
it says without looking at it if you do not read it. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay.  So on the 9 April the acting 
10 
Chairman of the Board Mr – Dr Ben Ngubane called myself 
and Leo Dlamini who was the manager in the office of the 
Chairman to his office and actually just told us that I would 
be taking over so that is how it happened.  So on the 11 
April I then worked with Leo to transfer information – 
transfer duties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So who is Leo? 
MS DANIELS:  Leo Dlamini was the senior General 
Manager in the office of the Chairman at the time.  Mr 
Tsotsi in his evidence did refer to him as the manager 
20 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  When Mr – Dr Ben Ngubane asked 
you to become a senior manager in his office what was 
your position? 
MS DANIELS:  I was the senior manager in the office of 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 17 of 224 
 
the Group Executive, Group Commercial. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And who was that? 
MS DANIELS:  That – at the time it was Matshela Koko but 
he was acting and he had been suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And according to your affidavit you 
become the Company Secretary from 1 October 2015? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So then you hold a dual position?  
Senior Manager in the office of the chairperson and the 
position of Company Secretary? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  I actually did not.  The responsibilities for 
the Chairman’s office in terms of correspondence was dealt 
with by the office of Chief Executive.  I then just deal with 
the other matters pertaining to the office of the Chairman.  
Sorry Mr Chairman.  I handled the liaison with the Ministry 
– the Department of Public Enterprises more particularly 
the Minister ’s office and then attended to the Board duties 
of the Chairman – the administrative issues that he needed 
to deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you held the position of Company 
20 
Secretary from 1 October 2015 to 27 July 2017. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When – when was your dismissal? 
MS DANIELS:  20 July 2018 Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  20 July. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 18 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2018.  You were also the acting Head of 
Legal and according to the affidavit that was from the 1 
September 2016? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And for how long did you hold that 
position – acting position? 
MS DANIELS:  I think it was until the 27 July 2017 Mr 
Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  If – well your – if your dismissal 
10 
came a year later what happened – what was your position 
in the intervening period from 27 July 2017 to 20 July 
2018? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman here I am going to have to 
give you some context.  I was the – I was then the Head of 
Legal and Compliance.  I – the 27 July 2017 was quite 
significant because it was the first Board meeting of I think 
the Xhosa Board meeting – the Xhosa Board in Eskom.  
And it is at this meeting that I was told – well prior to that 
– weeks prior while I was on leave it was announced that a 
20 
Board breakaway that I needed to choose between being 
Company Secretary and Head of Legal.  I was overseas at 
the time.  So when I came back this was the first Board 
meeting that was held and the issue was raised again by 
the Board and I was then told to choose.  And I chose to 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 19 of 224 
 
become the Head of Legal and Compliance.  And that is 
why the 27 July is – it is an odd date but it was – and what 
was more dramatic that it was actually with immediate 
effect.  Even though it – it had an impact on the 
governance you know arrangements in Eskom it was 
immediate effect that I was relieved of my Company 
Secretarial duties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay so from then on you – you 
became the Head of Legal? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were no longer acting you were 
now permanent Head of Legal. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct.  I was permanent. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Okay. 
 
Before 
I 
go 
into 
the 
suspensions.  In – there are emails that we have looked at 
exchanged between yourself, Dr Ngubane and what has 
been referred to as the Businessman.  These emails came 
up during your disciplinary hearing Businessman infoportal.  
You say at the disciplinary hearing the ruling I read that 
you were told by Dr Ngubane in April 2015 that the email 
20 
belongs to Mr Richard Seleke.  Do you recall that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I do recall that but I do need to correct 
it Mr Chairman.  The chronology is incorrect.  It was 
actually – it was April 2016 not 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he told you that? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 20 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  Ja because the emails in question at the 
disciplinary hearing are in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  The – okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So you saying he told 
you in April 2016? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chair I am not certain of when he told 
me but I do know that he told me that it was the DG’s 
email. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you – do you recall when it was 
that 
you 
started 
sending 
or 
receiving 
emails 
to 
Businessman or infoportal email address? 
MS DANIELS:  The first email that I have in my records 
was when I replied to all.  Subsequent emails have come 
out here in the commission that I have watched and it 
seems that it started in 2015 – late 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is the – that is the one that you 
regard as the first? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that Dr Ngubane forwarded it to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now prior to Dr Ngubane forwarding 
that email to you had you not had any – have you not sent 
any emails to Businessman or infoportal that address – 
that email address? 
MS DANIELS:  Not that I have in my records. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 21 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And had you received any – have you not 
received any emails from that email address? 
MS DANIELS:  It does appear that there were some that 
were forwarded to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But had you become aware of them 
before Dr Ngubane forwarded that one to you? 
MS DANIELS:  I think Mr Chairman you know the – I 
cannot say that they were not in my Inbox you know what I 
10 
mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS DANIELS:  I say I cannot say that they were not in my 
Inbox. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but… 
MS DANIELS:  But I did not take – I took them at face 
value at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were – had them. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when would that have been as 
20 
you recall?  Obviously, I am not looking for an exact date but 
I want to have an idea of when it was, month and year or 
roundabout which month. 
MS DANIELS:   First from the evidence that has come out 
and that what I have been made aware of, it was late 2015. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 22 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Late 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think from the... on the day that Dr 
Ngubane was giving evidence, I think reference was made 
to, if I am not mistaken, some emails that may have 
happened, somewhere mid-year 2015 around July/June if I 
am not mistaken.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was 28 September 2015, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is one for September but my 
recollection is that before the September one, there was one 
10 
or more earlier than September 2015.  Does anything earlier 
than December sound like something you know nothing 
about? 
MS DANIELS:   I have not seen them Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So I would not be able to, you know, 
categorically say. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
So 
you 
... 
but 
whatever 
communications you had with this Businessman Info Portal 
that you sent to whoever was on the other end, is the 
20 
position, that some of the emails that you sent to this email 
address, you sent on your own but others you sent because 
Dr Ngubane asked you to send them?   
 
Or is the position that all the emails that you sent were 
sent because you made the decision to send them, you were 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 23 of 224 
 
not asked by anybody to send them? 
MS DANIELS:   They were usually part of a conversation 
regarding some subject matter that we were dealing with.  
The one was about a media statement.  I think both were 
about media statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, maybe it will be better that Mr 
Seleka goes to the... to each one of those emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we can... you can also have a look at 
them and have ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 Yes. 
 
Ms 
Daniels, 
the 
emails 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to refresh your memory. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am saying so that she can refresh 
her memory as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair thank you.  Ms Daniels, the 
emails are in the second file, Eskom Bundle 08(b), page 944. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 944? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   944. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   944? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   944, Chair.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 944.   
MS DANIELS:   Here I am. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 24 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the bottom of the page, it is an email 
from Businessman dated 28 September 2015 at 04:41 p.m. to 
Baldwin, Dr Ngubane, subject:  Forward for chairpersons.  
They serve documents as discussed.  That is at 04:41 p.m.  
Immediately above that, it is an email from Baldwin, Dr 
Ngubane.   
 
The email address is baldwindrngubane@gmail.com.  It 
is sent on Monday, 28 September 2015 at 05:23 p.m. to Ms 
10 
Suzanne Daniels.  Forwarding for chairpersons.  The email 
immediately above that, it is from yourself, Suzanne Daniels, 
danielsm@eskom.co.za.   
 
It is on Monday, 28 September 2015  at 17:47.  It is to 
baldwindrngubane@gmail.com.  The subject is RE.  So that 
is a reply:  For Chairpersons, the attachment 28/09/2015, 
BOD, Round Robin Resolution.  What does BOD stand for?  
Board of Directors? 
MS DANIELS:   Board of Directors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now the document, Ms Daniels, and I 
20 
will ask questions on this, on the emails.  The document that 
Dr Ngubane said would have been attached to this emails is 
on page 948.  It is contained on pages 948 and 949 dated, 
28 September 2015. 
 
Reference number: Round Robin.  Has the numbers 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 25 of 224 
 
referred to there, 28 September 2015.  The Board.   
“Attention 
dear 
members. 
 
Urgent 
request 
to 
approve 
the 
suspension 
of 
contact 
and/or 
commercial relationship with Mail & Guardian, City 
Press and Sunday Times on a Round Robin...” 
 
Now Dr Ngubane said he recalls this document having 
been sent to several SOE’s.  He mentioned Transnet, Eskom.  
The document on the face of it, on page 949, also shows that 
it would have been sent to Denel.  Do you recall this 
document? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So do the emails jolt your memory in 
regarding to this exchange of... the exchange preceding the 
emails relative to this document? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it does Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
is 
your 
recollection 
that 
in 
September 2015, that was the first time you became aware 
of this email address of Businessman of Info Portal or were 
you already aware of it? 
MS DANIELS:   I think it was... this would have been 
20 
roundabout the first time that I have seen it in direct 
correspondence like this.  I really cannot pinpoint.  2015 was 
such a ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember whether it was the 
first time you became aware of this email address? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 26 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In September 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   2015.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But it would seem here that on the 
28 September 2015, 
Dr 
Ngubane 
forwarded 
to 
you 
documents 
that 
had 
come 
from 
that 
email 
address, 
Businessman. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is right.  And you do recall this 
occasion? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, he would have phoned me and said, I 
have sent you an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Do you recall what you did with 
them after receiving them? 
MS DANIELS:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or what he wanted you to do with them? 
MS DANIELS:   I would have prepared the document that you 
see on page 945. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have...? 
MS DANIELS:   I would have prepared the document that you 
20 
see on 945. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the document in... at... appearing at 
page 945 was prepared by you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that goes up to... is...  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 27 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   946. 
CHAIRPERSON:   946.  Is that where it ends? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, we may want 
to read on record the contents of the two documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I think that is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, if you go back to page 948, 
10 
back to the, what I believe is a draft.  Is that correct?  Page 
948. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I believe it is a draft.  And this person is 
writing to not only Eskom but the other SOE’s to adopt this 
as a draft of the board. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now the document reads: 
“Urgent request to approve the suspension 
of 
contact and/or commercial relationship with Mail & 
20 
Guardian, City Press and Sunday Times on a Round 
Robin introduction on the 28 September 2015. 
The chairperson received the letter from the Minister 
of Public Enterprises, enclosing the letter from the 
chairperson of Transnet and the resolution of the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 28 of 224 
 
Transnet Board.” 
 
So if you look at – and we want to compare paragraph by 
paragraph – if you go back to page 945, Ms Daniels, you 
have that heading, the urgent request to approve, which I 
have already read and introduction and then the first 
paragraph.  It says: 
“On 
the 
28 September 2015, 
the 
chairperson 
received the letter from the Minister of Public 
Enterprises, 
enclosing 
the 
letter 
from 
the 
chairperson of Transnet and resolution from the 
10 
Transnet Board.  These attached as annexures 
hereto.” 
 
So I could do that or you can say to the chairperson, the 
documents are essentially the same chairperson and I simply 
copied and paste for the purpose of the resolution for the 
board of Transnet.  I mean, the board of Eskom.  Or should I 
go through it? 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is correct Mr Chair.  That is indeed 
what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So let us just make sure we have a 
20 
complete understanding of the documents that were attached 
to Businessman’s email to Dr Ngubane.  One, you say it is 
the document appearing at page 948.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a draft letter which is meant to be 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 29 of 224 
 
addressed to “the board”.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, when... that was the one 
document.  Is there another document that was attached to 
Businessman’s email that he directed to Dr Ngubane or as 
this the only document that was attached? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, I cannot remember if this was 
attached to the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   But when I prepared the document, there 
10 
were the letters from... there was a letter from the chairman 
of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Which indicated... it was addressed to the 
Minister of Public Enterprises, Ms Lynne Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And it indicated that Transnet was going to 
withdraw its media stand and its media participation with all 
of the publications mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With City Press, Mail & Guardian and 
20 
Sunday Times? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What other document was attached? 
MS DANIELS:   It was a letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A letter from the chairperson of the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 30 of 224 
 
Transnet Board. 
MS DANIELS:   The board.  I think it was Ms Linda Mabaso. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
addressed 
to 
the 
minister 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   To the Minister of Public Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Public Enterprises.  Yes, what else was 
attached? 
MS DANIELS:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So this document... this draft at page 948, 
was it also part of... was it also attached? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   On the... and I say a resolution of the 
Transnet Board.  So there would have been... there ought to 
have been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   A resolution of the Transnet Board. 
MS DANIELS:   ...a formal resolution, a formal document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Those 
were 
the 
two 
attachments 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Those were the two attachments? 
MS DANIELS:   ...that I would have attached to this one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka, do we have them here 
in the bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We do not have those two ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We do not have those two? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 31 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Would you be able to 
facilitate getting them or you would not have access to 
anything? 
MS DANIELS:   I will definitely check my records, Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   But I am not sure if I still have them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether you can find them, ja.  So 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   But ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this draft letter at page 948 which was 
meant for the company secretary to be addressed to the 
board and I think it was meant to be addressed to the boards 
of different SOE’s, how did it come... did it come to your 
attention at the time, around 28 September 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   I would go on these documents, Mr Chair.  
And I would say yes it did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   What I do recall that this was not actually a 
Round Robin ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   This did not become a Round Robin 
decision.  This actually became a meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but who drafted this document? 
MS DANIELS:   This one ...[intervenes]  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 32 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   This letter? 
MS DANIELS:   The... which letter?  I just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The one at page 948. 
MS DANIELS:   That one I am not clear about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   That I am not clear about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not clear who drafted it? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure who drafted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you were not company secretary at 
that time? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   No, I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But you say you became aware of it 
roundabout end of September? 
MS DANIELS:   It would have been the end of September 
because it was addressed... it was sent to from Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  But you cannot remember how 
it may have come to you? 
MS DANIELS:   No, from here, it was forwarded to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Dr Ngubane? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  You recall what Dr Ngubane 
said you must do with it? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, he asked me to prepare the document 
which you see on 945. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He asked you to prepare the document at 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 33 of 224 
 
page 945? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And attach the document at page 948 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Those... 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to assist you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did he speak about the document 
at page 948 in particular? 
MS DANIELS:   Not that I recall, Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Not in so many words.  He just asked me to 
use that as the basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, to use that as a basis to prepare 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   This document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the document at page 945? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is what you did? 
MS DANIELS:   That is what I did. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And as a result, the document you 
prepared at 945 to 946 is... except for one or two 
differences, are basically identical to the one that he sent to 
you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it is just that we... this... I subsequently 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 34 of 224 
 
found out, if you look at page 950 is the way that Transnet 
did its resolutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And ours was slightly different.  So that is 
why it is in 945, it is done in that particular format.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But the substance is the same? 
MS DANIELS:   The substance is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Actually, most of it seems to be 
identical. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  And what is the document at 
page 945?  Who was it addressed to and for what purpose? 
MS DANIELS:   This was addressed to the board to make the 
resolution ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS DANIELS:   ...that you see at the bottom of page 945 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...which says:  Eskom shall suspend any 
dealings. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would it be correct that you prepared 
the document at page 945 in order to give effect or 
implement what is written in the document that Dr Ngubane... 
that you say Dr Ngubane sent to you which is at page 948? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 35 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, you were 
saying 
to... 
explaining 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
that 
what 
ultimately transpired is that the resolution was adopted by 
not... but not by way of Round Robin but in an actual 
meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair.  There was 
actually a special meeting called to deal with the media... 
and I am trying to think of the correct word.  I think it was 
described as a media onslaught at the time.  And that these 
10 
specific publications, who were identified by the board, as 
not favourable to Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, I think Mr Seleka, earlier on 
you wanted to either read ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or ask the witness to read the document 
at page 948.  I think that is a good idea. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that a good idea? 
CHAIRPERSON:   There might not be a need to read the one 
at 945. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she had said that that was meant 
to implement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or give effect to the document at page 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 36 of 224 
 
948 that she had received from Dr Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think let us have that one read into 
the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that the... whoever is listening or 
viewing, can understand the context of the two... or the 
contents of the two documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Daniels, let us go back 
to page 948.  I have read the paragraph immediately under 
10 
introduction.  So I will move onto the second paragraph.  It 
starts: 
“City Press, Mail Guardian and Sunday Times in the 
recent past.” 
 
Let us see whether they repeated that mistake.  Did you 
repeat the mistake here?  It does not have Mail & Guardian.  
It is Mail Guardian.  Do you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   “City Press, Mail Guardian and Sunday 
Times in the recent past.” 
20 
“They have published stories in their respective 
papers, 
making 
unsubstantiated 
allegations 
of 
fraudulent 
conducts 
in 
our 
administration 
and 
corruption against officials of the sister’s state-
owned companies.” 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 37 of 224 
 
 
The sister’s state-owned companies.  They... what is 
that, Ms Daniels? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of what that 
was? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair... do I go into detail now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tell the Chairperson. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, there was actually a 
conversation between the minister and the chairperson about 
10 
the media treatment of... when she... when they talk about 
sister companies, they are talking about Eskom, Transnet, 
Denel.  I think those were the main ones at the time that we 
were being bombarded in the newspaper and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is written as sister apostrophe s 
state-owned. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it is supposed to be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  It does not say sister 
companies or sister state-owned companies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says sisters. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was actually the state-owned 
companies that were within the portfolio of the Department of 
Public Enterprises.  And that is what it was meant to say, 
sister state-owned company. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 38 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Shall I carry on, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“They have selected to not report on the verifiable 
responses provided by the relevant SOC’s.  SOC’s 
irresponsible... and irresponsible published gossip 
and sensationalism without any regard for fact. 
The 
above 
form 
of 
reporting 
by 
the 
three 
newspapers is misled...” 
 
Now I want to check if that mistake is also there.  Is 
10 
misled to the members. 
MS DANIELS:   It is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it exactly there? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
“The 
above 
form 
of 
reporting 
by 
the 
three 
newspapers is misled to members of public.” 
 
That 
is 
on 
page 
945. 
 
That 
is 
the 
resolution 
subsequently adopted.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand that you had to 
20 
reproduce it like that, exactly as it is? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, I do not actually have a 
recollection of, you know, the copying and the pasting and 
things.  I recognise the Transnet documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 39 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   I recall the letters from the minister... my 
apology.  I recall the letters from Ms Mabaso.  I recall the 
conversations that the chairman had with the Minister of 
Public Enterprises.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what is that you cannot recall? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure if I would have corrected this 
letter.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but I thought you said earlier on, you 
prepared the document at page 945? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, this was... I am not sure what version 
10 
this is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS DANIELS:   So this would have been a copy and paste. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay so I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you may have had different versions. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
whatever 
version 
this 
one 
is 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   This is the ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...quite clearly, it is taken from the 
document at page 948. 
MS DANIELS:   That I... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, so I am not... there may have been 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 40 of 224 
 
corrections to the grammar and those things but the base 
document would have come from document 948. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
I 
think 
what 
Mr 
Seleka 
was 
highlighting is that you appeared to have just taken it as it is 
in the true sense including how they formulated what they 
must have intended was misled the public.  Continue, Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
“The 
above 
form 
of 
reporting 
by 
the 
three 
newspapers is misled to members of the public and 
10 
is intended to influence public deception.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, unless it was... unless they meant to 
say has misled.  Or would that make sense Mr Seleka or not 
really?  No, then the two after misled would not... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair I do not... what the 
Businessman wrote, I would not want to correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will read it as it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
“...and is intended to influence public deception that 
state-owned companies are corrupt and guilty of 
stealing public funds.   
If this negative trend by the three newspapers is not 
challenged, it will cause irreparable damage to the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 41 of 224 
 
roles of the state-owned companies in assisting 
government in job creation and economic growth. 
It 
is 
therefore 
important 
that 
the 
state 
own 
companies...” 
 
Now you will see it is missing the “ed” there.   
“...the state own companies should collectively 
suspend 
any 
dealings 
with 
the 
above 
three 
newspapers until such time they provide verifiable 
proof supporting their allegations referred to above.” 
 
Then the proposed resolution follows: 
10 
“Resolve that: 
1. Denel/Eskom hereby suspend any dealings. 
2. Placing advertising or any other commercial 
relationship with Mail & Guardian, Sunday Times 
and City Press pending the resolutions of the 
complaints that the state-owned entities have 
against the three newspapers until such time they 
provide verifiable proof supporting the allegations 
referred to above.  Yours faithfully.” 
 
Ms Daniels did you... do you recall... I mean, the 
20 
Chairperson was asking whether changes... or I think you 
were explaining to him whether changes would have been 
made to this draft which was literally taken from this draft 
and put on the Eskom document for the purposes of the 
board resolution.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 42 of 224 
 
 
Do you recall whether you went through the document, 
read through the document prior to you placing on Eskom 
document for purposes of the board? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure, Mr Seleke(sic).  I remember 
this document ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Seleka. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Seleke is coming... 
MS DANIELS:   My... [laughing] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   My apology, Advocate Seleka.  I do... I 
remember these documents, the Transnet documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The reasons I am asking that question is 
because when you go back to that page which is on the 
board’s resolution the portion of the resolution does not 
have Denel, so Denel is deleted, you do have only: 
“Eskom shall suspend any dealings.” 
So somebody would have read, to notice that hey, I need to 
delete reference to Denel.  Any recollection that you would 
20 
have done that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from that, also the document at 
page 948, particularly 949 reads: 
“Denel/Eskom hereby suspend” 
Whereas the one at 945 says: 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 43 of 224 
 
“Eskom shall suspend any dealings” 
So one gets the impression that either you or somebody on 
your behalf did look and decided what to leave out and 
what to include.  Is that fair comment? 
MS DANIELS:   That is fair comment, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember whether it was you? 
MS DANIELS:   I really cannot recall, I would have to look 
at what was attached to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would you have prepared the 
document at 945 without reading the document at 948?  I 
10 
am saying prepared, maybe it is not prepared, it is just 
electronically – just put it on to create exactly the same 
document and change here and there.  Would you have 
done that without reading it and applying your mind to it? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I am a stickler for grammar. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   I said I am a stickler for grammar so I 
would have corrected these mistakes, so that is why I am 
not sure if there were other versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but Dr Ngubane, as I understand it, 
20 
sent the document at page 948 to you, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he must have either given you 
instructions about what to do with it or there was an 
understanding between the two of you as to what you 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 44 of 224 
 
should do with it, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, he asked me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was that instruction or what was 
that understanding.   
MS DANIELS:   He asked me to use these documents to 
prepare …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The document [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MS DANIELS:   The document for the board, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that is what you did. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   And that is what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question is, would you have done 
that without reading the document at page 948? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I would have read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have read it? 
MS DANIELS:   I would have read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you remember whether you 
made the changes that Mr Seleka and I have referred to on 
the part relating to resolution? 
MS DANIELS:   That I cannot recall but …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot recall. 
MS DANIELS:   But if I had prepared the document then it 
is possible that I would. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   You know, I would not say that I did not, I 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 45 of 224 
 
could not say that categorically right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now you said that you remember 
that the email that Dr Ngubane forwarded to you on the 28 
September came with a letter from the Chairperson of the 
Transnet board to Minister Brown as well as – you say 
resolution? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, there was a Transnet resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A resolution but you say you do not know 
whether it also came – that is the email from Dr Ngubane 
to you, you do not remember whether it came with the 
10 
document at page 948? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not recall if it was attached to this 
particular email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   It may have been a subsequent email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are saying the end you got 
it from Dr Ngubane. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would you know whether it is a 
document that he drafted, Dr Ngubane, the document at 
20 
page 948? 
MS DANIELS:   This would not be something that he would 
have drafted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not the kind of document that he 
would drafted? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 46 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He gave evidence before me to the 
effect that he normally did not prepare his speech, his own 
speeches.  I do not know what else he said he did not 
prepare, he would have those prepared for him.  Is that to 
your knowledge the correct thing that he did not prepare 
his speeches as well? 
MS DANIELS:   He did not prepare his speeches from 
scratch, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I think media statements was the 
10 
other one, ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  There was a process within Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Certainly during the time that I was in his 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   What would occur would be that the 
executive responsible for that particular area would draft 
the content …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Media statement or speech. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   And it would be sent to the media 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 47 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   We had a dedicated communications 
department.  They would sort of make it media friendly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   It would then come to me, I would look at it 
and check if it made sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Just from a – from someone who knew 
nothing about it, that as the test.  And those questions or 
issues 
would 
then 
– 
I 
would 
raise 
them 
with 
the 
communications 
department 
and 
with 
the 
executive 
10 
responsible and say look, this is too technical or, you 
know, really do you expect the Chairman to talk about this?  
These are the kinds of questions that would come from 
that.  If it was something that, you know, was not 
immediately able to be clarified, I would request them to 
brief Dr Ngubane in any event.  He also read through his 
speeches and made his own …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Changes. 
MS DANIELS:   Changes and amendments.  Once the 
speech was finalised, you know, he would get a copy of 
20 
this is the proposed speech, the media - communications 
department would then prepare possible questions with 
answers.  So there would be active participations from his 
side because he would be the one presenting it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you say he would not have 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 48 of 224 
 
prepared this document himself, this draft at page 948. 
MS DANIELS:   No, this would not have been prepared by 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, why do you say that?  What is the 
basis for saying that? 
MS DANIELS:   From my understanding, Mr Chair, and my 
recollection, this was the Transnet template, this was the 
Transnet template. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it have been prepared by 
somebody within Transnet or the …[intervenes] 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Or they may have used the Transnet 
template. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, it is just that I 
cannot remember, I thought I was under the impression 
that Dr Ngubane accepted that this document came with 
emails from a businessman but I cannot be sure, I do not 
know what your recollection is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, he did, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he did accept that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.0758 
ADV SELEKA SC:    He recalled that the document was 
sent to various SCOs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that was the one to Eskom. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 49 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, the meeting you say took 
place in respect of this document on page 945, can you 
recall the date of that meeting? 
MS DANIELS:    I really cannot recall, it would have been 
around this time, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it your understanding of the document 
10 
at page 948 that whoever drafted it was saying that the 
board of Eskom must take a certain stand against the three 
newspapers mentioned in that document, namely City 
Press, The Mail & Guardian – Mail Garden – the Mail & 
Garden …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sunday Times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Sunday Times. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that your understanding as well, that 
that person was saying the board of Eskom must take a 
20 
certain stand and actually the boards of other SOEs must 
do t6he same against the newspaper. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Yes, 
Mr 
Chairman, 
that 
was 
my 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that this was to be in response 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 50 of 224 
 
to certain articles that were said to have been published in 
those newspapers about SOEs. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chair, that was my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And that was what actually happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Do you think you 
would have the minutes of that meeting, not now but you 
could check for that? 
MS DANIELS:    I will definitely check. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also just going back – I am sorry, Mr 
Seleka, going back to my question.  So you have a 
situation where somebody – and if Dr Ngubane’s evidence 
is correct and probably – well, it certainly seems to be, if 
somebody using the businessman email address had 
drafted this letter, this document at page 948, that person 
wanted the Eskom board to take a certain position against 
those newspapers.  Dr Ngubane gave you the document at 
page 948 and asked you to prepare the document at 945 
20 
which would ask the board of Eskom to adopt exactly the 
position that whoever had drafted the letter at page 948 
wanted to be adopted by the Eskom board. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 51 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   I accept that, that is exactly what 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And on your understanding the 
person who drafted this, would that person have been 
within Eskom or outside of Eskom or is that something you 
do not know? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, from the evidence and from 
my experience within Eskom this is someone external to 
Eskom at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is somebody who was external to 
10 
Eskom at the time. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels did you know who is that 
person? 
MS DANIELS:    I did not know who that person was at the 
time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in September 2015 you did not 
know who was that person. 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chair, I did not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was it strange to you that the 
Chairperson of the board, I think he had been confirmed as 
Chairperson at the time, Dr Ngubane, in September 2015, 
was it strange to you that the Chairperson was asking you 
to prepare resolution that would be adopted the board on 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 52 of 224 
 
the basis of a document that came from outside Eskom or 
was that not strange, that was something normal? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the time I did not 
interrogate it as I would later …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   I did not interrogate it as I would later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   At that point in time I took it at face value. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is there a reason why you took it at 
10 
face value? 
MS DANIELS:    I – at that time I was still the senior 
manager and I honestly had no reason to believe that there 
was anything sinister in the activities of the Chairman and 
in his conduct.  You know, I - you know, when you start a 
job you always believe that people are good and I did not 
have any reason at that stage to even suspect anything. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, we have seen …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see we are at quarter past, Mr 
Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Opportune time, Chair, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us take the tea adjournment.  Am 
I wrong to think that there were other emails that you 
referred Dr Ngubane to from businessmen that happened  
before September in 2015? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 53 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is actually June 2016, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is it June 2016? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is actually June 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  So on what we have, 
September 2015 appears to be the earliest we have 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The earliest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From what we have been able to 
obtain. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  We will take the tea 
adjournment, we will resume at twenty five to twelve. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair are you done with your 
questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think so. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Daniels I had asked the 
question whether you knew who Businessman was at the 
time of exchange of these emails? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not Mr Chairman. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Did 
you 
come 
to 
know 
who 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 54 of 224 
 
Businessman was? 
MS DANIELS:   In my disciplinary hearing, Mr Chairman, 
my attorneys did an extensive search and with the help of 
the organisation called OUTA it established that it was a 
DG Seleke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was?  
MS DANIELS:   Director General’s Richard Seleke.  Based 
on my further reading that I have done and assessment of 
the evidence that has come out in the Gupta leaks 
etcetera, it’s my suspicion that it wasn’t just one person, it 
10 
was indeed an info portal but I do suspect that one of the 
administrators of that email box was Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say your attorneys, during your 
disciplinary action did some research and according to 
their research they told you that it was Mr Richard Seleke 
behind the name Businessman? 
MS DANIELS:   They didn’t just tell me, Mr Chairman, we 
received IP addresses and I think it was technical data 
from ALTA.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You will obviously recall that the 
20 
Chairperson finds otherwise in his ruling, he finds that the 
email – info portal, most probably belonged to Mr Essa. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, it was most probably, they 
also did not produce any evidence that it was, indeed, Mr 
Essa’s.  What Eskom relied on in my disciplinary hearing 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 55 of 224 
 
was the emails from the discredited Matshela Koko so 
there was no direct evidence that it was and he found that 
it may have possibly have been Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let me know from you, did you 
know who is the person behind the name Businessman, 
using the email address, info portal 1? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say you were told by Dr Ngubane 
that the email address or Businessman email address info 
portal belongs to Mr Richard Seleke. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That would have been long before your 
disciplinary action at Eskom. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now these emails, if you followed the 
hearing of – the testimony of Dr Ngubane here, before the 
Commission, were exchanged with Dr Ngubane, September 
2018 before Mr Richard Seleke was appointed at DPE.  His 
date of appointment was effective 27 November 2015, did 
you know that? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, Dr Ngubane himself has said, to 
the Commission that, in fact, he understood from you that 
the email is of Richard Seleke and not – he understood 
from you and not the other way around, you told him, not 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 56 of 224 
 
him telling you that, that is the email of Mr Richard Seleke.  
Would you explain your comment to the Chairperson on 
that? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, it’s clear from the emails 
that Dr Ngubane introduced the info portal email into the 
system…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is assuming that the email at the 
bottom of page 944 from Businessman to Dr Ngubane, was 
the first one? 
MS DANIELS:   Assuming, but in my experience, what was 
10 
introduced to me…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And also, assuming that you had not 
received any email from Businessman prior to that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are able to say you had not received 
any emails or sent any emails – you had not received any 
mails from and had not sent emails to Businessman before 
that email at the bottom of page 944 that came from 
Businessman and was directed to Dr Ngubane?   
MS DANIELS:   Not that I could find on my system. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, you see and what we 
– this Commission has been able to obtain through the 
Fundudzi report is that on 21 s t June 2015, Mr Richard 
Seleke, 
using 
 
an 
email 
address, 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 57 of 224 
 
blueberries.slk@gmail.com, he sent his CV – this is prior 
to him being appointed at the DPE, he sends his CV 
through info portal 1 on Sunday 21 June 2015, and he 
says, 
“Evening sir, please find attached my CV and 
supporting documents, regards Richard”, 
 
That you find on page 1042 of Eskom Bundle 08B, 
1042 at the bottom of the page, Ms Daniels, you see the 
email, blueberries.slk@gmail.com, it’s from that email 
address 
to 
email 
address 
infoportal1@soho.com, 
the 
10 
subject is Richard CV, the email is sent at 22h32, that’s 
twenty eight minutes before eleven at night, you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the email immediately above that, 
it’s a forwarding email.  The forwarding email from 
Businessman, 
in 
inverted 
commas 
the 
email 
is 
infoportal1@soho.com, date is 21 June 2015 at 8h34pm, 
subject 
forward, 
Richard 
CV 
and 
it’s 
sent 
through 
anckimcwc@gmail.com and that email address, if you look 
at the email above, seems to belong to Ms Kimberley 
20 
Davids and Businessman writes, 
“Hi madam, as per sir, this is the candidate for DG, 
 it possible for him to meet madam on Tuesday, 
regards”. 
 
So, Businessman forwards Mr Richard Seleke’s CV 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 58 of 224 
 
to, on the face of it, appears to be Kimberly Davids and he 
says this is a candidate for DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think Kimberley Davids is, 
understood to have been someone working in the office of 
the Minister of Public Enterprises, Minister Brown, I don’t 
know whether as a PA or as something else but it is 
understood to be somebody who was working in Minister 
Brown’s office. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, she was the Executive 
Assistant. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm? 
MS DANIELS:   She was the Executive Assistant to 
Minister Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was the Executive Assistant, okay 
and you knew – at the time that you were working at Eskom 
in 2015/2016 did you know her to use this email address of 
anckimcwc@gmail.com?  
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but you knew that Kimberley Davids 
was Minister Brown’s Executive Assistant? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did because I had to liaise with her 
on issues relating to meetings etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so it appears that Mr Richard 
Seleke sent to infoportal1@soho.com on 21 June 2015, his 
CV to that email address and that on the same day in the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 59 of 224 
 
evening, Businessman or somebody from that address – 
email address then forwarded – sent an email to Ms 
Kimberley Davids in the office of Minister Brown, saying, 
enclosing the CV of Mr Richard Seleke and saying, this is 
the candidate for DG and DG would be Director General 
and asking whether it would be possible for madam to meet 
Mr Seleke on Tuesday.  I take it madam refers to Minister 
Brown, Mr Seleka, I think you had put a question to the 
witness but I just, summarised what appears at page 1042. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Than you Chairperson.  Ms Daniels the 
10 
position of DG, is that the position that Mr Seleke, 
ultimately was appointed into? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Chairman, he was the 
Director General. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Director General at DPE, I see there, 
then the email on the top of the page is from Ms Kimberly 
Davids, 
that 
email 
address 
which 
info 
portal 
used, 
anckimwc@gmail and she seems to be forwarding to 
herself, now at an official address, kim.davids@dpe.gov.za 
on the 23 r d of June 2015 and the subject is, forward, 
20 
Richard CV, there’s an attachment referred to as Mogokare 
CV.doc, qualifications PDF, do you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   That’s correct, I do see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now on the face of this exchange, it 
would appear that Businessman and Richard Seleke are 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 60 of 224 
 
two different persons, any comment on that, do you see 
that? 
MS DANIELS:   I see that on the face, Mr Chairman, and 
that is why I say that, you know, it is my suspicion that this 
was used as an information portal, this particular inbox and 
that it was not managed by just one person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you or do you not accept that on 
the face of it, it appears that the person who forwarded Mr 
Richard Seleke’s CV to Ms Kimberley Davids appears to be 
somebody other than Mr Richard Seleke himself? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   That I accept but later on, Richard Seleke, 
himself uses that very inbox, you see, so that is one of 
those reason why I said to you that I don’t think that it was 
one person that used this info portal address.  We just 
don’t have enough proof. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How do you know that Richard Seleke 
used it? 
MS DANIELS:   There were emails in the Gupta leaks and 
ALTA…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I’m asking you, how do you know 
20 
that Richard Seleke used it? 
MS DANIELS:   There was an email in the outer bundle 
that they gave us which was from info portal, signed, best 
regards Richard. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay would you have that email? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 61 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was part of our evidence bundle at 
the disciplinary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And tell me, just repeat that again, 
what did it say? 
MS DANIELS:   I can’t remember the details now, Mr 
Chairman, but it did say, best regards Richard.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  An email from info portal?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When was that? 
MS DANIELS:   I would have to ask my attorneys. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well let’s look at this further because 
Fundudzi has another correspondence between Kimberly 
Davids and Businessman page 1032.  These are Exhibits, 
as you can see, from the report itself, 1032, you there Ms 
Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, the bottom email again which is 
16 July 2015, it’s from Kimberly Davids with that email 
address of gmail.com, 16 July 2015, the subject is forward, 
Travons CV to Businessman inforportal1@soho and here 
20 
she explicitly writes, 
 
“Dear Salim, herewith CV for Aleska Board as 
discussed”, 
 
And she’s not writing to Richard, you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see that. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 62 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, all the more the – all the more the 
– all the more giving credence to the conclusion that 
Businessman and Mr Richard Seleke are two different 
persons but this email takes it further, the email takes it 
further it, in fact, covers the face behind Businessman, do 
you have any comment, Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I still have, based on what 
my experience was, I cannot discount that Salim Essa was 
one of the people that had access to this box but it is still 
my suspicion that there was more than one person handling 
10 
this box. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And, that leaves one – if you look at 
this correspondence before Mr Seleke is appointed DG in 
the office of the Department of DPE, two things.  One is, it 
puts a big question mark on the explanation that he would 
have been the one having interest in the affairs of Eskom 
because at this stage he would have been the one having 
interest in the face of Eskom as a DG of the DPE because 
at this stage he’s not in that position, he’s not in that 
department, that’s a big question mark on that explanation 
20 
because look Dr Ngubane says it was an explanation you 
gave to him and he didn’t have a problem with it because 
it’s an interest expressed by the DG of a department that 
oversees the SOE’s.  Now, I can let you comment on that 
first and then I can go to the next point. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 63 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Well, all I can say is that it was – from Dr 
Ngubane that this was the DG and I took it at face value. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – well, so Dr Ngubane says you 
told him, he’s the DG, Mr Richard Seleke he has an 
interest they want to see the media statements before they 
are published because they see them for the first time 
once published and he wants to know beforehand and that 
was your explanation, what do you say about that, just that 
portion, did you say that to him? 
MS DANIELS:   I didn’t say that to him but that did happen 
10 
when it was – it was, in fact, when it was a major media 
statement the DPE did want sight because Minister Brown 
was not impressed, to use a colloquial terms but when she 
saw the media statements for the first time in the media 
and that she hadn’t been briefed or had input, so on major 
issues she had wanted to see them beforehand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Minister Brown? 
MS DANIELS:   Minister Brown, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I’m talking the DG now. 
MS DANIELS:   Well, he would have been the one handling 
20 
the issues on her behalf. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, who raised the concern, is it the 
Minister or is it the DG?  
MS DANIELS:   In my recollection, the Minister raised 
these…[intervenes]. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 64 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not the DG? 
MS DANIELS:   Not the DG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you tell Dr Ngubane that the DG 
raised the concern? 
MS DANIELS:   In the email that we got? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, did you tell Dr Ngubane, you 
personally, saying to him, the person behind the email, 
Businessman is Mr Richard Seleke and this is the reason 
why he’s corresponding with us. 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So, you maintain that it is Dr Ngubane 
who told you that the man behind Businessman email is Mr 
Richard Seleke?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there any chance that you could be 
mistaken about that and that maybe you told him? 
MS DANIELS:   I did not deal directly with the Director 
General, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   I said, I did not deal directly with the 
20 
Director General, you know, to tell the Chairman that, it 
would have been the other way around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are quite clear that you did not tell 
him or it could be that you told him but you can’t 
remember, what is the position?  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 65 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   I’m quite clear that I wouldn’t have told him 
that it was DG Seleke. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the fact that the emails from 
Businessman from info portal happened or Mr Seleke was 
appointed as DG of the Department of Public Enterprises 
would mean that if it was him at that time it would be very 
strange because, to your knowledge, to our knowledge he 
had nothing to do with DPE or with Eskom at the time 
before his appointment to DPE. 
MS DANIELS:   Well to my knowledge yes, I don’t think he 
10 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  The other point then, 
my second point, was, phased with this information on the 
face of which it is apparent that Richard Seleke could not – 
could most probably not have been the person behind the 
email Businessman info portal, how, in your view, should 
the Commission deal with that aspect because we can only 
go by the documents before us? 
MS DANIELS:   As I said, Mr Chairman,  if you look at the 
20 
totality and you look at the correspondence in the Gupta 
leaks, for example, and you look at, you know, the specific 
institutional emails, it is, in my view a suspicion that Salim 
Essa was one of those people that controlled that inbox.  I, 
you know, I found other emails, I did not have direct 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 66 of 224 
 
contact with Salim Essa and you can see from this, I would 
still say that it’s highly suspicious that at various points in 
time he was the one directing those emails but there isn’t, 
in my mind yet, because I don’t have access to everything, 
that conclusivity.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Shall I carry on?  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, then I was provided with the 
document 
which 
I 
showed 
Ms 
Daniels 
during 
the 
adjournment, I’m going to beg leave to hand it up, 
10 
Chairperson.  It goes with the documents we’ve referred to 
on page 945 and 948; the draft resolution that was 
prepared and sent to various SOE’s and then in respect of 
Eskom we saw that, that draft became the draft resolution 
for the Board to adopt.  What we’re focusing on here, this 
– with the production of this, Chairperson, is the persons 
who created the document itself, the draft itself.  Ms 
Daniels might not know but I’ve shown her the documents 
it’s an IT production and I beg leave to hand it up.  So 
what is being handed up to you, Chairperson, is a copy of 
20 
the email, the first page is two emails which we have 
already referred to, firstly exchange between Businessman 
and Dr Ngubane on 28 September 2015, Dr Ngubane then 
forwards that email to Ms Daniels on the same date, we’ve 
referred to that, we can turn the page and we will mark the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 67 of 224 
 
document in due course for the purposes of the record.  
Then you have the draft document or draft resolution which 
was adopted – adopted into Eskom’s document, Ms Daniels 
you follow? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s two pages and then the third 
page is what has been drawn to our attention, Ms Daniels.  
Now you have this document, info, at the top, urgent 
request email attachments and you have these blocks, read 
only document, compatibility mode and then you have 
10 
protect document.  Against that block of protect document 
you have related dates; last modified 28 September 2015 
...25pm, created 28 September 2015 2:25 pm.  Last printed 
today 1.57 pm.  Below that you have related people and 
firstly is the Bossa and it shows that the Bossa is Mantsha 
Attorneys.  Does that ring a bell Ms Daniels with you?  
Mantsha Attorneys? 
MS DANIELS:  Mantsha Attorneys I can assume is Daniel 
Mantsha he was the Chairperson of Denel at the time Mr 
Chairman. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The Chairperson of Denel? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At the time September 2015? 
MS DANIELS:  I will have to check but if he was .. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At some point he was the Chairperson? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 68 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  He was Chairperson – he was related to 
Denel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then last modified by you chose the 
name of the person there Salim Essa and if you read this 
together with that email from Kim Davis where she says – 
this email I read what did she say here – say: 
“Dear Salim herewith CV for Alexco Board as 
discussed. 
The email of 16 July 2015.” 
If you read the two together it seems the commission cannot 
10 
but 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
man 
behind 
Businessman is Salim Essa.  You see that? 
MS DANIELS:  I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you have any comment? 
MS DANIELS:  I still think that it is – it is more than likely 
that it was more than one person but I do not discount that 
he would have had something to do with infoportal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chairperson then you turn the page 
you go to what Ms Daniels has said is a template of a 
resolution for Transnet.  Is that right Ms Daniels? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you go to – turn again that page – 
you go to the last page of this document it has similar 
information – the same information as to the author and the 
person last modified.  The author again Mantsha Attorneys 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 69 of 224 
 
and last modified – oh here last modified – I beg your pardon 
by the same Attorneys.  For the purposes of the record Chair 
I would ask that the document be admitted as Exhibit U18. – 
it is going to have to be Point 5.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you double checked what the last 
number was?  Was it not 18.3? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was 18.4 the last number Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I am going to explain why I added 
Point 1 at the end. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this one that you want to be admitted 
is at what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is going to be at page – we will add it 
to the bundle at page 951.1.  What I have not done 
Chairperson is to admit the emails we have referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And mark them as exhibits and those 
emails which are starting at page 874 would be admitted as 
Exhibit U18.5.  That is the e – the Businessman’s email to Dr 
Ngubane and then Dr Ngubane forwarding that email to Ms 
20 
Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want us to start at 874? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it 874. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  Let me – not 874 sorry.  Sorry 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 70 of 224 
 
Chair those emails which I want to have admitted are on 
page 944.  Page 944.  Together with the – that will be from 
944. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the related – and the related 
documents until page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have dealt with these emails under – 
during Dr Ngubane’s evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they were there they should have been 
10 
admitted there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they have to retain that Exhibit 
number throughout because otherwise you – you will have 
confusion.  Same documents are in different bundles and 
different bundles are known as – with – by different names.  
So I think that is what we should do either now or later 
maybe during lunch break you can have a look. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  During lunch will be in order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Also that we do no. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that it does not delay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that they can be admitted where they 
primarily belong and then reference to them can be made to 
whatever bundle they are deemed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 71 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the exhibit numbers relating to them 
can be used. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  That will be done 
during the lunch break Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Ms Daniels there is more 
emails exchanged with Businessman but they come in during 
2016.  But I think this is the critical moment what we have 
gone through now – that is the critical moment.  So I – I 
would like – Chair unless you have any questions I want to 
10 
move on? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine you can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Talking of Mr Salim Essa Ms 
Daniels have you – you have met with – well ja rather say 
that you have met with Mr Salim Essa as we understand from 
your affidavits; your testimony, correct? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And can you tell the Chairperson your 
first occasion when you met – the first occasion when you 
met with Mr Essa? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman I met Mr Essa for the first time 
in March 2015.  As I testified in Parliament it was on the 9 
March but as I said to you earlier with the – with the 
commission’s team and using phone records they have 
confirmed for me that it was actually the 10 March.  I was 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 72 of 224 
 
called to – by Matshela Koko who was the acting Group 
Executive for Technology and Commercial at the time and I 
was called to Melrose Arch to meet with him.  It was around 
about lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were called by whom? 
MS DANIELS:  Matshela Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS DANIELS:  He held the position of acting Group 
Executive Technology and Commercial at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  And – so Dave Facto [?] he was my boss.  I 
went to Melrose Arch and I waited for him at the restaurant 
called JB Rivers because he told me I must wait for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Koko tell you to go to that 
restaurant? 
MS DANIELS:  He just told me to come to Melrose Arch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  For me that was sort of a hub and I thought 
that would be the easier – easiest place to… thought that 
would be the easier – easiest place to… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright so he did not tell you where 
exactly at Melrose Arch you should go but once you were 
there you went into this restaurant. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes and then I told him where I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 73 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  He told me to wait there and I waited for 
about an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he asked you to go to Melrose Arch 
did he say why? 
MS DANIELS:  No not at that stage.  He wanted to talk to me 
about certain matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He wanted to talk to you about? 
MS DANIELS:  Certain matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certain matters. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what he said? 
MS DANIELS:  That is what he said when he called. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  But he did not – he was not specific.  So I 
waited at the restaurant and he came across and he 
collected me.  We then went across the road to an office 
building and we proceeded to go to the – I think it was the 
first floor and we walked towards an office in the corner and 
at the entrance I could not see there was not any plaque 
identifying what the company name was etcetera.  We went 
20 
inside.  I had to hand in my phone at reception.  We waited 
in a board room and a couple of minutes later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you were going to this building he still 
had not told you what – where you were going and what 
matters you had to discuss? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 74 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  No.  We – the conversation was quite limited 
you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  It was like where are we going?  He said be 
patient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  It will become clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This would have been around about what 
time of the day or evening? 
MS DANIELS:  It was in the afternoon. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Around about lunch – lunch time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around about lunch time. 
MS DANIELS:  Ja.  Or just after lunch 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  Because people were having lunch at the 
restaurant and things like that.  So – I cannot remember 
specifically the time but it was in the afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  We are then ushered into this board room 
20 
and we waited – we wait a couple of minutes and I still asked 
him you know what is this about?  And he was like be 
patient.  And then this gentleman walks in introduces himself 
to me as Salim Essa and that he is the advisor to Minister 
Brown.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 75 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what he said? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
MS DANIELS:  I was quite surprised because I had not 
heard of him before.  I looked at Mr Koko and he just sat 
there quite – quite comfortable.  Mr Essa then proceeds to 
ask me what do we need to do if we want to suspend people.  
And I was a bit perplexed you know.  And I said to him well 
firstly I am not a labour lawyer.  And so – my area of 
expertise does not extend that far but what I can tell you is 
10 
that you need a very good reason to suspend people.  You 
cannot just suspend them willy nilly. It is at that stage that 
he then proceeds to tell me – or sketches out that in the 
coming days the four executives namely Tshediso Matona, 
Dan Marokane, Tsholofelo Molefe and Matshela Koko would 
be suspended.  At this point I look at Matshela Koko because 
he is sitting in the room and he is actually unfazed by this 
revelation.  Mr Essa continues to tell me that there would be 
an inquiry and he knows that these executives more than 
likely…. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There would be an inquiry where? 
MS DANIELS:  At Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay he was talking about Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 76 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  And the – into the – he just said into the 
affairs of Eskom and that you know certain people would – 
would not – not return.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
MS DANIELS:  And he said that certain people would not 
return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said certain people would not return? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask him who he was talking about? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman at that stage I was quite 
10 
shocked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  I was – even though I was a senior manager I 
had not been exposed to this kind of behind the scenes 
machinations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of who the 
people were that he was talking about when he said certain 
people would not return and what was your understanding of 
where he was saying they would not return to? 
MS DANIELS:  Because he was talking of suspensions.  I – 
20 
my understanding was that they would not return to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Continue.  So you said you 
looked at Mr Koko after hearing that his name was included 
by Mr Salim Essa. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 77 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Among the executives who would be 
suspended and he looked unfazed? 
MS DANIELS:  He was unfazed.  He – I still looked – 
because he was sitting opposite me.  I – you know directly 
opposite me and I looked at him and I frowned in sort of 
bewilderment because I was like how – what is going on 
here?  And he just gestured you know be quiet.  He raised 
his hand he did not speak much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say keep quiet – did he say… 
MS DANIELS:  No, no he did not say keep quiet he just – he 
10 
raised his hand as if to say you know do not ask too many 
questions.  So it was gesture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He raised his hand to you. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a manner that you understood to be … 
MS DANIELS:  Like just leave. 
MS DANIELS:  Do not ask too many questions? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  So he was not shocked by 
this revelation? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  No he was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  He was quite comfortable.  He was relaxed in 
his chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 78 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  I think he was you know he had some – a 
cold drink I cannot remember what but it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  But it – it was not – it was like an ordinary 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  I was quite bewildered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  We left shortly after. 
MS DANIELS:  How did you respond to this revelation from 
10 
Mr Essa? 
MS DANIELS:  Well I said to him that there would – this is 
not possible there would have to be reasons for suspending 
people.  You cannot just suspend them on – without any 
reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  I remember I repeated that.  For me what was 
shocking was that he had said that in the coming days … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said what about coming days? 
MS DANIELS:  That this would happen in the coming days. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  
MS DANIELS:  And that was a bit you know that was 
shocking for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  And I think when – when he realised that I 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 79 of 224 
 
actually did not you know could not add any more value to 
the process questions that he was asking the conversation 
ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  Matshela Koko proceeded to walk me out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  Of the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  And I remember asking him how – how is this 
possible?  You know.  And he just said well this is what is 
10 
going to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MS DANIELS:  And I then left and went home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Koko remain behind? 
MS DANIELS:  He did remain behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now I may be mistaken I did not 
seem to – I do not seem to remember reading in your 
statement that Mr Salim Essa said at that meeting that some 
people would not return.  Do you know whether you did 
include that part? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  No I did not include it in the – in the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Why not? 
MS DANIELS:  I am just you know this is more formal.  I 
spent a lot of time trying to remember, going through my 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 80 of 224 
 
notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is just that it is an important part of 
the conversation is it not – was it not? 
MS DANIELS:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just like the suspension – the first is 
certain people would be suspended and you are told the 
names of the people who would suspended that came as a 
shock to you; you have told me.  But it must also have come 
as even greater shock that some people would not return if 
that – if you understood that to refer to the same people who 
10 
would be suspended?  Because it would mean the idea was 
that they would be suspended but they would part ways with 
Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:  Well at the time I did not understand it like 
that Mr Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you understand him to mean 
when he said… 
MS DANIELS:  Because he was –  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry –  
MS DANIELS:  My apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should not speak at the same time.  
What did you understand when he said some people will not 
return?  I thought you said you understood that to be a 
reference to the – at least some of the executives who – who 
would be suspended? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 81 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  You see he spoke about an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  So I was not very clear at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  I said I was not very clear at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were you not clear about? 
MS DANIELS:  What he was – who he was referring to.  That 
would become clearer later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I asked you earlier on when you 
said he said some people would not return.  I asked you 
10 
what your understanding was of who he was referring to and 
my recollection is that you said your understanding was that 
he was referring to the people who would be suspended. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct.  But it happened so quickly 
that I did not make that connection at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Ms Daniels we were speaking just 
maybe ten minutes ago or maybe fifteen or twenty.  You said 
Mr Salim Essa said to you some people will not return.  And 
then I asked you what your understanding was of who he 
was talking about when he said, some people would not 
20 
return. And my recollection is that you said he was talking – 
your understanding was that he was talking about the people 
who would be suspended or at least some of them.  Is my 
recollection of your evidence incorrect? 
MS DANIELS:  I – I am a bit confused now Chairman. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 82 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  I think – I think it would be – it would have 
been the four of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS DANIELS:  I think if I – I said I am a bit confused now.  
So I think it would have been the four of them 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been reference to all of 
them? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now my question is, how could you 
10 
not include that part in your statement namely that he said 
some people would not return because if anything it seems 
to me to be even much more important than his statement 
that they would be suspended. Because it meant that they 
would part ways with Eskom. 
MS DANIELS:  It was not a deliberate omission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  It was not a deliberate omission Mr 
Chairman.  I think going through preparing for my testimony 
since four weeks now. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you include it in your statement to the 
Portfolio Committee in Parliament? 
MS DANIELS:  I am not sure.  I do not think it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – did you include it in your oral 
evidence before the Portfolio Committee? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 83 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how could you have not remembered 
on so many occasions over such a long period of time 
something so important that here was this person from 
outside Eskom that you were meeting under very strange 
circumstances it seems to me from what you have said 
telling you that certain executives from Eskom and he 
mentioned them by name would be suspended and would not 
return to Eskom.  How could you remember that he said they 
would be suspended but you did not remember that he said 
10 
they would not return?  Because it seems to me to be equally 
important if not even more important than the fact that they 
would be suspended. 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman for the – for preparation for the 
commission I had to go through my notes and I brought my 
actually original notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Which I did not go through at the time of 
giving evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  In 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are those notes that you made at the 
meeting with Mr Salim Essa and Mr Koko? 
MS DANIELS:  No they are not of the meetings that I speak 
about later in – in the testimony. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 84 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but do those notes include this piece 
of important information namely that Mr Essa told you that 
some of the people would not return to Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:  They jogged my memory as to what – what 
was said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but did they include that or did they not 
include that? 
MS DANIELS:  There are references to it from the Board’s 
side Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels in your 
affidavit when Mr Matshela Koko phones you you say it was 
in the afternoon in paragraph 18 I think of your affidavit.  I 
am – I cannot recall whether the Chairperson asked you 
whether did he – did he give you reasons why he was calling 
you to Melrose Arch? 
MS DANIELS:  No he did not – he was not specific. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So he gave reasons but he was not 
specific or he did not give reasons at all? 
MS DANIELS:  No he just said come meet me at Melrose 
20 
Arch. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you ask him for the reasons? 
MS DANIELS:  I said – I asked why and he said we will let 
you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said what? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 85 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  I asked why and he said I will let you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought earlier on you said he said to you 
he wanted to discuss some matters with you? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is what he – we spoke – we spoke 
quite a lot of times so I may have the sequence wrong but 
you know he was not specific as to I want to discuss X with 
you.  It is just meet me there and I will – I will speak to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say when you asked him why I will 
let you know or did he say there are some matters I want to 
discuss with you? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  It will be more I will speak to you when I – I 
will – I will discuss the matters when I see you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Was this the first time and as I 
understand it this is during working hours? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were at work and you receive a call 
from him. Is it the first time that he called you during working 
hours to come to him somewhere outside of the office? 
MS DANIELS:  At that point in time yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In March 20 – well not March 2015 – 
when you – you were reporting to him at this time.  Is this 
the first time he is calling you?  Was this the first time? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So he had never called you prior to this 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 86 of 224 
 
to come to him at Sandton? 
MS DANIELS:  No not at this time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja no any time before. 
MS DANIELS:  Not that I can recall Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He did not call you to cancel him at 
Woodmead Shopping Centre prior to this?  Because it is 
really around the corner of Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja.  Not that I recall. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you are trying to think, I see in your 
face. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   [laughing]  Yes.  No, the trip to Melrose Arch 
stood out for me.  That is why I do not think, not that I recall 
that we met at other places. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this would have been... it would have 
made it all then more strange that he was calling you during 
office hours that he had not done it before but he was doing 
it now for the first time during your normal office hours and 
you would go to them to him to a place he does not even 
identify where in Melrose Arch.  It will make it all the more 
strange. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you went, nonetheless. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would have been even more strange if 
he did not tell you what he wanted to discuss with you 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 87 of 224 
 
outside of Eskom, is that not so? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And it would have been even 
stranger when, after meeting you at the restaurant where you 
were waiting for him, he took you and you walked to some 
offices and still he did not tell you on the way to those 
offices.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when you came to this board 
room and you said he still did not tell you, you waited for 
10 
somebody to come in.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you must have found all of this quite 
strange? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ja, the Chairperson 
has already asked you.  You know, how did you know where 
to wait for him? 
MS DANIELS:   I just parked in the central parking, Mr 
20 
Chairman.  And I walked up and out of the escalator, I think 
the first restaurant to the... that I could find, was JB 
Rivers(?) because, you know, it was locked(?).  I sat down 
and I let him know that I was there.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, JB Rivers... Dr Ngubane says he 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 88 of 224 
 
was there.  Mr Koko himself says he was there.  Now you 
say you were also there. 
MS DANIELS:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That sounds like some meeting point.  
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I for the first time... I listened 
to the testimony last week and that is when I heard that they 
were at JB Rivers as well.  So, you know, for me it was 
strange but that was the closest restaurant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had you been to that restaurant before? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I have been there before? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Many times? 
MS DANIELS:   Not many times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A few times? 
MS DANIELS:   A few, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once? 
MS DANIELS:   When I used to shop at Melrose Arch, I 
would go there.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, Mr Koko... you have seen his 
statement?  It is actually his affidavit. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he says... he called you to... he 
agrees calling you to Melrose Arch.  He agrees meeting with 
you at JB Rivers but he says you did not go anywhere else.  
The two of stayed at JB Rivers.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 89 of 224 
 
 
And he wanted you to advise him on his... on a labour 
related issue or his labour rights because he was being 
threatened by Mr Tsotsi to be suspended if he did not 
reverse the suspension of Mr Malesela Sekhasimbe.  You 
saw in his statement his affidavit? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I saw that in his affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And tell the Chairperson what is your 
response to that? 
MS DANIELS:   With respect Mr Chairman, Mr Malesela Koko 
is lying.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What he says happened did not happen 
insofar as he says the two of you did not move to any other 
place.  You spoke at that restaurant and that he spoke to you 
about his written suspension.  Is that right?  So you say that 
is not true? 
MS DANIELS:   That did not come into the conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   We... he collected me at JB Rivers and took 
me to the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he ever speak to you about what he is 
20 
saying on another occasion and not on this occasion? 
MS DANIELS:   No, he did mention his tussle with Mr Tsotsi 
but it was not about the pending or being threatened with 
suspension.  What I do recall is, subsequent later in the 
year, this... the suspension and the disciplinary matter 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 90 of 224 
 
against Mr Sekhasimbe did continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   But at that point in time, he did not mention 
Mr Sekhasimbe’s suspension to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   He also did not speak to me about Mr 
Tsotsi’s threats and he definitely did not ask me advise on a 
pending suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Before I forget this point which I 
should have asked earlier on.  Now, when you left this 
10 
meeting, the boardroom where you met with mister... you and 
Mr Koko met with Mr Essa on your version, did you still ask 
Mr Koko:  Why did you bring me here or did you not ask him? 
MS DANIELS:   I did ask him, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did he say? 
MS DANIELS:   He did not really answer me.  You know, he 
just shrugged his shoulders.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of what the 
purpose is for you being brought there to meet with Mr Essa? 
MS DANIELS:   You see, at that point I was an Eskom 
20 
functionally in the office in Mr Malesela Koko’s office.  So 
when he had issues, process related issues or, you know, 
questions, I would be the one responsible to get the answers 
for him or, you know, get the right people to speak to him.   
 
He did not characterise me in the affidavit that Advocate 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 91 of 224 
 
Seleka refers to as his legal advisor at the time but I was not 
in that position as legal advisor.   
 
I was in his office and I generally was an executive 
assistant.  So I think from that perspective, you know, I 
would have been the go-to-person.   
 
But I did not have the necessary labour process other 
than what I knew this is the process that was followed at 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my question is whether you were able, 
after the meeting, to understand for yourself what the 
10 
purpose of that meeting was or whether you did not seek to 
understand that or to apply your mind to the question:  Why 
was I brought here.   
 
Did you make up your mind and say:  This is why I was 
brought here.  Or did you not think about it?  Or you do not 
know why you were brought there and you were not told? 
MS DANIELS:   I was not told why I was brought there, Mr 
Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you look at... did you, having regard 
to what was discussed, did you analyse and conclude why 
20 
you were brought there or did you not do that? 
MS DANIELS:   It was difficult to conclude why I was brought 
there but what I did do was then call... I called Dan 
Marokane and asked him to come and see me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Asked him...? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 92 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   To come and see me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   So that I can... could tell him ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...what had transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now from what you have told me in regard 
to the content of the discussion in that meeting while Mr 
Essa was there.  It seems that there are two issues that he 
raised with you.   
 
One, he asked you what process or what is to be done at 
10 
Eskom if somebody needs to be suspended.  And two, he 
told you that certain people were to suspended and he gave 
their names.  Is there something else of importance that I am 
missing out that he told you? 
MS DANIELS:   No, just what I told you today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are the two things? 
MS DANIELS:   Key things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, what 
boggles one’s mind is this.  That this seems to be a secret 
20 
meeting.  Is that how you understood it? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not a meeting... when I say, it is not 
a meeting arranged by emails.  We are going to meet at 
Eskom office on such a date, such a time.  It is a phone call 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 93 of 224 
 
to you:  Come to Melrose Arch.  You do not know where.  
Who else you are going to meet.  What is the agenda.  No 
prior arrangement.  You understand? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that what gets to be discussed there 
are things pertaining to Eskom, letters pertaining to Eskom 
by a person who is not an Eskom employee or official.  Mr 
Koko did not say people are going to be suspended.  
Correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko did not say what is the 
procedure to follow in order to suspend.  You say it was Mr 
Salim Essa who was talking? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what boggles the mind is.  How is 
that they would call you to such a meeting to discuss such 
sensitive issues.  Call you and not anybody else.  Did they 
trust you? 
MS DANIELS:   I... Mr Chairman, that has been an issue 
that, you know, has always been in my mind, as I have been 
20 
sort of privy to some of these discussions and my testimony 
will later tell you.  It just appears that, they did not really 
think that people would speak out, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That people would do what? 
MS DANIELS:   Would speak out about what had happened.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 94 of 224 
 
I did not know Mr Essa.  So the confidence with which he 
spoke ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Mr Koko... or let me put it... how was 
your relationship with Mr Koko at the time? 
MS DANIELS:   At the time, it was one of respect and trust.  
We had gone through a challenge with Eskom in terms of 
procurements, litigations.  And we worked quite closely 
together.   
 
So at that time, you know, I had no reason not to trust 
him.  He was fastidious.  He was meticulous.  He followed 
10 
Eskom processes.  You know, it was a... at that point, it was 
a good relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Well, you see, one 
has... and you need to explain this.  You know, the public 
has received some negative reports about yourself that had 
received some positive reports.   
 
You had been called the whistle-blower.  And you need 
to balance these perceptions that if you go to a meeting like 
this, that really these people either trusted you or you must 
20 
be part of them.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And maybe you need to explain to the 
Chairperson and I think that is why the Chairperson is at 
pains to find out, you know, how do you get yourself into that 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 95 of 224 
 
meeting so that we move on from that point.  You either are 
part of them, hence they are able to discuss these things 
with you or maybe there is some other reason why they did. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairperson, I cannot give you a reason 
for why they would trust me.  I sometimes felt like a use, you 
know, just a useful functionary, just part of the background.  
But in my own... just from what Advocate Seleka is saying is 
that, you know, there has been this theory that I was part of 
it.   
 
And I would urge you to just look at the Gupta’s modus 
10 
operandi.  I was not offered bags of cash.  I was not 
entertained at the Saxonwold residence.  I was not in Dubai 
at the lodges of the Gupta’s.  I certainly was not a member 
of the Roy Club.   
 
I did not get invited to any of the functions or any of the 
things that people have testified about.  So it is something 
that I also do not understand, you know, why there would 
have been this blatant ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess that assuming that you had 
no interactions with Mr Salim Essa or the Gupta’s, anybody 
20 
from the Gupta’s or their associates, Mr Koko could bring 
you to such a meeting if he thought that he could trust you 
that you would be one, helpful to Mr Essa and two, that you 
would 
not disclose maybe this meeting 
or 
what 
was 
discussed at this meeting to other people.  Would you think 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 96 of 224 
 
he had that trust in you? 
MS DANIELS:   I think at the time he did.  He did.  But he 
had also earlier told me that, you know, I must tell Dan that 
we are not of the correct political affiliations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that. 
MS DANIELS:   I said, I think at the time he did trust me 
because he also told me to tell Mr Marokane that we were 
not of the correct political affiliations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who is we? 
MS DANIELS:   Myself and Mr Marokane. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it seems to me Ms Daniels that 
unless there is something else that comes out, you may have 
been trusted to be the person who would cooperate in this 
context. 
 
And that you would be able to advise Mr Essa as to how 
at Eskom you go about if you want to suspend somebody but 
that you would also keep the discussions at the meeting 
confidential.   
20 
 
Because they would not call you to that meeting just to 
tell you that certain people would be suspended.  What 
would you do with that information? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I think at that stage they did... Mr Koko 
probably thought I would not disclose the information. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 97 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So Ms Daniels, and I 
know I have said when we started that there are matters that 
you will deal with in the second time around.   
 
So what one sees here from this moment onwards, 
because this is the beginning of the suspensions, once those 
officials are out that were to be suspended, you have new 
people coming in.   
 
You have Mr Brian Molefe, you have Mr Anoj Singh.  But 
let me focus on Mr Brian Molefe.  At the very beginning of 
10 
his entrance, there is the Tegeta issue ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka.  I think it is 
necessary for the sake of completeness to also deal with her 
evidence about what happened after that meeting and the 
following day because I think she said she called certain 
people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I just wanted to deal with the impression 
that gets created. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That gets created.  And maybe you can 
explain.  I mean, we will deal with the details later.  That 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 98 of 224 
 
here you have this contact with Mr Salim Essa in this 
meeting. 
 
And there is a facilitation of the transactions with Tegeta 
later on which features in your disciplinary hearing that leads 
to the prepayment to Tegeta, for instance, of R 659 million.   
 
And that you are one of the parties’ central in the 
facilitation of that prepayment.  You see that impression that 
gets created? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a yes? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  Sorry, Mr Chairman.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so these things need to be 
explained.  You do not just appear on the scene once but you 
see that the trend developing on where you feature.  You 
may want to say something now or you can say it later.   
MS DANIELS:   I prefer to say later when we deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When we deal with it. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  And okay, so the meeting is 
over and you go home and we know that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Go home or go back to work?  Did you go 
home or back to work? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 99 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chairman I went back to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Because I... I was actually... I live in 
Pretoria.  And I was actually quite shaken by the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So I drove straight home.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And on your way home, I mean, that is 
apparent from your documents, your testimony, your affidavit 
that you called a friend of yours and... paragraph 27.  You 
10 
called a friend of yours and your words were, you say: 
“I know this man called Salim Essa.  Can he do what 
he says he can?  My friend responded:  In all 
probability, yes.” 
 
And then you get a call from a doctor... you will help to 
pronounce that name? 
MS DANIELS:   Dr Gieunu(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And the next day, Mr Koko asked 
you about those telephone calls.  Now let me ask you about 
your friend because you did not give us more details 
20 
regarding your friend.  Did your friend know Mr Salim Essa? 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chairman.  What he did say is he 
knew of Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He knew of him? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 100 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that your friend knew of 
Salim Essa?  Because your call does not say:  Hi, mister so 
and so, if it is a mister, do you know Salim Essa?  You 
simple ask him:  I met this man.  Can he do what he says he 
can do?  Did you know that he knew of him? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, as I have testified in parliament, Mr 
Chairman.  He... the friend that I spoke to was quite... he 
worked in government circles as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He worked in...? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   In government circles as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Government circles? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   He was a one time advisor to Minister 
Mcebisi Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Minister who? 
MS DANIELS:   Jonas, Mcebisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Jonas. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   So and we had been friends over 20 odd 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So I thought if there is one person that some 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 101 of 224 
 
understanding of what the political landscape looked like it 
would be him and that he would give me an honest answer.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I did not see the name of your 
friend.  Is there a particular reason you might want to tell us 
who your friend is? 
MS DANIELS:   It is in my parliamentary statement so I can 
tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is his name? 
MS DANIELS:   His name is Rustum Mohammed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dr Mohammed? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   No, Rustum Mohammed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Justin Mohammed? 
MS DANIELS:   Rustum.  R-u-s-t-u-m 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I may, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 31. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 31? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 31. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay alright.  So you phoned him 
on your way from this meeting with Mr Essa and Mr Koko and 
before your office? 
MS DANIELS:   Before I arrived home, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did you go to the office and then 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 102 of 224 
 
went home?  I thought you said you went back to work. 
MS DANIELS:   No, no.  I did not go back to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not go back to work? 
MS DANIELS:   I went straight from Melrose Arch, home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Roundabout what time was it 
when you left that meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   It would have been late afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About what time? 
MS DANIELS:   Roundabout three in the afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   The traffic... roundabout three in the 
afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About three in the afternoon? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja.  The traffic was not yet ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was not yet heavy? 
MS DANIELS:   ...was not yet heavy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think you said you... you say you 
got Mr Koko’s call around lunch time or did you say you met 
him at the restaurant around lunch time? 
MS DANIELS:   It was around lunch time when we were at 
20 
the... when I was at the restaurant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but did not want him to... 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  So from the meeting 
you went home? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 103 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on your way home, you called your 
friend? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in that conversation you just asked 
him... you asked him whether Mr Essa could deliver what he 
said he... what he said? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  I just said:  I met this man, Salim Essa.  
Can he do what he says he can do? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But what he had said?  He could do 
10 
or could not do? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I was talking about the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Because the distinct impression was that, 
you know, this was going to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But he was not going to be the one 
doing the suspensions, is it not? 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what were you talking about when 
you asked your friend whether Mr Essa could do what he 
20 
said he could do?  He never said he would suspend the 
people. 
MS DANIELS:   Well, Mr Chairman, that is the impression 
that I got. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 104 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   That was the impression that I got, even if 
he did not say that in so many words. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what was the impression that 
you got? 
MS DANIELS:   That he would be able to, you know, 
arrange these suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would be able to? 
MS DANIELS:   Arrange the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Arrange the suspensions? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is what you were talking 
about. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To get them suspended. 
MS DANIELS:   To get them suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So – and your friend’s 
response was probably he would be able to do what he 
said he would do? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, he said in all probability, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did your friend know what you were 
20 
talking about? 
MS DANIELS:   No, he did not, I did not tell him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not tell him? 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you subsequently tell him? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 105 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not, he found out in parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did he never ask you what are you 
talking about, what did Mr Essa say he would do? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not think we had that specific 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is strange.  You are my friend, I 
get a call from you, you say to me can so and so do what 
he says he can do.  I respond and say yes.  I do not know 
what it is you are talking about, what it is that he said he 
would do and then I do not ask questions during the 
10 
telephone conversation.  I do not phone you up later on 
and say what were you talking about? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not recall that we had that 
conversation, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree with me that it is strange?  
Unless the two of you had  full understanding of what it 
was, that is why he would not – he did not need to ask you. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it may be strange to you now.  At the 
time I actually did not speak much about Eskom matters to 
my friends, anyway.  And Mr Mohamed lives in Cape Town, 
20 
not here in Gauteng so it would not be something that we 
would discuss on the telephone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what was the purpose of your call to 
your friend then? 
MS DANIELS:   My purpose was to find out if this man 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 106 of 224 
 
could – you know, had that kind of power that he purported 
to have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is all you wanted to find out? 
MS DANIELS:   That is all I wanted to know at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you found it out? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, the ensuing days actually showed 
more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even though your friend did not know 
you were talking about Mr Essa getting people suspended? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, he did not – no, I did not tell him that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is very strange to me, Ms Daniels. 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I did not tell him anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I do not know if you have one 
or two questions before we take the lunch break or whether 
we should take it straightaway? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We should take it.  We can take it, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we are going to take the lunch 
break.  The time is ten past one, we will resume at ten past 
two. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 107 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, DCJ.  Ms Daniels, did you 
have any interaction with the Gupta brothers? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did.  One of them, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you tell the Chairperson the 
circumstances under which you had such interaction? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell us first how it was? 
MS DANIELS:   I had the occasion to meet with Ajay 
Gupta.  It took place late July 2017.  I was called by Salim 
Essa and the conversation was actually about Mr Molefe’s 
pension matter that was before court at the time.  I said to 
10 
him do not waste my time, you know, Brian is going to lose 
the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, he – how did you meet, did 
you call you, did somebody call you, a meeting was set up?  
Where was it set up, what did he want to talk to you about?  
Give me all the information. 
MS DANIELS:   That is why I am saying Mr Salim Essa 
called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Salim Essa called you? 
MS DANIELS:   Salim Essa called me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and said what? 
MS DANIELS:   And the said – the introduction was about 
the Molefe matter, Brian Molefe’s pension matter that was 
before court.  I said to him Brian is going to lose that 
matter and he then said let us meet for coffee. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 108 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just go back again.  He 
called you – tell me, he called you and said what?  Did he 
say Brian Molefe matter?  What did he say exactly? 
MS DANIELS:   He was asking what was happening with 
Brian Molefe’s matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that is now Mr Salim Essa?  
MS DANIELS:  Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was 2017? 
MS DANIELS:   Late July 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Late July.  Was this only the second time 
10 
you were talking to him after the meeting at Melrose Arch 
or had you spoken to him or had communication with him in 
the meantime? 
MS DANIELS:   In the interim I had had communication 
with Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   There was one meeting, physical meeting 
at his offices when it was at Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and when was that? 
MS DANIELS:   I cannot recall the precise date of that 
20 
meeting, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  2015, 2016, 2017? 
MS DANIELS:   That would have been either – early 2017, 
mid… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Early 2017? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 109 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   We were talking – would you want me to 
describe that one as well? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just tell me about that second 
meeting before you go to the July one. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  So that meeting, Mr Matshela Koko 
told me that we were going to a meeting with Ms Lyn Brown 
to talk about IPPs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that second meeting which you had 
10 
with Mr Salim Essa was arranged by Mr Koko? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  What did Mr Koko say to you to 
make the arrangement? 
MS DANIELS:   He said I must please come along, we are 
going to meet Minister Brown to discuss the IPPs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To discuss the IPPs. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is early in…? 
MS DANIELS:   Early 2017. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   2017.  And you went along. 
MS DANIELS:   And I went along. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where was this meeting held? 
MS DANIELS:   I assumed that we were going to Pretorius 
about once again we ended up in Melrose Arch. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 110 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and he had not told you that were 
going to go Melrose Arch? 
MS DANIELS:   No, he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he say where the meeting was going 
to be held? 
MS DANIELS:   No, he did not.   Because it was a me with 
Minister 
Brown 
I 
assumed 
we 
would 
be 
going 
to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Pretoria. 
MS DANIELS:   To Pretoria. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you went to Melrose Arch. 
MS DANIELS:   We ended up in Melrose Arch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   This time the offices – what I later came to 
find out, it was the offices – it was actually the offices of 
Trillian.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   You know, the Trillian Group of Companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   I was made to sit outside the boardroom 
20 
while he and Salim Essa had a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Because it was a glass office I could see 
them but I was sitting outside of the boardroom.  During 
the time that I was sitting out there, Mr Eric Wood from 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 111 of 224 
 
Trillian came past and introduced himself to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And during that introduction Mr Essa and 
Mr Koko then came out of the boardroom and Mr Essa 
joked with me then, you know, you must tell your boss to 
stop Tweeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, talking about Mr Koko? 
MS DANIELS:   Talking about Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Because he was very active on Twitter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And I think he has earned the nickname of 
tweeting engineer.  So he was very active there.  That was 
the end of that meeting.  Mr Koko and I had then left.  I 
obviously was very irritated with Mr Koko and I said to him 
why did you bring me with to this meeting?  You know, I 
had to sit outside.  And he said well, he had things to 
discuss with Mr Essa and I just said please do not put me 
in this position again, do not waste my time.  We then 
returned to Eskom.    
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you did not go to see Minister 
Brown? 
MS DANIELS:   Not at all that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ask him what happened to the 
meeting with Mr Brown that you said we were going to? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 112 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   I did ask him in the drive back and he says 
that would be arranged for another time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So he asked you to come along, 
said that the two of you were going to meet with Minister 
Brown but took you to Melrose Arch, kept you outside of 
the boardroom, had a meeting with Mr Salim Essa inside 
the boardroom, came out of the boardroom or the meeting 
and drove back with you to Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is quite strange too, is it not? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was very strange and I was actually 
quite furious that he had wasted my time and had once 
again taken me into that situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But for all intents and purposes from 
your version it looks like he did not need you to come 
along? 
MS DANIELS:   No, he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why would he take you along when 
he did not need you, let you impact your work and then 
take you not to a meeting, take you to outside a boardroom 
20 
and have a meeting with somebody else inside? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, my only impression of what 
was happening at the time that it was really a power play. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What power play? 
MS DANIELS:   He was Acting CEO at the time and he 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 113 of 224 
 
quite enjoyed showing that he was, you know, in charge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how would taking you to this meeting 
but you are sitting outside the boardroom show that he was 
in charge? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I think also just letting me know who 
– you know, who was in charge of my time and – ja, it was 
just – it was a bizarre moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Daniels, this does not make sense to 
me. 
MS DANIELS:   But that is what happened, Mr Chair, it 
10 
happened like that.  I sat outside …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He just takes you – I mean, you must 
have had a lot of important work to do, he takes you, he 
says come along, we are going to see Mr Brown, does not 
take you to Minister Brown, he takes you to Melrose Arch, 
makes you wait outside the boardroom, has a meeting with 
somebody, when he is finished he says okay, let us go 
back to Eskom. 
MS DANIELS:   But that is how it happened, so I am not – 
and I did have very, very stern words with him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ask him why did you bring me 
here? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, he just laughed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   He just laughed. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 114 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you ask him? 
MS DANIELS:   I did ask me, that is what I said, in the trip 
back I said why did you bring me here, this was an 
absolute waste of my time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the first time around when he took 
you to Melrose Arch to meet with Mr Essa, I think you 
asked something and you say – you said he shrugged his 
shoulders. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, he did.  And you must just remember 
the first time that he took me, I was in a much junior 
10 
position than what I was in 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anyway, so that was the second meeting 
and then was the next meeting you had with Mr Essa the 
one towards the end of July 2017?  Or was there another 
one before that? 
MS DANIELS:   There was another one before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When was it? 
MS DANIELS:   But it was not a meeting it was in June of 
20 
2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What was that one about?   Or, Mr 
Seleka, is that something that is deferred to next time Ms 
Daniels comes back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, I think we can go into it. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 115 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   It is out of sequence though. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it out of sequence?  It does not 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it does not matter. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to see your interactions with 
the Guptas or their associates. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, with this one I would have to 
give you just a little bit of context, if you do not mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   It was in June and Mr Matshela Koko had 
been on suspension for the conflict of interest where he 
had not declared that his daughter was involved in Impulse 
or …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is June 2017? 
MS DANIELS:   2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, so what I am – all the events that I 
am telling you now are in 2017.  And I – we had received 
the report from Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr and Nkonki about the 
conflict of interest.  On the fact of it, they could not find, 
you know, any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Mr 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 116 of 224 
 
Koko but what they had not done was interrogate the 
evidence.  It was merely taking of statements and things.   
 
So when I presented the findings to the board, I 
said to them that they cannot take the report on face value, 
it needed to be interrogated.  There was a bit of to and fro.  
This meeting was telephonic and it was a meeting to the 
audit and risk committee and it was – and I remember that 
I had to – I was at great pains to explain to them because 
there was a tussle between the – some of the board 
members said well, the report says he can come back, 
10 
other members were we are not so sure.  But there was 
sort of a big leaning towards he can come back now 
because he was Acting CEO at the time. 
 
And I said to them you cannot do that, you know, 
you have to – we have to interrogate this report, you would 
be failing in your duty if you accepted it as is. 
 
Eventually, it was quite a struggle, it was a debate 
– you know, the minutes will show that there was quite a 
debate.  At the end of it I got the instruction to instruct a 
senior counsel to interrogate the report.  So that was the 
20 
meeting that happened on the 14 July – my apologies, the 
14 June 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So how did that meeting come about? 
MS DANIELS:   That was an audit and risk committee 
meeting. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 117 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you mean that is the meeting 
…[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   That is the board …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where you were dealing with the report 
from the …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, that was just the context for you as 
to what would happen next.  So the next day, this was in 
the evening, the next – I then got the instruction to brief 
10 
counsel, which I did in the morning.  It is in the afternoon, 
I am going home, I – there is a filling station across the 
way from Megawatt Park, I go to the filling station and I 
was filling in petrol and this Maserati pulls up next to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who? 
MS DANIELS:   This Maserati, a black …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, ja, it pulls up next to you. 
MS DANIELS:   It pulls up next to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Says to me pull over.  It was Mr Salim 
20 
Essa.  So in the side there are parking spaces, I had 
parked next to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the garage? 
MS DANIELS:   At the garage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the filling station.

MS DANIELS:   At the garage, it is in a public place.  He 
motions to me to get out and I get out and he says to me 
why are you not supporting the return of Matshela Koko? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The what? 
MS DANIELS:   Why are you not supporting the return of 
Matshela Koko? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   I was taken aback because of the meeting 
that happened before.  He could recite verbatim what I had 
said. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the meeting that you had with the risk 
and audit committee? 
MS DANIELS:   At the meeting with the audit and risk 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, which was a telephonic meeting, 
you said. 
MS DANIELS:   Which was a telephonic meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he could recite exactly what you had 
said at the meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   What I had said at the meeting.  So I was 
20 
literally quite shocked and I did say – you know, it took me 
a while to compose myself because the first thing I thought 
was, how the hell did he know what I had said?  The 
Commission investigators actually highlighted it to me, he 
may have been on the call.  And I said that may well be, I 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 119 of 224 
 
would not know because I only arranged for the directors 
to be on the call. 
 
However, I then said to him – said, you know, why 
are you – I said to him well, that man is not fit to be CEO 
and he said to me I promised – I promised – no, I must just 
get the sequence right, I am sorry.  It was quite quick… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   It was quite a quick and a very significant 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can refresh your memory if there is 
10 
something that you want to… 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, I am just trying to – I am not sure if I 
wrote it in my affidavit.  He then said to me – because I 
said to him there is no way that Matshela Koko could 
become CEO and he should never come back to Eskom, 
you know, the board would be derelict in its duty if he did 
come back to Eskom.  And it was at that point that he said 
to me what do we need to do to bring him back?  I said 
there is no way that he can come back, you know, he is 
just – he does not belong in Eskom.  By that time I had 
20 
discovered just exactly what the man had been involved in, 
in terms of the tender manipulations, etcetera.   
 
And he said to me name your price and we will do 
whatever you say.  And I said there is no price that will - 
you know, will make me help get you – help you get him 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 120 of 224 
 
back. 
 
The next minute, and I do not know the precise 
timing, it happened quite quickly, the next minute he says 
to me, I will offer you 800 million if you help us and we will 
do whatever you say.  And I looked at him and I said do not 
be ridiculous and I actually scoffed and burst out laughing 
and got into my car and just drove away.  I was quite – I 
was quite shocked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that was your third meeting. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   With him.  And then the next one was 
the one towards the end of July? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This encounter, this third meeting, have 
you included it in any statements that you have made? 
MS DANIELS:   I told parliament about it, it did not make it 
into the public state – into the public arena because it was 
overshadowed by my meeting with Ajay Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was it in a statement that you 
submitted to parliament. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   It was in my consultations with the 
evidence leader. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but was it in the statement because I 
do not seem to remember seeing it. 
MS DANIELS:   I did not do a formal affidavit to parliament 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 121 of 224 
 
because they called me so quickly and also because of the 
– so what you have from me as a statement is actually 
what the evidence leader called an evidence guide.  So I 
did not make any affidavit to parliament.  The transcript 
would contain what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then in July, how did the one that 
happened in July 2017 come about?   
MS DANIELS:   That was subsequent to this meeting.  
Salim Essa then called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who called you? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   The very Salim Essa, he called me and I 
must admit, Mr Chairman, I was quite, you know, surprised 
and I was morbidly curious as to why he would call me 
after I had turned him down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is about how long after your 
third meeting with him? 
MS DANIELS:   It would have been about a month later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   So he called me and that is when he talked 
about the Molefe matter and how is it going with the Molefe 
matter?  And I said Brian is going to lose that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said? 
MS DANIELS:   Brian is going to lose that matter. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 122 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The matter was in court. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And then he said to me can we meet for 
coffee?  And I was - I must admit I was curious as to why – 
why would you want to meet with me for coffee now, I told 
you I do not want anything to do with you.  And he just said 
let us just, you know, have coffee.  I – then once again, it 
was arranged for the African Pride Hotel, it is in Melrose 
Arch and that he arranged to meet with me in the 
10 
reception.  I went …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At his office? 
MS DANIELS:   No, no, no, at the hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, so it was not in his office.  We met 
there and then he took me – he said let us go over to – I 
am not sure how it came about, in terms of let us walk to 
the office.  And I said to him well, I do not have much time, 
I have another appointment.  We walked – what I thought 
were offices, were in fact townhouses.  They were behind 
20 
Melrose Arch, in the precinct because we could literally 
walk from the hotel to the apartment, to that block.  And he 
opened the door and we walked in, into a lounge type area 
and in the lounge area …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now before you could have the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 123 of 224 
 
coffee that he said you should have? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so were you now going to an 
apartment? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I only found out when he opened the 
door that it was an apartment.  I then realised, I thought it 
was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not ask where you were going to 
have this coffee? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, he said let us walk – and I thought it 
10 
was an office in the direction that he was going because 
that is what it looks like from the outside.  There was a 
restaurant in front of - I think there is an Ocean Basket and 
there is, you know, there are a couple of restaurants in 
front so I thought it was an office. 
 
As he opened the door I then realised that this was 
actually not an office, it was an apartment.  As I walked in, 
the curtains were drawn, so it was not very brightly lit but 
in this room, in the lounge area was Ajay Gupta, Duduzane 
Zuma, Minister Ben Martins and an Asian lady that I could 
20 
not remember her name because they did introduce me to 
these people.  I just – at that stage I was in total shock as 
to what I had walked into. 
 
Salim then continued to introduce me to Ajay Gupta 
and to Duduzane Zuma and to – obviously I knew Minister 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 124 of 224 
 
Ben Martins, so greeted him and to the lady that was there.  
They then asked me – he then asked me to sit down and I 
think 
Salim 
explained 
to 
him 
in 
vernacular, 
Indian 
vernacular, I am not sure which language I would be but he 
explained something to Mr Gupta and then Mr Gupta sort of 
sat back and said – he replied something also in the 
vernacular, but I could not understand.   
 
The next question was - you know, Salim Essa then 
said to me just tell Ajay what was – well, he gestured to Mr 
Gupta, tell him what was happening with Brian’s case.  I 
10 
just said, in terms of process, I said we were going to see 
the judge, Deputy Judge President’s office the next week 
which was – I think it was the 1 s t or the 2 August the date 
had not yet been confirmed and that we would be 
discussing the case management of the matter and I did 
not say anything else.  
 
Mr Gupta then responded, but not in particular to 
me, I think he was talking to the people in the room, you 
know?  He just said this – you know, we would need to find 
someone in the Deputy Judge President, DJP’s office to 
20 
move this case out.  And what was more significant for me 
- I mean, that was already one of the shocking statements 
- but then he – the next one he said was, when this matter 
would be easier to deal with, when Nkosazana Zuma comes 
into power and it was at that moment that I realised that 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 125 of 224 
 
whatever scepticism I had had about the Gupta family 
influence on – on the country issues, you know this was it.  
I did not need any more evidence.  I was not, I thought you 
know forget whatever else you wanted to know, this was it.    
          I tried to stay as composed as possible, because I 
was extremely – I mean all sorts of thoughts went through 
my head, you know was this a trap, what were they 
wanting, I had already turned them down, are they going to 
kill me you know because here I am in a place, nobody 
knows, because I had told my family I am going to Marro 
10 
Lodge, you know would they find me, those – so all those 
things go through your head when you sitting there and I 
had Mr Zuma sitting on my right hand side and it is like 
okay you know just get out of here.   
          And if you read my testimony you will see that I 
describe Ajay Gupta sitting there in an old T-shirt and a 
tracksuit and bare feet and that just made me even more 
angry that – and he was unshaven very slovenly and I am 
thinking this man is sitting here and thinking that he owns 
the country the way that he was speaking.  They – he was 
20 
quite dismissive after that he spoke to Mr Essa and once 
again in vernacular and he just you know he took his hand 
and just dismissed me like that and he walked me out to 
the door Mr Essa and I just walked away.  I tried to get 
away as fast as possible, got into my car and went home.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 126 of 224 
 
It took me quite a while to process what had happened.  I 
really did not speak to anybody about it until I spoke much 
later to my attorneys as to what was going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka I know you wanted to come to 
this meeting but I want to be clear about the other 
meetings as well.        
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no Chair that is perfectly in order 
with me because that covers – it kills many birds with one 
stone if I may say so.  Ms Daniels the meetings you had 
particularly after the second meeting where Mr Madsella 
10 
Gugu[?] asked you to go with him to Melrose Arch you say 
and you were simply made to sit outside the boardroom 
where they have a meeting.  Did you not – this is early 
2017 at the time you are the company secretary in 2017.     
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I was also acting head of legal.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, company secretary and acting head 
of legal.  Now that is fairly two senior positions and you 
are accountable to the board as a company secretary you 
attend board meetings.  You have been working at least 
until that point directly for – when I say working you have 
20 
been working in the office of Dr Ben Ngubane.  Ja, your 
yes’s will have to be recorded.     
MS DANIELS:   Oh my apologies yes that is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, do you tell the board about this 
thing? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 127 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:    Mr Chairman at that point in time I did not 
believe that the board was bona fide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is around early 2017? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are saying that you did not believe 
at that time that the board was bona fide? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue Mr…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What do you mean by that? 
MS DANIELS:   From about late 2016 there were a number 
10 
of incidents that – well more particularly it started with the 
Public Protectors report where the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The State of Capture Report?  
MS DANIELS:   The State of Capture Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was released at the end of 
October 2016.  
MS DANIELS:   I think it – yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS DANIELS:   I had – the board had received a summons 
in respect of appearing before the Public Protector. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is prior to the reports? 
MS DANIELS:   Prior to the report being…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja – being made, released.  
MS DANIELS:   Unfortunately it was a very short space of 
time and we did motivate for an extension of time but what 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 128 of 224 
 
the previous Public Protector did ask for were the conflict 
of interest registers which I was the custodian, my office 
was the custodian of.  So we had – you know the registers 
for each meeting.  I then compiled that for the Public 
Protector and it was through that that we – the first signs 
of the conflict, the various conflicts of the people were 
then exposed.   
          And I had released those reports, those documents 
to the Public Protector without informing the board.  Now 
my reasoning for doing that was firstly I had been 
10 
summons by the Public Protector so I really did not have 
any reason to explain to the board why I was doing that 
because I was compelled by law to do that.  Secondly I felt 
that these were real time records so once you completed it 
there was no need to change it.   
          You know it was at each meeting and there was 
regularly - when you as a director had to update your 
records you would inform me and I would ask at each 
meeting if there were changes.  So for me there was no 
need to actually ask permission and I gave that to the 
20 
Public Protector.  So it came out obviously in the report the 
difference and I think from that moment the tension 
between myself and the board escalated because many of 
the board members, the implicated board members were 
extremely irate that I had not asked permission and I said I 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 129 of 224 
 
did not need permission these were company records you 
know.  So that was the beginning of that kind of tension.  It 
escalated with issues such as bank accounts being frozen, 
where one of the board members actually – there was a 
meeting where the Minister was called, Minister Lynn 
Brown was called.   
          She in fact was on a telephone conference where 
the board members were complaining that their bank 
accounts were being investigated and that they were being 
declared politically exposed persons etcetera.  And it was 
10 
at that point that she came on the call, there was a 
decision that she you know she would assist where if 
possible and I am not quite sure how that meeting ended 
but subsequent to that meeting that very day one of the 
board directors called me and said to me that she was 
extremely angry because her accounts – I think it was 
Nedbank was threatening to freeze her accounts.   
          And she said to me that if these people think that I 
am going down alone they have another thing coming this 
board is owned – everybody knows that this board is a 
20 
Gupta board and I will make sure that everybody knows.  
Ja, and I should…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which member of the board said that to 
you?                          
MS DANIELS:   Do I have to…[intervene] 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 130 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was about to ask the same question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No I am saying to her I was about to 
ask the same question, Chair.  Your microphone is off 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, if it is a matter that in respect of 
which no 33 notice has been sent out she can tell me next 
time but she must tell me at some stage.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no 33 notice that has gone out?  
10 
MS DANIELS:   No.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No we do not…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   She has not told us the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Do not tell me now but 
you will tell me next time.   
MS DANIELS:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright so one of the board 
members said that to you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, and I was actually quite speechless.  I 
20 
– she ended the call and she phoned me back I think it 
must have been about an hour later and said…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now; it is still that same meeting 
Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 131 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you are talking about.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   She’s – no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Go back to the meeting that Mr Seleka 
asked you about.   
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Mr 
Chairman 
I 
am 
responding 
to…[intervene]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   My question.  
MS DANIELS:   Mr Seleka’s question as to why did I not go 
to the board. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to?  
MS DANIELS:   Why did I not go to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay alright, ja.   
MS DANIELS:   And so unfortunately now it has taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then respond to that first.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shall we rather go to the meeting.  So 
I had asked you the question after your second encounter 
with Mr Koko and Mr Essa where you were taken to 
Melrose Arch.  They leave you outside the boardroom, they 
go into a boardroom meeting.  Why did you not – well I 
20 
said did you raise the issue with the board.  Your answer 
was no because at that time the board…[intervene]      
MS DANIELS:   Well, I did not trust the board any longer.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So and you were going on to explain 
why.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 132 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   And that is why I was explaining, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, let us accelerate the 
– to what I believe is the fourth meeting and this – my 
assessment is that this meeting it gives us the connection 
between Mr Salim Essa and the Gupta’s.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes, when you talk about the fourth 
meeting I assume you talking about the July meeting.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is late July meeting where 
you have described you are behind Melrose Arch, the 
10 
townhouses, the apartment and so on. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that establishes a connection 
between the two? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we know now that they working 
together? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I did not follow your narration – 
you were called by Mr Salim Essa.  Is that what you said? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct Mr Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where are you when he calls you? 
MS DANIELS:   I was either at home or…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or at work?  
MS DANIELS:   No, I was not at work.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 133 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were not at work.  So would this 
have been over a weekend?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, this was over the weekend.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Over the weekend, so he calls you and 
you oblige? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You go to Melrose Arch.  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, at the African Pride Hotel.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   African Pride? 
MS DANIELS:   Hotel.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hotel.  Well the obvious question 
follows why did you go?  
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman as I earlier alluded to I was 
actually morbidly curious at this point; this was the 
same…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Daniels you could not have gone 
there out of curiosity no, you could not.   
MS DANIELS:   Let me explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean this is the man that told you in 
2015 about executives that he said would be suspended 
20 
and you were shocked because he is not part of Eskom.  
And upon your version Mr Koko could not explain why he 
brought you there, you were unhappy about that and now 
you say about two years later he calls you over a weekend 
you agreed to go where he wants you to go because you 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 134 of 224 
 
are curious.  
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chairman remember I told you 
about the meeting in the parking lot at the fuel station. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS DANIELS:   At that meeting he had offered me 
R800million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All the more reason why you should not 
have nothing to do with him and you say after that, after he 
has offered you R800million, corruption.  You say he called 
you over a weekend, you agreed to go and meet him 
10 
because you are curious.   
MS DANIELS:   Well I found it quite astounding that 
someone that I had turned down so flatly…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   I say I found it quite astounding that 
someone that I had turned down so flatly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You should not be wanting to talk to that 
person after that Ms Daniels.  You should not be wanting to 
take his calls after he has offered you R800million to do 
something wrong.  You should not be wanting to talk to that 
20 
person, you should not be taking his calls.  If you had his 
number, you have saved his number you should block his 
number.  Is it not?  So what are you doing going to meet 
with him over a weekend, out of curiosity?     
MS DANIELS:   I really was you know curious sir because I 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 135 of 224 
 
could not understand why would he want to have anything 
to do with me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Yes, and Ms Daniels 
you go there – well I said to you this morning that one will 
find it strange that this people kept on calling you to this 
meeting’s.  Either they believed that you were with them or 
either they knew that or that they really trusted you as one 
of their confidants.  How do you clear that?    
MS DANIELS:   Well like I said earlier I had – I did not 
10 
participate in…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not what? 
MS DANIELS:   I say I did not participate in the Saxonwold 
visits.  I was not offered bags of cash or provided with 
bags of cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were offered…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were offered.  
MS DANIELS:   Well that was late 2017 Mr Chairman, it 
was a different time.  In my view it was more an act of 
desperation, their bank accounts were being frozen.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that make any difference?   
MS DANIELS:   Well for me the timing of it you know was 
just an act of desperation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that make any difference to the 
fact that that was corruption?   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 136 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Well I did not accept it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in offering you if that is true 
that was corruption.  In offering you that money in order for 
you to do wrong.  Was it not?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So does the fact that they were making 
this offer in desperation make any difference?   
MS DANIELS:   No, that does not make any difference but 
in the context because I mean the reasoning for the bribe 
was really to help get Matshela Koko to be chief executive 
10 
officer of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you had then, you had some 
understanding of why they were offering you R800million?  
MS DANIELS:   That is what he said at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you could understand what they 
were doing?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is what he said.  
CHAIRPERSON:   They wanted to get Mr Koko to be CEO? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes and Mr Essa said well I had promised 
Mr Koko well he said I had promised Matshela that he 
20 
would be CEO.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is Mr Essa saying that? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Essa is saying that and that is when I 
said well that is one promise you will not be able to keep.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 137 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  So this 
meeting to which you were called by Mr Essa himself 
directly which means he has your telephone number, he 
could access you.  Correct?   
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not block his number?  
MS DANIELS:   I did after the July meeting.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not prior to that? 
MS DANIELS:   No.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say the discussion was about Mr 
10 
Brian Molefe’s case.  Which case was that? 
MS DANIELS:   It was the pension matter.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the pension pay out to him? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Do you know whether what was 
said about they will try to get somebody in the office of the 
Deputy Judge President whether they acted upon that? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   What you are not aware, you are not 
sure you – did you come to know about it? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   It was much later but not – Mr Chair much 
later one of my colleagues told me that the DPJ actually 
did institute an investigation in his office based on the 
testimony that I gave in parliament.  He did investigate but 
I 
am 
not 
sure, 
if 
I 
understand 
what 
you 
asking 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 138 of 224 
 
if…[intervene]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whether there was interference for 
lack of a better word.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know whether there was 
interference?  
MS DANIELS:   No, I do not know.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ja, I see in your affidavit 
you talk about in paragraph 30 of the affidavit about 
political interference.  I was quite use to the amount of 
10 
political interference and lobbying behind the scenes.  
Would you like to enlighten the Commission what is being 
referred to there as political interference?   
MS DANIELS:   Yes please just repeat the paragraph for 
me.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 30, page 7, at the top of 
page 7.   
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman from – I joined Eskom in 2006 
and from inception there was quite a contestation around 
procurement matters and just general interference in the 
20 
day to day running of the utility.  My first experience of that 
was with the old order mining rights that Eskom had 
acquired.  As Eskom it had old order mining rights which 
when the new laws came into being that needed to be 
converted and as I was in primary energy I was tasked with 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 139 of 224 
 
coordinating 
and 
preparing 
those 
applications 
for 
conversion of mining rights. 
          It was a significant amount of mining rights, it would 
– and this is my personal belief, it would because they 
were coal mining rights it would have given Eskom access 
to its own coal mines and it would have alleviated a lot of 
the coal issues that we now experience as a country.  
However, 
we 
went 
through 
a 
series 
of 
you 
know 
applications that I together with the then chief executive 
officer I think it was first Mr Maroga and then Mr Davis we 
10 
went through having to submit these applications to the 
DMR. 
 
Then 
known 
as 
the 
Department 
of 
Mineral 
Resources and at that stage I think I was on the eve of 
submitting the documents for consideration when I was told 
not to submit those documents as a political solution would 
be found to those issues.   
          Those mining rights ended up in the hands of 
private companies and Eskom began the fight of trying to 
get them back with no avail.  There was also then an 
unofficial policy statements that Eskom cannot own a mine.  
20 
So that was one of my first experiences of political 
interference on the parts of the shareholder as I call it.  
There were also others when there were – in procurement 
when there were tenders we were told you know so and so 
is behind it follow process make sure that you do this.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 140 of 224 
 
          I recall in 2011 specifically I was asked to put 
together a list of the top hundred suppliers of Eskom 
together with their contact details and the person at the 
company because the Minister wanted to do an ANC fund 
raising campaign.  I still have that database but you know I 
was asked to prepare it and it was handed to the Minister.  
Further things like there were instructions to the board 
around not following the public finance not the Public 
Finance Managing Act the PPFA.  Eskom had an exemption 
to 
the 
triple, 
which 
is 
the 
Preferential 
Procurement 
10 
Framework Act.  It was due to expire Minister Gigaba and 
Minister Gordhan on the last could not agree on the 
extension because Minister Gigaba was Public Enterprises 
and Minister Gordhan was the Minister of Finance.   
          So on the eve of the expiration of the exemption we 
get a notice that says the exemption is no longer valid, will 
not be extended.  Minister Gigaba tells the board do not 
follow the instruction, us as officials say you cannot do 
that that is breaking the law, he get the board in that 
tussle.  And there are many more examples of that kind of 
20 
interference in the granting of tenders.  The first nuclear 
tender for – was also the parties were going to sign, 
Minister Gigaba says no we will not, you will not sign it.   
          The parties were actually at the signing ceremony.  
There was quite a lot of that kind of interference from the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 141 of 224 
 
Ministry; from various political parties. The Chairman would 
get lots of you know meet with this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  So what I am saying is I had always – we had 
always get instructed when you get this kind of instruction 
follow process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Do not waiver follow process.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry who would have told you that? 
MS DANIELS:  Whoever my boss was at the time? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So would Mr Dan Marokane have told you 
that? 
MS DANIELS:  It was still… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because he was once your boss as well? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  So we would – you know make sure that 
we have – we follow the process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but answer my question.  Would – 
would Mr Dan Marokane have said that to you? 
MS DANIELS:  He had on occasion yes because we had 
some interference. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay but you know like the Chairperson 
has been pointing out some of these things do not appear in 
your affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:  Um the affidavit was about – I am – 
suspensions and .. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 142 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because they will have to be notified 
about these things so that they can respond to it.  So I think 
Chair if I may propose to the witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You may have to do an affidavit 
elaborating on those –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Those political interferences. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that it can be served on the… 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the relevant – affected parties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But Ms Daniels what we see from the 
documentation we went through this morning is that if you 
talking political interference there is more than just political 
interference.  If regard is to be had to the newspaper – the 
resolution regarding the newspaper houses City Press, 
Sunday Times and Mail and Guardian then came from 
20 
outside to the Board sent to Mr Ben Ngubane; it becomes a 
resolution of the Board.  That is another interference is it 
not? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.  That – that 
interference took … 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 143 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is like somebody outside of the Board 
is effective in controlling what the Board – decisions the 
Board may or should take in regard to those newspapers. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   And he said this is the position you 
must take and they adopt that position. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You would know I have not referred you 
to it but I – I did refer you to when Dr Ngubane testified.  It 
10 
is an email Mr Koko receives about the guarantee which was 
firstly a pre-payment R1.68 billion regarding Tegeta to be 
paid to Tegeta.  And there is an email that from Mr Koko 
rather from Businessman to Mr Koko then Mr Koko forwards 
you that email.  Recall that email that talked about the 
guarantee? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You recall that.  That too came from 
Businessman into Eskom through Mr Koko through you 
ultimately made its way – was it the Board or the BTC? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  It was the Investment and Finance Committee 
and then the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then the Board. 
MS DANIELS:  yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So there too it is an indication of an 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 144 of 224 
 
interference from outside? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this Board was being controlled by 
outside forces if you like in inverted commas – outside 
persons – persons outside of Eskom?  Whether it be Mr 
Richard Seleke he is outside of Eskom; whether it is Salim 
Essa he is outside of Eskom and they were writing these 
emails putting proposals together and feeding them to the 
Board.  You follow? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was a control from outside? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And certainly in relation to the email that 
contained the – a draft of what position the Board should 
take with regard to the City Press, Sunday Times and the 
Mail and Guardian the Chairperson did not take exception to 
this whole thing that somebody from outside is sending him a 
draft of what the Board should – what position the Board 
should take, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not object to that? 
MS DANIELS:  No he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instead he said you – you must prepare a 
resolution based on that draft? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 145 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And in addition to that if – if your 
information – your testimony is go by the evidence you 
testified with the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee it is in 
your statement; it is in your affidavit that on the 10 March 
you were at Melrose Arch when you are being told four 
executives names are mentioned are going to be suspended.  
Again an indication of outside interference? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  It is more than outside interference it 
10 
is outside control is it not? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chairman I would just like to also add 
that you know in the beginning I – I did not quite believe that 
three brothers would control the state in the manner that 
they did.  That would be coming clearer as we go along.  As I 
went along in my journey.  And that is precisely why I started 
speaking to the media firstly anonymously because I was not 
sure you know there was such an element of mistrust at 
work.  I did speak to my colleagues but because of that 
atmosphere that you did not know who was loyal to who it 
20 
was very difficult to speak to the people inside.  Even – even 
matters that were you know sort of reported to the whistle 
blowing line.  The executives would know who they were 
talking about.  You know that would become knowledge. So 
that line was not very secure.  I started anonymously talking 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 146 of 224 
 
to some of the journalists in the beginning because I really 
did not know where to – to take the information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Why did you not resign from Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:  It was – it was very difficult.  I did approach 
the – the recruitment agencies.  The fact that I had worked 
at Eskom was a blight on my record.  So that made it 
difficult.  I was also – I am a single parent so it was not that 
easy just to walk out of a job and not have a job. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
MS DANIELS:  So I think those were the - you know the 
10 
compelling what shall I say the competing interest at the 
time for me.  But it was quite a difficult terrain to master – to 
muster because most of the people you know just ignored 
what – what you were – what one would say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  In – internally.  And it would only become 
clearer 
later 
that 
there 
were 
– 
stake 
– 
they 
were 
stakeholders so interested. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For interested parties. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 Interested 
parties in 
– in 
what 
was 
20 
happening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  And that made it difficult. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry interested parties what?  Interested 
parties within Eskom or outside of Eskom or both? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 147 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  It would be both. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay let us go to the suspension of the 
executives because they are suspended on the 11 November 
and you as I understand from your affidavit were not part of 
the meetings that led to their suspensions? 
MS DANIELS:  No I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were – you attended the one of the 
9t h March did you not? 
MS DANIELS:  No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought I read something – I read 
10 
your – oh maybe I misread [mumbling].  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  No, no.  Mr Chairman what you... 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it was somebody else’s in here. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  What you would have read is that 
maybe just for a point of clarification.  When I became 
Company Secretary those minutes had not been signed for a 
year.  So myself and the Board Secretary had to work 
through those and we prepared them for the Board – for the 
2015 for want of a better word.  And it was – and that is why 
it took so long for those minutes to be signed because we 
20 
had to listen to all of the tapes.  We had to then – I had 
prepared a plaque for each Board Member to make sure that 
they could tell us that what was in those minutes because we 
were not present.  So I think you – the reason I refer to them 
in my affidavit is because I did read them. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 148 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you had the – you had access to the 
audios of those meetings? 
MS DANIELS:  Some of them yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja well let us talk about the minutes 
which are being referred to here the 9 March 2011 and then 
the minutes – the meetings of 11 March 20 – oh I said 2011 I 
beg your pardon 2015.  Well the commission has obtained 
audios of those minutes – of those meetings so you would 
also have had access to them? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Ja … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you would have – you would have 
listened to that. 
MS DANIELS:  Ja at Eskom.  I split it between myself and 
the Board Secretary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ja okay.  Now that you have raised 
that let me ask you.  Do you know why the minutes would not 
have been constructed a week after the meeting took place? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman that period was… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No let – just answer my question.  Do 
20 
you know yes or no? 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do not know? 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Why they would not have been 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 149 of 224 
 
constructed? 
MS DANIELS:  Why – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Within a week after the meeting took 
place? 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So you had to do that exercise a 
year later. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The minutes are signed by Dr Ngubane. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You would have – he would have had to 
ensure that those minutes what you bring to him as a draft 
minutes which he has to sign is a correct reflection of what 
took place in the meeting? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct but the process was even 
more detailed than that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja tell the Chairperson. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman what we did was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We compiled – once we – once we had – 
20 
there were draft minutes so once we had put them together 
in the necessary format each Board Member received a pack 
and each Board Member was given the opportunity to 
comment on whether we had correctly captured those 
minutes.  And once that had been done I then prepared a 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 150 of 224 
 
pack for Mr – Dr Ngubane and it was actually first approved 
at one of the Board meetings before he signed them off. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  You have spoken in – well 
stated in your affidavit that in the morning of 11 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Seleka.  Okay please 
continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  In the morning of 11 
March 2015 Mr Koko called you in rapid succession and one 
of the things he spoke with you about or rather raised with 
you was the concerns that you have called two people and 
10 
he was asking you why did you speak to them? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes he did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  One being your friend and the other one 
being – he said the Frenchman. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But you know I have – we have 
obtained the telephone record between you and him in which 
we see that there is a telephone call from him to you the 
evening before – the night before in three minutes before 
ten.  And I was curious to know you did not mention anything 
20 
about that and him at least that night questioning you about 
who you were speaking to on your way back home.  Do you 
think you have an explanation for that? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman I – I do not recall speaking to 
him about the conversations but that happened the next 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 151 of 224 
 
morning.  But it was very possible that he would have called 
me at that time.  He had no respect for personal boundaries 
and personal time.  So I – I do not recall exactly what that – 
what that call would have been about but it was definitely not 
about the you know the – the telephone call.  What I can – if 
I look back at that day the most important types of things 
were like he was trying to finish off certain transactions and 
more than likely they would have pertained to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And Ms Daniels there is an 
occasion or for lack of a better word immediately after the 
10 
suspension of the executives where you talk about you 
meeting with Dr Pat Naidoo.  Can you tell the Chairperson a 
little bit about that what – who called – how you meet with Dr 
Naidoo.  Who is firstly who is Dr Pat Naidoo? 
MS DANIELS:  Dr Pat Naidoo is one of the Board Members – 
was one of the Board Members at the time.  He was also the 
Chairperson of the Build Recovery and… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You deal with it in paragraph 42 to 46 of 
your affidavit. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
Build 
Recovery 
and 
Build 
Program 
20 
Committee.  So I was called to a meeting with him.  He 
asked to see me and he wanted to know what would be the 
process to appoint Mr Nick Linnell.  He said that… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So which day is this?  Sorry. 
MS DANIELS:  This was on the 13 March 2015. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 152 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Carry on. 
MS DANIELS:  So I explained the process to Dr Naidoo in 
terms of we would need to if you request for a quotation or a 
request for a proposal.  Dr Naidoo listened and seemed to be 
a bit impatient about the process because for me my 
impression was that they had already appointed Mr Linnell 
and now needed to regularise the process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was that your impression? 
MS DANIELS:  That was my impression. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What did he – did he convey to you that 
10 
they were already engaging – the Board was already 
engaging with Mr Linnell. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes he did and he did say that to me.  In fact 
you will see in paragraph 43 I think he had said the Board 
had acquired the services of Mr Nick Linnell. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you recall or not whether Mr Linnell 
was every formerly appointed by the Board? 
MS DANIELS:  I – I did not see a formal letter of 
appointment Mr Chairman but what I do know is that I was 
called upon to cancel the contract for Mr Linnell. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were called upon to cancel Mr 
Linnell’s contract? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you recall when about was this? 
MS DANIELS:  This was late April I think.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 153 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What 2015? 
MS DANIELS:  It was in 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you looking for a document? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I am just looking for SMD3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  SMD3 is on page 32.  Page 32/33.   
MS DANIELS:  Mr Linnell’s letter is dated the 14 April Mr 
Chairman so it would have been around – it would have been 
subsequent to that letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So SMD3 is an annexure to your 
affidavit.  The document is a letter dated 14 April 2015 from 
10 
the Project Office Business Improvement Delivery.  It is 
signed on the face of it what appears to be by Mr Nick 
Linnell resignation as director. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that the document you were referring 
to? 
MS DANIELS:  That is the document I am referring to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the letter is addressed to acting 
Chairperson Dr Baldwin Sipho Ngubane Eskom SOE 
“Dear 
Chairperson. 
 
 
Appointment 
of 
20 
Coordinator of the Eskom Inquiry.” 
Two options Ms Daniels I could read the letter or you could 
give the Chairperson the gist of what is contained in the 
letter? 
MS DANIELS:  I could give the gist if that suits the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 154 of 224 
 
Chairman; I am not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja what is Mr Nick Linnell writing about 
in this letter? 
MS DANIELS:  What Mr Linnell is writing about in this letter 
is the attendances that he did on behalf of the Board in 
setting up the inquiry and in participating and being part of 
the meetings.  He was – he was also to draw up the Terms of 
Reference for the inquiry that was to follow.  And then it later 
– I think it appeared in the newspapers that he was no 
longer going to be coordinating and that is when he wrote 
10 
this letter to the acting Chairperson Dr Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So in the last two paragraphs of his letter 
he writes? 
“It is clear from written correspondence and 
public statements that the Board appointed 
me to fulfil this role.  It is now also apparent 
from the media reports that the Board has 
since allegedly terminated that appointment.  
In the circumstances I would be grateful if 
you would advise me of the position of the 
20 
Board with regard to my appointment and if 
my services have as publicly stated been 
summarily terminated how the Board would 
like me to account for my services rendered.  
Yours sincerely.” 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 155 of 224 
 
What did you want to tell the Chairperson about this?  Oh 
you were – you were talking about you had to – you were 
called upon to terminate. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  His – his contract or his appointment. 
MS DANIELS:  Subsequently. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Subsequently yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes based on that. He did issue an invoice to 
Eskom and Eskom paid it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how much was that are you able to 
remember? 
MS DANIELS:  I think it was in the region of about 
R160 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair I think we have that invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the bundle somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ms Daniels the next issue or the 
20 
next aspect where you feature is in regard to the exit 
negotiations.  You called an exit negotiations of the – of the 
executives.  And you say you attended some of the meetings 
the – the delegation that the Board had mandated to have 
settlement discussions with the executives had. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 156 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you find that in the relevant 
paragraphs in your affidavit? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that was paragraph 56. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now are you aware or not that Dr 
Ngubane had also been authorised by the Board to attend at 
the CCMA in regard to the labour dispute of Mr Matona?  If 
you do not know you do not know? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I actually am aware that he had to 
attend. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  My recollection may be inaccurate Mr 
Seleka.  I got the impression that what he said that is Dr 
Ngubane when he gave evidence that he gone to the CCMA 
on his own and not because he was representing the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was my impression. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair you are correct.  That is what he 
said before the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And we were pursuing that issue with him 
20 
because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And we will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and I think I – I do recall that I think 
Mr Matona said Dr Ngubane was part of the Board’s 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 157 of 224 
 
delegation or representatives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the negotiations with him 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that I think Dr Ngubane when he gave 
evidence seemed to deny that.  I hope I am – my recollection 
is accurate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is absolutely accurate Chair and it is 
an issue – Chair you will find – can I give you the page 
reference? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In Dr Ngubane’s bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well no, no it is even in – yes it is even 
in this bundle Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us do that.  Chair you can read it so 
that you clarify if – you clear your mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I will not read it now but if you tell me 
that it is there that is enough for me. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because that is my recollection that 
he… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Said he went to the CCMA. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 158 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On his own he was not representing the 
Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that he said he was not involved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the negotiations with Mr Matona. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I just read through his statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It says he says: 
10 
“Whilst the inquiry was pending Mr Matona 
had filed a labour dispute.  Following the 
conclusion of the inquiry Matona negotiated 
and settled the dispute.  Prior to that – that 
is paragraph 4.29 of his affidavit – prior to 
that I had been tasked by the Board to attend 
the CCMA proceedings which Mr Matona had 
instituted against Eskom.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh then my recollected was incorrect. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No your recollection is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja in terms of what he said on the witness 
stand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you reading from his affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From his affidavit before us – so his 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 159 of 224 
 
admission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So his affidavit says he was tasked by the 
Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He says that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To go to the CCMA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the witness stand he said he went 
there on his own.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Your recollection is perfect Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Ms Susan – Ms Daniels I should not 
have read that statement to you but you already say you 
know that he was – what did you say Ms Daniels? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she said she – you asked the question 
whether she was aware that the Board had asked if Dr 
Ngubane to attend the CCMA and she said yes.  But you 
must tell me if I misunderstood you? 
MS DANIELS:  I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is not what you intended saying. 
MS DANIELS:  I am not sure Mr Chairman I – if my memory 
20 
serves me correctly he also had to depose to the affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where? 
MS DANIELS:  In the Matona matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us clear this first.  Did you say you 
were aware that he had been tasked by the Board or did you 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 160 of 224 
 
say you were not aware of that but you were aware that he 
did go to the CCMA? 
MS DANIELS:  He did go to – I was aware that he went to 
CCMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But whether he was asked by the 
board or not? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did you know? 
MS DANIELS:   That I am not sure of at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, thank you. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I understand Dr Ngubane will tell us... 
he has already told us himself.  So but you are then 
involved... not involved but you are invited into settlement or 
exist, you called them, negotiations that the delegation... the 
delegation, as we understand it, is Dr Ngubane.  And you 
can confirm that.  Dr Ngubane, Mr Romeo Khumalo and Ms 
Venete Klein. 
 
And in respect of, I think, Mr Dan Marokane, Mr 
20 
Zethembe 
Khoza 
and 
Mr 
Romeo 
Khumalo 
were 
the 
delegation. 
MS DANIELS:   The board appointed Ms Klein, Mr Khumalo, 
Dr Ngubane and Mr Khosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As the delegation. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 161 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   As the delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I did not hear the first one? 
MS DANIELS:   Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Khumalo 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Khoza as the delegation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The delegation, ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was a delegation of four? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  One, two, three.... yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And were they meant to engage in 
the negotiations with all the executives who had been 
suspended? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you in the meeting when the 
delegation was appointed? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not think I was in the meeting that was 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   But what I do know is because I had to deal 
with them ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   They have testified as well. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 162 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That they were... well, only two.  So you 
know because you had to deal with them. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You attended the meetings when the 
negotiations took place. 
MS DANIELS:   I attended the meetings.  I also... I took 
notes at the meetings.  I also had to arrange the meetings 
and I, in some instances, I liaised with the suspended 
executives to get them to the meeting. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So let us deal with Mr Matona, for 
instance, by way of example.  So when you say you had to 
arrange the meetings, you would have called him and said to 
him:  We have this date, this time, this place for a meeting to 
discuss.... would you say also what to be discussed... what 
was to be discussed? 
MS DANIELS:   I would not at that stage would have told him 
what were to be discussed but I... Mr Chairman, but I would 
have told him that the board delegation would like to meet 
with him. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you said they met at Protea Hotel in 
Midrand. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was a neutral ground off... away from 
Megawatt Park.  So I arranged it at... yes, the Protea Hotel 
in Midrand. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 163 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  What do you recall was the 
discussion with him? 
MS DANIELS:   I would have to... can I refer to my...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Before you get there.  In 
paragraph 
54 
of 
your 
affidavit, 
you 
say 
the 
board 
emphasised that this would not alter the fact that he would 
remain on suspension.  I think they are talking about Mr 
Matona there.   
 
And then you say it was Dr Ben Ngubane and Mr Romeo 
10 
Khumalo who were mandated to meet with Mr Matona on 29 
April 2015 to discuss the matter of his suspension.   
 
So here it looks like you are saying only two board 
members were mandated to discuss with Mr Matona. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chair.  What they did as a group, 
they would decide who would talk to whom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The group of four? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They then divided the job amongst 
themselves? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say who of them would meet with who 
in terms of the executives? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  And then you say in the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 164 of 224 
 
next sentence: 
“At this point, it was clear that the board was no 
really 
considering 
the 
option 
of 
the 
term 
of 
executives involved with their public utterances.” 
 
You see that statement? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that true? 
MS DANIELS:   That is, from what I witnessed Mr Chairman, 
there was absolutely no intention of those executives 
returning.  Well, for ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the basis for you to come to that 
conclusion? 
MS DANIELS:   The manner in which the discussions were 
conducted, except for the... there was a mark change when 
they dealt with Matshela Koko but for the three executives, 
Mr Matona, Ms Molefe and Mr Marokane, there was a totally 
different tone and posture in terms of how they would deal 
with it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you talking about tone at the meetings 
that the representatives of this group of four had with those 
20 
individual executives? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I thought that this... I understood 
the statement to relate to one board and to relate to 
something that would have happened before the delegation 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 165 of 224 
 
could meet with the executives.   
 
It gives the impression that even before the delegation 
met with the executives individually.  You are saying that it 
was clear that the board was not really considering the 
option of the executives coming back.  That is how I 
understand it.  Is that ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   That is what I am seeking to convey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   Based on... I... it is in my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Because 
at 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
23rd of April 2015 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a meeting of the board? 
MS DANIELS:   That is the meeting of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS DANIELS:   Which there are no recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the meeting where the board 
mandated the four to be the ones to negotiate with the 
executives? 
MS DANIELS:   I think that happened earlier if I recall. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but there was a meeting of the board 
on the 23rd of April? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 166 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say it was clear to you, it was 
clear on that day that the board was no really considering 
the option of the return of these executives? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and what is the basis for you to have 
come to that conclusion?  Because you cannot, obviously, 
rely for that on what happened subsequently when the 
delegation met with the executives.   
 
What is it that had happened or that was happening at 
the time of that meeting of the 23 rd of April 2015 that made 
10 
you believe that the board was not going to entertain the 
return of these executives? 
MS DANIELS:   I have my handwritten notes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...from the meeting of that date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   I have made available...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it notes that you have made at the 
meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   At the meeting.  Contemporises notes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, contemporaneous notes.  Okay are 
those 
notes, 
you 
have 
not 
previously 
given 
to 
the 
Commission? 
MS DANIELS:   I have provided it yesterday, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 167 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   I have provided it yesterday but we have 
spoken about it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It may well be Mr Seleka that it is 
something she can deal with next time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when they have had a chance to have 
a look at those notes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then, when you come back, one of the 
questions you can deal with is, what was the basis for you to 
say that it was clear that the board did not contemplate that 
the executives will come back.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Ms Daniels, then let us rather go into 
the meetings where there are settlement discussions and you 
are present at some meetings, you say you have arranged.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka.  Did you say Ms 
20 
Daniels there are no recordings for the meeting of the 
23rd of April? 
MS DANIELS:   That is what I am led to understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is what you were made to understand? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 168 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  And minutes, that would be there? 
MS DANIELS:   There are minutes of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   But from my notes, it seems that this was an 
in-committee meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright. 
MS DANIELS:   I was not the company secretary at that 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja okay. 
MS DANIELS:   I took notes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now, I was certainly going to go to 
that point Chair because the minutes what on the face of it 
appears to be the minutes has been attached by Ms Daniels.   
 
There are certain things that Ms Daniels state in her 
affidavit that are not apparent from those minutes.   
20 
 
Hence, she has then only yesterday emailed, scanned 
and emailed copies of what she says are handwritten notes.  
So we are here to deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Thank you, Chair.  So but, I mean, 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 169 of 224 
 
similarly, there will be not minutes of this next meetings we 
are going into. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, I understood from your 
affidavit that even though you attended meetings of three of 
the executives, you did not attend the meeting where the 
delegations met with Mr Dan Marokane. 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not attend the meeting with Mr 
10 
Marokane because that would have been a conflict of 
interest for me.  He was my boss and I have spoken to him 
about the suspensions.  My meeting with Salim Essa.  So I 
did not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at that time Mr Koko was no longer 
your immediate superior? 
MS DANIELS:   He was.  He was acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he was... because he was acting 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Acting ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...group 
CEO, 
he 
was 
therefore, 
temporarily, not your immediate superior? 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Koko was acting in 2015.  It is a 
complex... the organisation changed so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 170 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Marokane and I... he was my direct boss 
from twenty... I think it was 2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Until 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MS DANIELS:   So that is why I did not take part in any of 
this.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, I wanted you to explain that 
to the DCJ because earlier you mentioned that you attended 
10 
or maybe you gave the impression that you attended 
meetings of all four. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And I had asked a question:  What 
was in the meeting of Mr Matona, what was told to him? 
MS DANIELS:   I just want to get to my... I think the first 
expression to Mr Matona was that the court action did not sit 
well with the powers that be.  And I am quoting because I 
20 
wrote down exactly what was said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he spoke... when he gave evidence, 
he talked about the day when the CCMA hearing or meeting 
was postponed.  He said that the Eskom delegation said they 
wanted to consult with the shareholder or the minister.   
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 171 of 224 
 
 
And then he said there was subsequently a meeting... 
there was subsequently a meeting which he referred to as 
the first meeting and then another one later on.   
 
Now what you have just told me, does it relate to the day 
when the CCMA matter was postponed or does it relate to 
the one of the two meetings he talked about or some other 
meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   I think this is one of the two meetings that 
he spoke about, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   This one took place on the 4t h of May 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that have been what he called the 
first meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure if this would have been the 
first meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or from your perspective, was it the first 
meeting for the Eskom delegation to negotiate with him? 
MS DANIELS:   H’m.... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or are you not sure? 
MS DANIELS:   It is not clear from... it is not hundred 
20 
percent clear from the way I that I dotted my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS DANIELS:   There may have been discussion before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But was it the first one that you 
attended? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 172 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   The first one that I attended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So you said, what was the 
first point made or...? 
MS DANIELS:   The first one was that the court action did 
not sit well with the powers that be.  This ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Who said that? 
MS DANIELS:   This was said by Mr Romeo Khumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  And please 
carry on Ms Daniels. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   They then, mister... as I said in my affidavit, 
Mr Khumalo then outlined a framework of a proposal to Mr 
Matona and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Outlined what? 
MS DANIELS:   Sort of a framework of a proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   To Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   And the proposal included a payment by 
Eskom...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Let us just get this right.  Who 
was... who were at this meeting?  You were there, Mr Romeo 
Khumalo is there, Mr Matona was there.  Who else was 
there? 
MS DANIELS:   Let me just check.  I am just going to check 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 173 of 224 
 
my notes if you do not mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, Ms Daniels your affidavits, you are 
starting with this at paragraph 57. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay this would be Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Khumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   And Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay and yourself? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your role?  Was it to advise the 
delegation on legal matters or what? 
MS DANIELS:   No, at that stage what Dr Ngubane wanted 
me to do was to take notes when he was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DANIELS:   You will recall that he testified that he was 
going to employee engagement meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So he ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so you ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   So he did not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were at these meetings that we are 
talking about for negotiations with the executives at the 
request, at the instance of Dr Ngubane? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 174 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your task was to take notes? 
MS DANIELS:   Take notes, organise the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The logistics. 
MS DANIELS:   The logistics. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   So I would take instruction from either Dr 
Ngubane or Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright okay.  Continue.  The Romeo 
about the framework? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS DANIELS:   And what he was talking about was, you 
know, and from my notes it seems like there had been prior 
discussions because there was no commitment now to a 
specific role in government because they were talking about 
his transfer.   
 
The financial issue around what proposal they would 
give him and the messaging in terms of how would they 
communicate to the public.   
20 
 
And also, then did say the court action did not sit well 
with the powers to be and that one would have to deal with 
that, that matter.  Mr Matona then responded ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I just before you go there Ms 
Daniels?  Let us read your affidavit... these two paragraphs 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 175 of 224 
 
into the record.  That is paragraph 64 because they are 
significant.  Page 15 of your affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:   Do you want me to read it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will read it. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says: 
“That the delegation subsequently met with Mr 
Tshediso Matona on the same day.” 
 
Now... sorry, I have asked you out of sequence of your 
affidavit because you started with Ms Molefe on the 
10 
4t h of May and now you carry on and you say: 
“On the same day, the meeting with Mr Matona.” 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct.  It was the 4t h of May. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so the delegation does not go away.  
They wait for the next person to come. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, there were a series of meetings on the 
4th of May. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 4t h of May at the Protea Hotel. 
MS DANIELS:   At the Protea Hotel.  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it goes on to say: 
20 
“Mr Khumalo opened the discussion and emphasised 
that at that stage there was no commitment to a 
specific alternative role in government and that it 
would be considered.   
He emphasised that Mr Matona’s court action did not 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 176 of 224 
 
set well with the powers that be.  There appeared to 
have been prior discussion that I was not privy. 
Mr 
Khumalo 
then 
proceeded 
to 
outline 
the 
framework of a proposal to Mr Matona.  He stressed 
that 
Eskom 
was 
committed 
to 
managing 
the 
messaging together with Mr Matona so that his 
dignity and credibility, as well as the credibility of 
the board remained intact. 
The financial proposal included the payment by 
Eskom to the Government Employees Pension Fund 
10 
to secure Mr Matona’s full benefit as government 
employee. 
Since had been at Eskom for a relatively short time, 
it was confirmed that Eskom and the Department of 
Public Enterprises were working together to secure 
the full benefit to have him approved and reinstated. 
The prospect of another role in government was also 
mooted.   
Mr Matona requested that a formal proposal be 
tabled and that a further meeting be set out.” 
20 
 
And you are talking... then you go to the second meeting 
with Ms Molefe.   
 
So let us go to the meeting with Ms Molefe which is... 
which comes prior to this one.  In a nutshell – I know you set 
it out in your affidavit – what can you tell the Chairperson 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 177 of 224 
 
about that meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, Mr Chairman at this meeting, this one 
was led by Ms Klein and she very early on set the tone of the 
meeting by saying... explaining to Ms Molefe that this is the 
delegation that has been put together to talk to the 
executives.  And her question was:  How do we amicable find 
a solution?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Whose question? 
MS DANIELS:   Ms Klein to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Klein’s question to Ms Molefe. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   ...to Ms Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   To Ms Tsholofelo Molefe is, how do we find 
amicable find a solution.  Ms Molefe, obviously, responded 
by saying... you know, this was actually the first time that the 
board met with Ms Molefe or in fact communicated with her 
because she said there had been eight weeks of no 
communication.  And then Mr Khumalo took over and said in 
very direct English:   
“Without prejudice and reserving the rights of 
20 
Eskom, the terms of reference for the review were 
developed by the Audit and Risk Committee and that 
this was a separate discussion.” 
 
He went on to say: 
“Can we find a way of amicable parting ways?  The 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 178 of 224 
 
parties would like to avoid the legal angle on each 
side.  Would you consider a managed parting of the 
ways?  Would you be open to this discussion and 
also the public management thereof?” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how were you able to recall all these 
details? 
MS DANIELS:   I wrote my hand... these are my handwritten 
notes, Mr Chairman.  It is not that I have a super memory but 
I did write who said what and I did make these quotes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where does the notes that you would 
10 
have made available to Dr Ngubane? 
MS DANIELS:   You know Mr Chairman, Dr Ngubane actually 
did not ask for my notes if I recall now.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, because I understood that he was 
asking you to be present in those meetings in order to do 
exactly that, take notes so that you can provide him with... 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, if I look back now, he did not ask me for 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you offer them? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   I would have given him, you know, verbal 
feedback but I think because there was this delegation of the 
board in any event, that grouping spoke to each other. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, Ms Klein did say, she recall the 
words... what?... amicable.  Amicable or parting being 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 179 of 224 
 
mentioned or separation.  But, anyway, they will deal with 
what you are saying in due course.  So Ms Molefe, according 
to you, responds and essentially she required more time? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, she did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Matona gave evidence and said that at 
the first meeting he had with the Eskom delegation after the 
CCMA...  
 
After he had referred the matter to the CCMA and had 
been postponed, he said the delegation or one of the people 
on the Eskom delegation. 
10 
 
And I do not know if he said it was Mr Khumalo, but he 
said he was told that... well, one, he said he wanted to 
return to his job but he was told in no uncertain terms that 
that was off the table.   
 
Do you... that is what he has said.  And I think Ms Klein 
has denied that if I am not mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe she has not.  Do you... did he 
say that in any meeting that you attended, Mr Matona?  
That.. was that said?  The part that was said by him, did he 
20 
say it?   
 
And the part that he says was said by somebody from 
the Eskom delegation.  Did he say that he wanted to get 
back to his job? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Matona did say that he wanted his job 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 180 of 224 
 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did say that? 
MS DANIELS:   He did say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Was there a response? 
MS DANIELS:   But the response was, you know, the court 
action did not sit well.  So it was implied that they did not 
want him back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you were present at the meeting where 
Mr Matona said he wanted to get back to his job? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, he spoke about... at this meeting of the 
10 
4t h of May ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   He spoke about the impact that this had had 
on him and that he would want his job back.  But the 
discussion did not go that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you... do you remember or do you 
not remember anybody from the Eskom delegation saying:  
Gong back to your job is off the table or words to that effect. 
MS DANIELS:   Not at this meeting, Mr Chair.  It may 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember that? 
MS DANIELS:   It may have been at a previous meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   But certainly by the time it got to this 
meeting of the 4t h of May ...[intervenes]  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 181 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   ...it was not about returning to his job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, his evidence was that of the two 
meetings that he held with the Eskom delegation, it was in 
the first of the two meetings where he raised this issue of 
him going back to work.  
 
Then he said he was told in very clear terms that that 
was off the table, out of the question.  You say you do not 
remember hearing anybody saying that to him? 
MS DANIELS:   No, not from what I have written down. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   That I think was at a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Because here already the proposal is 
already in the formulation stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And then you 
attended Mr Matshela Koko’s meeting as well and you seek 
to convey that that meeting was different from the others in 
comparison? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   The meeting was markedly different to the 
others. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you get to that one, let us 
talk about where Ms Molefe was – the meeting with – in the 
Eskom delegation and Ms Molefe, did she talk about going 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 182 of 224 
 
back to work at all at her meeting with the Eskom 
delegation? 
MS DANIELS:   She – I think the first issue for her was 
that there had been no communication whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS DANIELS:   I think the first issue for Ms Molefe was 
that there had been no communication whatsoever so she 
did not have an understanding of where the inquiry was, 
what her position was, you know, she – the impression I 
got is that she did want to come back. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The impression you got was that she did 
want to go back? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was that based on what she said or 
was just your impression? 
MS DANIELS:   Just my impression at the time because 
this was actually – for her, the 4 May was the first meeting 
that she had actually spoken to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know what the attitude of 
the Eskom delegation was to the possibility of her going 
20 
back to work? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, it was at that meeting that they had 
already spoken about how do we find a solution for you to 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 183 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   So that is how the meeting started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did the solution necessarily exclude 
her going back to work? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you say that? 
MS DANIELS:   Because it said - what was asked to her 
was, can we find a way of amicably parting ways? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay and that came from the Eskom 
delegation? 
MS DANIELS:   That came from the Eskom delegation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not from her. 
MS DANIELS:   Not from her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and what was her response to this? 
MS DANIELS:   She said – because it ended with would be 
open to this discussion and also the public management 
thereof, that was the delegation quote.  And she responded 
by saying Eskom had already appointed lawyers in the 
matter so it puts her at an unfair advantage – I mean, put 
them at an unfair advantage and the trust issues are so 
deep so it would be something I would consider. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Then you can move to Mr 
Koko’s meeting with the delegation.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair, thank you.  Yes and 
you were …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to make sure that before 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 184 of 224 
 
she says Mr Koko’s meeting with the delegation was 
different with a clear picture as to how the other two 
meetings were like. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed.  Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, then you may go into Mr 
Koko’s meeting. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  Oh… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This meeting, does it take place on the 
same day as well? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   This one was on the 11 May 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you deal with it on paragraph 68 of 
your affidavit and could you briefly just explain to the 
Chairperson how this meeting compares to the others?  
The other two you have mentioned. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, this meeting was markedly 
different in that it was hosted – it was hosted by Mrs Klein 
and Mr Koza and there was quite collegiate familiar, you 
know, sort of bantering beforehand and it was – it was 
opened by Mrs Klein with sort of – even though the correct 
20 
words were like without prejudice and off the record, it 
opened with how do we treat people and things like that.  
So there was a tone being set, you know, which was 
different …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a what meeting? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 185 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   It was more collegial than the others. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
You 
know, 
the 
others 
were 
more 
adversarial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   In terms of they came in, they sat down 
and the next question is, how are we going to part ways.  
This one, there was banter, it was – ja, it was just – the 
atmosphere was different.  He was also given time to 
explain and he went into, you know, great lengths of saying 
10 
thank you for the opportunity for being heard even though 
he reserved his rights and things like that and he once 
again went on about I really do not understand why I have 
been suspended, you know, but he would not make it 
difficult for the board if the board thought that he should 
not come back.  So it was very much – and I think that he 
was shocked and he could not understand why he was 
where he was at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say you think he was shocked? 
MS DANIELS:   These are words that he used. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that he used. 
MS DANIELS:   In this presentation because he was 
allowed t6 actually present to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You believe he was shocked? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I thought he was acting. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 186 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, continue? 
MS DANIELS:   He was a very good actor.  And, you know, 
it was about – he could not understand where he was and 
it is at this meeting that, you know, he coined that phrase 
that Eskom is my veins, the blood in my veins is blue, 
those kinds of things, so he really went to town. And they 
actually indulged him in terms of explaining.  Of course he 
did 
come 
with 
the 
narrative 
of 
the 
reason 
for 
his 
suspension was because of Mr Tsotsi and his animosity 
with Mr Tsotsi.  So that came – that was in the narrative.  I 
10 
think then what was important, he also, you know, pointed 
out his career in Eskom and things like that. So there was 
a lot of that.   
 
Ms Klein then also thanked him for being very 
honest with the board and so did Mr Koza.  They both said 
thank you for the explanation, thank you for sharing this 
knowledge with us, this was a totally different tone to the 
other meetings, none of the other executives where  - 
meetings, where I had been present, had ever had this kind 
of dialogue or exchange.  
20 
 
And then the question came from Ms Klein as could 
you fully trust this board again?  And he responded that he 
would be able to – that he was confident that the issues of 
the previous board were resolved and that he would be 
able to work with this board. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 187 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you done? 
MS DANIELS:   I think that… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is paragraph 71. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, that is what I... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein in her affidavit to the 
Commission, Ms Klein says Mr Koko was the one executive 
who wanted his job back. 
MS DANIELS:   That is incorrect in my view, Mr Chairman, 
because they were not given the opportunity  to even, you 
know, articulate it properly that they wanted their job back, 
10 
they were just – the first line in the meeting was, how do 
we part ways?  So even if they were considering coming 
back, there was just no opportunity for them to do so.   
 
Mr Koko was asked would you trust this board and 
would you be able to work with this board again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You may or may not know this but Ms 
Klein in particular has also stated in her affidavit that she 
understood that the – at least the two executives, that is 
Ms Tsholofelo Molefe and Mr Marokane wanted settlement 
agreements with the board, that is why the board appointed 
20 
a delegation to go create settlement agreements with them.  
If you do not know, you do not know.  If you know you may 
tell the Chairperson what you know. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I do not know the minutiae 
but from where I was sitting, that was not the approach of 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 188 of 224 
 
the board.  This delegation was appointed to exit the 
executive and more particularly Mr Matona, Mr Marokane 
and Ms Molefe. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You know, I am reminded because I am 
giving you Ms Klein’s version to the Commission, I am 
reminded of one version she also gave which is that you 
were – it appears that you were in fact involved in the 
drafting of the letters for the suspension of the executives, 
you together with Mr Salim Essa. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. Mr Chairman, I addressed that in my 
10 
supplementary affidavit.  Those letters which she attaches 
were drafted purportedly on the 10 March.  I did have a 
template of the letterhead so I could accept that I would be 
the author, listed as the author, but if you look at the data 
presented on there, there are a couple of red flags on that, 
on that metadata that she presented. 
 
Firstly, the letters are printed before they are 
created, they are also talking of hearings of suspension 
which did not take place, on their own evidence, and it 
would be impossible for me to have worked with someone 
20 
that I had just met.  So you will see in my affidavit I said I 
question the authenticity of those letters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. In fact the letters are termed pre-
suspension letters.  But now in your explanation to the 
Chairperson, I want to go back to these exit negotiations, 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 189 of 224 
 
you called them.  If you say the board – what the board 
sought to achieve was to exit the executives, the three you 
have mentioned, did you know what the reason for that was 
because here they would get rid of or exit the CEO and the 
CFO all at the same time.  
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, my only supposition as to 
why these people needed to be exited from their position 
was to make way for Brian Molefe coming to Eskom and the 
eventual transferring to Anoj Singh as well because those 
were the positions that were open.  Mr Koko came back to 
10 
generation, I think he was moved from procurement and 
engineering. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was moved from where? 
MS DANIELS:   From group technology and commercial.  
He went to generation when he came back in Brian 
Molefe’s time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So generation, it is a division within 
Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you explain to the Chairperson 
20 
what generation was responsible for? 
MS 
DANIELS: 
Generation 
was 
responsible 
for 
the 
managing and operation of the power stations. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Now 
your 
explanation 
to 
the 
Chairperson that you think the executives were being 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 190 of 224 
 
removed in order to make way for Mr Brian Molefe and Mr 
Anoj Singh, is that just an impression on your part or do 
you have some factors that you are able to point to for the 
benefit of the Chairperson which you would say you relied 
on for making that conclusion?  
MS DANIELS:   One of the factors is that while these 
negotiations were – discussions were continuing, the board 
– Mr Molefe had already – Mr Molefe, Brian Molefe had 
already arrived at Eskom and in fact on – I think it was the 
4 May he had in between these exit negotiations, the board 
10 
delegation 
had 
a 
meeting 
with 
Mr 
Molefe. 
 
I 
do 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that on page 17?  Page one seven, 
paragraph 73? 
MS DANIELS:   No, no, that was a different meeting.  It 
would be paragraph 62, Mr Chairman, of my affidavit.  
Because, as I say, in between the meetings a meeting with 
Brian Molefe also took place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is one the – which date is this? 
MS DANIELS:   On page 40. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but the date? 
MS DANIELS:   This was on the 4 May, the very same day 
that the delegation met with Ms Molefe and Mr Matona. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well already in April the Minister had 
announced the secondment of Mr Molefe. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 191 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   17 April.  17 April 2015. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, she literally parachuted into the office 
that day.  If I recall, I was standing at the CEO’s – next to 
his desk delivering some documents and the next minute 
Minister Brown comes literally flying in with Brian Molefe in 
tow.  The Chairpersons of Eskom and Transnet I think 
arrived a little bit later.  You know, there was a time 
difference but they – that is he literally was parachuted 
into Eskom. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   He or she was literally what? 
MS DANIELS:   Parachuted into Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is that now? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr Molefe. 
MS DANIELS:   Brian Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   He arrived with Minister Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DANIELS:   On the day that …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the day that he arrived. 
MS DANIELS:   …Mr Seleka talks about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS DANIELS:   Is it the day that he arrived? 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Seleka.  Sorry, Mr 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 192 of 224 
 
Seleka, we are at half past four.  I need us to take a break 
but let us talk about how much more time you envisage you 
might need with Ms Daniels? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thirty minutes, Chair.  I personally 
need 30 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   30 minutes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that s fine.  Ms Daniels, that 
is still fine with you, we can continue? 
MS DANIELS:   That is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, counsel for all concerned, it that 
fine?  Okay, thank you.  Let us take a short break, it is half 
past four now, let us resume at quarter to five and then we 
will go on and then we finish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you DCJ, Chairperson.  Ms 
20 
Daniels you are still under oath, thank you.  Just before 
the adjournment then we talked about what in your view 
would have been the reason why the executives were 
exited by the Board, and the subsequent secondment then 
of Mr Molefe.  Correct?   Your microphone is off. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 193 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you aware beyond what you have 
mentioned how the secondment of Mr Brian Molefe came 
about, and now when I am asking you that question and 
you don’t know the answer please do not speculate, unless 
we ask you to surmise from what was happening. Were you 
aware of how he was seconded? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not aware of how he was seconded Mr 
Chairman but I did have to administer the process of 
regularising if that is what Mr Seleka is asking. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh yes, you had to administer? 
MS DANIELS:   Administer the process, put the paperwork 
in place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of what? 
MS DANIELS:   Of the secondment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And probably what you should tell me is 
what it is that you implemented in order to give effect to – 
in order to bring about the secondment. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you can certainly do so, 
Chairperson as she answers your question Ms Daniels has 
indicated to us – we would actually prefer her to have an 
affidavit specifically submitted to us dealing with the 
secondment. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 194 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am quite happy that she deals 
with that after she has submitted her affidavit, if you are 
happy, I was just trying to simplify your question.  So I 
think it is up to you whether you want her to deal with it 
briefly or you want to defer it to after – to the next time 
she comes back.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Ms Daniels you are going to go into 
the details which I wouldn’t know offhand, I would prefer 
that we defer it. 
MS DANIELS:   I would also prefer because it actually is 
10 
quite detailed Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:    And I would like to put a full picture 
before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay thank you.  Then in regard to – 
were you aware that executives were suspended on the 
ground or preferred reason that there was going to be an 
investigation. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that was explained to us Mr Chairman 
20 
as employees by Ms Klein and Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and we understand that Dentons 
was subsequently appointed to conduct an investigation. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you have to deal with Dentons? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 195 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   I did not deal with the appointment of 
Dentons, I was interviewed by one of the Dentons team 
members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were interviewed? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes I was. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Do 
you 
know 
why 
were 
you 
interviewed, why you were interviewed? 
MS DANIELS:   Because one of the areas was primary 
energy and procurement, I got interviewed on those issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And who was the – what do you call 
10 
them, the Group Executive for that division? 
MS DANIELS:   At the time of the review it was Matshela 
Koko, Acting Group Chief Executive – Group Executive, my 
apologies Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me put this to you, Ms Klein talks 
about this Dentons report, but there were three versions 
and the first version was destroyed, according to her 
because it disclosed the names of persons and entities 
who had not been consulted. She goes on to talk about the 
second version which – from which the names were 
20 
redacted and then talks about another version which was 
redacted by yourself and subsequently made public without 
the Board approval.  Could you respond to that, well firstly 
are you aware of those allegations she is making? 
MS DANIELS:   I did watch the testimony of Ms Klein Mr 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 196 of 224 
 
Chairman so I am well aware of what she testified.  I am 
also aware of what she puts on affidavit because the 
Commission provided it to me to respond and I do have a 
response to that.   Mr Seleka’s question is just a bit 
complex, as most matters at Eskom, so I am not sure 
where to start Mr Seleka, I would just need guidance from 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Simplify it for her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I may simplify it thank you Chair.   
Let’s start with what is the version of the report said to 
10 
have been destroyed. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman I want to unequivocally tell 
you that the versions of the Dentons report that you have 
and that the Commission has is not complete.   There has 
been an original version that was destroyed, and the 
reason I say that is because I had sight of that version by 
virtue of the fact that I was in the office of Dr Ngubane.   
That version which for the purposes of just as I say was 
complicated I am going to call the original version because 
that is how it is referred to in the minutes, but that original 
20 
version is non-existent in today’s time, and I say so 
because I had to read it at the time, it was a presentation, 
it was not in a formal report yet, it was a presentation 
through the Board of Eskom and it detailed the tender 
manipulation, the criminality that was associated with one 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 197 of 224 
 
Matshela Koko and it went into detail into the interviews 
that were conducted, so there was quite – it was quite a 
damning report but any Board should not have discarded at 
that stage. 
 
The report spoke about the other divisions, it did 
speak about you know how we could improve processes 
around primary energy, diesel purchases, the financing, it 
actually did not find any fault for want of a better word with 
the way that the finances were reported you know because 
there were external entrances.  Group capital it spoke 
10 
about how we could do things better in terms of project 
management, which were things that were already being 
addressed in Eskom.   
 
The primary areas that were really, really unpacked 
were the procurement areas of which Matshela Koko’s 
name featured prominently as to how the manipulation took 
place.  That version was then collected and destroyed.   I 
found an electronic version, well I thought it was, on my 
computer which I did hand to the Commission, but I don’t 
we could have broken the code to that, but so that is why I 
20 
am saying my testimony and why I am passionate about 
saying 
that 
original 
document 
and 
that 
the 
Board 
deliberately destroyed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but you say the report that was 
destroyed you have got – you have been able to find a 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 198 of 224 
 
version of it in your computer. 
MS DANIELS:   I thought it was a version, I am not sure 
because it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you have not been able to access 
it?    
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but if it is accessed you would 
know if – once you read it you would know if it is the 
same? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes that is correct Mr Chairman and I have 
10 
handed that to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Now do you know 
whether that report had been submitted to the Board by 
Dentons as Dentons Report or final report or whether it had 
been submitted as one of the drafts before the final report? 
MS DANIELS:   It is not clear from the records of Eskom 
that we went through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS: But from my recollection it wasn’t in report 
form, it was in presentation format and it said these are 
20 
the findings that are coming out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is your understanding that this was 
a presentation that Dentons was putting, was going to put 
before the Board in order to forewarn them of what to 
expect in the final report? 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 199 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:    Yes, that would be a good way to describe 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But do you know whether Dentons 
ever got a chance to present that document to the Board in 
a meeting or whether Dentons simply submitted that 
document to the Board for the Board members to read so 
that they are forewarned of what the final report was to 
look like? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman it is not clear from the 
records of Eskom whether that was in a meeting because 
10 
the copy that I was you know was presented was handed to 
me by Dr Ngubane so I wasn’t – I am not sure but in the 
minutes you will see, and I refer to them and I say in 
paragraph 88 of my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   That these details did not make it into the 
official records of Eskom as it was decided by the Board 
that it would be destroyed.  This is recorded in the Board 
minute of 14 August where it clearly states: 
“Concern 
was 
expressed 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
20 
collection and destruction of initial reports.  The 
Company 
Secretary 
was 
expected 
to 
take 
the 
necessary steps to ensure that all original reports 
were connected in exchange for the final report, in 
view of the concern the Chairman of P & G, People 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 200 of 224 
 
in Governance, Ms Veneta Klein undertook to 
ensure that all reports were returned to her within 
seven days for them to be destroyed.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And that is why I say that that original 
report – I am not sure you know they talk about initial 
reports, and they talk about original versions but for me 
that version has not made it into the official records of 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Having read both, I take it you have read 
10 
the final report of Dentons. 
MS DANIELS:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it your observation that there is a vast 
difference between the final report and the document that 
you say was destroyed which you think sought to forewarn 
the Board of what was to come in the final report? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is my contention Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Unequivocally so that because you will see 
that the reports that I have provided to the Commission the 
20 
preliminary report and the final report are very similar 
because the Board actually stopped, instructed Dentons to 
stop the investigation, so those two reports even though 
they are two reports, they are very similar, there is not 
much difference, I think the dates are even the same 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 201 of 224 
 
because they say instructed to stop as at this date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that the differences 
between the final report and that document that you  say 
was destroyed relates to the alleged role that was played – 
was set to have been played by  Mr Koko in procurement 
matters? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where the big difference lies. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the big difference lies in the influence 
on particular contracts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Particular specifications, manipulation over 
a period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Daniels 
you may want to refer the Chairperson to the minutes, the 
minute of the meeting you are referring to I think is 
paragraph 89 where you say: 
“A copy of the minutes is attached and marked 
SMD7.” 
20 
You will find that on page 47. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before that, this document 
you are talking about that was ultimately destroyed it 
would have – would it have been emailed to the different 
members of the Board or would hard copies have been 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 202 of 224 
 
made and they were distributed physically at a meeting of 
the Board and after the meeting they were collected to be 
destroyed? 
MS DANIELS:  This was hard copies Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   These were not emailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   These were hard copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Yes Mr Seleka?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, and I think the 
10 
Chairperson’s question might be answered by what is 
reflected on the minutes.  I see the minutes are on page 
47, minutes of Eskom Holding Board Meeting extract from 
the final minutes of Eskom Board In-Committee meeting on 
14 August 2015 at the Eskom Research Testing and 
Development Boardroom, do you see that at 900? 
MS DANIELS:    Yes.  So Mr Chairman that is the 
resolution that I quoted it is actually on page 49, it is item 
6.2.1 and it says: 
“Company secretary should ensure that all initial 
20 
reports are collected and destroyed in exchange for 
the receipt of the final Denton report. 
6.2.2 
It is not noted that the Chairman of People in 
Governance as in 6.2.1 above ensures all reports 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 203 of 224 
 
are 
returned 
to 
her 
within 
seven 
days 
and 
destroyed.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see also on page 48 paragraph 123 
members considered mediates dictation, do you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could you read that also quickly? 
MS DANIELS:     
“Members considered the media expectation with 
regard to the outcome of the Dentons investigation 
and supported that the report be released to the 
10 
Minister with a covering letter from the Chairman of 
the Board articulating the next steps.  Copies of the 
final report would be delivered to the members, the 
Group Executives, the Chief Financial Officer and 
external auditors.   However concern was expressed 
with regard to the collection and destruction of the 
initial 
reports. 
 
The 
Company 
Secretary 
was 
expected to take the necessary steps to ensure that 
all original reports were collected in exchange for 
the final reports.  In view of this concern the 
20 
Chairman of P & G, Ms Veneta Klein, undertook to 
ensure that all reports were returned to her within 
seven days for them to be destroyed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then follow that resolution you started 
with in paragraph 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 204 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that those minutes are not signed, 
but we have seen minutes last week and maybe this week 
that were signed like more than a year later and so forth.  
Do you know whether there is any particular reasons why 
these ones are not signed? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman these were extracts of 
minutes, you will it is noted extract, I am not sure why it is 
signed but this one comes from my personal file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS DANIELS:    Because I kept the minutes or I kept some 
in my records so the original should be signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so there should be a signed one? 
MS DANIELS:  There should be a signed version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so the legal team we must check 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair.  Ms Daniels then the issue 
regarding you are said to making public a further redacted 
version of the report without Board approval, which is what 
Ms Veneta Klein alleges happened. 
20 
MS 
DANIELS: 
  Mr 
Chairman the redacted 
version 
happened in 2017, February 2017. At the time I did talk 
about it in my supplementary affidavit.  At the time, late 
January, we were hit with a number of PAIA applications 
and 
also 
a 
set 
of 
media 
questions 
by 
the 
former 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 205 of 224 
 
investigative journalist Sikonathi Mantshantsha who is now 
the spokesperson for Eskom.   He sent a rather detailed I 
think it was about three page of questions and we had a 
number, I think there were three or four PAIA applications 
at the same time.    
The Board had decided to release the final Dentons 
report, but at the same time had asked me to get legal 
opinion on how do we do that in terms of the PAIA 
provisions etcetera, and were we allowed to release those 
documents as is, you know without – because we hadn’t 
10 
notified the affected parties, even though the report was 
not incriminating there were names of companies and 
earnings and things like that in there, and the initial 
reports show that while we could release Eskom employees 
and Eskom officials we would need to notify the companies 
involved etcetera, and the preliminary legal opinion was 
shared with the Board.  The recommendation was that we 
redact those names from the report that was to be released 
to the public and it is that redacted report that was then 
released in 2017, there was no malice intended, it was 
20 
purely based on legal advice, I do have the files, I will 
make it available to the Commission, the legal opinion 
stating why we did that.   
I would not have been, I actually also sent it to the 
Minister on the 1 s t of February because the immediate 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 206 of 224 
 
conference was set for the 7 t h of February so I sent her a 
copy of the speech, a copy of you know the documentation 
and the rationale as to why we would be redacting the 
document on the 5 t h of February and I said this was a 
preliminary legal opinion.  I would not have been able to 
send that to the Minster had the Board not been aware of 
that, so that is why I contest Ms Klein’s version in saying 
that you know she makes it appear as if I redacted out of 
my own volition and just made it appear on that day. 
In fact on the day of that press briefing Dr Ngubane 
10 
asked me to explain to the media why we had redacted the 
document, so I do have those documents available.   It was 
not done out of seeking to hide information, it was done on 
the advice of counsel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you are saying to the Chairperson 
that the Board was aware of that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the Board was much aware of that 
because I would not be able to – I would not have been 
able to converse with the Minister in the manner that I did 
had the Board not been availed of that information. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two last points and – sorry – may we 
go back to the testimony you have already given.  The last 
meeting that you had at Melrose Arch where you place is it 
the Minister or Deputy Minister, Ben Martens? 
MS DANIELS:  Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises.  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 207 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes in that picture I mean this work 
stream hasn’t investigated that I should draw to your 
attention and I am sure you know by now that Mr Ben 
Martens has denied being present in that meeting. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, he denied it immediately the next 
morning, I woke up to a press conference being held by 
Minister Martens, I am fully aware that he had denied it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay Chair I don’t know whether she 
needs to comment on that but it is a matter we haven’t 
investigated.   Number two Ms Daniels it is the paragraph 
10 
in your affidavit on page 17, paragraph 73 where you’re 
talking the Board delegation meeting on 19 May 2015 and 
that you were in attendance and I think you need to 
address that to the Chairperson because the members of 
the Board delegation those who were appointed to be the 
Board delegation will have to be confronted with what you 
say there. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes Mr Chairman on the 19 t h of May this 
was after these discussions with the suspended executives 
the – Ms Klein and I am just trying to – here – Ms Klein 
20 
opened this discussion by saying that they needed to find 
settlement with the parties because they needed to clear 
the decks, and I put that in quotation marks because that 
is how I made my notes.   She also confirmed that the 
shareholder has approved to get rid of the people and make 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 208 of 224 
 
the necessary concessions if it is suits out the problem.  And 
she stressed that the priority is to get the people off and 
away. 
 
The meeting then discussed the various settlement 
arrangements that had been put in place and it said that the 
minister had a ceiling of R12 million to negotiate and that 
there were...  
 
The guiding principles were as follows, as I put here that 
there would be... that they would be able to do full cost-to-
company for up to 12-months.   
10 
 
They would be able to pay trance eight and trance nine.  
That was in relation to the incentive, the long-term incentive 
scheme that executives were on.   
 
They would have... there could be a contribution to the 
legal costs and a communication plan around the suspended 
executives could be negotiated.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Would you please tell the 
Chairperson where did this meeting take place? 
MS DANIELS:   My notes do not reflect where this took 
place. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could this meeting having taken place in 
Eskom, at Protea Hotel, at Melrose Arch or wherever? 
MS DANIELS:   This would have either been at the Protea 
Hotel or at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And who was in attendance apart from 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 209 of 224 
 
yourself? 
MS DANIELS:   This was Ms Klein, Mr Khumalo, Dr Ngubane 
and Mr Khoza. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And...? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Khoza. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  That concludes my 
questions to Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Where is Annexure SMD6 to 
which you refer in paragraph 74 of your affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I may assist? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 38? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, somehow I saw the colours at page 38 
and somehow I associated those colours with the colours on 
the cover of the transcript of the parliamentary committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Parliamentary portfolio. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So I just want...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may I ask while Chairperson is 
20 
going through this document? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I ask some questions while the 
Chairperson is going through? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 210 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, this document is dated 
4 June 2015 and in your affidavit you refer to it as... what do 
you refer to it as?  It is a briefing to the minister?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, a brief to the minister from 
chairman on the status of the suspended executives.  Now, 
the status of the suspended executives, I wonder what did 
they mean by that.  What do you they mean by that?   
 
I see paragraph 1 of the document on page 40, it is 
introduction.  Paragraph 2 is board resolutions of 11 March 
10 
2015.  So, those are the resolutions we have learnt about all 
of last week.   
 
Paragraph 3 deals with the terms and conditions of 
suspension.  Now that too we learnt about but you want to 
convey to the minister the status.  Is it on the 4t h of June or 
maybe around that time?   
 
Paragraph 4 deals with effect finding forensic inquiry.  
So it does not specifically relate to the executives.  So 3 
says: 
“The PMG identified the key executives to be put on 
20 
suspension for the duration of the inquiry as 
Sthembiso 
Matona, 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer, 
Tsholofelo 
Molefe, 
Financial 
Director, 
Dan 
Marokane, 
Group 
Executive, 
Group 
Capital, 
Malesela 
Sekhasimbe 
Koko, 
Group 
Executive 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 211 of 224 
 
Technology and Commercial.” 
 
Paragraph 4: 
“But by 4 June, the minister would have known that.” 
 
So what is new here which you are seeking to convey to 
the minister?  You go to page 45. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 5 deals with courts 
challenged by Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I can ask her this question.  
You see at paragraph 8, page 45 under interactions with 
10 
other executives, you write: 
“Aside from Mr Matona, the executives have in 
various ways approach the company and they have 
indicated that they are amenable to a settlement 
being made in terms of which they would resign from 
their positions and accept an exit package.” 
 
Can you see that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that suggests to me that you are 
saying that Mr Matona had not approached the company and 
20 
indicated that he was amenable to a settlement being made 
in terms of which he would resign from his position and 
accept an exit package.  Do you accept that? 
MS DANIELS:   I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 212 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Because he took us... he took Eskom to 
court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
MS DANIELS:   He took Eskom to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He took Eskom to court? 
MS DANIELS:   To court, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but were you not recording here what 
the position was as at the meeting that you talk about in your 
affidavit, I think on the 19t h... is it the 19t h of May?   
 
Ja, in your paragraph 73.  Paragraph 73 of your affidavit 
10 
which is at page 17, paragraph 73 of your affidavit.  You talk 
about what happened at a meeting of the delegation of the 
board of 19 May.   
 
And then after you have said what they... what was said 
at that meeting.  You then say in paragraph 74: 
“I was then asked to prepare a brief for the minister 
from the chairman on the status of the suspended 
executives.  A copy of the briefing document is 
annexed hereto marked Annexure SMD6.” 
 
So 
and 
then 
your 
briefing 
seems 
to 
be 
dated 
20 
4 June 2015.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is the date on here with the 7t h(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the status of the discussions with 
regard to the suspended executives, what you recorded at 
paragraph 8, is it what was the position, I mean, as at the 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 213 of 224 
 
19t h of May when the delegation of Eskom had a meeting?  
 
Is it what was the position at the time you prepared the 
document which was 4 June 2015?  Or what was it? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, the notes from the 19 t h of May 
were not... was to inform the brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   The notes from the 19t h of May that I have 
did, informed the brief because I, in my preparations for the 
Commission, is when I discovered by notes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am talking about this document. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  I would have to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   SMD6.  I am asking whether you sought to 
record in that document the status of the matter of the 
executives as to where the process was or as at the 
19t h of May or as at the 5t h or 4t h of June or on some other 
date? 
MS DANIELS:   As of the 19t h of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As of...? 
MS DANIELS:   The 19t h of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 19t h of May? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   My notes says to TM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   And then there is a question mark. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   And to be confirmed. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 214 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So you certainly.... that would... 
that precede the meetings, the meeting between the Eskom 
delegation and Mr Matona to try and discuss a resolution of 
the suspension? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the meeting of the delegation of the 
19t h of May precede the meeting of the delegation of Eskom 
with Mr Matona to try and settle? 
MS DANIELS:   The final meeting, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The final meeting? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the first meeting taken place? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the meeting had taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It had taken place.  
MS DANIELS:   Already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if your minutes... if this document at 
paragraph 8 is correct, then it would seem that what you say 
there, as far as Mr Matona is concerned, is not in line with 
what Ms Klein said and I think Dr Ngubane as well but I 
might be mistaken about Dr Ngubane.   
20 
 
Namely, that all the, except for Mr Koko, all the 
executives wanted to leave Eskom.  And they denied, Mr 
Klein denied any suggestion from Mr Matona that he said he 
wanted to go back to work.  So this, it would seem that what 
you say in paragraph 8 would in support of Mr Matona’s 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 215 of 224 
 
version. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But with regard to the other 
executives, if what you say is to be read as suggesting that 
they made the approach to Eskom that they wanted to go, if 
that is what paragraph 8 also means in regard to the other 
executives, then that would be in line with what Ms Klein, I 
think, said.   
 
But if you do not mean that but you mean that Eskom 
approached them and said let us talk about exit packages.  
10 
And in response they then said:  Well, we are amenable that 
might then be slightly different.    
 
Are you able to say which one you are talking about, 
which one of these two scenarios you are talking about? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, my scenario is that it was put 
to them ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   ...we want to part ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  How amenable are you to that? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  Even though I drafted this, this would 
have been signed off by the chairperson.  So the language 
would be different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 216 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   But what I am saying to you today - and that 
is why I gave you what was given to the minister – what I am 
saying to you today is that the executives were not, except 
for Malesela Koko, the executives were not given a choice.   
 
They may have expressed they wanted to come back but 
that was not, to use Mr Matona’s words, that was not on the 
table.  So you know, that is what I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   I am just giving you so that you can see they 
have the full picture of what occurred. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  So what 
is your final reaction to Ms Klein’s evidence and Dr 
Ngubane’s evidence before me that the board wanted all 
these executives to come back, they wanted them to come 
back?  It is the executives who choice that they did not want 
to come back.  What is your reaction to that evidence? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, with the greatest of respect, 
Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein are lying to this Commission.  
They distorted the truth.  Ms Klein was at the forefront of 
wanting to get rid of the executives, in her own words.  Dr 
20 
Ngubane played this person behind the scenes.   
 
From what I witnessed, there was no intention.  Other 
than Malesela Koko, there was no intention to bring back any 
of those executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Then the last one goes back 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 217 of 224 
 
to that one of R 800 million.  What was your understanding 
of what Mr Essa wanted you to do in return for him giving 
you that R 800 million rand if you accepted it? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, my understanding was.  Mr 
Koko was on suspension at the time and he would have 
faced disciplinary action.  And had the disciplinary action run 
properly, he would have been fired.   
 
And I think that what Mr Essa wanted was manipulation 
of 
that 
process. 
 
You 
will 
see 
in 
Malesela 
Koko’s 
parliamentary testimony, he only refers to the report that 
10 
exonerates him.  He does not go further than that.   
 
We all know... I spent a lot of time... there were senior 
counsel appointed to actually run that disciplinary.  The 
board overturned my selection of senior counsel.   
 
The charge sheet was tampered with so that there were 
gaps.  And that is why the disciplinary ended up, you know, 
being such a sham.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Now... so I thought that you had said the 
R 800 million was offered so as to get Mr Koko back 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to the company. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because he was on suspension at the 
time. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 218 of 224 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct.  He was on suspension 
because of that Impulse International. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was not the suspension that we are 
talking ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   No, no.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, and this was ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   That...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, this was a separate... 
MS DANIELS:   A separate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DANIELS:   He was acting Group Chief Executive 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   And this was why you will recall that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What would have been your... what 
20 
would be your normal role when an executive such as Mr 
Koko was to face disciplinary process at that time?  What 
powers did you have? 
MS DANIELS:   I would have assisted with the choice of 
chairperson and evidence leader and I would have assisted, 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 219 of 224 
 
you know, getting the evidence together from the Eskom 
side.  And I would have worked with... then once that had 
been prepared, it would have been handed over to the 
Industrial Relations Team.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   And that is what I did in the beginning to 
choose, to make sure that the evidence bundle, the charge 
sheets and everything were correct and were handed over 
for the IOR Team to run.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka, has this... is this one of 
10 
the parts that may need to have 3(3)-notices send out before 
she comes back next time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because we do not have it in her 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you will tell me more about it when you 
come back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When all the details have been put on 
affidavit. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 220 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And those who may be implicating have 
been served by way of 3(3)-notices. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I do not know whether counsel for 
Ms Daniels had any plans to re-examine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, before he does that, let me just 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you have some questions? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just one last point to Ms Daniels. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Going back to that paragraph in that 
report Mr Chairperson referred you to under paragraph 8 
which says: 
“Aside from Mr Matona, the executive have in 
various forms approached the company and have 
indicated that they are amenable to a settlement 
being made in terms of which they would resign from 
their positions and accept an exit package.” 
 
If you look at Ms Venete Klein’s testimony or even 
20 
affidavit 
including 
your 
testimony 
today, 
because 
you 
attended the meeting when Mr Koko’s exist settlement 
negotiations took place.  That paragraph would not be 
correct in relation to him.   
MS DANIELS:   No, it is not correct.  But they did offer, I 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 221 of 224 
 
think if I recall, they did offer him, you know, a letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, they what? 
MS DANIELS:   They did give him a letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What do you mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
MS DANIELS:   H’m... 
CHAIRPERSON:   A letter to say what? 
MS DANIELS:   H’m.  What would you call it?  Just an 
indication of what the settlement package would look like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For Mr Koko? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he wanted to go? 
MS DANIELS:   If he wanted to go, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I thought he... no, this paragraph 
says apart from Mr Matona, aside from Mr Matona, the 
others wanted to go.  But that cannot be correct if one looks 
at the evidence of both yourself and Ms Klein that he wanted 
to come back. 
MS DANIELS:   That Mr Koko wanted to come back? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that he wanted to. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what is being conveyed to the 
minister here is not correctly reflecting ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   It is not.  It is not correctly. 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 222 of 224 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...the position? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, is it correct in regard to the other 
two executives? 
MS DANIELS:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did I take it ...[intervenes] [laughing]  I am 
sorry, I just could not resist. [laughing]  Is it correct in regard 
to them? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the time, there was a 
10 
settlement negotiations ongoing with Mr Marokane and there 
was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That does not mean it is correct.  That 
there were settlement negotiations with him, does not mean 
this statement is correct, necessarily. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is what I was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question is about who may be 
approach? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, that is why I am saying that was not 
correct.  The approach was made by the board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this statement, except for Mr Matona, 
is not correct in regard to any of the other executives? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And but ...[intervenes]  
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 223 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is something you realised only 
now? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Counsel for Ms Daniels, did you plan to do 
any re-examination now or you might do it some... when she 
returns? 
10 
COUNSEL:   Chair, I think I need to consult on certain 
aspects of her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   I had to in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So you could do it next time she 
comes again? 
COUNSEL:   Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Alright, we are 
going to... I am going to release you but you will come back 
to deal with the other matters that have not been covered.  
20 
But thank you for coming.  Thank you for everybody for 
cooperation.   
 
For the rest of the week, the Commission is not going to 
have any sittings.  This is just for the... to inform the public.  
It will resume on Monday, next week.  And next week it will 
15 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 267 
 
Page 224 of 224 
 
hear evidence relating what is called the R 1 billion Housing 
Project of the Free State Government, that will be for next 
week.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
