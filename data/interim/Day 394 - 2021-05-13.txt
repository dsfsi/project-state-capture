MR ZWANE:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That they are true and correct. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson I beg leave to 
have this affidavit dated 10 May 2021 admitted as Exhibit 
U41.3 together with the annexures thereto and those 
annexures Chair they start from page 353.235. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The affidavit of Mr Mosebenzi 
10 
Joseph Zwane that starts at page 353.219 will together with 
his annexures be admitted and will be marked as Exhibit 
U41.3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Just to 
recap Mr Zwane’s evidence relates to a number of aspects 
some of which we addressed in his last appearance and we 
hope to finish off today Mr Zwane.  Just in broad light or 
just to touch on the highlights we dealt with the issues 
regarding 
your 
trips 
to 
India 
which 
allegedly 
were 
sponsored by the Gupta’s.  We want to finish off on that and 
20 
then deal with issues relating to Mr Zwane’s establish – or 
the start as he called it his own brainchild which is the 
Estina Project in the Free State. We will deal with that Mr 
Zwane.  Deal with the issues relating to Estina the evidence 
of certain witnesses that have already come before the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 7 of 354 
 
commission regarding what happened in regard to the 
project.  Look at whether or not the Gupta’s were involved 
in the project.  We will also deal with issues relating to your 
appointment as a MP and ultimately your appointment as 
the Minister of DMR – Department of Mineral Resources.  
How you were appointed and what you did as a result 
thereof.  And also deal with the issue regarding the 
Waterkloof landing of the Gupta airplane in 2013 which from 
there is the wedding at Sun City.  And we will finalise with 
the closure of bank accounts.  Your chairperson should this 
10 
in the Inter Ministerial Committee and what role you played 
in regard thereto.  So that is – that is in a nutshell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine but I wonder whether it 
would not be convenient to finalise everything connected 
with emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I know the emails will go all over the 
place.  They will – they will touch upon all the items I think 
you mentioned but it might be convenient to just deal with 
that – get it out of the way even if after that you can then 
20 
focus on specific topics. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is not going to disturb your plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes let us – the emails Chairperson has 
in mind those ones we were dealing with. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 8 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja last time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the previous occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So that is fine.  That is – Mr 
Zwane let us then pick it up from the evidence or the 
affidavit rather of Mr Theron and there we were dealing with 
the emails in regard to the bookings of the trip or the flight 
in September 2014 that – that booking was made by Travel 
Excellence  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just tell us first where to find that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I am going there.  That is on page 
353.134. 
CHAIRPERSON:    253 or 353? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  353.134.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Zwane you are there as well? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found the page Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Now the allegation in this regard Mr 
20 
Zwane is – is that details of – of trips that you had arranged 
by the Gupta’s or Mr Ashu Chawla of Sahara Computers and 
that there were emails exchanged to show that.   
 
Firstly we went to the one of the choir.  And maybe I 
should start with the choir because you have responded to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 9 of 354 
 
that one in your affidavit.   
MR ZWANE:  Huh-ah. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I know I have referred you to a 
page but because the choir issue it has come up maybe I 
should start with it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes maybe I should start with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Mr Zwane deals with that in his 
affidavit.  Mr Zwane you know that in your affidavit you do 
10 
say which is the affidavit we have just submitted – admitted 
this morning – you do say that you in fact were on the same 
plane with the choir going to India. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I did realise that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Because that – that is slightly 
different from in your main affidavit where you say you 
came to know about the choir being in India when you were 
already in India and you tried to meet with them. 
MR ZWANE:  Thank you Chair.  Let me deal with that 
matter. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Please address the Chairperson. 
MR ZWANE:  I was aware that the choir would be taking a 
trip.  I did say that.  I also said I was not involved in terms 
of the organisation of that trip.  I did indicate that I said to 
the choir I was also going to the – to India around that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 10 of 354 
 
month and if it happens that we meet in India and I have 
time I will make time and come and see them performing.  
And I should also say Chair I did say I did not become part 
of the travelling arrangement with the choir.   
My name was included in the itinerary of the choir 
which we dealt with the last time and I said that I do not 
know how my name was included there because I made my 
own travel arrangement and contrary to the view that was 
expressed by Mr Theron that I was paid for by the Gupta’s I 
now – I was fortunately able during the week which I was 
10 
given by this commission to get documents that indicates 
that there was an approval given to me as a MEC to go to 
India and go and lieu investors there.   
I have since also included as an annexure the 
payment thereof because I was fortunate to get that.  And 
the issue of – the issue that I dealt with earlier on that I 
was not part of the itinerary of the choir or the people who 
were arranged for by the choir.   
There was a question that was asked to me that was 
I part of the lunch that was prepared and in the email of Mr 
20 
Theron it is indicated that 24 people attended the lunch.   
If you minus 24 from 27 which is in the itinerary it 
will make clear to this commission that the three people that 
are part of the approval of the trip were not part of that 
lunch.  So I thought I should raise those issues and clarify. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 11 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you – you say you were one of 
those three. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well Mr Zwane on that issue 
obviously the question arises is if your choir had a lunch at 
Mr Gupta’s house in India how did they know about it? 
MR ZWANE:  I did – I did explain and clarify that matter last 
when I was here.  I do not own the choir; the choir is not my 
choir.  I have said I did give or lend a hand there and there 
10 
where they would need my support because I was involved 
in the formation of the choir as a program of government 
which was called social cohesion.  There were a number of 
activities that were undertaken under social cohesion.  So I 
may not know the details in terms of how the choir goes 
about in terms of sourcing funds I did raise that point even 
last time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I am not sure that answers this 
question.  How did the choir know about Mr Tony Gupta and 
their itinerary including going to Mr Gupta’s house for lunch.  
20 
So if you take that with the fact that it was your i-Pad, your 
email address it was being used to exchange information in 
regard to who is going to share a room and who is not going 
to share a room it seems from the totality of that evidence 
that you seem to be the connection between the choir – 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 12 of 354 
 
whether it is your choir or not but it a choir formed – 
founded by you and others.  You seem to be the connection 
between the choir and Mr Tony Gupta and/or the Sahara 
Computer people.  What is your comment on that? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I did indicate last time when I was here 
that indeed at some point I did lend my gadget to a member 
of the choir who wanted to send a Gmail.  I did say – I did 
say in my last statement that I was not privy to the contents 
of that email as it was sent.  I deny the assertion that I 
seem to be a common denominator in this arrangement.  I 
10 
have said earlier on the choir made its own arrangements 
which I am not privy to and I want to put that statement and 
repeat it on record here today.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So who were the – it is okay you have 
counted 27 guests and minus 3 you said 24 seems to have 
attended the lunch at the – at Mr Tony Gupta’s house.  Who 
were the other three of which you say are the department’s 
officials? 
MR ZWANE:  The three was me, Ms Matau [?] and Mr Ashok 
Narayan. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way who was Ms Matau [?] just 
remind me? 
MR ZWANE:  She was an official working in my department 
Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 13 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  The office manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Office manager. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In your office. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is – that is the one trip.  So your 
– your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your version Mr Zwane that the fact 
that you and the choir travelled in the same flight to India 
was just a coincidence or you say no it was planned that let 
us go together but we were going for different purposes and 
we were not being paid for by the same source.  I was being 
paid for by the Department and I do not know who was 
paying for the choir. 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I planned my trip to India followed all 
the processes evidence thereof is here and I think in the 
20 
middle or towards the end of processes I learnt that the 
choir was going to India that is what I have said even in my 
affidavit around the same – same time.  That is why I said if 
my program allowed I will take a turn where you are 
because I am going to India on my work.  That is what 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 14 of 354 
 
transpired Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it does not answer my question.  
My question is whether it was just a coincidence or it was a 
plan – it was planned that you – you would travel in the 
same flight with the choir. 
MR ZWANE:  No it was not – it was not on my side planned 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So as far as you are concerned it 
was a coincidence. 
MR ZWANE:  I think so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Zwane you would have seen the 
affidavit of Mr Ephraim Dlamini one of the community 
members in regard to the dairy farm and he says there that 
to the commission in an affidavit that they had been 
promised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is the affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on page – Chairperson it starts 
on page 353.308. 
CHAIRPERSON:  308. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  308 and the paragraph I want to 
refer to Chair is on page 353.315 paragraph 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 27. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 15 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  315. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is Mr Ephraim Marcosini 
Dlamini.  He is one of the farmers and he says and would 
have been one of the beneficiaries in the project and in 
paragraph 27 he says: 
“The committee we selected to interface with 
the government on all matters relating to the 
10 
dairy project failed to report back to us on 
any developments.  Having been promised 
training in India we heard instead that Mr 
Zwane had taken a choir he supported to 
India.” 
 
So any comment on that Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:  No thank Chair.  I have read this affidavit by 
Mr Dlamini.  I would have loved if Mr Dlamini was asked by 
this commission to give evidence in terms of that assertion 
because to the best of recollection my knowledge and belief 
20 
there was never a stage where I was present as the MEC of 
Agriculture and people were promised to go to India – to do 
what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the – there would be beneficiaries of 
the – of the project were not promised any training. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 16 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:  The – there was – there were beneficiaries of 
the project that would have been trained in South Africa 
mainly because they were farmers who would have known in 
the course of them doing their business simple facts about 
farming.  It boggles my mind why would we then have taken 
people to India for a simple training – by whom?  Because 
those would have in the affidavit of Mr Dlamini in issues 
that we are discussing here who was supposed to train them 
in India? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja continue – finish. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  If there is any evidence to that Chair I will be 
gladly willing to engage but from where I am seated there 
was never at any point during my tenure as the MEC of 
Agriculture where beneficiaries were promised a trip to 
India.   
In fact if you look at witnesses that have came here 
it took some time before beneficiaries were properly 
organised into a unit and by the time they would have 
formed committees and so forth I would have never – I 
would have actually moved out of that department.   
20 
Because this trip was around October in 2012 and if 
you look at your details in terms of what was happening 
during that time it was the time where the department was 
busy still bringing these beneficiaries together trying to get 
into contracts with them.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 17 of 354 
 
So there is – I do not think there is an issue or any 
matter that was raised of the building training to India that I 
know of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My understanding of what Mr Dlamini is 
saying is that they as the intended beneficiaries of the 
projects had been promised training.  Now if the training 
was to take place in India maybe that would not be 
surprising because the evidence is to the effect that, and I 
think it is the evidence of Mr Talete(?) is to the effect that 
he had undertaken a trip to India, I think he had also gone 
10 
there with Mr Maria(?) 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And as I recall, the – his evidence, 
the purpose of the trip by him was to go and see how the 
Indian 
company, 
I 
forget 
what 
it 
was 
called 
now 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Paras.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Paras.  How they dealt with what you 
wanted to do under this project in the Free State because 
he said it seemed that there was something to be learnt as 
20 
to how they dealt with that(?).  So he went there and of 
course as we know, according to his evidence, ultimately 
that company was part of the project in the Free State, 
according to his evidence. 
 
There is a suggestion that that company denied 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 18 of 354 
 
that but let us leave that aside.  According to his evidence 
that was the company was part of the Estina Project and of 
course people who were brought in to work on the project 
were from India.   
 
So it would make sense if the position was:  You 
people are going to beneficiaries to this project.  Maybe 
you 
must 
go 
there 
and 
see 
how 
people, 
who 
are 
beneficiaries there, what they do, what their roles are, get 
to understand because we want this to be as successful 
here as it is in India.  That is one approach.   
10 
 
Of course, another approach might be, the 
training would take place in the Free State and people who 
had the know-how from India could be brought into South 
Africa.  So what do you say to that?  Assuming that it is 
true that they were promised that they would be given 
training. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair I would not be speculating.  I am 
saying to this Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I – to the best of my recollection and my 
20 
knowledge and belief, that was never the case.  If that is 
the case, that Mr Dlamini produced evidence so that the 
person who promised them can actually be able to answer 
what was on his mind when he promised these people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 19 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane, you 
have testified that you knew the Guptas from 2010 when 
they came for a TNA Breakfast. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To your knowledge, did any member of 
your choir have in a relationship with the Guptas, because 
this is now 2012. 
MR ZWANE:   I would prefer that we do not call this choir 
my choir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is why I stopped – I stopped 
10 
myself and calling it your choir. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I am asking did – to your 
knowledge ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the name of the choir?  Let us 
call it by the name. 
MR ZWANE:   Umsingizane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Umsingizane.  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  I will have to remember that, 
20 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   No, you can just say the choir.  I think I will 
understand.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well, Umsingizane is a Zulu word. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 20 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It – Umsingizane is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...part of grass. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So...  But I do not know whether that is 
what they had in mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may mean that the choir was intended 
to be well-grounded, well-rooted.  [laughs]  Do you know if 
10 
connect with what I am saying Mr Zwane or is there 
something else? 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe it is not Zulu. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I have never called you by your clang 
name in this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   But allow me to say [speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   I would not know how they arrived 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That name. 
MR ZWANE:   ...to that particular name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   As you say, I know that Umsingizane is a 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 21 of 354 
 
grass. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   That is normally not eaten by cattle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   It is used to do the Zulu and Sotho lands(?) 
and hence Sotho. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That is all what I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
But 
as 
to 
what 
they 
had 
in 
mind 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think you know more Umsingizane 
than I do.  [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  My question was.  You knew the 
20 
Guptas since 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was going to say.  Anyway, this is 
the only choir we are talking about.  So if you forget the 
name, if you say the choir ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Ja, that is correct. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 22 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...wel will know which one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Okay you knew 
them from 2010.  We are now in 2012.  And the emails are 
exchanged to your email address.  You are saying they are 
meant for the choir.  So to your knowledge, did any of your 
choir of the choir members have any relation or direct link 
with the Guptas? 
MR ZWANE:   The organiser of the choir at that time, I 
think it was Mr Thomo.  In fact, I must say, maybe it will 
assist the Commission, that the choir was composed of up 
10 
and coming artists van different areas, as I have said.  
Different backgrounds and - but seemingly when the choir 
– after the choir was formed, they then agreed that – they 
said Mr Thomo would actually be the organiser.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The organiser or the conductor? 
MR ZWANE:   Organiser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   In terms of whatever events that must come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That are connected with the choir. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I would not know exactly his networks and 
connections but he did his job very well, I must say.  
Because, as I have said earlier on, the choir travelled the 
length and breadth of South Africa and...  So to go to your 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 23 of 354 
 
question.  I would not know that information but he was an 
easy-to-go person. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you say Tony Wood? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thomo. 
MR ZWANE:   Thomo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thomo? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  He said Mr Thomo would organise. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Ja.  And...  Oh ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Thomo is t-h-o-m-o or -t-o-m-o? 
MR ZWANE:   T-h-o-m-o. 
CHAIRPERSON:   T-h-o-m-o, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you remember his name or not? 
MR ZWANE:   I think his name was Mfanafuthi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mfanafuthi? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. [Indistinct] [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the Zulu version. 
MR ZWANE:   I am really sorry, Chair.  It is not my 
intention but it is Advocate Seleka who wants to know 
these details.  Unfortunately, they are Zulu names.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 24 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I cannot change them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot change them.  [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   No, I cannot change them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well, I have – I suspect that he 
is not the firstborn in his family because when you are 
given that name, it means that there is a boy or boys 
ahead of you.  [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the parents say:  Oh, it is a boy 
again!  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, it may happen that the parents were 
expecting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...a girl. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Girl, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   It is now a boy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   So they were disappointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
20 
MR ZWANE:   But it is a boy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us – I was looking at the list of the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 25 of 354 
 
names which is on page 353.129, Chairperson.  Point 129. 
CHAIRPERSON:   353.129? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On 129, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is that list, Mr Zwane, about 
sharing of the...  And those you who would not share.  I 
see under those you are going to share, number 8, there is 
that surname of Thomo.   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On which page are you? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   129.  I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   Number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Number 8...  those you are sharing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr L Thomo.  I am saying mister but 
it does not mister but it is F L Thomo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, could that be the person? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should be the person? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the organiser did not have a 
computer? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 26 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   How was he going to organise? 
MR ZWANE:   If you take it back in 2012, a local area like 
the Free State, there were many youngsters who would 
have not had the luxury of a computer, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So this is an email from Ashu, 
whom I take to be Ashu Chawla, simply because there is an 
Ashu Chawla that is connected with Sahara Computer 
because his email is ashu@sahara.co.za.   
 
So he sends an email on the 13 t h of October 
10 
2012 to nareshkhosla@susindia.com(?) and he says room-
sharing 
but 
before 
that, 
there 
is 
an 
email 
from 
mzwane@gmail.com.  I think you have accepted that that is 
your email address.  And it is on October 13, 2012 and it is 
sent – it was sent at 02:46 p.m.  And it was sent from your 
email to Ashok Narayan.   
 
Okay.  No.  So that – ja, Ashok Narayan at that 
address 
willemse@gmail.com(?) 
and 
the 
subject 
is 
Detailed Itinerary.  And it says here with rooming list as 
expected, non-sharing.  M J Zwane, T I ...[indistinct], C M 
20 
Radebe 
and 
M 
E 
Mokwena, 
MP 
Mabaso 
and 
MM 
...[indistinct]  Those are not sharing rooms.  And then the 
rest are sharing rooms.   
 
And then above that it is an email from Ashok 
Narayan that is addressed to ashu@sahara and the subject 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 27 of 354 
 
is, Room Sharing Details.  And it is sent from his iPhone as 
it is being forwarded message.   
 
And then Ashu sends, at the top, sends the room 
sharing 
details 
to 
nareshkhosla@susindia.com 
and 
khoslanaresh@hotmail.com, S M Orient(?) Hindu Dara(?) 
at - of their(?) own(?) group.com and the subject is, Room 
Sharing.  [Speaker is not clear – names and email 
addresses unclear]   
 
So as I recall you, you said this – the reason 
why this has got your email address is because a member 
10 
of the choir needed assistance to send an email and you 
offered your cell phone.  Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I offered my gadget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the way, I think you said you gave it 
to an official in your office to help her – help them.  Is that 
right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was sent by an official in your 
20 
office. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or in the department. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Ashok Narayan. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 28 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Well, as this thing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As this – yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...as this thing stands, I remember I did say 
in this Commission, Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...that I was not privy ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...to the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
I 
just 
made 
my 
gadget 
available 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...for the choir to perform ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...what they needed to perform, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So.  And you say that you 
never told anybody that you were going to be on this trip 
and that you would be one of those who would not be 
sharing rooms? 
MR ZWANE:   There is evidence, Chair, from my side 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...that I paid for my trip, my accommodation 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 29 of 354 
 
and everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   There was no need ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...for the three of us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...to be put in sharing or not sharing 
because we were not part ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...of the arrangement of ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...this itinerary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no.  I understand that.  I am 
trying to get to understand how your name came to be 
here.  So you are clear that you never the official who – to 
whom you gave your gadget that you were going to be part 
of this trip? 
MR ZWANE:   Of the choir? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the choir. 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you never told them that you should 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 30 of 354 
 
be put in the list of those who would not be sharing rooms? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you do not know where they got this 
from? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I do not know where they got this 
from.  Despite that fact, as Chair has indicated, this email 
seems to be a copy of the email which was sent, the Gmail 
which was sent.  It is not an original document from my 
gadget.  It is a copy of which I may not be privy in terms of 
the amendments that were made to that copy.   
10 
 
All what I know is that, at any stage I did not 
submit my name to the choir for – to this trip.  I did say on 
record, the last time when we were here, that my wild 
thought was that – because I performed about two songs 
with the choir, which I said earlier on, they thought maybe I 
will join them.  And I think that is what I can speculate up 
to this far, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have a recollection whether on the 
occasion you gave your gadget to the official, there was a 
member of the choir who was there in your office at the 
20 
time or who was going to be with the official who used your 
gadget? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember? 
MR ZWANE:   That happened a long time ago.  Perusing 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 31 of 354 
 
the information by Mr Theron, to my best recollection, that 
was on a weekend.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   So that I do not come in here and explain 
why I worked on a weekend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you came to the Commission on a 
public holiday, Mr Zwane.  So.  [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   ...they not be saying when I come here, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   So it was a weekend and if I recall, we had a 
programme somewhere in Thabo ...[indistinct] and the choir 
was performing there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In that function? 
MR ZWANE:   In that function ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And it was a departmental function? 
MR ZWANE:   It was a department function. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   The function, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   So I was busy doing something.  So I lent 
the gadget to lend a hand.  That is what I know, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  So, would the answer be 
that there would have been member of the choir with the 
official or you are not sure? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 32 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you know that they were performing? 
MR ZWANE:   I have said that is my suspicion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I do not know, Chair.  I was not part of this 
arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane, you have said that you paid 
for the trip yourself. 
MR ZWANE:   The department. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The department paid for the trip.  Can 
you show us where is that proof of payment?  You say it is 
here. 
MR ZWANE:   In this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Must be attached to your affidavit, is it 
not? 
MR ZWANE:   You said it is 319?  219? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   219, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The annexures to that affidavit 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   The information that I was given starts from 
235. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   236... 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 33 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The information you were given? 
MR ZWANE:   I requested for this information, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I am no longer in that department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   As I have said the last time when I was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   But give me some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   So whatever was given to me, I make sure 
10 
that I try and help the Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...to understand where I am coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  There is a – 241, the approval 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe – let us do it quickly. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page two – 353.235.  What document 
is that Mr Zwane? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Transaction log sheet.  Do you know 
what it represents?  It is written surname in English as 
Zwane, M J.  A cell number is given and then the date 
given is 07/12/12 and the transaction code is given there 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 34 of 354 
 
and another code and the badge.  What document is that 
and what is it supposed to show? 
MR ZWANE:   This is the proof, Chair that – I think this 
document has to do with subsistence(?) and travelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   It is proof that the department for this trip 
paid for my subsistence and travelling. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
what 
– 
that 
date 
of 
7 December 2012, what does it represent?  It is a date for 
what?  Do you know? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   I think this – my – let me say, Chair.  The 
documents, as they are, we normally do not get to that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...level of detail ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...as ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   MEC’s. 
MR ZWANE:   ...MEC’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   And this Commission makes – need to get to 
those details.  I may not be spot on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   But my suspicion is that this transaction log 
sheet was delayed and was only fit in after some time when 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 35 of 354 
 
I was even back from my trip to India. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the reason we have to ask is 
because you attached them to your affidavit.  So that is 
why we have to ask you what do they represent. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go to page 353.236.  What does 
that document represents?  It says, in the heading, 
Subsistence and Travelling Plan.  Name file – initials:  
10 
Zwane, 
M 
J. 
 
Personnel 
number 
is 
given. 
 
Claim 
description.  SMT.  And then next to that is written India.  
Period 
start, 
15 
October 
2012. 
 
Period 
end 
date, 
23 October 2012.  Are those dates the dates for your trip?  
Did you leave on the 15 t h of October 2012 and came back 
on the 23 r d of October 2012? 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And there is reference to advance 
taken and then there is an amount and that is – what is 
written there is 729504.  And then next to that, there is 
20 
something handwritten and it is like divide by three and 
30(a)(?).  And then on that column, there is 729504 and 
the total is 729504.  Is that the amount you claimed for 
SNT that is R 729 504,00? 
MR ZWANE:   This – I think this is the amount, Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 36 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   To the best of my knowledge, is that, this is 
– there is a formula of calculating this amount that will 
include the currency of the country where you are going 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   ...compared to the currency of the country 
where you are departing from.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but do you know whether the amount 
is what are indicating here or is it perhaps seven thousand 
10 
two hundred and ninety-five Rand four cents or is it seven 
hundred and twenty-nine thousand five hundred and four 
Rand? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair.  Let me not speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you must remember [laughs] you 
SNT claim for what ten days or whatever could have gone 
up to seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand Rand? 
MR ZWANE:   I think it is seven thousand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Seven thousand? 
MR ZWANE:   Two hundred and ninety-five. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And four cents. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, okay.  Alright.  And I see that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 37 of 354 
 
it is stamped 6 December 2012.  And you simply have 
signed on the 16 t h of November 2012 ...[indistinct] signed 
also.  Yes. Mr Seleka, do you want to say – ask any 
questions...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Zwane, I see that at the top of 
that page – oh, that is point 236, ja.  That one the period 
start date is indicated to be 15 October 2013 and the 
period end is 23 October 2012.  Do you see that?  Period 
starts …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes, I see that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the allegation regarding the India 
trip is said to have taken place on the 13 October 2012 
which will be two days before this date there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe for the sake of completeness, Mr 
Seleka, you can also just check when the choir came back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the choir, according to the 
itinerary the choir came back on the 22 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is a day before the 23 r d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Zwane? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   What must I answer, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first question is that according to 
this document that we just dealt with namely the one at 
page 353.236 your trips to – you left on the 15 t h or the SNT 
claim relates to a period starting from the 15 October 2012 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 38 of 354 
 
and ending on 23 October 2012 whereas Mr Seleka says 
the choir left on the 13 October two days before this and I 
think that question is being asked in the context of the fact 
that you – it is your evidence that you did travel in the 
same plane as the choir. 
MR ZWANE:   The trip indeed was, according to the 
approval, was meant to take place from the 15 t h to the 23 r d 
and Chair, I must indicate that I do not have an answer in 
terms of this question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   This is what I know about – but to the best 
of my recollection maybe the itinerary of the choir might be 
the one which is faulty.  To the best of my recollection, 
that is the recollection.  I may be wrong, I am happy to… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Acknowledge that point.  It is – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Now but your recollection is 
that you came back from India on the 23 October. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes because according to my itinerary I had 
an engagement of the 22 n d. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the choir – Mr Seleka says the choir 
came back on the 22 October.  Is that correct, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, I am looking at – maybe Mr 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 39 of 354 
 
Zwane will help us.  Page 353.130 and .131. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is in regard to the itinerary.  You 
will see against – there are dates there, Mr Zwane, against 
some of what is written there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see that, I do not know if Mr 
Zwane can see it, 21 October 2017, 17.00 arrival at 
Mumbai Hotel, pick up intercontinental and relax for the 
rest of the evening, 22 October, 8 o’clock breakfast at 
hotel.  9 o’clock checkout – that is now 22 n d, checkout from 
10 
the hotel and proceed for [indistinct] India, lunch outside 
nearby and going towards an Orbit Mall, shopping and 
dinner and after that straight proceed for airport to fly back 
home. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Luxury [indistinct] required at Mumbai 
International at 8 a.m. for the whole day [indistinct] and 
drop at airport at 10.30 p.m.  That must be 10.30 p.m. on 
the 22 n d, I think? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think so, Chair, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to 12 hours and 120 kilometres 
[indistinct] hour.  Well, that – if that – in terms of that 
itinerary, the choir could not have arrived back on the 22 n d.  
I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 40 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they were still going to spend a 
day there but do we have anything that shows when they 
actually arrived back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not in the files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not in – there is nothing that 
indicates… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, except for what is attached here, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it say here at page 353.131: 
“After that straight proceed for airport to fly back 
home.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if they were going to – if that is on 
the 22 n d, which much be evening, I guess, then they would 
have arrived in South Africa on the 23 r d.  A flight from India 
to South Africa, if you leave in the evening in India, you 
would arrive on the 23 r d, would you not?  Mr Zwane, you 
know you did fly. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   I think the Chair is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  I think we must just 
check, see if there is something concrete about when they 
arrived. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 41 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Of course what this does raise, Mr 
Zwane, which you obviously appreciate, I think, is it seems 
that your stay in India was for more or less the same 
duration as the choir. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So you have a situation where: 
1. You are the founder of the choir or one of the 
founders, whatever the position is, you have an 
association with the choir.  That is something.   
2. There is an email made from your gadget which lists 
10 
you as one of the people going on this trip with the 
choir.  You say it is done by an official from your 
department. 
3. You are in the same flight as them to India. 
4. You stay with – you stay in India for more or less the 
same period as them and you – and if you came back 
on the 23 r d and if this information at page 353.131 is 
correct, it looks like the planning for the choir was for 
them to arrive back in South Africa on the 23 r d as 
well.   
20 
Whether they actually arrived back on the 23 r d at this stage 
we do not know but the planning was that they should 
arrive back in South Africa on the 23 r d.  Now the planning 
of your own trip must have been that you should arrived 
back about the 23 r d as well unless the planning was that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 42 of 354 
 
you were going to come back earlier and something 
changed and did you recall whether from the beginning the 
23 r d was the planned day of return on your part or the 
department’s part for your trip? 
MR ZWANE:   There are two issues here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I thought earlier on I was asked a question 
whether the choir travelled on the 13 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, yes, ja, yes.  Do you want to 
deal with that? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   No, I am just saying on this issue 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On what I am saying. 
MR ZWANE:   What the Chairperson is raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, there is a difference. 
MR ZWANE:   There is a difference there.  Number two 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I accept that, that is why I said 
almost. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I said it is for almost the same period. 
MR ZWANE:   Number two, if you look at 241. 
CHAIRPERSON:   353.241. 
MR ZWANE:   353.241. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 43 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I had a clear itinerary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us get there, 241. 
MR ZWANE:   2.3, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?  243? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   241.  It starts on 241, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR ZWANE:   241, point 2.3, down there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just say it again, I am getting 
confused.   
MR ZWANE:   The page [intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   353 point? 
MR ZWANE:   241. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am there. 
MR ZWANE:   Down there, 2.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let start – first say this appears to be a 
letter from Mr M Peter, head of department for Agriculture, 
addressed to the Premier, Honourable E S Magashule, Free 
State Provincial Government and the subject is: 
“Request for approval for MEC of Department for 
Agriculture and Rural Development Mr M J Zwane, 
20 
Ms I T Motaung and Ashok Narayan to attend a 
strategic meeting with the Department of Agriculture 
and strategic partners in India from the 15 to 23 
October 2012.” 
Okay, so yes, continue. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 44 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I am saying 2.3 will give indication to this 
Commission about my business in India. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, yes, 2.3 says – that off that 
letter says: 
“The 
following 
meetings 
have 
therefore 
been 
arranged for the MEC: 
1. Minister of Agriculture State of Uttarakhand, Mr 
Shiveja Singh Rawat on October 16 at Dehradun. 
2. Minister of Agriculture State of [indistinct] Mr 
Vidushi Yadav on October 18 at Agra. 
10 
3. Meeting and talk of Pares dairy, October 19, 
2012. 
4. Minister of Agriculture, State of Maharashtra, Mr 
R V Patel(?) on October 22 at Mumbai. 
And then 4.1 says on page 353.242: 
It is recommended that approval be granted by the 
Honourable Premier for Mr M J Zwane, Ms I t 
Motaung and Mr Ashok Narayan, to undertake a trip 
to India from 15 to 23 October 2012.” 
So the point you are making is that from the start your trip 
20 
was planned to be from 15 October to 23, you would depart 
on the 15 October and arrive back on the 23 October.  You 
say that was your trip as organised by the department. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  But you accept, I guess, 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 45 of 354 
 
you accept that – you accept the things that I was 
observing to say – except for saying if the choir left on the 
13 t h, you left on the 15 t h, but you accept that it is almost 
the same duration. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and Chair on – I mean, on the first 
one, going out, Mr Zwane, if you flew on the same flight, 
only date can be correct.  Either the 13 t h or the 15 t h.  So it 
is neither here nor there which date at this point but the 
10 
fact that you flew out together, so your trip coincided 
almost to the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, almost exactly, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you could not have been on the 
same flight with them to India and be on the same flight 
with them from South Africa to India again on the 15 t h.  So 
either your department has got it wrong about the 15 t h or 
somebody else who says the choir left on the 13 t h got it 
wrong, it is not the 13 t h, it is the 15 t h.  But in the end it 
20 
might not matter whether it is the 13 t h or the 15 t h if it is 
accepted, as you do accept, that you were on the same 
flight to India with the choir and indications are that the 
choir must have arrived back on the 23 r d as well.  We are 
not sure but we suspect based on that itinerary.  If the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 46 of 354 
 
choir also arrived back on the 23 r d then your period of – or 
the trip with the choir is exactly the same, if that is the 
position.  So you accept that, those facts, except that we 
are not sure that the choir arrived back on the 23 r d but it 
looks like it, that is what we are saying. 
MR ZWANE:   I am also not sure whether I was right when 
I said we travelled together on the 15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I think we must change that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Must change that.  Ja, okay. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   But, Chair, the issue here as raised by Mr 
Theron 
was that I travelled together with the choir 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the expense of… 
MR ZWANE:   At the expense of the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Guptas, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   That was an issue and I have since in this 
Commission, I reflected that that is not correct.  The issue 
that we are talking about now, it is beyond my control.  In 
a plane as you go to India or China or anywhere, there are 
20 
obviously 
people 
in 
that 
plan 
which 
have 
booked 
themselves going where they are going.  Some are going 
where you are going and they are from South Africa.  I 
have met a number of people on my various trips whom I 
know.  Where are you going?  I am going to China or 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 47 of 354 
 
Russia.  When are you coming back?  Maybe there will be 
a difference of two, three days.  That to me is not an issue, 
I think what I was trying to reflect in this Commission is 
that the assertions as made by Mr Theron, because I think 
Mr Theron is the reason why we had to get to this point, I 
am not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think, Mr Zwane, the point you 
make is an important point, namely that you are dealing 
with the allegation that your trip was paid for by Guptas at 
all. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are saying I have checked with the 
department, here are documents that support my version 
that I was – this was an official trip and it was not paid for 
by the Guptas, it would have been paid for by the 
department.  But the other aspects, that we have been 
dealing with, may be related to the issue that you said that 
you may have been in the plane, the same plane, was just 
a coincidence, you were not involved in the planning of the 
choir trip, that it might go to say was it all a coincidence 
20 
but you are right to say the issue of who paid is an 
important issue for your trip.  Ja. 
Okay, alright, let us take the tea adjournment, we 
will resume at quarter to twelve, it is nearly twenty five to.  
We adjourn. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 48 of 354 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   So, I believe we 
have exhausted that part, you might have some questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we have exhausted this email, ja, 
let’s continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Very well, Mr Zwane I will go back to 
Mr Theron’s affidavit, which is on page 353.22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 353.22. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   Okay, so we dealt with .21, we 
dealt with .21, the allegation in paragraph 30.  
MR ZWANE:   Can I get the page, sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, 353.21 
MR ZWANE:   Point .21? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And this is Annexure NDZ? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No Annexure ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at the black numbers, remember to 
look at the black numbers on the left corner of each page. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Okay, okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   353.21, and that is Mr Theron’s affidavit 
as I understand the position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Point .21? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 49 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you found it? 
MR ZWANE:   Okay I found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, what we have been dealing with is 
paragraph 30, paragraph 30? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of particular concern is the evidence.  
of a kick-back from the Gupta’s to Zwane and other 
officials in the department who facilitate in the 
Estina scheme in October 2012, shortly after the 
10 
launch of the Estina project, Zwane, officials from 
his 
department 
and 
local 
gospel 
choir…[Intervenes]”.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, Mr Seleka, don’t forget the 
question or point you wanted to pursue.  Can we go back 
or no, we don’t need to go back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the purpose of your trip to 
India on 15 October to 23 October 2012? 
MR ZWANE:   As shown in my itinerary I was going to meet 
20 
with different Ministers and …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was two Ministers, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, it was two Ministers…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think when I looked at that letter from 
Mr Thabethe to the Premier, it was two Ministers is that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 50 of 354 
 
right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the one was Minister of Agriculture 
the other one – or they were Ministers of Agriculture from 
different states? 
MR ZWANE:   Different states yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but both were Ministers of 
Agriculture? 
MR ZWANE:   I should also indicate, Chair, that in that 
itinerary I was scheduled to go and see the plant in Paras. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In Paras, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   When I was there, I think the CEO of the 
company was not available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   So that trip did not materialise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That meeting with the CEO? 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, ja of Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Did not materialise, that is why consistently 
in my affidavit I have been saying I’ve never been to 
Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And I’ve never been there, but just to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 51 of 354 
 
complete the question you have asked, Chair, after the 
announcement of Mahoma Mobung there were actually a 
number of projects in that Mahoma Mobung concept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   And they were divided in terms of the 
districts of the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   I can recall, we had vegetable farming, we 
had fishery, we had meat, we had sheep farming just to 
mention, but a few.  We will collaborate with any country 
10 
who shows interest in those projects.  So, as I went out, 
it’s not only India, I remember that the fishery was, at 
some point finally supported by the Chinese and it 
happened.  As to how far it is now, I can’t tell, I know that 
the poultry was also supported by a company called VKB in 
the Free State and a number of farmers, have, since 
benefitted out of that project, so that was the aim, Chair, 
thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, was the purpose of the trip, 
therefore – of your trip, therefore, to meet with the two 
20 
Ministers of Agriculture, from different states and to visit 
the Paras part or head quarters, is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, that’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are the three important things you 
were to do while you were in India, as far as the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 52 of 354 
 
department was concerned? 
MR ZWANE:   There were four Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   I think we are using the fourth one, I can 
quickly…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s go – where is that letter from Mr 
Thabethe? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   353.241. 
CHAIRPERSON:   241? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   There were actually three Ministers I was 
supposed to meet with Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was three? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the one was Mr Rawat, Singh 
Rawat and the other was Mr Yadav.  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the other was Mr Patel, Mr Patel 
was on the 22 n d, yes.  So, on the 16 t h of October, Mr 
Rawat, on the 18 t h of October, Mr Yadav and then on the 
20 
22 n d of October Mr Patel.  Okay and then, Paras was 
supposed to be on the 19 t h yes, okay, alright, thank you, 
Mr Seleka then we can…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 53 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me just pursue this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can go back to the – oh you are 
pursuing something…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me just…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane then it means – you say the 
tour to the Paras plant didn’t take place? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the 19 t h became open – the 19 t h of 
October became open for you? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, it was open for me, yes Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, from your itinerary we also see 
that the 17 t h, the 20 t h and the 21 s t seem to be open for 
you.  So, what – you say yes? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so, on those days which – four 
days, would you mind telling the Chairperson what would 
have been your activities, in those days because the 
itinerary for the choir  has those days, maybe you 
20 
accompanied the choir on those days? 
MR ZWANE:   No, thanks Advocate Seleka.  Chair, I did 
say, indeed, one or two occasions I did go and watch the 
choir performing, I did say that in this Commission.  
Normally if you have meetings back-to-back like this you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 54 of 354 
 
have information, you come back, you process it, if there’s 
any issue that you need to follow up, then you have the 
day to do that follow up so that when you come back and 
give a report, you have tried your level best to actually 
give account fruitfully.  So, normally those days we’ll then 
deal with, how was the trip, how was the meeting, do we 
need to make a follow up when we are still here, on any 
other issue, call back home if you need to call back home 
and get some more information and provide, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you say, you did meet with the 
10 
choir? 
MR ZWANE:   I did say last time, Chair when I was here, 
that I did meet with the choir once or twice,  yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, once or twice.  The tour which 
didn’t take place, as you say, to Paras plant what was the 
purpose for that? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I did indicate that the top official there, 
I think the CEO was not available, he had some urgent 
matters to attend to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but what was the purpose? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   The purpose was that, because I was 
already going to India for these others, check for myself in 
terms of the report that I got from the officials about the 
capacity that Paras has, by and large, that was the 
purpose, Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 55 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were going to check Paras capacity 
to do what? 
MR ZWANE:   We were informed that Paras had capacity in 
terms of quantities, milk quantities, it also had a rise in 
terms of marketing, selling milk and I thought, when I was 
there, I may as well verify the report that was given to the 
Executive and myself, in terms of Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That is why I wanted to meet with the top 
10 
official and just ascertain whether we were in the right 
direction. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
remember 
whether 
Mr 
Thabethe’s trip to India preceded yours or you preceded 
his? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair I don’t remember those details. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do know he did go to India? 
MR ZWANE:   I know he did go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and he – I would imagine when he 
came back, he would have given you a report? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s if of course it did precede 
yours…[intervenes]. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 56 of 354 
 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
He 
would 
have 
had 
information…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would have got all the information. 
MR ZWANE:   Even if I was to be the first to go, he would 
have already had information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   About this Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it seems to me, and I want you 
to comment on this, it seems to me that the Paras meeting 
wouldn’t really have been essential for you if, indeed, your 
10 
DG or Head of Department had been there because he 
would be the operations man, he would be the one who 
would have got all the information, in order to be able to 
make an assessment whether Paras could be a partner but 
it may be that, because you were going to be in India 
anyway, you might have thought, if we are going to have – 
if my department is going to have a working relationship 
with Paras I may as well see them so – but in terms of it 
being essential, it probably wouldn’t have been, would you 
agree or would you not agree? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Unfortunately, I don’t agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you think it was very essential? 
MR ZWANE:   My role is to play oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Even on these issues that there is a report 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 57 of 354 
 
that there is a black file with white papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   As I get a chance to play an oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   It is important for me to go and see whether 
this file exists. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   It is in the condition that I was told it is and 
those details. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
We 
normally 
do 
that 
in 
our 
work 
as…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, in interrupted you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Chair the affidavit of 
Mr Thabethe is in the Bundle, his trip was, according to 
him, on the 29 t h of February 2012 to the 4 t h of March 2012 
so it would have preceded this one in October 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if that is so, my recollection is that 
20 
by October a lot of ground had been covered in terms of 
this Estina project.  So, your meeting wouldn’t have been 
an essential meeting because by then, if my recollection is 
correct,  the decision to partner with Paras had long been 
made, I may be mistaken, but I’m thinking there was an 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 58 of 354 
 
agreement that was concluded in June or July, I think there 
were three contracts. I think the one was July 5 if I’m not 
mistaken July 5 I know that there was one…[intervenes].   
ADV SELEKA SC:   June, 7 June 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   7 June, and so on so, the relevant 
decisions had long been made if that is the case. 
MR ZWANE:   Hence I’ve raised an issue of an oversight, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you can’t verify whether they 
exist when you have already signed an agreement with 
them, you should verify that before you sign agreements, 
isn’t it? 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, let me just…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say, even if they’ve signed, I want 
to see. 
MR ZWANE:    Let me just make a practical example Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   In the space where I’m working, the 
Department of Transport through its entity having acquired 
a property in the airport in Brazil long before I become the 
Chairperson there.  We normally apply to go on oversight 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 59 of 354 
 
to go and see this property whether it exists…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is happening there? 
MR ZWANE:   Whether what is on the paper is on the 
ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That is normally a known. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   It’s actually better if everything has been 
signed because you’re not seen as a politician running 
ahead of you in terms of these processes in terms of PFMA 
10 
that may not need you to be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   In terms of the …[indistinct], once those 
processes are done then we can come in and say, indeed 
there is this there is this, but you said that was there and 
it’s not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes Chair the affidavit of Mr 
20 
Thabethe makes an interesting reading and that’s on page 
353.340 - .340. 
MR ZWANE:   .340 okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
From 
paragraph 
9 
onwards, 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 60 of 354 
 
so…[intervenes]. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I’m there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says, 
“I then made a request – well India he says is 
identified as the highest milk producer and there 
was already a bilateral agreement on Agriculture 
between South Africa and India.  I then made a 
request to the Premier honourable ES Magashule on 
recommendations of the former MEC Mosebenzi 
Zwane to take a trip to India, accompanied by Mr 
10 
Ashok Narayan and I advised that to the office of 
the Premier at that time”, 
 
But, in fact he was not at the time, because his 
appointment was only on the 1 s t of March, I’ll show you the 
letter.  So, the first part, Mr Zwane is that this trip was 
taken at your recommendation, to India. 
MR ZWANE:   There was information as I get it here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   About this Paras having this quantities and 
so forth and so, where did that information come from? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But was the trip undertaken at your 
recommendation? 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
No 
Chair, 
I 
don’t 
remember 
me 
recommending – in fact, we don’t dictate to officials as to 
how they do their work especially when it comes to issues 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 61 of 354 
 
of third parties who are appointed in a process that we are 
not party to.  We normally don’t involve ourselves. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but this is contrary to the 
oversight, you claim, because in this case it’s only to go 
and – go to India look at – you will see as he goes further 
in his affidavit, is to visit, precisely this company called 
Paras.  So, I think his allegation would be consistent with 
your position that you would play an oversight role 
because he’s not operating the project, he’s only taking a 
trip to visit this potential company. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   May I answer Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That is not his role to play, oversight.  
Oversight 
is 
always 
played 
by 
politicians, 
officials 
implement.  I see nothing wrong about this trip, I must say, 
if in his mind, he wanted to make sure before he appoints 
these people that, indeed, what is said about them does 
exist, he was free to go to India. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that’s fine but the one point 
which is of interest is that I read his affidavit, paragraph 9 
20 
to mean that you were the one who recommended that he 
undertakes this trip together with Mr Ashok Narayan.  Now, 
if I recall from his evidence, when he was giving evidence, 
and I may be mistaken, but I seem to think that he said 
that when you told him about him going with Mr Narayan to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 62 of 354 
 
India, that he said, you said, that came from the Premier.  I 
hope I’m not wrong, but he certainly said it was – the fact 
that he had to go with Narayan who wasn’t something that 
came from him and he seems to have said, you told him, 
you mentioned it to him, but if my recollection is correct, it 
seems that you might have got that from the Premier.  
Does that jog your memory at all? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I do remember vividly what happened 
there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   And I did, on several occasions painted that 
picture and you will see in my affidavit, I have been very 
consistent.  I have said to this Commission that there was 
a practice up until I left Free State, that if you are going on 
a trip as a department, after all your arrangement there 
was a section in the – associated with the Premier ’s 
department not office, department called International 
Relations.  They would always recommend an official to 
accompany you who will be conversant, for example, if we 
go to China, there were people who were trained in 
20 
Mandarin in China who would be able to take you through 
tradition and customs in China and be able to interpret the 
Mandarin, that was the practice.  It did not need a Premier 
to 
pinpoint 
an 
individual, 
this 
individual 
would 
be 
recommended to us and when we do our request, which in 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 63 of 354 
 
this case, will obviously be done by him to the Premier 
then we…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, what you say – I think you say will 
be done by him, I found it strange that it was done by him 
in regard to you. I would have thought that if an MEC 
wanted the Premier ’s permission to travel overseas the 
MEC would write to the Premier rather than an official 
writing to the Premier asking the Premier to release the 
MEC.  I can understand him writing in regard to officials of 
the department, but I found that a little strange but, maybe 
10 
you say, no that’s how we used to do things. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, on the face value it looks strange but 
the practicalities that puts me here today, if I want to run 
to the Premier, I wouldn’t be able to prove aspersions cast 
to me by everybody that I travel to India on a trip all paid 
by the Gupta’s, no.  so, the paper trail has to be done 
through correct channels by officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Once, the MEC has taken a decision that – I 
think it is prudent for the department to visit here and 
20 
there, then we get into an official process of requesting 
and that process, indeed, will be overseen by the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    
Okay, no, that’s fine, Mr Seleka? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 64 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane isn’t it 
that Paras was going to team up with Estina to supply 
services or manage the project at Vrede? 
MR ZWANE:   I wouldn’t have known details in terms of the 
nitty gritty’s because that process is not a process we are 
involved in, Chair but I know, the information and the 
report, as it was given, was that Paras was a big dairy 
company who’d assist the project to the level which we 
wanted it to be, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see, in Mr Thabethe’s affidavit, 
10 
paragraph 10, you don’t need to go there, that he says, on 
his trip to India with Mr Narayan he did meet with the CEO 
of Paras Dairy for some reason he said, who’s name will be 
divulged at a later stage and he explained the whole chain 
of milk production in India.  He says there were also staff 
members of Paras who were further accompanied by the 
Indian delegation to visit the processing plant and in India 
I brought back my presentation from the Paras.  It is on our 
return from India, that is paragraph 11,  
“that I then developed an Executive Council’s report 
20 
carrying recommendations into the concept of a 
dairy 
project 
identified 
in 
India 
as 
Siyata 
...[indistinct] MPPC’s.  After the Indian trip Mr 
Narayan went back to the office of the Premier as 
he was not part of my team save for the sake of 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 65 of 354 
 
accompanying me to India.  The executive council 
upon receiving the report on recommendations of the 
MEC 
from 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
then 
approved  – approval document is ...” 
I 
am 
just 
mentioning 
that 
that 
is 
what 
I 
have 
just 
...[indistinct] in other words even though you may not have 
met the CEO Mr – Mr Thabethe had met the CEO of Paras. 
Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Zwane if you say you did not 
know the details Paras – Paras role of Estina in order to 
manage the project in October which is about four or five 
months after the agreement is signed for the purposes of a 
project which you initiated.  Why would you not have known 
what Paras role is in the project? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I am saying the report that we got 
indicated that Paras had the capacity to deal with the 
project.  That stemmed from interactions that I was not part 
of because of PFMA but officials will deal with those details 
20 
in terms of appointing a service provider that is suitable for 
the project.   
 
Now those details will not be the details that in Paras 
there is this one and this one and this one it surprises when 
you are being informed that this is a company that is going 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 66 of 354 
 
to do work, this is the profile of the company and if you have 
time then you can play an oversight over what you have 
been told about the company. 
 
You do not go back and get details as to the nitty 
gritty’s in terms of that company who will be sub-contracted, 
who will be doing this.  Unless there is something that is 
being raised at a later stage either by Auditor General or 
Treasurer or somebody saying there is something here then 
you dig deeper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thanks Chair.  But I think you can 
freely tell the Chairperson because your response seems to 
suggest that it is Paras you were contracting with but it was 
not. You contracted with Estina a company called Estina.  
And in paragraph 12 Chair Mr Thebethe explains how Estina 
comes about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is true. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But you could tell – say to the 
Chairperson here is Paras in October you go to Paras for a 
tour to India to tour amongst other Paras – you say that did 
20 
not happen but you are saying to the Chairperson you were 
playing an oversight role but this is not a company you 
contracted with.  You should be actually looking at Estina – 
who is Estina because I want to play an oversight role and 
hence the reason for my question.  What did you understand 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 67 of 354 
 
Paras to be playing in the project – to be its role in the 
project?  And I am asking you this let me conclude it 
because then you can address everything.  That Paras is 
said to have denied its involvement in the project.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us start with this.   You 
accept that no agreement – I just hope I am right now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
No 
agreement 
was 
ever 
concluded 
between the Department of Agriculture and Paras in regard 
to the Estina project. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Well Chair maybe let me say before we – we 
get to that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  It is a fact that my HOD together with Ashok 
Narayan went to India and went to Paras and this is a fact in 
terms of the report we got.  That necessitated me when I was 
going to India to go and verify what was in the report for the 
longest time I have been under the impression that Paras is 
the one that is doing work in Vrede on the project called 
Vrede Dairy.  And until there were issues that were raised by 
20 
Auditor General I think in mid-2013 I have been operating 
under that impression.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
when 
you 
discovered 
that 
the 
Department had never concluded any agreement with Paras 
what did you do in circumstances where – when were all 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 68 of 354 
 
along you were under the impression that the department 
had an agreement with Paras? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair if I was still in the department and in this 
case unfortunately I was no longer in the department 
because I left the department early March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013. 
MR ZWANE:    2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013. 
MR ZWANE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but when you discovered was it after 
10 
you had left the department when you discovered that… 
MR ZWANE:  The report of the Auditor General was after 
when I had left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR ZWANE:  And there was subsequently a report I think by 
Treasury which came at a later stage when I was no longer 
there.  So the remedial actions would have happened even 
when I was no longer there. 
 
I know as well seated here having read all the 
information that is before me that there were issues in terms 
20 
of the contract as you earlier have indicated that there was a 
contract in June which was subsequently  
CHAIRPERSON:  Replaced by another one in July. 
MR ZWANE:  Replaced by another one and government was 
involved at a higher – at the highest level in terms of that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 69 of 354 
 
contract which normally is not in the prevue ordinarily of our 
sects.  Yes.  In my affidavit the first affidavit I have tried to 
paint a picture as to the process you iden – you go to the 
community you identify their needs then you come up with a 
concept as I have done.   
And this concept is tested for a lack of a better word 
even at the level of the executive after having tested it with 
the department.  And everybody says no this is a concept 
that we think it is correct and we can try this concept.  And 
then thereafter once this concept has passed it went through 
10 
the state of the province which was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but hang on Mr Zwane we understand 
that.  
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is really relates to Paras. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you have said that you did get to know 
at some stage that the Department of Agriculture had not 
concluded any contracts or agreement with Paras but you 
say you only got to know that after you had left the 
20 
department. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you say you left the Department 
of Agriculture in March 2013. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 70 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now did Mr Thabethe the HOD of your 
department tell you that there was a contract between the 
department and Paras? Is that where you got the information 
from or where did you get the information from that the – 
there was an agreement or contract between the department 
and Paras? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair there was information as I indicated 
earlier that there is a company called Paras in India which 
has the capacity to undertake the magnitude of the project 
that we envisaged.  And as such officials went to India to 
10 
verify and they came back and they were happy.  Right.  And 
then the work started internally in terms of administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question is did Mr Thabethe tell 
you that the department had concluded an agreement with 
Paras or did he not tell you?  Where did you get the 
impression from that the – there was an agreement between 
the Department of Agriculture and Paras? 
MR ZWANE:  Because normally Chair nobody will be given 
work without having followed the due processes as we all 
know that.  So that was my impression about Paras. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but was it your impression or did he 
tell you as the HOD?  Remember that this is somebody that 
had undertaken a trip to Paras in India. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you knew about that trip.  You 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 71 of 354 
 
obviously approved the trip as the MEC – when I say 
approved I do not necessarily mean 00:11:51 but I do not 
think you would have gone there without political approval 
but – and you say you knew about the trip – you supported 
the trip.  The Premier supported the trip – approved the trip.  
Now did he say to you we do have an agreement as the 
department with Paras or did he not say that? 
MR ZWANE:  I do not remember him saying such Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So your impression that there was an 
agreement between the department and Paras was based on 
10 
what? 
MR ZWANE:  My agreement was based on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your impression. 
MR ZWANE:  My impression was based on the fact that it 
was a common cause that there should be processes – due 
processes that are followed in identifying a service provider.  
And that – those processes are then undertaken by HOD 
assisted by other officials.  And once the HOD has taken all 
these processes we are ready to move.   
We do not many a times get to a point where we are 
20 
shown contracts or are told about contracts being ready.  In 
the report normally what comes is that we are going to be 
working with Paras which in this case was the case I was 
told.  That is why in October I also wanted to go and play my 
oversight when I was in India.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 72 of 354 
 
That is – that is how far I knew about Paras Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever ask Mr Thabethe for the 
agreement 
with 
Paras 
because 
you 
were 
under 
the 
impression that the Department had an agreement with 
Paras, did you ever ask him to show you the agreement? 
MR ZWANE:  We do not normally do that if there is nothing 
untoward or there is a query raised Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how are you going to play your 
oversight if your department has or you understand the 
department to have contracts with another entity involving 
10 
millions and millions or rands and you never even want to 
see this contract? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair there were a number of contracts that 
were entered into by the department except this contract.  
Those contracts were not shown to us not only me and other 
MEC’s what you normally get as a report is that here is a 
service provider who is going to do these things after 
processes have been undertaken and if you have any 
questions you do not raise your question at that particular 
point or if there is any suspicion you then go deep to say 
20 
was the due processes followed and how were they – the 
processes followed?  Reading by any suspicion but if there 
is no suspicion what you normally do is to ensure that what 
the HOD has undertaken to do is taking place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my questions – you said as MEC you – 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 73 of 354 
 
your role is play oversight. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over the department over the HOD.  You 
take the trouble of wanting to make this CEO at – of Paras 
wanting to go to Paras and meet them because you want to 
even verify whether this Paras exists or whatever you want 
to verify.  One would have thought that if you want to do that 
the least you would do is let me see the contract that the 
department has.  How do you play oversight in regard to a 
project where you have no idea what the contract says about 
10 
the project and the partnership? 
MR ZWANE:  Let me revert back to my earlier example of a 
property owned by ACSA in Brazil. If we apply to go and play 
our oversight in Brazil it has never happened Chair that we 
normally would get into the details of saying let us see how 
the contract – how this property was acquired, the contract 
and so forth.  We look at the report in front of us and based 
on that report we take that report with, we go and play our 
oversight.  If there are issues we pick up there we then come 
back and say there are these issues give us further 
20 
information.  So normally that is how we – we do things.  So 
it would not have come to me that in this case specifically I 
must look for a contract before I go there.  Because that has 
not been the norm.  I do not think any MEC in the Free State 
has done that Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 74 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then you – if you do not do it that way 
– you do not ask to see the contract when you see the 
contract you might not need to go through every clause but 
at least you can look at the main clauses or features there 
might be a memorandum that explains to you the main 
features of the contract but at least you see it.   
Now when you do not see it and you do not call for 
the contract the result may be what happened namely in 
October 2012 you are under the impression that your 
department has a contract with Paras.  You are in India – 
10 
you want to meet with the CEO of Paras and I suspect you 
are going to say to the CEO of Paras I know that we have a 
contract with you and then he would say what are you talking 
about?   
You 
would 
feel 
embarrassed 
I 
would 
imagine.  
Because you did not have – the department did not have a 
contract. But then the question that arises is even the trip 
that Mr Thabethe undertook to India even whatever expenses 
if any may have been connected with your meeting with him 
maybe there were not any because you were going to be in 
20 
India anyway or other meetings they could have been  
MR ZWANE:  Fruitless. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Wasteful 
– 
fruitless 
and 
wasteful 
expenditure because why are going to India to meet an entity 
with whom you have no contract?  You understand.  Whereas 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 75 of 354 
 
if you asked for the contract you would have been told there 
– the department would have failed to give you a contract 
and you would have said but why – what kind of partnership 
do you say we have with Paras is we do not even have a 
contract.  You would have raised that question is it not? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair let me answer that question simply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  By referring you to page 241 – it is 353.241.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am there. 
MR ZWANE:  As the Chair has read this letter that goes to 
10 
the Premier and the letter is from the HOD. This letter has 
an itinerary that points me to Paras in October as the Chair 
is saying. I mean if my assertion in this commission is not 
right why would in my itinerary rating by the HOD still write 
Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no nobody says – nobody says you 
were not – you are saying you were under the impression 
that the department had a contract with Paras 
MR ZWANE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you are not in a position to say 
20 
Mr Thabethe told you that the department had a contract with 
Paras. Okay.  Nobody says your impression – your evidence 
that you were under that impression is wrong.  So nobody is 
saying your – you were – you did not have that impression.  
You understand.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 76 of 354 
 
So – so I asked you what gave rise to that impression 
and you may legitimately point to among other things the fact 
that in the letter that the – Mr Thabethe wrote to the Premier 
he said you were going to meet – you were going to have a 
meeting with Paras officials or whoever.  There may be other 
things that he said to you that made you gain that – that 
gave you that impression.  
But what is strange to me is that also Mr Thabethe 
when he was giving evidence before this commission if I 
recall correctly I certainly understood him for quite some 
10 
time to be saying we were working with Paras.  But one was 
looking for the contract.  So where is the contract with 
Paras?  Because we can only see an agreement between the 
department and Estina and Estina is not Paras.   
And then he said if I recall correctly he was under the 
impression that there was an agreement between Estina and 
Paras that Estina would be assisted by Paras or something 
like that.   
But the whole project I think was promoted on the 
basis that Paras was part of the project but there was 
20 
nothing in writing that had been signed by Paras with the 
department to say Paras was part of the project.  That is my 
recollection.  Does it accord with your understanding? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I think your recollection will come handy 
with what I have referred to the Chair to. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 77 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  In October already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Paras was still an entity or a service provider 
according to my knowledge and impression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your understanding. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But now what did you know Estina’s 
role to be in this project as at October 2012?  Did you know 
about Estina at all? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not know about Estina? 
MR ZWANE:  No Sir – no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When did you hear about Estina being 
involved in this project for the first time? 
MR ZWANE:  AI think there was an issue raised by Treasury 
if I – if I recall well and Estina – that is why the Vrede Dairy 
ended up in 00:25:30 the Estina Vrede Dairy.  And when 
asking is Paras Estina then there was information there I 
think at the level of EXCO if I am not mistaken I cannot 
20 
recall that these companies were working together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do you recall around about when it was 
that this… 
MR ZWANE:  I think it was 20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transpired. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 78 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:  I think it was 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you still in the department? 
MR ZWANE:  No I was long gone by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So by the time you left the department in 
March 2013. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not heard about Estina being 
involved in this project. 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Thabethe had never told you about it 
10 
either in writing or verbally. 
MR ZWANE:  No Chair not of what I remember.  No.  That is 
why in October I was still going to Paras.  I would have 
endeavoured to check where is Estina – what – what does it 
look like as I play my oversight? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that – this is very strange or 
interesting but then Mr Zwane you have to concede that 
there must have been something wrong with how you were 
performing your oversight function over the department and 
over the HOD.  If for at least a year 2012 because Mr 
20 
Thabethe went to India to see – to visit Paras in February 
2012 you left the department in March 2013. If for a whole 
year you were under the impression that in regard to this 
project Paras was the department’s partner it had a contract 
with the department on this project and you had heard 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 79 of 354 
 
nothing about Estina which was the entity that actually had 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
department 
then 
there 
must 
something that was terribly wrong with performing oversight 
functions.   
Whatever it is we might not be able to detect that 
maybe but any oversight where your own HOD – where your 
department can give you the impression that it has a 
contract with an entity a involving millions and millions of 
rands on a certain project when actually it only has a 
contract with b and you are – you are not aware of this entity 
10 
called b then there must something that is not going well.  It 
should not be like that is it not? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair I think this commission will appreciate 
that I did take an initiative of playing oversight on the 
information that was before me.  And the evidence is here 
right in front of the commission.   
2. The Chair has just said in terms of his best recollection 
the HOD when he was here gave an impression that he 
himself was under that impression that Paras was actually 
...[indistinct – word cut off] provider.  Now, Chair, I think I 
20 
did indicate this previously that this are the people 
appointed 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
knowledge, 
skills 
and 
qualifications to do this work as given to them by law.  Now 
if a report comes to me and I follow the report, and as this 
Commission can see, that I did attempt to go and meet with 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 80 of 354 
 
the service provider and it is here in the itinerary, I would 
not have, honestly, a view that I was not played my 
oversight.   
 
If at all, the evidence in this Commission was 
contrary, 
even 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
...[indistinct] 
understanding that no Estina has always been there and I 
am talking about – but I will agree with the Chair.  The 
Chair is saying, in terms of his own recollection, that is 
what HOD(?) said in this Commission.  And I am saying 
that is correct.  That was also the information given to me.   
10 
 
So I follow that information and a report was 
given 
to 
me 
and 
I 
played 
my 
oversight 
over 
the 
...[indistinct]  I am not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Zwane, the proposition is.  There 
must be something terrible wrong in the performance of 
oversight if it leads to a situation where the MEC of the 
department thinks the department has a contract with a 
company in India ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and it turns out, he even wants to go 
20 
and meet with the CEO of that company in India and it 
turns out that his department never had a contract with 
that company, number one.  Number two, if it turns out that 
its – his department had a contract with a local company, 
Estina, and for a whole year it did not know about.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 81 of 354 
 
 
I am saying there must be something terrible 
wrong if performance of the oversight function by the MEC 
does not enable him to discover that.  Do you disagree? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Why?  You think oversight – the 
oversight function would be performed quite well if such 
challenges would arise? 
MR ZWANE:   I am painting a picture here, Chair, that 
oversight is played in terms of the information that is 
placed before you.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   When you play oversight, you do not go and 
dig what is not in front of you unless there is an 
information or somebody has raised an issue in terms of 
this same report that is in front of you.  The report 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you call for information as well. 
MR ZWANE:   There is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You must just rely on what officials give 
you.  You must have an understanding that will enable you 
20 
to say:  I see what you are giving me but there is 
something else that you should be giving me that you are 
not giving me.  I want that.  Where is this?  Where is that?  
Where is that?  Bring it here.  That is what you should do.  
You should not say:  This is what the officials give me.  I 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 82 of 354 
 
will only look at what the officials give me.  What do you 
say to that? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair it not like that, unfortunately, in 
the public sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   You do not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You say it is fine if – are you saying that 
as an MEC in playing – in performing your oversight 
function over the department, you must only look at what 
the officials give you?  You must not call for other 
10 
documents that they might not be giving you which are 
important or relevant for your oversight function? 
MR ZWANE:   Once you know that there are documents 
that are not given to you, once that comes to your 
knowledge, you will indeed request for that additional 
information.  It is a standard in the departments that in a 
particular time you must get the report in terms of how 
things are going.  In a particular time, you must then play 
your oversight based on the report that is placed before 
you. 
20 
 
Now I am saying to this Commission.  Based on 
the information that was put before me, signed by the HOD 
about Paras, it is here.  I was going to Paras myself in 
October to play my oversight because at that particular 
time there was nothing that was suspicious in terms of the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 83 of 354 
 
reports.  In fact, on the hindsight, if the meeting with Paras 
I had, had materialised I would have picked it up there that 
no I am knocking at the wrong door.  Yes. 
 
And I would have without any hesitation acted 
and then I would have then gone to what the Chair is 
saying:  No, bring the documents and let me see the 
contract.  Embarrassed as I would be but I will then, at that 
point, because there is this issue that has been raised.  I 
know about it.  Get to deeper details.  But if there is 
nothing, normally Chair, we do not ask for something that 
10 
we do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, let me allow you to put 
questions to mister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know we are four minutes to one but I 
think let us adjourn for lunch at quarter past one.  Let me 
give you a chance to... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Yes, Mr Zwane, 
a couple of things and I was struck by the fact that you 
said the meeting with the CEO of Paras in Indian did not 
20 
take place but I thought that itinerary of yours would have 
been arranged on the basis that whoever you were going to 
see has agreed to see you.  It is a prior arrangement.  That 
is why it is then dated.  Even the date is there and you 
would know which day you are seeing who, which day you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 84 of 354 
 
are seeing which one.  So how come that the CEO was not 
available? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I did say the CEO was not available.  
Something urgent had cropped up.  I did say that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Two.  In regard to – back to the 
issues the Chairperson has been dealing with you.  Chair, I 
– we might as well just go into this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  No, that is fine. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure, Mr Zwane, you can see this is 
not – the picture that you emerges is – you are going all 
the way to India to meet with somebody that you believe is 
the CEO of the company that the department has an 
agreement with, actually that is wrong.  There is no 
agreement.  But here it is Estina locally.  You are not...  
[laughs]  You do not know about them.  You do not go and 
do oversight there.  [laughs]   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And Mr Zwane, the evidence of 
the CFO, Ms Sepathi Dlamini, talks about your call to her.  
Your telephone call to her ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Okay? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 85 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...on the 15 t h of June 2012.  Now this 
is some two days or three days after your department or 
Exco has approved the project.  You approved on the 
12 t h of June 2012.  On the 15 t h, she receives a call from 
you, she says.  And you wanted to enter – to go to a 
meeting in regard to the R 30 million prepayment.  And 
guess it was to who in regard to the project?  It was to 
Estina. 
MR ZWANE:   Can I answer? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you very much, Advocate Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   The information that this Commission should 
have is that when this project was approved by Exo there 
were issues, number one, that had to be looked into by the 
committee, Treasury Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I would like you to deal with that 
in due course because we are going to come to them. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But just your comment on you called 
20 
her, you said to her:  Go to a meeting with M – is it MEC or 
Mr Mohali?  And this was in regard to the prepayment of 
R 30 million to none other than Estina. 
MR ZWANE:   I may – I am taking a long route.  Let me be 
short. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 86 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   And get to that particular point.  I made a 
call to the CFO.  It was on Friday afternoon.  I think she 
has also said that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   That I was supposed to report.  We had Exco 
on every Wednesday.  I am supposed to go back to Exco 
and report in terms of the work done since the last...  And 
he then raised the issue that Treasury seems to be still 
busy in terms of what they need to...  I then called the 
10 
MEC of Treasury and asked him:  Is there any progress 
that we will report, because we are both going to that Exco 
meeting on Wednesday.   
 
The MEC said:  No, I am busy with my officials.  
I am at this place.  It would be important if you can make 
your officials available should they have any questions to 
clarify in terms of the progress in this project.  My call was 
not specifically a call that was aimed at the releasing(?) of 
the R 30 million.  It was a call that was saying:  As we go 
to Exco, let us know how much we have progressed or 
20 
there are issues that will enable us to have more time in 
terms of Treasury.  We will have to give that report.  That 
was my call to the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what did you ask the CFO to do? 
MR ZWANE:   I asked the CFO to join the MEC of Treasury 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 87 of 354 
 
with his team.  He had given me a venue where they were 
meeting.  They were in a meeting when I talked to him.  He 
said:  No, fortunately, we are here.  We are meeting.  So 
we can look at that issue and if ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What issue was that? 
MR ZWANE:   The progress in terms of what needed to be 
done by the committee and the department pertaining the 
project.  Let me just, maybe for the sake of viewers.  There 
was an issue of R 84 million that the Treasury Committee 
had to look into.  There was an issue of our R 30 million 
10 
that 
our 
department 
had 
said 
– 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture – it is available.   
 
Now looking at the magnitude of what was 
needed and Treasury had to look into.  We had to go back 
to Exco and say it is feasible or is not feasible or we need 
to buy more time in terms of allowing officials to work on 
this project.  That was my call to her to say:  Let us not be 
found wanting because we are the lead department in 
terms of this project. 
 
If Treasury is saying they are ready, they can 
20 
engage on this matter and resolve, can you please then go 
to a meeting?  Meet with the officials there and the MEC 
will give me a report on Monday.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was about R 84 million not the 
R 30 million? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 88 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Treasury was looking into the feasibility of 
getting this R 84 million.  Thirty ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   For your department? 
MR ZWANE:   For the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the project? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   That email, to the best of my recollection 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   The department was required to reprioritise 
within the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   It is that reprioritisation that would go back 
to Exco to talk about.  It is also about the feasibility of the 
R 84 million that will bring the whole annual amount of this 
project to R 140 million.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   So my was that, let us not be found wanting 
on oversight in terms of giving information. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That was the essence of the call.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So the – to your knowledge the meeting 
to which you were sending the CFO was to discuss money 
for the Estina Project? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 89 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I do not know whether to call it Estina or 
Paras.  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   It is like the issue of the choir ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I have never heard it called Paras 
Project. 
MR ZWANE:   Oh, but like – let me accept, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   After this discussion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or Vrede Dairy Projects.  Then you can 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it will suffice. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Vrede Dairy Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   That was the arrangements in terms of 
finances of that project, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But you see, Mr Zwane.  Okay, let 
20 
me ask this question.  I take it that you reported regularly 
to the Executive Council about how this project was going 
as well as other projects in your department? 
MR ZWANE:   I take it Chair that the leader of evidence 
here has just reported that this was a project recently 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 90 of 354 
 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no what I mean.  Once it had been 
approved ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...going forward up to the time you left 
the department.  I take it that you reported regularly at 
certain intervals to Exco ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...as to how the project was going. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MR ZWANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would that have been maybe – 
what?  At least once a month or once every three months 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   It ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is that? 
MR ZWANE:   It can depend, Chair, in terms of the priority 
20 
given to the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.   
MR ZWANE:   This project, as it was approved, there was 
urgency attached to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 91 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   It is there in the minutes of Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And once you have that – and it was a 
reflection(?) project that was also announced in the state 
of the province of the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   So it will ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was an important project? 
MR ZWANE:   It will gave that priority that anytime when 
you are given a task to perform, you must be ready that 
10 
you should report ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Regularly. 
MR ZWANE:   Not even regularly.  There might be a 
question:  How far are you in terms...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR ZWANE:   You should not be found wanting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   So that was the drive in terms of this project, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words.  You should be up to 
20 
date? 
MR ZWANE:   You must be up to date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you can be asked anytime. 
MR ZWANE:   Anytime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 92 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  You see the – it is just difficult 
to understand how it is possible that on a project that was 
so important to the province and to Exco and to your 
department and on which you could be asked anytime, you 
could be asked questions, you may have to report anytime.  
How 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
throughout 
the 
period 
of 
February 2012 up to March when you left in 2013(?), you 
could not have known that there was Estina playing a role 
in the project unless the head of department made a 
10 
concerted effort that you should not know about Estina.   
MR ZWANE:   Chair, maybe I must try and give some more 
information on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I think around March/April ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   2012? 
MR ZWANE:   2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   In my speech, as an MEC now of Department 
of Agriculture and Rural Development, I tabled this project, 
20 
not in February.  March/April.  Right?  And once I have 
tabled – the Premier will come with a helicopter view of 
what the department will do and that but the department 
will then give details during their presentation. 
 
This is a project that was announced by the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 93 of 354 
 
Premier around March or late February, let us say so.  Our 
department in around April and after April, when the project 
has been announced by the department, work would start 
to happen.  Then it is May/June going forward. 
 
In fact, if you come from that point, you will see 
that from April to June(?), it was two months.  June to 
September, four months.  November six months.  Around 
April, you see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Months by months? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   The following year.  Now, for all intense and 
purposes, Chair, I did what I could.  I do not want to cast 
suspicions because I do not like that happening to me also 
but I give what was brought to me and I acted upon it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was brought to you by – or 
what was told to you by the HOD, Mr Thabethe, did not 
include 
him 
telling 
you 
that 
the 
company 
that 
the 
department had a contract with or had an agreement with 
was Estina?  That is not part of what he told you? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, I know I said I 
was giving you time.  Would you like to go?  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 94 of 354 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
No 
problem. 
 As 
long 
as 
I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You have five minutes before we take 
the lunch break, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My time is your time, Chair.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you spent it, it is as much as I spent 
it, Chair.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane, the – Ms Dlamini is 
10 
specifically.  Her affidavit is here, Chair.  Specifically 
towards ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Please tell me where to find it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 353.398. 
CHAIRPERSON:   398, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is specifically talking about the 
R 30 million 
in 
regard 
to 
your 
call 
to 
her 
on 
the 
15 t h of June 2015 – I mean 2012.  So you will see on page 
20 
353.409 ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Four, zero, nine.  Paragraph 9.   
MR ZWANE:   Four, zero, nine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 95 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 9.  So this whole part, the 
reference you will see it is only to the R 30 million.  9.1 
says: 
“On the same day, 15 June 2012, which was a 
Friday 
afternoon, 
I 
have 
received 
urgent 
instructions from the MEC of Agriculture and 
Rural 
Development, 
i.e. 
Mr 
M 
Zwane, 
to 
urgently attend the meeting with MEC of 
Finance, i.e. Mr M Mohai...” 
10 
 
Is it Mohai?  
MR ZWANE:   Mohai. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mohai?  Is it an I? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I in the end.  Thank you.   
“I could sense urgency in the instruction given 
the fact that I had to do it on a Friday in the 
afternoon and there was also a bank credit 
transfer document that had to go through 
Treasury for it to be send to the bank in order 
20 
of the bank to transfer the payment to the 
intended beneficiary (Estina) to pay for the 
project. 
The bank credit transfer document comes in 
the picture where the payment of any amount 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 96 of 354 
 
above one million had to be made. 
This process had started with myself and the 
Director of Finance in the Department of 
Agriculture having followed correct process to 
request payment of R 30 million...” 
 
The next paragraph: 
“At 15 June 2012, when I was instructed by 
MEC Zwane to meet with MEC Mohai, the 
Department of Agriculture had already remitted 
all the necessary documentation to Treasury 
10 
so that Treasury could assist in the formal 
finalisation of the payment of R 30 million, 
which 
payment 
was 
intended 
for 
the 
beneficiaries...” 
 
I will skip the paragraphs.  Let us go to the next 
page, paragraph 9.6. 
“I 
arrived 
at 
Anta 
Boga 
Hotel 
for 
the 
meeting...” 
 
So this is meeting in a private hotel? 
MR ZWANE:   H’m.  Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not in the department? 
MR ZWANE:   We did not have sufficient venues so it was 
a normal practice in the Free State to do that.  It is save to 
say, this was not my meeting, Chair.  Before I cast 
suspicions 
or 
– 
this 
was 
the 
meeting 
organised 
by 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 97 of 354 
 
Treasury.  I just requested my official to join them.  I may 
not know the details.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  You take your responsibility for 
it being outside of your offices of the department? 
MR ZWANE:   I am just relating that that was a no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja.  We used to do that in the Free State. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but – okay.  Here is the...  Know, 
she has emphasised she could sense urgency, she could 
sense urgency and in the subsequent paragraph, she would 
10 
say the same thing, the urgency from your communication 
with her and it is specifically in regard to the payment of 
R 30 million.  How did you know that this payment had to 
be made?  One.  Two.  What was urgent about it?  But let 
us deal with the first part.  How did you know this amount 
had to be paid?   
MR ZWANE:   Can I respond? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you very much, Chair.  I think I had 
already responded to this question in terms of my call to 
20 
the CFO.  My call was never about the payment of any 
money to anybody.  My call was about the progress that I 
needed to report back to Exco, as I have said.  So that is 
what I want to put on record to this Commission.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, I am confused.  This meeting 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 98 of 354 
 
Ms Dlamini is talking about, it is about to determine why 
there is a delay in paying the R 30 million. 
MR ZWANE:   The meeting is about Treasury and 
Agriculture preparing any response, should it be needed, in 
the next meeting.  It was the next Wednesday.  About two 
aspects. 
 
The 
reprioritisation 
of 
projects 
within 
the 
department itself to the tune of R 30 million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And the issue of R 84 million.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   My call was about that.  It was not about 
paying anybody.  That is not my purview.  To the best of my 
recollection, I have not seek to interfere unless there is 
somebody who has not been paid within the period that we 
have said people should be paid in – in respect of this 
case it was 30-days.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see that Ms Dlamini later in her 
affidavit at page 353.415 ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Chair, can I interject? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  [laughs]  I think I know why. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the lunch break.  We 
will resume – it is now nearly twenty past one.  We will 
resume at twenty past two.  
MR ZWANE:   Thank you, Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 99 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The Chair has no 
follow-up questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will now let you ask your questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we will finish, Chair.  By five 
o’clock or so we will be finished with Mr Zwane.  Mr Zwane, 
so that is the Estina part and the evidence by Ms Dlamini 
10 
about a R30 million.  I had asked you the question how did 
you know the 30 million was to be paid.  You say no, your 
call was not about a payment of an amount.  You did 
mention, however, that there was what, reallocation to be 
made? 
MR ZWANE:   Re-prioritisation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Reprioritisation.  Ja and I thought I 
could ask you about Ms Fourie, Anna Fourie’s evidence 
particularly in regard to that because in her affidavit to the 
Commission, which is on page 353.358 we – just go to 
20 
point 360.   
MR ZWANE:   360? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, point 60, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is point 60, is that 353.60? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Correct, 
Chair, 
yes, 
353.6 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 100 of 354 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we moving away from…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let us go further because the first 
part, it is a confirmatory of what she did submit as her 
actual affidavit on page 353.360.  So Mr Zwane, she 
submits this affidavit. She says she had been employed by 
the Free State Provincial Treasury as the Deputy Director 
General Finance Governance.  That is in paragraph 1.  
Paragraph 4 says: 
“Due 
to 
my 
responsibilities 
related 
to 
risk 
10 
management 
as 
well 
as 
norms 
and 
standards 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second?  You said we 
should go to 353.60.  That is where I am but I do not see a 
paragraph marked 4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 360. 
CHAIRPERSON:   353.360? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 360, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I have read paragraph 1, she was 
20 
employed by the Free State Provincial Treasury as the 
Deputy Director General Finance Governance and then she 
makes the affidavit, paragraph 3, in her official capacity as 
the 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
Finance 
Governance 
– 
Financial Governance. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 101 of 354 
 
“Where we now report directly to the head of 
department.” 
Then paragraph 4: 
“Due 
to 
my 
responsibilities 
related 
to 
risk 
management as well as norms and standards I 
attend to various meetings.” 
Paragraph 5 on the next page, she says: 
“On 15 June 2012 I attended staff function.  In the 
same function the then CEO Mr Kgomongwe was 
present. 
 
While 
at 
the 
staff 
function, 
Mr 
10 
Kgomongwe, requested me to assist the other 
colleagues 
within 
the 
Free 
State 
Provincial 
Treasury to consider the funds required by the Free 
State Department of Agriculture.  While at the 
function the then Chief Financial Officer…” 
That is  Dlamini. 
“…from 
Free 
State 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
arrived. When she arrived I and other colleagues 
had to leave the function earlier and go back to the 
office.  At the office the CFO produced the contract 
20 
between the Free State Department of Agriculture 
and Estina as well as a payment document request 
from the Free State Department of Agriculture for 
an amount of R30 million.  The documents were 
assessed and certain questions were asked to the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 102 of 354 
 
CFO, which some of those questions were related ot 
the contract produced by the CFO.  She was unable 
to 
answer 
satisfactorily. 
 
After 
assessing 
the 
documents Ms M Maduka, an official responsible for 
the Provincial Revenue Fund at the time was 
requested to verify the availability of the funds in 
the 
Provincial 
Revenue 
bank 
account. 
 
On 
confirmation of the balance the maximum amount 
which was available, if the payment should proceed, 
was only R5 million.  There were not enough funds 
10 
in the Provincial Revenue Fund.  We were unable to 
effect the payment of R30 million.” 
Do you have any comment on that, Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I do not have.  I do not have any 
comment, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, do you recall whether in 
terms of the agreement between the department and Estina 
there was provision to say the prepayment should precede 
their actual commencement of the work.  We have called it 
prepayment.  I do not know whether that is what – that 
20 
comes from the contract or not.  Do you remember what the 
position was? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I saw in one affidavit, Chair, a 
reference to a clause in the agreement to the effect that 
initial transfer payment of R30 million shall be paid into the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 103 of 354 
 
account of the implementing agent, Estina (Pty) Ltd. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of anything along the lines 
of it happening before any work was to be done, did you 
come across anything like that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will have to – no, I do not know 
offhand.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If it comes – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I do not know offhand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, what I picked up in Ms 
Dlamini’s affidavit, Mr Zwane, I think it is the last page, if I 
am not mistaken – if you need us to go there we can go 
there.  What she does say is that there was urgency for the 
project to start or she posed it as kick-start the project.  
Now I am understand the impression that you also spoke 
about urgency in regard to the project but I may be 
mistaken, am I right? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I think the urgency I did say was in 
fact from the executive committee.  In the affidavit of Mr 
20 
Venter, the minutes of the executive committee, I think it is 
point 3, it says – it talks about the urgency of this project 
being implemented.  That is what I was mentioning.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 104 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am wondering whether the position 
is not that this payment of R8 million has to be made 
before the project could start because if the arrangement 
or agreement was that it should be paid first, it may be that 
it was urgent because the other party to the contract, 
Estina, which you thought was Paras, may have taken the 
position that we cannot start the project until you make this 
payment.  You understand what I mean? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair, I do understand, but I am not 
privy to …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know what the position was. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja, no, I am not privy to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But I understand you, Mr Zwane, 
to be saying before the adjournment that you needed to 
show that you will play your part and you seem to link that 
to the urgency of the matter. 
MR ZWANE:   I did say, I needed to be ready for feedback 
in terms of the decisions taken …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, sorry, not you personally, I am 
20 
talking 
the 
department 
– 
as 
I 
understood 
you, 
the 
department needed to show that it will play its part and 
that seemed to have been the reason for urgency. 
MR ZWANE:   I have indicated that both ourselves and 
Treasury were given tasks and I have indicated those 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 105 of 354 
 
tasks, Chair, and I also indicated that on our side I did not 
want us to be found lacking as the Department of 
Agriculture in terms of what was given us as a task before 
the next executive committee meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that 30 million is called an initial 
transfer payment which I have wondered why did the 
department have to make it because on the evidence of Ms 
Dlamini – and I will read from her affidavit – apparently, 
Paras had undertaken to invest R228 million into the 
project, she says VAT inclusive. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   So she also talks about Paras.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, she says – but this is at the 
presentation stage, this is prior to the conclusion of the 
agreement. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  No, I was just indicating that 
seemingly there is consistency in terms of this issue of 
Paras from the prior presentation but let me answer your 
question, Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I think I did …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did not ask a question but I think you 
can assume from my statement to you what the question is.  
Should I or do you want to say something? 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
No, 
I 
am 
ready 
for 
the 
question, 
Chairperson. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 106 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so the question is, why did you 
need to make an initial payment of 30 million three days 
after Exco approved the project when allegedly Paras had 
committed to investing R228 million into the project?  
Could you not have asked them to start with the payment, 
a down payment? 
MR ZWANE:   We, as the department …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I am sure in this case. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   And it will further cascade down to PFMA in 
terms of arrangements of payment, arrangements of the 
process plan when it comes to this project.  So the nitty 
gritties in terms of how this was arranged should actually 
be the work of the HOD assisted of course by officials like 
CFO which I have indicated earlier on that I had not seen 
the contract and those details I am sure would have been 
contained in the contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you are saying you are not able to 
say why the R30 million had to be paid within a space of 
20 
three days after Exco had approved the project? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I am not able to say why. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are not able to. 
MR ZWANE:   And why was it supposed to be paid up front. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 107 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I am not able to say why. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I am intrigued by that because this 
project is you initiation, it is a project which one would 
refer to as your brainchild inspired by your upbringing with 
your father, you have seen the black farmers who were not 
making it and you initiated the project with the intention to 
turn around a situation.  You go to the communities, you 
call meetings, you attend meetings with them in order to 
introduce the project, in order to identify the beneficiaries 
for the project and change their lives and here the process, 
10 
you actually also sell the idea, as you said, to the other 
politicians or members of other political parties serving 
with you at the province.   But you seem thereafter, if one 
listens to your answers, to have dropped the ball. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair, it is not like that.  I think there 
are roles and responsibilities in government which at a 
particular point I must hand over to the officials.  The 
issues of procurement in the main according to a PFMA are 
not my purview, it is a purview that is being practised and 
monitored by officials.  I do get in there if there are issues 
20 
and those issues are raised with me, I do get - and ask the 
same officials to do their work.  There is no way where you 
can find me as an MEC dealing with prepayment and stuff 
like that, it is not my purview.  To the best of my 
recollection I was on the ball and in that process I had to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 108 of 354 
 
allow officials to do what is delegated to them in terms of 
the law and I guess the issue we are talking about here is 
actually 
a 
delegations 
of 
officials, 
it 
is 
not 
my 
responsibility. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, I think you were on the ball, 
Mr Zwane, for you to phone Ms Dlamini on the 15 June 
2012, for you to go to India in October 2012, for you to go 
to the communities not only once or twice but more than 
that and there is a couple of things we need to ask you on 
this because even though you were on the ball, the 
10 
procurement and appointment of Estina was said to be 
noncompliant with supply chain management and go the 
advice from the State Law Advisers, obviously.  Do you 
remember that? 
MR ZWANE:   I think the question is well apprised in terms 
of the processes which were followed in the Free State, 
every contract had to actually be seen by the State Law 
Adviser before it could be implemented.  The to and fro 
engagements between the department and the department 
– in this case the Department of Agriculture and the State 
20 
Law Adviser’s office which actually be an issue of the 
finalisation of legality in terms of the contract and that falls 
squarely at the doorstep of the HOD. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you know that the State Law 
Advisers, when the matter came to them, the contract had 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 109 of 354 
 
already been signed and they advised that the procurement 
process was not complied with. 
MR ZWANE:   I have since saw that during this process as 
I was forwarded with documentation.  Yes, I saw it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And you have also seen that the 
only person in Estina was Mr Vasram who was apparently a 
source manager for Sahara Computers, did not have 
experience in farming.  You comment? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, you want me to comment in terms of 
the contract and who was appointed.  Let me give you the 
10 
process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I want you to comment on the fact 
that Estina had this one person, Mr Kamal Vasram, who 
had 
no 
farming 
experience, 
who 
came 
from 
Sahara 
Computers as a sales manager.  Did you know that? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I did say up until October 2012 I have 
always been under the impression that Paras is the 
implementer of this project, that is why I highlighted this 
issue now after break that even the CFO seemed to raise 
that matter consistently about Paras.  So I was not aware. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you have since read about it? 
MR ZWANE:   I have since read about it, yes, that is why I 
thought in terms of the process this matter should have 
been corrected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 110 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Once it is detected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   The people responsible should have been 
held responsible. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Accountable. 
MR ZWANE:   Accountable in terms of what has happened.  
Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because we can cut a long story 
short.  If you say to the Chairperson, Chair, I acknowledge 
things did not go as they were supposed to.  You know, 
10 
just piggybacking from what you were saying about people 
should have been held accountable, let me cut a long story 
short.  What do you say because I could go into the 
details, R184 million was ultimately paid to Estina.  You 
surely have been aware of that?  Yes? 
MR ZWANE:   That is so, Chair, according to the legal 
prescripts that are clearly tabulated.  Should there be 
anything untoward, there should be somebody who is being 
held accountable to explain what has happened and so 
forth and so on.  I do acknowledge that fact. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And one could also say saying – 
or you could take it further because you would have seen 
that there are allegations and with information showing 
that part of that R184 million ultimately found its way to 
Gateway, the Gupta-owned entity.  You read that in the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 111 of 354 
 
OUTA report? 
MR ZWANE:   I did read that, yes, Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But there persons who were 
identified as beneficiaries, I believe some 82 of them, did 
not benefit from the project.  We see that from Mr Ephraim 
Dlamini’s affidavit and from another beneficiary or intended 
beneficiary – you are going to help me pronouncing his 
surname. 
MR ZWANE:   Can I say something? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it N-c-o-n-g-w-a-n-e. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Ncongwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So what do you say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wanted to say something, Mr 
Zwane?  Say it? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I think this Commission should have 
been furnished by an agreement between the department of 
Free State government and the beneficiaries.  As far as I 
can 
recall 
and 
to 
the 
best 
of 
my 
knowledge, 
the 
beneficiaries were to benefit from the real activities of 
Vrede Dairy.  That will include the milking parlour, that will 
20 
include the processing of milk and they will also benefit in 
the process of completion of the value chain when by-
product are also produced in Vrede.  So from milking, 
processing milk and production of by-product, that is the 
closest where these beneficiaries, as farmers, as owners of 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 112 of 354 
 
the business will benefit.  That is as far as I know.  I do 
not recall at any moment where beneficiaries were to 
benefit 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
project. 
 
My 
understanding is that once there is a service provider who 
will be developing this Vrede Dairy.  This service provider 
accordingly will have to bring materials and all those other 
things and do – according to the process plan between him 
or herself with the department and then the service 
provider will get paid for what they have performed.  That 
is my understanding of this project.  I do not know if I am 
10 
clarifying your concern.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I have to put to you what they 
have said in their affidavits about whether they benefitted 
at all or not because Mr Ephraim Dlamini goes as far as 
saying he had a shop in town and Estina would deliver milk 
next door to him which was a shop owned by a gentleman 
of Indian origin who did not even speak the local language 
and he could not even obtain the milk from this project.  
Your comment? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, on the occasions I went there milk 
20 
was sold from the dairy parlour.  By the time when the 
parlour was producing this I should indicate in this 
Commission that I was no longer in the department, so that 
that is the – but on the few occasions that I went there, 
milk was sold and I assumed that nobody will be barred 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 113 of 354 
 
from buying milk there and I would not be able to give you 
the details in terms of how much people have benefitted 
because I think when the [indistinct] rewrote her report the 
process was at the level where milk processing was to be 
completed.  The third layer, which was the production of 
by-product, up until today has not happened.  So there is a 
possibility, I assume, that – because of the value chain 
have not - up until today has not happened, so there is a 
possibility I assume that because of the value chain have 
not – that people have not benefited as they were 
10 
supposed to.   I think one issue I am picking up here Chair, 
I got into the statement of Mr Hlongwane and Dlamini, is 
an issue of communication in terms of how far is the 
project, if people have not benefited up to now, what are 
the hiccups, Because I think that should actually be 
communicated to them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you say you left the department 
in March 2013 but you were not far, you still remained in 
the Free State Provincial Government, is it not?  
MR ZWANE:   That is correct, Chair.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were just moved to another 
department.  
MR ZWANE:   I was moved to economic development.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and you did come back to 
agriculture in 2015.  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 114 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   For two, three months, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so you were not far, this project 
was close to your heart.  
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I was not far, that is true. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I know that you have said in your 
affidavit the reason why the project did not succeed, is 
because of - you attribute that to poor management, or is it 
operations, you say that in your affidavit. 
MR ZWANE:   That was my view and it is still my view. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is still your view.  
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What do you think went wrong because 
we understand cows, cattle was dying and those who 
sought to expose the situation, their lives were either 
endangered, or some of them did lose their lives, allegedly 
because of people who were said to be sent by you to 
protect your position.  
MR ZWANE:   There was no position to protect at that 
point. I was already not there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were already? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   I was already gone from this department.  I 
was not involved Chair, in the procurement of. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, to protect you.  
MR ZWANE:   From what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know, that is the allegation 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 115 of 354 
 
made that people were sent, maybe from tarnishing your 
name, you were exposed, what is happening at Vrede Dairy 
Farm, which is initiated by MEC Zwane, you taint his 
reputation, so keep your mouth shut.  
MR ZWANE:   I have read about those allegations, I can 
say to this Commission , one of the people who had made 
those allegations has since came back to me, Mr Gadebe 
and I have   tabulated in my affidavit that Mr Gadebe is a 
former ANC member who went to DA and I do not want to 
bring people's names here, as they did without any 
10 
evidence on my name because I respect that part but 
leaders of a certain party went to Estina Project according 
to what he is telling me and when they were there, they 
said they must try and expose whatever they can find, 
especially tarnish my name. 
Now, I asked him, why are you coming to me now 
when you have gone to the Commission and said what you 
said, and I did not respond and I did not act.  He says what 
they had been promised has not been fulfilled and I said, 
no, it is not my purview, I do not want to involve myself 
20 
there, Chair. 
But the fact Chair, is that Mr Gadebe and I think Mr 
Dlamini 
made 
serious 
allegations 
in 
terms 
of 
me 
assassinating people, and I would really appreciate it if 
those allegations could be tested because I think it is 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 116 of 354 
 
unfair that such serious allegations can just be made 
without any evidence.  The point is, they are still living, 
they are in fear and nothing has happened to them after 
them saying if anybody touches my name then they are 
sure to be killed. 
The people they are raising here, were actually 
officials of the department, stationed in Vrede so when 
meetings in terms of this project were called their officials 
will be there and some councillors of which Mr Gadebe at 
some point was one of the councillors.  I should put it on 
10 
record that when this project was proposed, I think the 
municipality 
brought 
evidence 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
municipality council did agree 100% with this project, and 
he was part.  The issue of the cattle which died was a 
national issue, it was publicised, it is well known.  
We went to there as Free State Government to 
check what was the cause, so it is not an issue that 
somebody could have tried to shield anything there.  If a 
project is there and something goes wrong there is nothing 
to shield but to correct the misnomers, because it is not 
20 
about me, it is about the community, which must benefit.  If 
the contractor is not doing right, the contractor must be 
attended to, to correct or remove, it is as simple as that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka can I just interrupt you 
because I do not want to miss that and I am going back to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 117 of 354 
 
something we dealt with before lunch, but I do not want to 
forget it.  
I have been looking at the affidavit of Ms Elzabe 
Cornelia Rockman in the same, in this bundle, it starts at 
page 353.378.  What I am going to raise with you Mr Zwane 
and then we will go back to what Mr Seleka is dealing with.  
Is your evidence that you only heard about the involvement 
of Estina in this project after you had left the Department 
of Agriculture.   
You see Ms Rockman says she was the Director 
10 
General in the office of the Premier from September 2010 
until 11 March 2013.  Now I am reading from paragraph 5 
of her affidavit at page 353.379, and then she says in 
paragraph 6: 
“I was appointed as the MEC, responsible for 
finance and took the oath of office on 11 March 
2013 and held that office until the election of the 
Premier following the 2014 general elections.” 
And then she talks about the Mahoma Mabung framework 
and Vrede at page 353.380.  In paragraph 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 
20 
she talks about budget allocations for 2012/2013 financial 
year on 29 February 2012 and refers to minutes of the 
meeting of the Executive Council and says at 2.2.3: 
“The Executive Council approved a memorandum 
tabled by the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 118 of 354 
 
Development on 13 June 2012 as follows.” 
about the Vrede Dairy are supposed to be created theory 
projects and she says: 
“The Executive Council approved the following the 
recommendations,1, 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
proposed integrated Vrede Dairy Agri Business 
Project and 3, supports the sourcing of additional 
funding of R84million for this current financial year 
from the province.” 
And says: 
10 
“The Executive Council further agreed that, where 
possible the department should meet the costs, and 
will be later refunded and engaged other relevant 
departments.  The matter be further discussed in 
the Treasury Committee as a matter of urgency.  
FDC should also play a role especially from the 
farming point of view.” 
Then in 2.2.4 she says; 
“On 18 June 2012, this is when you were still an 
MEC for agriculture, I was informed by the Deputy 
20 
Director General in the office of the Premier, Mr 
Albertus Venter who was on leave at the time that 
he 
had 
been 
contacted 
by 
Advocate 
Koenie 
Detierra[?] 
in 
his 
office 
regarding 
contracts 
pertaining to the Vrede Dairy Project, which had 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 119 of 354 
 
been presented at the Executive Council meeting of 
18 June 2012.” 
Do you see that?  Do you recall whether contracts were 
presented, contracts relating to the Vrede Dairy Project 
were present that at any meetings of the Executive 
Council? 
MR ZWANE:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I do not recall.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not recall? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, the interesting thing about 
this is this, that if contracts were presented at the 
Executive 
Council 
meeting 
of 
13 
June 
2012, 
those 
contracts could only have been between Estina and the 
department.  They could not have been contracts between 
Estina and Paras and therefore, if you were at that 
meeting, you would have become aware of Estina at that 
stage at the latest.  
MR ZWANE:   Chair, it was not a norm for a contract to be 
20 
presented at the executive, at the executive there will be a 
memo, 
the 
short 
summary 
of 
what 
you 
want 
to 
communicate and in this case, as I look at this, one of the 
issues that necessitated a memo to the executive it is point 
number 2: 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 120 of 354 
 
“Support and sourcing of additional funding of R84 
million for this current financial year from the 
province.” 
Why am I saying so, Chair is that this project was already 
a flagship project, it was not any project.  The Premier did 
talk 
about 
it 
in 
his 
State 
of 
Province 
Address, 
subsequently, I then went to details on this project.  I have 
said around April and then thereafter there starts in 
earnests the issue of service providers and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but remember that is not on my 
10 
question.  My question is simply that, do you agree that if 
contracts relating to Vrede Dairy Project were presented to 
the Executive Council, then on what you know now, those 
contracts could only have been between Estina and the 
department, they would not have been a contract involving 
Paras.  Do you accept that that would have to be the case? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I think Chair earlier on I did highlight the 
fact that the two officials excluding myself that is the HOD 
and the CFO, for a long time have been understanding or 
having an impression that the department has contract with 
20 
Paras. 
If this was presented earlier on and corrected that 
this is not Paras this is Estina I think the whole process 
that we talked about earlier on would not even have taken 
place, should if I had known that it is Estina.  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 121 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, Mr Thabetha’s evidence, if I 
recall correctly, was characterised by him talking about 
Paras being involved and being behind Estina or Paras 
having some arrangement or relationship with Estina at 
least at a certain stage he was talking along those lines 
during his evidence may have formulated what he was 
saying differently. 
But either at certain stage or throughout he was 
talking about there being a relationship between Estina 
and Paras but I think at some stage, the question was, was 
10 
there a contract or agreement between the Department of 
Agriculture and Paras?  And if I recall correctly, none could 
be sure, there was an agreement between the department 
and Estina, you see.   
So what I am suggesting to you, is that on what you 
know, now, it seems to me logical that you would agree 
that if contracts pertaining to the Vrede Dairy Project were 
presented at a meeting of the Provincial Executive Council 
on 13 June 2012.  That those contracts could not have 
been 
or 
have 
included 
any 
contract 
between 
the 
20 
department and Paras. 
On the contrary, they could only have related to the 
department and Estina.  Even though you say it was not 
normal to present contracts at Eskom meetings, but if 
indeed they were present on this occasion, for whatever 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 122 of 354 
 
reason, those could only be relating to Estina logically it 
seems to me.  
MR ZWANE:   If what…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Rodman. 
MR ZWANE:   Mr Thabetha said that there was no contract 
between Paras and the department my assumption would 
be that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, you see - and then I moved from 
that page which is 353.381 to the next page in paragraph 
2.2.5 Ms Rockman says the following.  You see, what we 
10 
were dealing with she said: 
“She had been informed by the Deputy Director 
General in the office of the Premier on 18 June 
2012.”   
Talking to her about contracts that related to the Vrede 
Dairy Projects, that Mr Venter said had been presented at 
the Executive Council meeting of 13 June 2012.  Then in 
the next paragraph, she says: 
“During the evening of the same day.” 
Which must be during the evening of the 18 t h of June 2012. 
20 
She says: 
“Mr Venter, and that is the Deputy Director General 
in the office of the Premier, forwarded an email 
from 
Advocate 
Koenie 
Detierra[?] 
with 
an 
attachment to me in my 
capacity 
as 
Director 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 123 of 354 
 
General.” 
She says: 
“The attachment contained, 1, a submission of the 
Department of Agriculture with the subject, and she 
quotes, 
the 
subject 
is 
quoted, 
to 
accept 
the 
proposal from Estina with regard to the Vrede 
integrated 
Dairy 
Project 
and 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
partnership with Estina assigned by the Chief 
Director, his services and the chief financial officer 
on 26 May 2012 and approved by the head of 
10 
department without a date.” 
So, she is saying the Deputy Director General in the office 
of the Premier that same evening of the 18 t h of June 2012 
sent this document and the document is one signed by the 
Chief Director, district services of your department and the 
Chief Financial Officer of your department and approved by 
the Head of Department of your department.  
And when you look at what she quotes there, she 
says that submission was written to accept the proposal 
from Estina, okay and then number 2, she also says that 
20 
Mr Venter sent her a partnership agreement she writes in 
quotes: 
“Partnership agreement between the Department of 
Agriculture Free State Province, South Africa and 
Estina Pty Ltd.” 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 124 of 354 
 
And she give the registration number: 
“In relation to the implementation of a Dairy Project 
at Vrede through a special purpose thereof created 
to fulfil the stipulated Agri BEE business called 
Zana Investments Pty Limited trading as Mahoma 
Mabung Dairy Projects, signed by the managing 
director [Mr Sanjeev Gautam] of Estina Pty Ltd on 
the 5 t h of June 2012 and signed by the head of 
department on the 7 t h of June 2012.” 
That is the head of your department who signed that.  So, 
10 
the question that arises is, you remember I said to you 
earlier on if throughout 2012 or maybe from about mid-
2012 to when you left the Department of Agriculture in 
March 2013 the involvement of Estina was well known 
within the department in the project and Mr Thabetha had 
even signed an agreement with them, for you not to have 
known 
of 
the 
involvement 
of 
Estina 
he 
must 
have 
deliberately withheld that information from you.  Do you 
remember that I said that otherwise, you would have picked 
it from talking or from documents.  You understand that, 
20 
that is what I said, I do not say you agree with it? 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair I understand what the Chair is 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, let me finish so that you can 
deal with everything.  What I want to suggest to you is that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 125 of 354 
 
here are people in other offices other than the Department 
of Agriculture.   
Mr Venter in the office of the Premier he has 
documents that come from your department, which talk 
about Estina being involved.  
Here is, Ms Rockman who is Director General, in 
the office of the Premier is getting documents from Mr 
Venter talking about Estina in regard to this project. 
How would it be possible that you are the only one 
from whom this information about the involvement of Estina 
10 
is withheld when everybody else is getting documents that 
mention Estina. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, the approval of my trip to India was 
approved in the office of the Premier where Ms Rodman is 
and this approval had Paras, nobody said no wait.  It was 
instant approved, I went to India and if the officials were 
available there I would have gone when everybody knew. 
Coming back to this information Chair, I have read 
this information I have read even the part of Mr Venter in 
terms of the to and fro of agreements, where there are no 
20 
proper contracts and subsequently, a new contract being 
entered into, I have read that now.  
But at the time when these things were happening, 
it was between officials, my officials who let me to go to 
India to Paras and the officials of the Premier's department 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 126 of 354 
 
I now know that Ms Rockman also knew about this issue 
and this issue big as it is, it should actually gone to Eskom 
because the next version will be when payment was 
supposed to be done around June on what was that 
payment going to be done, if there was no contract.  
These are the issues that I am saying, if they were 
brought to light, I am sure I would have dealt with them.  
Let me speak on my behalf, I would have dealt with them, 
yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you see, it goes back to what I 
10 
raised with you earlier on.  It should not be just what you 
are given by officials, you should also be asking for 
information to make sure that you know that things are 
under control and particularly if you talk about laying 
oversight, performing oversight functions but we have dealt 
with.  
So I wanted to just - let me just mention I think two 
other parts or documents, you see at page 353.383 
paragraph 2.27 Ms Rockman says, let me start at 2.2.6 
which is at paragraph 353.382 she says; 
20 
“I responded to Mr Venter that I had been informed 
that a meeting of the Treasury Committee was 
scheduled for 19 June 2012 on the matter of the 
Vrede Dairy Project.  Advocate Detierra[?] issued 
correspondence to the Chief Executive Officer of 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 127 of 354 
 
Provincial Treasury addressed to Ms Anna Fourie on 
19 June 2012, making reference to a consultation 
between Provincial Treasury and legal services, 
legal services being office of the Premier, that took 
place on 18 June 2012 and suggested among others 
that, 3, it appears that the procurement process 
was not followed.  The contract may be invalid due 
to a number of reasons or we suggest that you 
propose 
to 
the 
Treasury 
Committee 
that 
the 
agreement and the procurement documents be sent 
10 
to us for review.” 
And then Ms Rockman says after that: 
“A copy of the correspondence from Advocate 
Detierra[?] is attached and marked VR9.” 
Then in paragraph 2.2.7 she says: 
“Correspondence dated 19 June 2012 with 
the subject matter “advanced payment for 
Vrede 
Project”, 
from 
provincial 
treasury 
indicate that the Department of Agriculture 
submitted a request dated 15 June 2012 to 
20 
provincial treasury for an advance payment 
to Estina Pty Limited and makes further 
reference to a different submission dated 19 
June 2012 to amend the Department of 
Agriculture‘s projects – agriculture’s project 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 128 of 354 
 
list to have funding available for the Vrede 
Dairy project.” 
And then I skip there then I go to paragraph 2.2.8 she says 
there: 
“A 
meeting 
of 
the 
treasury 
committee 
convened on 19 June 2012.  I joined the 
meeting at a later stage and it was resolved 
that an ad-hoc technical committee led by 
the Director General in the office of the 
Premier 
that 
is 
myself 
at 
the 
time 
he 
10 
established to ensure among others that 
relevant documentation is provided by the 
Department of Agriculture to the provincial 
treasury to enable the provincial treasury to 
consider the application for the advancement 
– for the advance payment to review the 
contractual agreement entered into between 
the Department of Agriculture DARD and 
Estina Pty Limited and to consider further 
funding requirements for the project.” 
20 
 
She says: 
“I have not been able to obtain the minutes 
of the treasury committee meeting held on 19 
June 2012.” 
 
So you see she is talking about what everybody 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 129 of 354 
 
seems to have talking about Estina.  You see. There is an 
application for advance payment and the payment is to 
Estina.   
 
Let me then go I think the last reference I want to 
make is to paragraph – page 353.384 paragraph 2.2.10 – 
2.2.10. 
“A further process of engagement unfolded 
between the office of the Premier and the 
DARD that is your department set out in the 
correspondence between Advocate K J C 
10 
Ditira and the head of the DARD that is your 
department dated 25 June 2012 and 26 June 
2012 
respectively. 
 
Culminating 
in 
the 
reviewed agreement signed on 5 July 2012 
by 
both 
the 
head 
of 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Estina 
as 
well 
as 
the 
supplementary 
submission 
to 
provincial 
treasury.  Copies of the correspondence is 
attached 
and 
marked 
ER12 
and 
ER13 
respectively.” 
20 
 
So I just wanted to put that to say you see all over 
whether it is treasury or the office of the Premier, the DG 
there is talking about – is aware of Estina.  Correspondence 
refers to Estina.  There are contracts in which Estina is a 
party relating to this project.  The Deputy DG in the office of 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 130 of 354 
 
the Premier is aware of Estina being involved.  Mr Thabethe 
is aware. These documents and this correspondence comes 
from his department.  How is it possible that somehow the 
MEC whose project this is really does not know about the 
involvement of Estina? 
MR ZWANE:  Chairperson I think this issue we have 
repeated – repeated it for some time now and the simple 
explanation I have given and I think Chair alluded to it many 
times Mr Thabethe himself says in this commission according 
to your recollection that he was under the impression that 
10 
Paras had something to do with this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR ZWANE:  It is .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he said that ja. 
MR ZWANE:  It is on record.  It is not me saying it is – 
Chair’s recollection.  The leader of evidence here also says 
at some point Ms Dlamini paints that particular picture.  
Right.  These are two senior officials in my department  It is 
not – it is not as if everybody including my officials in the 
department were saying Estina I am the only one who says 
20 
Paras.  I have produced in this commission evidence that I 
was pointed to Paras late in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me – let me make sure you understand 
what I said about what Mr Thabethe said.  I said that I might 
not be putting it accurately but after lunch what I did say to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 131 of 354 
 
you is that I am not sure whether throughout he was 
speaking like this but at some stage he was speaking on the 
basis that he understood Paras to be behind Estina. So in 
other words Mr Thabethe never said he did not know about 
Estina.  He knew about Estina but all he was saying is at 
least at a certain stage that his understanding was that there 
was some relationship between Estina and Paras but he may 
at some stage or I may have understood him to – to say this 
project was really between the Department of Agriculture and 
Paras but then there would be a time when you say but 
10 
where is the contract between Paras and the department?  
But he never said he did not know about Estina. 
MR ZWANE:  He did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had never said – he acknowledged that 
Estina was there.  So – so you are not even on the same 
level as him because you are saying you were not aware of 
Estina at all until after March 2013 whereas he knows the 
involvement of Estina from beginning to end.  It is a question 
of what was the role of Paras in this whole thing?  He does 
not say Estina was not known to him.   
20 
MR ZWANE:  May you please accept Chair my version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Which I have backed up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  By my itinerary to India visiting Paras that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 132 of 354 
 
indeed I was going to visit Paras.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you – you are not able to add – it is 
what you have said 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka I know I 
interrupted you but I think – I thought it was important. 
MR ZWANE:  Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And also to be fair to Mr Zwane if I pick up 
something. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To put it to him so that he could comment 
on it. 
MR ZWANE:  I appreciate that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair in fact 
Mr Thabethe in his affidavit says that it was Paras which 
recommended Estina as a local company that will – that will 
contract 
with 
the 
department. 
 
That 
paragraph 
12 
I 
mentioned.  So he was clearly aware of Estina and whatever 
relationship they had with Paras that is where it is evasive – 
20 
it is unclear what was going on.  But then we had this Estina 
concluding the contract with you led by a man taken from an 
IT sector – the IT sector who does not have knowledge of 
farming and you would have seen from his affidavit of Mr 
Theron that he sends affidavit to Mr Ashu of Sahara 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 133 of 354 
 
Computers – not affidavit I beg your pardon invoices in order 
to be paid.  And the allegation is that he was then receiving 
remuneration for the service rendered at this project from 
the Gupta’s. Payments in the emails said pay this invoice 
from Linkway.  You saw that. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes I saw those allegations Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You would not know how he was paid? 
MR ZWANE:  As I have said earlier on that was not my 
responsibility as a MEC I would not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you – did you know whether or not 
10 
from the out – from the evidence of Ms Dlamini Paras did 
make the investment of R228 million. 
MR ZWANE:  I did answer that question Sir.  I said Chair I 
said I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know that they had committed to 
do that investment? 
MR ZWANE:  Paras? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  On which basis? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not know. 
20 
MR ZWANE:  Chair – no I am… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is a presentation – Ms Dlamini 
talks about the presentation made through the department.  
The presentation includes that commitment to make an 
investment of R228 million by Paras. Are you saying you did 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 134 of 354 
 
not know about it? 
MR ZWANE:  I am saying Chairperson it has gone to length 
in terms of Estina – Estina and read.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I am just touching on there are other 
things we can move on. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes, no I am saying the issue of Paras is what 
I have said was the presentation that Paras is going to be 
doing – to be a service provider that is what I have said.  
And the details of what will happen between the department 
and Paras I do not know because I have said earlier on I did 
10 
not see the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were – were you ever told by Mr Thabethe 
or anybody where the money was going to come from to 
finance of fund this project? 
MR ZWANE:  If my memory serves me well Chair there was 
an understanding that if we reprioritise projects in the 
department we will be able to get up to R30 million which I 
have said earlier on is the money that we needed to 
prioritise that is why I called the CFO.  There was another 
R84 million which was given as a task to the treasury 
20 
committee to try and find money for that project. That is what 
I have said.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the question is whether you were 
ever told by Mr Thabethe where the money would come from 
to fund this.  Did he say it was all going to come from the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 135 of 354 
 
department? 
MR ZWANE:  No in terms of the – in terms of the information 
and in terms of EXCO meeting there was going to be a 
shortfall that we know hence the creation of the treasury 
committee 84 million was to be sourced out if I may use that 
word 
from 
the 
province 
other 
departments 
and 
the 
department was supposed to reprioritise and they 00:13:37. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get to know or did you know at the 
time this is 2012 now how much the project was going to 
cost – what was the estimated cost of the project? 
10 
MR ZWANE:  I think this project was for three years if I am 
not mistaken R114 million every year times 3 that was the 
cost of the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was going to be over R300 million. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is right over three years. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in terms of where that amount of over 
R300 
million 
was 
going 
to 
come 
did 
you 
have 
an 
understanding whether it was going to come- all come from 
20 
the department including money that may be – that could be 
contributed from other provincial departments or did you 
have any under – or what understanding did you have? 
MR ZWANE:  That – that was exactly my understanding 
Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 136 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your understanding was that all the 
money to fund this project was going to come from the 
provincial government. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you – did Mr Thabethe never tell 
you that the arrangement or agreement was that the entity 
that would be involved whether it was Paras or whatever was 
also going to put in – inject some money into the project – 
millions of rands into the project? 
MR ZWANE:  No I never got that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He never told you that 
MR ZWANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could you be mistaken about this or you 
are sure he never told you? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair well I am recollecting from my memory 
this project is seven/eight years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  I may not be precise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you do not recall. 
MR ZWANE:  I do not recall – I do not recall it in this point 
that is raised I think the whole debate is about this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Of that I was contributing money ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 137 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  So the way I understood Mr 
Zwane’s answer to your question Chair about whether or not 
he 
was 
told 
where 
the 
money 
will 
come 
from 
my 
understanding is that in fact he is the one who said go to 
reprioritise and get the money.  So he would have rather the 
instruction would have come from him to tell them where to 
find it as opposed to them telling him where we are going to 
find it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us confirm with him. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that correct Mr Zwane? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your understanding correct? 
MR ZWANE:  These are two different issues Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  The Chair has asked me whether the total cost 
was going to come from the provincial government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  I have said that was my understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  I have said it was my understanding that at 
20 
least for 2012 we were supposed to go and reprioritise and 
get to the value of 30 million from our own department and 
then 84 would then be a responsibility of the treasury 
committee.  I did allude to that fact – to those facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and so the… 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 138 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The balance would come from other 
departments. 
MR ZWANE:  In the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the province. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The balance to make 84? 
MR ZWANE:  No to make 114. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay – 30 plus. 
MR ZWANE:  30 plus 84. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja just my comment related to the 30 
million in 2012.   
MR ZWANE:  There is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to repeat to him what you say 
about that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So Mr Zwane what I am saying is 
the – because it was the first question the Chairperson 
asked you about whether they told you where the money 
20 
would come from and your explanation was in relation to the 
30 million and the 84 million.   
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I was saying the way I understood you 
to be saying to the Chairperson is that in respect of those 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 139 of 354 
 
amounts you instructed them to go reprioritise so that you 
can get that money.  So you told the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 30 million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the 30 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 30 million ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  You told them where to find the 
money and it was them telling you where they are going to 
find the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the Department’s officials you are 
talking about. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
MR ZWANE:  Can we go to the place Chair where there is 
00:19:07 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is my understanding correct. 
MR ZWANE:  Where there is a EXCO resolution of Mr 
Nhlabe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Rothman. 
MR ZWANE:  Ms Rothman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR ZWANE:  I think I am trying to attempt to … 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You want the tables? 
MR ZWANE:  Ja it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Rothman’s  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 140 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:  It is page 381 - .381. 
CHAIRPERSON:  .381 okay. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR ZWANE:  Vrede Integrated Dairy Agri Business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph are you reading from? 
MR ZWANE:  3.1 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  I am reading there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry 3.1? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is at the top of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja okay right. 
MR ZWANE:  There are actually two 3.1’s I was reading at 
the second one.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR ZWANE:  That says Vrede Integrated Dairy Agri Business 
Project propose integration dairy and other elements of 
production and processing with emphasis of value addition 
and beneficiation that is me.  MEC Agriculture and Rural 
Development. 
20 
“The 
executive 
council 
approved 
the 
following recommendation by the department.  
The implementation of the proposed agri 
dairy 
project 
supports 
the 
sourcing 
of 
additional funding of 84 million for the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 141 of 354 
 
current financial year.” 
 
I think the question is around here.  And this 84 
million it says  
“Where possible the department should meet 
the costs and will be later refunded and 
engage other relevant departments.” 
 
That is EXCO Chair. 
“The matter be further discussed in the 
treasury committee as a matter of urgency.” 
 
Now as I understand the leader of evidence is that 
10 
we as the department was supposed to reprioritise.  I did not 
have a problem with that to put it on record.   
CHAIRPERSON:  He is saying his impression is that you 
were the one saying to your officials reprioritise in terms of 
budget.  So is his impression of your evidence correct or 
not? 
MR ZWANE:  `No that – that instruction would have come 
after the EXCO resolution Chair.  I will tell you why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But coming from you. 
MR ZWANE:  It would … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not coming from you because that is all 
he is asking. 
MR ZWANE:  It will come from – the direction is from EXCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  Me and HOD. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 142 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ZWANE:  Were most of the time part of EXCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR ZWANE:  HOD after EXCO has taken a decision where 
he is present should make sure that the decision of EXCO is 
implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ZWANE:  They should not wait for me.  In case where 
the HOD was not there I am alone I would go back and .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Convey to him. 
10 
MR ZWANE:  Convey to the department through the HOD the 
resolution of the EXCO.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So can I take it that you – your answer is 
therefore that  
1. You know that EXCO did give an instruction that the 
department should reprioritise. 
2. You are not sure whether you did say to the HOD and 
the 
officials 
of 
the 
department 
that 
they 
should 
reprioritise but if you – if anybody says you did say you 
can understand that you would have said if necessary 
20 
because that was the instruction of EXCO. 
MR ZWANE:  That is what I am saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me – Mr Seleka I see that in putting in 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 143 of 354 
 
Ms Rothman’s affidavit into this bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The annexures were not put in. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They may prove important.  Is it possible 
for somebody to quickly obtain those annexures because I 
am keen to look at some of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know how many there are – I see 
there is one that says 50 but it is – it may be that they were 
10 
excluded because they – it was not thought they might be 
material but I think they may be – or at least some of them 
maybe quite important.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If somebody can try and obtain them while 
we are continuing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I know it is – these are affidavits that 
were used in other bundles Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we will just obtain that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the Estina work stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja that should be easy to obtain. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 144 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if – if then copies can be made that can 
be slotted into everyone.  Now if there are too many it may 
be that it is necessary to look at them and see what is 
important.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know what I am looking for so if I am 
given I can have a look. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no.  Just lastly on this point Mr 
Zwane. The EXCO decides on the 84 million we can see 
here.  The 30 million which is an advance payment is the one 
which I understood you to have said I told them to 
reprioritise and get the R30 million.  Is that understanding 
correct because that is what I heard you say earlier? 
MR ZWANE:  It is not correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you saying it is EXCO that made that 
20 
decision. 
MR ZWANE:  The EXCO made a decision that we should go 
and reprioritise source some funds even if it means us being 
refunded by other departments.  We could reprioritise 30 
million in the department not because – not because of the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 145 of 354 
 
advance payment. Because of the total whole sum of the 
project an 84 will then be arranged by the treasury 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just from that Mr Zwane it seems that 
this project was being embarked upon without any proper 
planning – proper and adequate planning in terms of budget 
because if it had been properly planned and budgeted for 
you would not be having to reprioritise on the budget that 
has already been made for projects that had been there 
because when you reprioritise what it means as I understand 
10 
it is some project or some things that had been allocated 
budget to say they will be done suddenly they will not be 
done because money is taken away from them in order for 
this project to be funded.  What do you say to the 
proposition that even that shows that the project had not 
been the subject of adequate and proper planning including 
budgetary planning? 
MR ZWANE:  Chair in terms of the concept of the project it 
was done in 2011 consultation and everything done and 
dusted.  In terms of the financial planning on the hindsight 
20 
as I look on in all these papers that is the picture that is 
painted by this project.   
 
But let me hasten to say I think on several occasions 
where we had to sit down and agree maybe in lekgotla by 
that lekgotla that comes late January early February where 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 146 of 354 
 
we prepare for the state of the province address. 
 
At that point with a month to go a collective then 
decides that this project will be more – will give more value 
rather than these others small projects.  Then at that point a 
decision will be taken for us to support this bigger project 
that we all agree that it will put moving. 
 
In terms of other planning I agree with the Chair it 
looks clumsy but there are records to that extent not once – 
not twice where when we meet in – by the lekgotla there will 
be a reprioritisation of some sort.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how would you know there would need 
to be a reprioritisation in circumstances where there are 
proper grounds of urgency.  Why – in other words, as to 
why the project cannot be subjected to proper and 
adequate planning first before it is implemented because 
this was in 2012.  The concept had been raised in 2011.   
 
The agreements with – between the department 
and Estina were concluded in June/July.  Let us meet here, 
already.  Why could it not be decided that:  Look, let us 
arrange and have a proper budget for this project.  Let it 
20 
start next year when it has been properly and adequately 
planned for.   
 
What was so urgent that it could not wait for 
adequate and proper planning? 
MR ZWANE:   Can I speculate? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 147 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not want you to speculate. 
MR ZWANE:   Because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you – you are the MEC.  I want 
you to be able to say:  Well, these were the reasons.  But 
if you do not know them, then you do not know but that is 
what – because I would imagine that – I would expect you, 
also, as MEC that even if this was project, so to speak that 
you started, you came up with the idea.   
 
I would expect that you would want this project 
to be the subject of proper and adequate planning so that 
10 
it will be implemented properly and that if the department 
seemed to be rushing things too much, you would say:  
Hang on.  Hang on.  Nobody is going to die if we wait and 
have proper and adequate planning.   
MR ZWANE:   In the Leghotla planning, the department will 
be requested to propose mega projects in the Department 
of Agriculture.  There was an issue, even before I arrived, 
that the department was doing small projects that do not 
have the necessary intact.  As this Commission has 
evidence to the fact that everybody that came to this 
20 
Commission agreed that the concept and the project were 
brilliant. 
 
We 
saw 
this 
concept 
at 
Leghotla, 
Project 
Leghotla.  Then Leghotla, as a collective, bought in to the 
idea and saw this project as one of the projects that could 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 148 of 354 
 
prioritised.  That is what happened and that is why the 
project was first announced in the State of the Province 
Address and then by us.  From our side as a concept we 
were ready Chair.   
 
In terms of planning, as the Chair is saying, on 
hindsight looking at what has happened, I take that point 
but as I have said this is how we used to do things at that 
point in time, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Zwane, an 
10 
innocent person sitting on Exco not knowing what is 
happening outside of what gets to be told at Exco, hearing 
of a project to benefit the immediate community, X amount 
of money will be paid according to the presentation by this 
company from India, R 228 million.   
 
Who will support the project?  I am surprised you 
do not know about that intention by Paras to invest 
R 228 million but your CFO knew about it.  She talks about 
it in her affidavit.  You are asking us:  On what basis will 
they make that investment?  But it is not – you are asking 
20 
the wrong people.   
 
So they will support if they hear what is being 
presented to them and this is what happened.  But it seems 
this project and I am accelerating because there are 
certain things I want to ask you but let me ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 149 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I know your challenge. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think we are going to have to find 
another day for Mr Zwane.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Zwane ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am hoping you are not going to say:  
10 
Hey, I have come here ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I think honestly the Commission is abusing 
my generosity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   I honestly think so.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   My organisation and myself have undertaken 
to help this Commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR ZWANE:   And I never failed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no you have been cooperative. 
MR ZWANE:   I have cooperated.  Chair, to be quite frank.  
We started at issues that I was here last for.  Now I am just 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 150 of 354 
 
really beginning to ask myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   What is this Commission looking from me?  
Because the Commission gives a document an afternoon 
before I come here.  I come entirely come and do my best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no you cooperate Mr Zwane. 
MR ZWANE:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cooperate. 
MR ZWANE:   ...let me request, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Cooperation from the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I think this is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ought to be the last day. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, please.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR ZWANE:   I take off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I take days off ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   ...from my work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And I do not know anymore ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 151 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   ...what to say, really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   So I will humbly request Chair that let us try 
and finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, look – well, the one thing that is 
true that Mr Zwane is that you have been cooperating.  
That cannot be taken away from you.  You – even at short 
notice, you have been cooperative.  You are here on a 
public holiday.  So whatever arrangements happen must 
not detract from the fact that we know you have been 
10 
cooperating, okay?  That is the first point. 
 
The second point is.  Know that the Commission 
would never abuse your cooperation.  It would never do 
that.  Three.  Your – to the extent that you may wish to 
finish today, that is also understandable, okay.  As you 
know, I think we said – Mr Seleka said in the morning, we 
thought today would be the last day also. 
 
But part of the reason why, when there are some 
issues that have not been dealt with properly, one may 
think about another day.  It is really to be fair to all 
20 
concerned including you.  To say it might not be the best 
way of dealing with things.  To let you go and the issues 
being decided in circumstances where there is still a need 
for clarification on certain issues. 
 
So it is in good faith.  It is not to abuse.  But the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 152 of 354 
 
point you make in terms of your cooperation and wishing 
this day to be the last one are legitimate points.  They are 
legitimate points.  It may well be that what we should do is.  
Let us go up to five because we have another session, 
evening session. 
 
And what we can explore is whether whatever 
remains can be obtained from Mr Zwane by way of 
affidavits or not.  Maybe we could explore that.  So I just 
want you to understand Mr Zwane.  Nobody wants to abuse 
your cooperation.  Even those who do not cooperate with 
10 
the Commission, the Commission does not abuse them.   
 
So you have been cooperating.  That must go to 
your credit.  So let us continue and see how far we go but 
the bottom line is, we do not want a situation where when 
decisions 
are 
made 
about 
what 
really 
the 
evidence 
suggest, somebody says or you say:  No, but did these 
people ever hear me say I am no longer available when 
they want me?  I was always prepared to go and be asked 
whatever questions.  Now why did they not asked me about 
this?  I would have clarified it.  You know.  You see what 
20 
we are looking at?   
 
But I think let us proceed and then at five let us 
take it from there.  Thought can be given to putting 
questions to you in writing for you to deal with in an 
affidavit.  Consideration can be given to that.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 153 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Can I say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, say something, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair I appreciate that consideration.  I 
am not raising this out of bad faith.  I am raising this 
because it is my experience that most of the time I spent 
more time with the Commission repeating what I have 
already said on record.  If there is anything in that respect, 
my expectation is that we will go to that issue, deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR ZWANE:   But not repeat the whole section. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   But I really appreciate the consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Zwane, it is the nature of the 
beast.  Let us – it is true that there was sole sourcing 
here?  Estina was – there was no competitive appointment? 
MR ZWANE:   Okay? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You know that? 
MR ZWANE:   I know it now, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I know it know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you did not know it then. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 154 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I did not know it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
That 
there 
was 
no 
tender 
or 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is true that Estina was appointed 
as the sole service provider? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I know that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I have read about it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you knew it then. 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How ...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   I did not know and to be short about it.  
Where there are instances where correct processes will not 
be followed, the department through the HOD explains it 
the following year when there is the report of the Auditor 
General why this has happened, give reasons.  So provide 
all those reasons.  When this report came out, I was no 
longer there in that department. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in October 2012, five months after 
the contract is signed.  Who did you think was rendering 
services at the farm? 
MR ZWANE:   I did say Paras, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And to the extent that you say 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 155 of 354 
 
the problem with the project lies in the management, poor 
management.  Only one company was managing that 
project.  Is it not? 
MR ZWANE:   Except on the hindsight, having known all 
these issues, this project was badly managed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But by one company, is it not? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe you should say by whom? 
MR ZWANE:   The information I have is Estina as I have 
10 
gone through. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Estina badly managed this project? 
MR ZWANE:   Now what must I say to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he had said so Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And...  So this is the proposition I 
wanted to put to you and you can respond.  Because 
20 
having gone through the evidence that we did, at least to 
the extent that we have done, it seems that Estina for the 
project – the project may have been established for a 
purpose other than what was told to government, the 
Provincial Government.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 156 of 354 
 
 
I have told you about the evidence that shows 
the non-compliance in the appointment of Estina, the 
appointment of a company which was run by a person who 
is not experienced in farming.  He is linked to the Guptas.  
He then sent invoices to Sahara Computers that get paid 
by a linkway.   
 
The payments that goes to Estina, ultimately, are 
channelled to the Gupta company, Gateway and the 
beneficiaries intended to benefit from this company.  Even 
on your version, they have not seen what this project was 
10 
meant to do for them.   
 
So it seems, given the urgency at which it was 
appointed, the R 30 million advanced payment, all this was 
meant to benefit Gupta related entities and/or the Guptas 
themselves.  Your comment on that? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, my view is that, as I have said, this 
project was badly managed.  Should the management of 
the project been done well, this project, from where I am 
sitting, regarded as one of the best projects in agriculture 
to have happened for the people of the Free State.  That is 
20 
my view. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, just to looking at the 
question of how much still ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Left. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 157 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...remaining.  If I recall correctly.  The 
main matters on which the Commission wanted to hear 
Mr Zwane’s evidence was on Estina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On his involvement in the trip to 
Switzerland. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And is relationship with the Guptas. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was there – we did the trip to 
10 
Switzerland the last time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have done Estina.  I am not sure 
there is much left but you might have a better idea on 
Estina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, there should not be.  And then it is 
his relation with the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The meetings that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...on the face of it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...the invitations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His appointment as the Minister. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 158 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How it came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then, ultimately, the role he played 
when the banks closed the Gupta accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine.  Well, we – I think, 
for example, when the banks closed how his role there.  
That should not take long. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  I am sure we can, 
whatever we have not covered by five ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We may be able to cover by way of 
written questions and him answering by way of affidavit. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, Mr Zwane, we are not 
unreasonable people. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 159 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   Chairperson, I do not call somebody by his 
clang name unless I appreciate how he treats me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
MR ZWANE:   And this morning I have called you by your 
clang name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did, yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   To be quite frank, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR ZWANE:   Despite what I have raised, we are have 
been working very well with you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And I must put it on record.  That is why I am 
trying to raise ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   ...whatever I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we might finish.  Chairperson, they 
have got the files containing the affidavit and annexures to 
20 
Ms Walkman(?) [00:19:25] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, I think what we do in the light 
of what this latest discussion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us – we can look at that later. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 160 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if there are questions, they can be 
by way of written questions to Mr Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So we do not need to look at 
them now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it is three lever arch files... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane, then we can go back to the 
– what seems to be your relation with the Guptas.  But you 
know it seems to come throughout that relationship?  But 
let us look at the trips to India and we can finalise on that.  
There is one particular.  So we go back to the affidavit of 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  I may just say so 
that your junior can hear me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would, nevertheless, like to see them 
this evening, the annexures.  Okay. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 161 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if my evening might start at eleven.  
[laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So let us go back to the affidavit of 
Mr Theron, page 353.22.  So Mr Zwane, there is a heading: 
Zwane’s close association with the Guptas.  We went 
10 
through some of these emails...  the information previously 
which shows the emails exchanged, booking flight to India.  
And you asked the Chairperson to give you an opportunity 
to deal with these allegations in an affidavit.   
 
Now the trip to India in December 2013, you 
attended a wedding with Ashok Narayan, evidence, an 
executive 
of 
the 
Gupta 
company, 
Sahara 
Systems, 
members of the Gupta family and Chandrama Prasad 
Yadav, the farm manager of the Vrede Dairy Farm – Dairy 
Project.  You have answered this from page 353.225, I 
20 
think.  Paragraph 9.1.12.  You are going to have you keep 
finger, Mr Theron’s affidavit.   
MR ZWANE:   225? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   225, yes.  Point 225. 
MR ZWANE:   224? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 162 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   225.   
MR ZWANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, look for your affidavit.   
MR ZWANE:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR ZWANE:   I am sorry, Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 9.1.12.   
MR ZWANE:   Nine point...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One point 12. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, Chair.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is this where you are dealing with that 
allegation? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes, it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that what you deny is. 
“I deny that at any stage during my tenure as 
the 
MEC 
in 
the 
Free 
State 
Provincial 
Government I have attended a wedding of any 
of the Gupta family and say so with confidence 
in that I was not friends to the Gupta family to 
an extent that I would attend their weddings...” 
20 
 
Yes.  But I see you did not deny the trip to India 
in December 2013. 
MR ZWANE:   2013 or ’14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ’13.   
MR ZWANE:   This is the trip of the travel agents. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 163 of 354 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
No, 
the 
travel 
agents 
is 
September 2014.  It is coming.  It is the next one. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I see that you did not deny the trip 
to India in December 2013 where you would have travelled, 
as they say, Mr Ashok Narayan or rather members of the 
Gupta family and Thom Muglama(?), Prasad Yadav, the 
farm manager.  So that part is not denied? 
MR ZWANE:   Well, Chair I am going to say that it is not 
clearly stipulated.  That when you read my affidavit, I say I 
10 
deny that at any stage during my tenure as the MEC in the 
Free State Provincial Government, I ever attended a 
wedding of any of the Gupta family.  And I say so with 
confidence in that I was not friends with the Guptas. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To an extent that I would attend their 
weddings.  So it is a qualified statement there.  So you 
were friend with them but you were not friends in the 
extent that you would attend their weddings. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, this is the third affidavit.  Consistently 
in all my affidavits.  I hear what the leader of evidence is 
20 
saying and I take note of that.  I have been consistent that 
I have known – actually ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Tony Gupta. 
MR ZWANE:   ...I must not say the Gupta family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 164 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   I have known Tony and I have explained that 
I have known Tony because of the paper in the Free State 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And I have said I have not met with him 
outside the environment of me doing my work in the 
organisation 
or 
in 
government. 
 
That 
has 
been 
my 
assertion.  So I see this qualification and I wish to correct 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So what you are saying is.  You 
10 
were not friends with him? 
MR ZWANE:   No, I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
interacted 
with 
him 
...[intervenes]  
MR ZWANE:   In regards ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to your work? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next allegation.  Oh, I am just 
opening a door for the Chairperson to ask questions.  
20 
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] No, just continue.  I will 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will go – I will come in without the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 165 of 354 
 
dropping(?) in if I need to.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  As I said, Mr Zwane, keep 
that page open in Mr Theron’s affidavit.  The next 
allegation.   
“The trip to Dubai and Delhi in September 
2014 
which 
Gupta 
employees 
at 
Sahara 
arranged and which the Gupta family paid for.   
The flight tickets are evidence that Zwane flew 
to Dubai and then Delhi in the company of 
Rajesh (Tony) Gupta and Salim Essa and 
10 
Surya Kant Singhala. 
The purpose of this trip is unknown...” 
 
The next page: 
“The email records from Sahara Computer ’s 
server which evidence the trips and the Gupta 
family’s payment of Zwane’s expenses upfront 
or by refund are attached hereto...” 
 
And it is MJZ-21 and MJZ-22.  So it is MJZ on 
page 353.134 and point 135.  And we went through this 
which shows the email on page 353.134 from Alima Alana.  
20 
alima@travelexcellence.co.za 
on 
Thursday, 
11 September 2014.   The email is addressed to Ashu, 
ashu@sahara.co.za 
and 
they 
CC’d 
Saumur 
at Travel 
Excellence.  The subject is E-tickets attachments.  Surya 
Kant Singhala, 13 September.  Zwane, 13 September.  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 166 of 354 
 
Rajesh Gupta, 13 September.  And also the two(?) names 
that appears ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And the date is 11 September 2014 and 
the time is 05:46 p.m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Thank you, Chair.  And she 
writes: 
“Dear, Ashu ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is Ashu Bayi not Ashu Chawla. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, she explains it’s a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Another name? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is not a name, but it is a 
…[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   He says it is the meaning of friend. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it means brother. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but is the same, it is Ashu Chawla. 
MR ZWANE:   That is what I have read, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is what you [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
MR ZWANE:   This what I have read here is not information 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it is a sign of respect or affiliation 
of some sort, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Continue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So she says: 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 167 of 354 
 
“Please see attached E-tickets.  Thanking you, 
warmest regards Halima Allana.” 
Then the tickets – ja, Halima Allana, Travel Excellence and 
the details are set out below.  On the next page, Mr Zwane 
is then those – what is this, your travel itinerary and we 
can see your name: 
“Traveller:  Zwane/Mosebenzi Joseph” 
And 
the 
dates 
follow. 
 
The 
first 
one, 
Saturday 
13 
September 2014.  It is departing from Johannesburg to 
Dubai, departing at 22.20 and arriving in Dubai at 8.20 on 
10 
the 14 September 2014 and I am going to just read the 
next one.   
Sunday September 2014 you leave Dubai to go to 
India on the same day.   
The next page, 16 September 2014 you come back 
from India to Dubai.   
The next page 17 September 2014 you move from 
Dubai to Switzerland.   
 
Next date, 20 September 2014 you move from 
Switzerland back to Dubai. 
20 
 
And then 21 September 2014 you come from Dubai 
back to Johannesburg. 
 
Travel Excellence on the face of this arranged this.  
You send Ms Allana’s affidavit – Halima Allana’s affidavit 
where she confirms that they have received instructions to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 168 of 354 
 
arrange this for you and the two gentlemen mentioned 
including Mr Salim Essa.   
 
Chair, the affidavit, just for the record, is on page 
353.261.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of Ms Allana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Zwane has read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you travel from South Africa to 
Dubai on Saturday 13 September 2015, Mr Zwane? 
10 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, thank you.  Let me just thank the 
Chair, I think this was a point which made us to adjourn 
last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:  I should indicate, Chair, that the affidavit and 
her 
statement, 
I 
received 
that 
affidavit 
yesterday 
afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Yesterday afternoon and then I received the 
statement this morning but due to my commitment from my 
20 
party that I will always cooperate with this Commission and 
to you, Chair, that I took your advice when you say I must 
try and say something.  I have tried and collected all the 
information, as you can see the information that was not 
last time, it is here.  I would have loved to also had enough 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 169 of 354 
 
time but due to the predicament that the Chair raised of 
timeframes of the Commission I thought I should say in this 
Commission I will give it my best in terms of my 
recollection but I would have loved a situation where I 
would have also had a situation where I can prove what I 
am saying.  I will continue to try and source this 
information even when the Commission …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   After today. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes.  Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, that is important.  To the 
10 
extent that you are able to respond, do so, but where you 
feel that you need to go and do some homework, check 
some records or whatever and maybe file an affidavit to 
respond, that will be allowed. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I say we could only provide it 
yesterday because we received it yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I am not blaming anybody, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no. 
MR ZWANE:   I am just putting a record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   And my willingness to cooperate even under 
these difficult circumstances to help the Commission. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 170 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I know what I have 
said on these issues, I have reflected on this matter last 
time because I had committed that I will come back and 
ignore the issues – let me put the record straight, it was 
not my intention to contest the emails.  That is why I am 
cooperating today, trying to assist the Commission.  The 
issue was getting some sufficient time which I can see it is 
10 
not possible even today to try and prepare myself around 
to be of assistance to this Commission.  That is why I am 
here.  I thought I should clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, having said that, having reflected 
during these few days before I came here, indeed there 
was a trip I took.  I remember the trip which seeks to go – 
and at this point in time I was in Economic Development.  I 
did meet with investors in Dubai, I did meet with investors 
in India, I did go to Switzerland, as a business trip, as you 
20 
can see it was pointed in different directions.  I do not wish 
to contest anybody’s affidavit.   
What I want to put as a point and fact in this 
Commission is that throughout my tenure as MEC and the 
Minister and even in the ANC, when there is a trip that is 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 171 of 354 
 
undertaken, once that trip is approved, it was a norm that 
officials will then deal with issues of booking, whether they 
use travel agent, whether they pay themselves, that was 
not upon me.  So it was my assumption all the time that 
that has been the norm, hence I was able to prove in the 
earlier circumstances.   
 
In this case also, that has been an assumption.  I 
want to say to this Commission, under no circumstances I 
would allowed a situation knowingly where a third party will 
be involved to pay my own travel arrangement whether it 
10 
be in a form of refund or otherwise because the norm and 
assumption has always been the organisation or the 
department I am representing should be the one that will 
always take care of my travelling arrangements.  I wish to 
put that on record, Chair, otherwise I will continue to try 
and source …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the documents. 
MR ZWANE:   Information, where I can source information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   I thought I should deal with that in that way. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  I understand you to 
be saying the trip referred to in this ticket at page 353.135 
did take place on the dates given and to the places 
indicated but you are saying it was an official trip. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 172 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And as far as your concerned, your 
knowledge is that – or assumption is that it was paid for by 
the department. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was Economic Development at the 
time. 
MR ZWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right?  And – but you have not 
had the opportunity of trying to obtain documents that 
might show the position and you will continue to try and 
10 
obtain those. 
MR ZWANE:   I will continue to do so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR ZWANE:   And I am saying upon realising this 
information, as it is here, properly recorded, I had always 
had an assumption that the department or organisation 
where I am will be the one that is responsible to undertake 
those nitty gritties in terms of ensuring that I arrive where I 
am going. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and therefore you are saying you 
never yourself communicated with these travel agents. 
MR ZWANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And asked them to make bookings. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 173 of 354 
 
MR ZWANE:   No, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And …[intervenes] 
MR ZWANE:   And, Chair, I do not know how – even the 
method of payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Who paid this travel agent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR ZWANE:   Those details that due to time constraints I 
may not want to bore the Commission with, I thought I 
should make that presentation in this Commission. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja. 
 
Okay, 
no, 
that 
is 
fine.  
Arrangements when we stop, we will talk about when you 
could file – let us have an affidavit that might refer to 
whatever documents you are going to be able to get 
because, as you say, you would not get enough time to 
look at even the affidavit that you got yesterday.  So we 
will talk about that when we stop. 
MR ZWANE:   I have already enquired, Chair, I must say I 
will add some information but as I got it this morning and 
yesterday, to try and close this matter and assist the 
20 
Commission to know what happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Zwane, that will be 
helpful.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, I was going to just say the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 174 of 354 
 
answer, as I see from Mr Zwane’s affidavit is that he says: 
“It 
is 
regrettable 
that 
I 
could 
not 
locate 
the 
departmental approvals for this trip and my request 
for those documentations to the department could 
not yield any positive results and because I am no 
longer in the Free State province I depend on other 
people and because of the shortness of time, I also 
could not lay my hands on these vital documents.” 
So I understand this to mean that I have tried to locate 
them, I could not, I have made enquiries with the province, 
10 
the provincial department, to no success.  But I suppose 
you will continue to deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he will continue to try and see 
whether documents can be found.  I would say from the 
Commission’s side, the Commission should also try and 
find out.  So let us all try and find out what is there that 
can assist to establish what the position is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because what he is looking for are 
documents that may show that this too was an official trip. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Like the first one that we talked about in 
the morning, was an official trip and whether there would 
be documents that show that it was paid for by the 
department. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 175 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whether now in the light of what we 
saw in the morning whether there are S & T  claim 
documents that show that her claimed for S & T  because it 
was an official trip. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the legal team must also be in touch 
with the Economic Development department in the Free 
State to try and get that – I hope it is still called that 
because if the name has changed one could get lost as to 
10 
which one would have those records.  Do you know 
whether it is still called that, Mr Zwane? 
MR ZWANE:   I think the department it has not changed, 
Chair, 
it 
is 
called 
the 
Department 
of 
Economic 
Development and Environmental affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So I think you try from 
your side and the legal team will also try and obtain.  But 
from your side, we will fix the date, try and obtain and you 
will give us what you have obtained and the legal team, 
whatever it obtains, it must also share it with you. 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So, Chair, for now I 
would not go into the details of Ms Allana’s affidavit 
because she then attaches the passports that she has of 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 176 of 354 
 
the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can refer to it, if you want to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page did you say it is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   353.261.5 but the next page is the – 
are the important ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:   261.5? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 261.5 is the beginning of her 
affidavit. 
MR ZWANE:   Chair…? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja – okay, yes, you refer to what you 
wish to refer to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So paragraph 7, Mr – well, let us start 
at 5.   
MR ZWANE:   You are 261 point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go to point 6. 
MR ZWANE:   Point 6? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, point 5 is the beginning of the 
affidavit.  Thank you.  Paragraph 5 with the heading: 
“Matters relating to Mr Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane. 
20 
I 
hereby 
wish 
to 
respond 
to 
a 
request 
from 
investigators of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry 
into 
allegations 
of 
state 
capture 
who 
have 
requested all Travel Excellence records concerning 
Mr Zwane.” 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 177 of 354 
 
So, Mr Zwane, let me go paragraph 6.  Says: 
“I reviewed my email …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, no, it is fine, read the whole page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I read it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, start from the beginning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
“I hereby wish to respond to a request from 
investigators of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry 
10 
into Allegations of State Capture, the Commission,  
who have requested all Travel Excellence records 
concerning Mr Mosebenzi Zwane with identification 
number…” 
And the number is given. 
“I have never met, corresponded with or received 
any payments for travel undertaken by Mr Zwane.  
All interactions in respect of Mr Zwane’s travel 
arrangements were with Mr Salim Essa and Mr Ashu 
Chawla.” 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or Chawla, is that Chawla? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have been saying Chawla, I think I 
have pronouncing it wrongly.  It must be Chawla. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, my junior is nodding, Chair, 
Chawla.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 178 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hey?  Chawla? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My junior says Chawla. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, she must be right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She must be.  No, if she is wrong, they 
chop head.(?). 18.30 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
6. 
“I reviewed my email account at Travel Excellence 
and retrieved an email dated 12 September 2014 
which I compiled and sent to Ashu@sahara.co.za.  
10 
A printout of the email is attached hereto marked 
annexure HA1.  In the aforesaid email I have 
attached the travel itineraries for the following 
individuals: 
1. Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta. 
2. Mr Essa 
3. Mr Zwane 
4. Mr Surya Kant Singhala.” 
7. 
Mr 
Essa 
made 
the 
abovementioned 
travel 
arrangements and feedback was provided to him via 
20 
email on 4 September 2014.  A printout of the email 
describing the flight details for Mr R Gupta and Mr 
Essa is attached hereto as annexure HA5.  These 
tickets were valued at R53 495 per person.  A 
printout of the email describing the flight details for 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 179 of 354 
 
Mr Zwane is attached as annexure HA6. 
8. 
On 5 September 2014 I issued tickets for Mr R 
Gupta, Mr Essa and Mr Zwane.  I attach hereto a 
printout of the email as annexure HA7.  The printout 
of 
a 
follow-up 
email 
to 
Mr 
Essa 
at 
salimessa@gmail.com and salim@global.co.za for 
the air tickets of Mr R Gupta and Mr Essa is 
attached hereto as annexure HA8.  An additional 
follow-up 
was 
sent 
to 
Mr 
Essa 
at 
salimessa@gmail.com and salim@global.co.za for 
10 
the ticket of Mr Zwane.  A printout of the aforesaid 
email is attached hereto as annexure HA9. 
9. 
As a result of the changes made to the air tickets of 
Mr Gupta and Mr Zwane afterwards for their return 
flight, an additional R2 500 were invoiced per 
individual.  A printout of the invoice which was 
issued on 15 September 2014 is attached hereto as 
annexure HA10.” 
Ja, shall I carry on, Chair? 
“The passports are attached, I have referred to in 
20 
paragraph 13.” 
And they are attached including your own, Mr Zwane.   
“The payment…” 
According to her, in paragraph 12: 
“…, was made of R166 290 for those trips, for the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 180 of 354 
 
air travel, as mentioned above, was received in 
Travel 
Excellence 
ABSA 
bank 
account. 
 
I, 
unfortunately, cannot recall from whom we received 
the EFT payment.  The printout of the bank 
statement in which the transaction is reflected is 
attached hereto, as annexure HA14.” 
Well, so to the extent that the trips are conceded, the only 
question is, who paid for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that might not be the only 
question. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
other 
question 
is 
if 
Ms 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Allana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Allalla, Hallana. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Allana, Halima Allana. 
MR ZWANE:   Halima Allana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  If she says, as she does, under 
oath, that she made these bookings for four people, 
including you, Mr Zwane, and she says – and there will 
20 
say, correctly so, she has never interacted with you.  She 
says she had never corresponded with you.  She says she 
has never met you.  She says, as I understand her, she got 
all this information from Mr Salim Essa.  In other words, it 
is Mr Salim Essa who said he must make bookings for the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 181 of 354 
 
four people, including you, for this trip.   
If that is true that Mr Salim Essa asked her to make 
the bookings which have related to, among others, you, the 
question is – and if it is accepted, as it should be, that you 
did travel on this date to the placed indicated in the ticket 
and came back on the day indicated there, how did Mr 
Salim Essa know this information about your trip or how did 
Ms Allana know this information so accurately without 
having spoken to you?  You see, those are the questions 
that arise and then, of course, the question who paid but 
10 
apart from who paid, the question – there are these other 
questions.  How did she get to know you were going to 
travel to Dubai on such and such a day and from Dubai you 
were going to travel to India?  And, actually, that is where 
you travelled, that is where you went, and how did she 
know you would come back on the day on which you did 
come back without speaking to you?  She on her side says 
she got the information from Salim Essa. 
So those are the questions that arise.  But with 
regard to Mr Salim Essa, I think you said last time you did 
20 
not know him, is that correct?  You may have met him once 
or something or you did not know him at all? 
MR ZWANE:   Chair, I said – thank you, Chair.  Am I to 
answer one question or all of them? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you want to answer all of them you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 182 of 354 
 
can answer all of them. 
MR ZWANE:   Okay, Chair.  I did say I did not know Salim.  
In fact this who affidavit raises an interest also from me.  I 
confirm that I do not know this lady called Halima, I have 
not spoken to her.  I must also confirm in this Commission 
that I also did not speak to Salim.  As I have indicated, the 
person I knew I was talking to was Thuli(?) but let me also 
then respond to the issue, how would they have known?  
Chair, I have said it is my assumption, up to my, including 
this trip, that once the trip is set, the nitty gritties will be 
10 
done by the department.  The presence of my password, as 
you see it, in my mind alludes to that fact because it was 
there, I would ensure that it is available in the department 
during the course of them doing whatever work they need 
to do.   
I will also want to raise my interest in terms of 
actually who paid for this trip.  I think it is also important 
for me because my assumption has always been, to the 
best of my recollection, my belief and my knowledge, that 
the department will be doing this work and once tickets are 
20 
here, I will get into the plane and go.  So it raises those 
issues even to me, Chair.  I cannot respond how did she 
know, as a travel agent, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And I guess from your point of view 
if the department asked this travel agent to make a 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 183 of 354 
 
booking for you then that would have been between the 
travel agent and the department but, of course, she does 
not say that, she says it is Salim Essa but if that was the 
case, that would be the case. 
MR ZWANE:   That will be the case, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, you just do not know, ja. 
MR ZWANE:   That will be the case, ja.  I would not know 
because those details are not the details that will be 
followed by me as an MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, you know, it is one thing 
to read the affidavit, it is another thing to look at the 
emails, Mr Zwane, because the emails are striking and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Take us there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, take us there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go to page – well, the first email 
Chair is point, 261.9, so HA1, page 353, point 261.9, so 
that’s Ms Helana on the 12 t h of September 2014 writing to 
20 
Mr Ashu and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Writing to Mr Ashu Chawla? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair, @sahara.co.za. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The attachments ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 184 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she says: 
“Dear Ashubai, 
Please see amended tickets, 
Thanking you” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But the attachments again have three 
names, Ajesh Gupta, Zwane and Suria Singana.  Then you 
turn the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let me ask this question, do you 
10 
know whether Tony Gupta was on the plane, on the same 
plane as yourself when you went on that trip from South 
Africa to Dubai?  At least you had met him by that time as I 
understand it. 
MR ZWANE:  Yes, I knew him very well Chair.   I can’t 
remember Chair, I can’t remember seeing him.  I also 
cannot deny that he was on the plan, but what I know is 
what I already communicated to the commission that I did 
not instruct anybody to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka?  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the next page is the itinerary for 
Mr Salim Essa 
CHAIRPERSON:   The next page is page 353.261 what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 185 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Rajesh Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the dates is 13 September, 14 
September, 16 September, 17 September, 20 September 
and 21 September, exactly the same dates that we have 
seen in your – in respect of the itinerary relating to you Mr 
Zwane.  And I think the places are the same, they’re 
travelling from Jo’burg to Dubai, from Dubai to India, and 
then from India back to Dubai, when they are in Dubai then 
they go to Zurich, Switzerland and from Switzerland back 
10 
to Dubai and ultimately Dubai to Johannesburg, exactly the 
same trip as yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s start with this, you accept that the 
destinations are the same, the places where you went? 
MR 
ZWANE: 
 
 
Ja, 
according 
to 
this 
information 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes according to this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of your recollection of your 
own trip as well you have said that from here you went to 
20 
Dubai, from Dubai you went to India, from India did you go 
back to Dubai? 
MR ZWANE:   Yes Chair I think that’s the route in terms of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the route ja.  And do you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 186 of 354 
 
remember whether you went to Zurich or not? 
MR ZWANE:   I remember that I did go to Zurich. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did go to Zurich ja.  And from Zurich 
back to Dubai. 
MR ZWANE:   And back home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then back home from Zurich straight 
or from Zurich back to Dubai? 
MR ZWANE:   I think it is from Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, first went to Dubai then to South 
Africa. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR ZWANE:   Chair I wouldn’t be asked to speculate, this 
is a proper speculation and I think let me not waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is fine ja, no that’s fine, 
ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that’s the one, Mr Zwane’s one 
then Chair which we have read, is a duplication of the one 
we have read earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is on page 353.261.13, HA3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is – the route is the same, we have 
gone through it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You have checked it is the same? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 187 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It’s exactly the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  And the flight is it the same 
flight? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is what I haven’t looked at, let’s 
see.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA:  Is flight the equipment, Boeing 77 – okay 
let’s see Mr Zwane, let’s see – look at the first one, the 
13 t h of September 2014, so on page – the one of Salim 
Essa, 261.10, against the entry equipment, okay flight, so 
10 
we can look at flight, AK762 Emirates, it is the same Chair, 
AK762 Emirates, departure, the time is the same, 13:50, 
arrival the time is the same, 23:59, 23:59, you’re going 
from OR Tambo, Johannesburg to Dubai, flying time, it is 
the same Mr Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay we can always check and 
when you have time you will also have a look and to see 
whether they flew according to this on the same flights as 
yourself and then you will then deal with the issues in an 
affidavit that you will file and if you, by then we will have 
20 
seen some documents which you think are important could 
be for the Commission you will do so.  
MR ZWANE:   I will have to get in touch with them, but I no 
longer have their details as I am no longer Minister of 
Minerals, so I will do the best that I can Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 188 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, ja, thank you. 
MR ZWANE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we must stop here because we 
have reached five o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the arrangement therefore is that 
further questions can be put to Mr Zwane in writing and he 
will respond by way of affidavit but even before he receives 
any questions he has got some homework to do to see 
what he can get in terms of documents that throws light on 
10 
the issues and the legal team will themselves also 
approach the Economic Department of the Free State 
Province, to try and see what information the documents 
can be obtained.   Today is the – what is the date today? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The 13 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   13 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of May, if we say try and let us have the 
affidavit by 25 May do you think that will give you enough 
time Mr Zwane? 
20 
MR ZWANE:   Chair I will endeavour to do my best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will do your best.    
MR ZWANE:   Yes, I will collect whatever I can get, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, or maybe I just say on or before the 
– Monday is 31 May, 29 will be, 30 will be Sunday, 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 189 of 354 
 
Saturday will be 29, on or before Friday the 28 t h, or let me 
give you more time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no that is enough Chair.  That is 
two weeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am saying that’s fine, because 
you are still going to put questions to him, remember, we 
will give him that.   Your attorney is fine with that? 
COUNSEL FOR MR ZWANE:   We are okay with that Chair, 
we should be able to get that ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, we will give you enough time, 
10 
and – but in the meantime you I think try and make sure  
you have given him questions by when? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We can give the questions by this 
weekend Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By this weekend? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, because they are already here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, alright, okay alright, and then 
he will – the affidavit will deal with everything, okay, 
alright. 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much 
Mr 
Zwane 
for 
your 
cooperation and thank you to your attorney also, Mr Denda 
20 
for your cooperation, thank you.  
MR ZWANE:   Chair let me also thank you, I really have 
learnt a lot interacting with you and your time, I wish that 
this Commission can bear fruits for the country as we are 
moving forward and as I have said I will continue to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 190 of 354 
 
cooperate with the Commission and give it my best shot, 
all the best Chair.  I know your work is not as easy as we 
see you on television there, there is a lot that is going on 
behind the scenes. 
 
Otherwise from my side I want to thank you for the 
opportunity of giving me to explain my side of the story, I 
think that goes a long way, and thank you for the 
opportunity once more, to your leaders of evidence I do not 
have 
a 
complaint, 
I 
really 
want 
to 
appreciate 
that 
opportunity, thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr Zwane.  We will 
adjourn this day session now for 15 minutes and thereafter 
we will resume and start the evening session and that will 
relate to Mr Koko’s evidence, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in regard to Eskom.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once again good afternoon Mr Seleka, 
20 
good afternoon everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good evening Chair. 
MR KOKO:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, are you read? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes we are ready Chairperson 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 191 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As the Chairperson indicated this 
evening session is in regard to Mr Koko and I think due to 
the time lapse we may have to administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR KOKO:   Matshela Moses Koko. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
10 
prescribed oath? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth, if so please raise your right hand and say so 
help me God. 
MR KOKO:   So help me God. 
20 
MATSHELA MOSES KOKO:  [duly sworn, states] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Yes, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.   On the last 
occasion we were about to go into the affidavit of Ms 
Suleiman in regard to the travel of Mr Koko to Dubai, 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 192 of 354 
 
before we go there Chair I would like to just touch on 
certain matters in relation to McKinsey and Trillian and see 
whether we can come close to finalising on that.  I know 
we have some affidavit outstanding but we probably will 
have to make a different arrangement in regard to how we 
deal with those affidavits, and I want to Mr Koko start with 
Eskom Bundle 14[c] on page 811.112, and I want to explain 
that because this deals with the requirement of National 
Treasury approval.  Both Mr Koko and Mr Singh Chair have 
said, have alleged in this email from the official of National 
10 
Treasury are exactly as – well the version is quite different 
by Mr Koko and Mr Singh but maybe they will – Mr Koko 
will explain to you why reference to this email has been 
made.   
 
That email is an exchange between Mr Dave Gorey 
of Eskom, this email is the first at the bottom of the page – 
oh wait, in the middle of the page, there is an email from 
Dave Gorey ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL FOR MR KOKO:   Chair I have not quite heard 
what the page number is? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, page 811.112 in Bundle, Eskom 
Bundle 14.  Eskom Bundle 14, page 811.112. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the first email is in the middle of 
the page, from Mr Dave Gorey to DJ@Eskom.co.za on 
Thursday the 4 t h of February 2016 at 3.07pm, it says “sorry 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 193 of 354 
 
Chair ...[indistinct] cc Mr Charles Kamima, the subject is 
practice note number SCM3 of 2003, and the email reads: 
“Good afternoon Soli,  
Thank you for your hospitality this morning.  We 
look forward to schedule productive engagements in 
the future.   As we discussed please confirm to us 
that practice note number SCM3 of 2003 entitled 
“appointment of consultants” is currently valid and 
effective for public entities such as Eskom.  We 
understand that this practice note and others will be 
10 
incorporated into a new set of regulations once the 
review process has been completed. 
Best regards, 
Dave Gorey  
Senior Manager : Commercial 
Eskom Group Commercial” 
And the telephone contacts are given.  Mr Koko are you on 
the same page? 
MR KOKO:   I am there, I’m there Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Then at the top of that is a 
20 
reply email from Solly.ctangana@treasury.gov.za sent on 
Thursday the 4 t h of February 2016 at 17:23 to Dave Gorey, 
copied in is Mr Charles Kadema, Vukami Indaba, Sindile 
Nxonjelo, subject re Practice Note numbers SCM3/2003, 
the email reads: 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 194 of 354 
 
“Dear Dave, 
Practice 
Note 
3/2003 
is 
still 
applicable 
until 
replaced 
with 
new 
instructions 
after 
the 
promulgation of the new Treasury Regulations.  The 
retainer/contingency fee principles are not clearly 
outlined in the practice note.  If you intend applying 
them you need to do some further work to ensure 
that you do not compromise the principles of 
Section 
217 
of 
the 
Constitution 
and 
other 
legislation.  
10 
Regards, 
Solly” 
Thank you Chair.  Mr Koko you recall this the email when 
we 
were 
talking 
about 
the 
requirement 
for 
National 
Treasury approval, amongst other things you were making 
reference to this email. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson why were 
you making reference to the email? 
MR KOKO:   Chair the letter of award you have it as 
20 
evidence before this Commission, is dated the 17 t h of 
December 2015.   We could not have got to that point of 
the letter of award unless we have met the ...[indistinct] 
and compliance to National Treasury Regulations are at 
...[indistinct] so for – when we had the first steering 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 195 of 354 
 
committee, I think it was in January, an impression was 
made ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, before you proceed Mr Koko, the 
December that you talk about in terms of when the award 
was made is ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   It is 2015, one five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Right.   The impression that was put to us 
when we had the first steering committee by the project 
manager was that the National Treasury’s compliance is in 
10 
place as well.  We also heard evidence and there are 
affidavits in this Commission, if I recall one is from Mr 
Mabelane, i think Mr Singh makes the same statements 
that the contract was actually concluded in January 2016.  
At all material times when the question of compliance to 
National Treasury’s product the only reference that was put 
to the fore is a letter – is an email between Dave Gorey 
and Mr Solly ...[indistinct] who was then the CPO, Chief 
Procurement Officer at National Treasury. 
 
Now I have never had sight of that until the 
20 
proceedings in this Commission and it is what it is before 
you now, and you see that it is dated the 4 t h, so that’s the 
only reason why I made that statement and I have said to 
you I am not going to pass a comment or judgment call on 
this email, except two things; one it came after the fact 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 196 of 354 
 
and two it is for the lawyers to decide whether this letter 
gives consent or not but what I can tell you, what I can tell 
you, is that we came to a realisation sometime in 
February/March that the National Treasury compliance was 
not in place so I have no doubt in my mind that certainly I, 
Matshela Koko, and members of the steering committee 
and there were ...[indistinct] to us there Chair and one of 
the problems I have in the proceedings there I seem to be 
the spokesperson of the Steering Committee and by the 
way I need to make this clear that the delegations from the 
10 
Board was not to the Steering Committee, so you cannot 
hold the Steering Committee collectively accountable, that 
is not how Corporate works, but in any event all that I am 
saying is this letter when I ...[indistinct] was to say to you 
the people involved when they say we have National 
Treasury Compliance they all refer to this letter, but it is up 
to you to make our judgment call whether this letter gives 
compliance or not, but what I am putting to you is that 
around February/March I think I used, the term that I used 
something like the writing was on the wall. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the writing was on the wall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the writing was on the wall was 
mentioned around February/March or something. 
MR KOKO:   Yes I think I made ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or March/April. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 197 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, February/March the writing was on the 
wall and I do not recall any dissent that the writing was not 
on the wall, in other words there was no compliance to 
National Treasury Regulations and this letter cannot be 
relied upon.  That is as far as I can put it Chair, I had not 
seen this letter at that time, I came to know about this 
letter I think sometime in the Parliamentary file. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I wouldn’t know. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
That’s 
I 
think 
either 
towards 
Eskom 
Parliamentary file, it was part of the bundle that Ms 
10 
Daniels put together, that’s when I came to be aware of 
this, but Chair we are playing around in circles, the writing 
was 
on 
the 
wall, 
there 
was 
no 
National 
Treasury 
compliance at that, at least around February/March and 
when the letter of award of 17 December 2015 was signed 
and when the date of the 7 t h of January is referred to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no that certainly expedites the 
proceedings, I only wanted to refer – to bring it to the 
Chairperson’s attention because it had been mentioned but 
Chair as Mr Koko says insofar as he is concerned the point 
20 
doesn’t need to be belaboured, he has given you what he 
understands is let – this email exchanged comes he says 
after the fact, the contract had been concluded without 
having obtained initial Treasury approval.  It is the 
significance of that step which is under scrutiny Mr Koko, 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 198 of 354 
 
the significance of that step and – because in terms of the 
Act wherever the Act is referred to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That appears on ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It appears ...[indistinct] the Public 
Finance Management Act section 1 says: 
“Reference to the Act includes regulations and 
instructions issued by the National Treasury so that 
if you fail to comply with the instruction or the 
regulations it is a failure to comply with the 
legislative profession.” 
10 
The failure leads to the contract being a nullity, being a 
nullity because there is no prior compliance.   So that 
contract then becomes enforceable against a government 
department or an SOE, a State Owned Entity, and that is 
significant because what Mr Singh – I am not sure about 
you in regard to the payments, why they were met, is that 
Eskom had an obligation to make those payments.   Is that 
your position as well? 
MR KOKO:   Chair when I was here I promised to send you 
a policy of Eskom, and I said you will not wait long, and I 
20 
did exactly that.   I have sent it to ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, well I recently asked them 
whether they have got what I simply called the document 
that should tell me who had what responsibilities or 
obligations in the processing of invoices and they assured 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 199 of 354 
 
me that they have got that.  So that may or may not 
necessarily be what you are talking about but I am just 
saying I have just been calling on that, but I think they 
have got everything now, or is it – Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No we do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We do I have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay do let me have copies, I don’t 
know if they are already here in advance because I do 
want to look at those documents. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes and Chair I am happy to go to it to show 
you that it is not the – it is wrong to say because the 
contract, the entering into a contract adds problems, in 
other words because it needs, for lack of a better word, 
let’s say because it is an irregular contract therefore you 
are not – you can’t pay the contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no contract? 
MR KOKO:   You ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that you can’t pay ja. 
MR KOKO:   You will be wrong to reach that contract., 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you made the point last time I think, 
at least the approach of Eskom is that if there is a contract 
but there was some irregularity as long as the outside, the 
other party has ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Acted bona fides. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 200 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...satisfactorily then they should be paid 
and then Eskom can deal internally with its own officials 
who may  not have done what they were supposed to do. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, and I have also made – I have 
selected the page, I also quoted ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   It is called an edification policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   You have to report yourself, you have to go 
and plead poverty ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why people, what is the [laughing] 
MR KOKO:   You have to go and say I am guilty 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You must go and say ...[indistinct] and 
they decide how to deal with you? 
MR KOKO:  And they decide how to deal with you but – 
and it is written in black and white. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It says, if I may quote: 
“The procurement and tender committee cannot 
20 
withhold payment to a supplier because of internal 
governance process.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think it might be – that might be 
a very fair approach in the sense that if the other party to 
the contract acted in good faith then – and it has done its 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 201 of 354 
 
party, it has performed the work, they get paid because 
sometimes when just because of some irregularity and 
sometimes no matter how small the irregularity then a party 
refuses to pay yet the other party has performed, maybe 
spent money to perform as well, it can be quite unfair 
sometimes. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, I am simply saying to you Chair it is not 
the gospel of Moses, it is what Eskom framework says, 
unless the other party did not act in good faith, in other 
words unless the other party was part of ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was party to the irregularity. 
MR KOKO:   Was party to the irregularity then there’s a 
problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine.   Well Mr – we 
will let Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  Chair I can ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh he is going to deal with it now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But as we go into it Chair, and this is a 
20 
legal matter, ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can reach for the file if you want to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have it ...[indistinct] I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, right. 
MR KOKO:   It is bundle, that is MK49, in Bundle 15. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 202 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes I will give you the reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair as we do that I just want to 
underscore that by just – and I appreciate Mr Koko is not a 
lawyer, irregularity is one thing, unlawfulness is another.   
Here this contract is not just irregular, this contract is 
unlawful and unenforceable, for want of compliance with a 
legislative requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now let’s go to what Mr Koko is drawing 
to your attention.  It is in Eskom Bundle 15[b], and that is 
on page 613.  So this is – the document is Eskom 
Procurement and Supply Management Procedure. 
MR KOKO:   Give me the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 613, but Chair you have to read 
that in context with where the paragraph starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let’s start with what is it that we are 
looking for, because if Mr Koko says this policy says in fact 
the mere fact that a contract is irregular doesn’t mean that 
20 
Eskom must withhold payment to the other particular 
contract even though the other particular contract has 
acted in good faith and has performed to the satisfaction of 
Eskom, unless you say no that is not what it says, I don’t 
need to look at it now, I can look at it later. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 203 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he goes on to say he says Eskom 
must pay if the other party has acted in good faith and they 
have performed their side of the bargain to Eskom’s 
satisfaction, so if that is uncontested we don’t need to 
really go there, I can look at it later, but if it’s contested 
then I will look at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The paragraph is qualified Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is heavily qualified.    
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let’s go to it, straight to it, because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that ...[indistinct]? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, 2.6.7, paragraph ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   2.6.7, we’re looking ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 8. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bullet point, the third bullet point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this says, and Chair look at the 
20 
heading, “Condonation of Irregular Procurement”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now I have made a distinction between 
an irregularity and a nullity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 204 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because here is the irregularity in the 
procurement, it is a process related defect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not a substance related defect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well an irregularity I guess depending 
on the circumstances could go to process, it could go to 
substance, it would depend, I don’t know here, but I don’t 
think all irregularities just go to procedure or process, I 
think some might go to process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Some might go to substance, the one 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, then you have whenever an Eskom 
employee procures assets, goods or services by any means 
without adherence to the approved procurement framework, 
now that is important Chair, and that is why I am 
emphasizing here is procedure.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The condonation process must be 
followed in order to give effect to the irregular procurement 
20 
and enable payment to the supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So there needs to be condonation 
first, then there could be payment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, then there could be payment, and  
let me skip the first two, they are important those bullet 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 205 of 354 
 
points, but let me skip them, it says: 
“the irregular procurement must be dealt with as 
follows involving three separate but simultaneous 
steps.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if you say they are important maybe 
we should ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   We should read them? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The first one is: 
“a disciplinary/remedial process.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The irregular procurement must be dealt 
with as follows, involving three separate but simultaneous 
steps. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One, or bullet one. 
“A 
disciplinary/remedial 
process 
where 
the 
employee 
who 
committed 
an 
act 
of 
financial 
misconduct may be disciplined according to the 
approved HR/IR policies and procedures.  This is in 
20 
compliance with the PFMA requirement or the 
effecting of disciplinary action if irregularities have 
occurred within the execution of procurement.” 
Bullet point 2 says: 
“An internal governance process due to a deviation 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 206 of 354 
 
from 
the 
approved 
procurement 
framework 
all 
conditions must be launched by the PTC Secretariat 
with the [Risk & Governance Trends Analysis and 
Commercial Risk Control Departments].” 
Mr Koko can you help us with what does PTC stand for? 
MR KOKO:   Procurement Tender Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Procurement and Tender Committee, 
thank you.   With Group Technology and – wait – all 
conditions must be lodged with the Procurement Tender 
Committee Secretariat with the Risk & Governance Trends 
10 
Analysis and Commercial Risk Control Departments within 
Group 
Technology 
and 
Commercial. 
 
Where 
a 
risk 
assessment must be conducted in consultation with the line 
management of the defaulting employee, in order to 
determine the risks faced by Eskom as a result of the 
procurement irregularity and any specific actions that need 
to be taken in order to rectify or prevent the irregularity 
from reoccurring.  The R & G, which is Risk & Governance 
Department, will follow up with the relevant line managers 
on the status of the corrective, preventative or disciplinary 
20 
processes to be taken within the agreed timeframes and 
will report thereon via the Senior Manager Risk and 
Governance to the Group Commercial and Management 
Committee, appear from their office and Group & Divisional 
Executives.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 207 of 354 
 
 
And bullet point 3 Chair is the one Mr Koko is 
referring to.   A payment process to the supplier which 
reads: 
“The relevant procurement tender committee is 
required to approve the payment to the supplier 
against a valid invoice and to the extent that Eskom 
has a valid contractual obligation to pay for the 
assets, goods or services delivered.   Unless 
otherwise advised by the Eskom Legal Department 
a Procurement Tender Committee is not committed 
10 
to unduly delay or withhold payment due to a 
supplier based on internal governance issues.” 
So that is why I am saying is heavily qualified Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are you relying on to say that?  
What qualifies it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It reads - the relevant PTC is required 
to approve the payment to the supplier against number one 
there must be a valid invoice and number two to the extent 
that Eskom has a valid contractual obligation to pay.  If 
their contract is a nullity Chair it is unenforceable against 
20 
the SOE and then you have another issue here, unless ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Unless otherwise advised by the 
Eskom Legal Department which means you also need them 
to be made aware of the – in this case the irregularity in 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 208 of 354 
 
order to give advice one way or the other.  Then the 
ultimate step ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The qualification you are talking about the 
one based on that part of the page where it says to the 
extent that Eskom – that says it is required to approve the 
payment to supply against a valid invoice and to the extent 
that Eskom has a valid contractual obligation to pay for the 
excess goods or services. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course – ja – is it – that is the one. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is the – that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then unless otherwise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well you see ordinarily is the 
position not that between two contracting parties if there has 
been non-compliance with something in terms of a contract 
or 
non-compliance 
with 
whatever 
else 
in 
certain 
circumstances the party who otherwise would be able to rely 
on the non-compliance not to perform his or her part can 
waive that for whatever reasons or condone that – that would 
20 
be within their – their power.  If they want to take the point 
they take the point and of course there can be litigation after 
that.   
And of course if the one party has already performed 
then issues of unjust enrichment and all of those things at 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 209 of 354 
 
common law would arise but in recent times is the position 
not that we have seen particularly with regard to contracts, 
tenders and so on involving government departments and 
SOE’s where even if the contractors declared by court to be 
unlawful the court would nevertheless say what would be just 
and equitable in the circumstances.   
You might recall the cash pay master contract and 
the decision of the constitutional court in regard to that.  
 So where it is accepted it the contract was unlawful 
but nevertheless to say at a practical level if we just say it 
10 
was unlawful that is the end of everything it might work out 
an injustice on the other party or on a party as in the case of 
the cash pay master services that related to social grants it 
could affect innocent people you know.   
So the court says it was unlawful but for a certain 
period of time we will un – accept – we will allow this 
unlawful contract to be continued with and for – to be dealt 
with as if it was lawful.  So one has those things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But those are legal issues. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are legal issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one maybe could leave until later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 210 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But from your side you can obviously as 
you – what you believe you want to pursue – to explore all 
options – all I am simply saying is… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – it may be that to the extent that 
Eskom may have taken the approach that just because there 
is an irregularity does not mean we will never pay.  We will 
check whether the other party has acted in good faith. We 
will check whether the other party has performed its part to 
our satisfaction and if it acted in good faith and it has 
10 
performed its part of the deal in good faith to our satisfaction 
we will pay and deal with our own employees or officials in 
terms of the irregularity as a way of being fair because we 
have benefitted from their services.  So – so – but I think 
maybe something that can be looked at. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At – at later but you might wish to say 
something before we move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair just to say in this matter the 
matter did come to court and Chair is correct in other 
20 
matters where third parties are involved you may want to say 
well look you will affect an adversely innocent third parties 
just carry on with this contract. 
 
In this case when it – when the matter went to court 
to review McKinsey and Regiments were all – Trillian were 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 211 of 354 
 
ordered to repay the money.  In fact McKinsey offered to pay 
the money before the judgment was out.  Trillian was fighting 
it that very ultimately ordered to pay. 
 
So in this case the money they were ordered to repay 
and issues of unjustified enrichment did not arise.  But that 
is because Chair there is a distinction where you fail to 
follow your own internal processes and the party you 
contracting with does not know that.  That is the Chair quant 
rule situation where well your directors represented to me 
they have got the approval – well they complied with internal 
10 
processes you cannot tell me otherwise after I have 
contracted with you. 
 
But when it is a matter of law and as the Chair says 
we can deal with that in due course.  It is a different matter 
and in particularly in this case where.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with it some other time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But generally speaking my impression is 
that if you are supposed to follow a procedure or if the 
procedure was legally binding and you do not follow it that 
20 
should result in a negative.  If it is a procedure where that 
was not legally binding that might be different.  So – but let 
us move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but you can then explore whatever 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 212 of 354 
 
you wish to explore. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair  
MR KOKO:  But Chair I have to comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes please comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko you do not – you cannot resist. 
MR KOKO:  This interaction is about me you must – you 
cannot – I may not be there Chair when you – when you deal 
with it at the end (talking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no your counsel will be able to 
make an input. 
10 
MR KOKO:  But I need to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – ja – say something.  Ja say 
something ja. 
MR KOKO:  Because of all the people that will be deciding I 
was the only one who was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So at least you need to consider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you can say something. 
MR KOKO:  My position.  At all material times up until 
November in my mind – up until … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MR KOKO:  2015 February/March  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  At all material … 
CHAIRPERSON:  March – February/March 2016 yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 213 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  2016.  The contract was lawful and there was no 
issue.  Post March the issues of compliance came. There is 
two issues.  One was National Treasury which was a gate 
keeper and there was condition precedent that relates to the 
30% in 00:09:36.  And remember now I was not involved 
hands on and I – and I can tell you now and I have to say 
this because I think I see where Mr Seleka is going.  Mr 
Seleka is trying to – is going to a point where he is saying 
you knew about the payment you did nothing and therefore 
you are complicit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must wait until he says so otherwise 
you could spend a lot of time on the – only to find that he is 
(talking over one another). 
MR KOKO:  I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when he does say you can deal with it. 
MR KOKO:  But all what I want you to know is that all these 
issues were ventilated at the board – at the BTC and  
CHAIRPERSON:  2015 
MR KOKO:  Not 2015 but certainly 20 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016 
20 
MR KOKO:  2016.  I have given you a date already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  13 December, 8 August and 21 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  2016. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 214 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  All these payments and were condoned for the 
for lack of a better word at the board and I had nothing to do 
with them.  Just – I just want you to know that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just before I go there. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair may I say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   This issue relates to the validity of the 
MS. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   And the reason that it was regular 
related to provision of public law and that is the irregularity 
and the law on that is with respect very clear is that until it 
is set aside that administrative act which in this case was in 
conclusion of the contract remains valid and the court may 
set it aside and then of course things are what would be 
equitable under the circumstances or even although it was 
irregular and hence unlawful but until the – it reaches that 
stage it cannot simply be regarded as a nullity and that 
20 
simply arises from the presumption in administrative law of 
regularity is it needs to be set aside so it is actually quite a 
number of complex issues of law that arises in this particular 
context in the enrichments sphere as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 215 of 354 
 
ADV BARRIE SC:   But I just wanted to make that point,. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is fine.  Okay let us 
continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then I wish to refer Mr 
Koko to page – on the same bundle 14 (c) 811. 
MR KOKO:  Not – thought you were in Bundle 15 – can I put 
the 15 away? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja that you can put aside.  The one about 
the supply chain management – yes.  Go back to 14(c) page 
811.170 
10 
MR KOKO:  Page 48.11.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 811 
MR KOKO:    Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .170.  Chair I wish to be fairly quick on 
this. 
MR KOKO:  I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 811.8170. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .170 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry 811.170 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Eskom Bundle 14. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes (c). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it. 
MR KOKO:  I am there Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 216 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  I am very familiar with this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this is an email from Mr Prish 
Govender Wednesday 2 September 2015.  It is addressed to 
Mr Koko he has copied in is Mr Singh and Edwin Mabelane – 
Subject 
is 
Feedback 
on 
McKinsey 
negotiations 
the 
attachment is feedback on the negotiations.  Final pack pdf 
and he writes: 
“Hi Matshela please find attached the above 
10 
for your attention.” 
Now this is September 2015 before the letter of acceptance 
is signed by Mr Edwin Mabelane in December. 
“So please find attached above for your 
attention the first three pages is a cover 
letter from myself providing an executive 
update.  Section 3 of the cover letter kindly 
requests your intervention to resolve certain 
key issues.  Kind Regards Prish Govender 
Program Director Group Capital Division, GM 
20 
Commodity 
Sourcing 
acting 
Group 
Technology and Commercial Division.” 
 
Mr Koko was Mr Govender reporting to you? 
MR KOKO:  No Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is he is the same department as you but 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 217 of 354 
 
in a different division? 
MR KOKO:  No Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please explain his designation. 
MR KOKO:  Commodity sourcing was – it is in Group 
Commercial. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Group Commercial was in Finance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Group Tech – Group Technology and 
Commercial. So what was your position at the time again? 
MR KOKO:  I was the Group Executive Technology and 
10 
Commercial Chair.  When I was with suspension Group 
Commercial and Technology was split.  The name was kept 
but Commercial when I came back on the 20t h of July the 
Commercial part was into – was 00:15:31 into Commercial.  
So Mr Govender reported to Mr Anoj Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Group Technology Commercial is that – is 
that position your explaining consistent with the feedback of 
October you gave. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that correct.  Oh Chair I just want to – 
20 
you signed the feedback is 22 October.. 
MR KOKO:  I signed it on the 6t h of October 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And your position was Group Executive 
Group Technology and Commercial. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair and the point that I am 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 218 of 354 
 
making that you will find in Eskom is that at that point when I 
came back Group Commercial and Technology was in 
transition of being split but I was in the office so I carried the 
office but the commercial part of the Group Technology was 
in Commercial – was in the CFO.  The sort – the cutting 
happened effectively on the 23 rd of October 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – so in September you were still in 
that position. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Mr Prish Govender is in Group 
10 
Technology and Commercial Division. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is where you were the GE. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are saying he reported to you. 
MR KOKO:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Even in September 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who reported to you – Edwin Mabelane? 
MR KOKO:  No Chair.  Edwin Mabelane was an acting in my 
20 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you came back. 
MR KOKO:  When I was on suspension.  That is when the re 
– if you look – if you read Mr Mabelane’s affidavit he deals 
with this topic I think quite nicely.  That in my absence a 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 219 of 354 
 
restructuring of the commercial division started and the 
second 00:18:05 were migrated to the CFO.  When I came 
back that process was unfolding.  I deal with the topic in my 
main affidavit.  So even though he was in my box but the 
reporting line was in the CFO until the 23r d of October when 
it was finally formalised. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you talking about Mr Edwin Mabelane 
now? 
MR KOKO:  Correct.  No, no I am saying you asked about Mr 
Mabelane I said Mr Mabelane was acting when I was on 
10 
leave. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but I am talking in September 2015. 
MR KOKO:  When I was in September 2015 Chair or not 
even in September 2015 – in June in July 20t h 2015 the 
restructuring commenced and the commercial people even 
though they were in my box they were officially reporting to 
the CFO and that process of restructuring was finalised and 
concluded  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 23rd October. 
MR KOKO:  On the 3r d of October when the – they did not 
20 
only report there but they took.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They moved out of your… 
MR KOKO:  They moved out of my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh out of your life. 
MR KOKO:  Out of my life completely.  Yes.  So – so in – at 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 220 of 354 
 
this point we had a transition period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  That – but the understanding was very clear 
commercial in the CFO and that happened before I came 
back from suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the covering letter is on the next 
page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am sorry just to – to get final 
clarification.  Would that mean that those people who were 
10 
reporting to the finance department or the CFO when – 
during the restructuring.  Does that mean that before your 
suspension they were reporting to you. 
MR KOKO:  They were reporting to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
They 
were 
reporting 
to 
me 
before 
my 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So something happened while you were on 
suspension. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They began restructuring. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you came back some of the people 
that had been reporting to you before suspension were now 
reporting to the CFO and that restructuring continued until 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 221 of 354 
 
the 23r d when it was completed. 
MR KOKO:  Indeed Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – this covering letter he refers to is 
on the next page 811.171 and he said: 
“Section 3 of the cover letter kindly requests 
your 
intervention 
to 
resolve 
certain 
key 
issues.” 
 
The letter is dated 2 September 2015 and he 
addresses to you: 
10 
“Dear Mr Koko.  Title is Feedback McKinsey 
negotiations 
Top 
Engineers 
Program 
the 
current status.” 
 
Now I am not going to read all that – let me go to 
what he says requires your intervention which is on the next 
page Key 811.179 he said Section 3. Section 3 says: 
“Summary of key items to date requiring 
EXCO intervention.” 
3.1 says: 
“Eskom 
legal 
is 
of 
the 
view 
that 
an 
20 
application 
for 
deviation 
from 
National 
Treasury guidelines on the use of consulting 
needs to be submitted.  This deviation is 
based on the fact that the guidelines is not 
specific on a risk based approached to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 222 of 354 
 
contracting.  The teams currently finalising 
the application with the office of the acting 
CEO.” 
 
Did you make any intervention in regard to that Mr 
Koko? 
MR KOKO:  No Chair.  Chair no I did nothing.  I did nothing.  
I am giving you a straight answer but I want to follow up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a straight question. 
MR KOKO:  Ja.  Every time I give you – my counsel gives 
me a lecture on how to answer he said I must not waste 
10 
time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
MR KOKO:  My counsel tells me answer the Chair and then 
you can go.  So the answer is no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  Chair the – this document is preceded by an 
email of the 31s t of August 2015 and it is on page 811.168 – 
there is two pages.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Point 168? 
MR KOKO:  8.68.  811.168. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And you know Chair my apologies to abuse you 
but Ms Mothepu says I was – I used the term I was the main 
negotiator.  That is not the term she used.  I went back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 223 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  She used a term I was central. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR KOKO:  She was central. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  That is the term she used. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I did say I cannot recall. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Main negotiator. 
MR KOKO:  Yes and I was saying to you she was wrong 
because if you look at this email on page 168 a person who 
10 
is central to the negotiations would not write to the 
negotiating team.  Remember now I am writing to the team 
that is appointed by the board tender committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I remember you made the point last 
time. 
MR KOKO:  Right.  So what I am saying to you is the basis 
of this letter – of this email was because it was up – it was 
after the meeting of the board of the 22n d of July 2015 where 
the board says go and put a corporate plan contract to deal 
with the design to cost.  And the basis of this email was to 
20 
check on the progress that the team is making.  If the team 
came to me and says it is all systems go I would have not 
set up a separate contract with fixed rate that is fully 
compliant with the National Treasury. I would have said to 
them sign because I have got this urgency. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 224 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Once they came with this lot of interventions, I 
decided I am not getting involved here.  The team has – they 
have been appointed by the board, they have been given the 
mandate they must live within the authority.  If they need any 
intervention, the intervention can only come from the 
authority that gave them not me – I left them and went to do 
a separate contract that I signed and initialised on the 29 t h 
of September 2015 that was eventually signed in 2016 a year 
later by Mr Mabelane.  So I did nothing Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remind me what are the topics that 
still remain to be dealt with in Mr Koko’s evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the moment it is transactions that you 
are dealing with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The transactions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are trying to finalise McKinsey 
Trillian.  The other transactions will be in relation to Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I – well the plan was before we to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 225 of 354 
 
get to Tegeta because it is quite heavy we could get out of 
the way the travel to Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja.  No that is fine I just wanted to 
have an idea. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we are busy with McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is the issue of the 
travelling. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it is Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is alright.  Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja we – we will also briefly touch on – 
associated with the travel Mr Koko links or otherwise or 
relations or otherwise with the Gupta’s 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Mr Koko okay – the thing is I ask you 
20 
one question you answer it by giving … 
MR KOKO:  I gave you direct answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Koko is following his counsel’s 
advice. 
MR KOKO:  I give a direct answer Sir – I did nothing. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 226 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Because there is a problem with 
this agreement you say you signed as well and I do not want 
to go there because we did go into it when you first 
appeared. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I have answered the question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja thank you.  Thank you.  The 
Chairperson for the Chairperson’s benefit Mr Koko if you did 
nothing is it not surprising because as you told the 
Chairperson last time you signed what I have now seen is 
10 
called 
the 
position 
paper 
which 
adopts 
the 
treasury 
regulations of 2013/2014.  It came into effect on the 1s t of 
January 2014.   
MR KOKO:  I confirm I signed that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  In August 2014 you signed it. 
MR KOKO:  I confirm I did that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is the cost containment and you 
appoint consultants on the basis of the fee, correct? 
MR KOKO:  I confirm that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I would have thought in September 2015 
20 
which is the year later when Mr Prish Govender says to you 
we need your intervention on Section 3 and the first foremost 
item on that section. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Instruction 3 or Section3.? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He said Section 3. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 227 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Compliance with National Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR KOKO:  Chair I am very familiar with this document – I 
know it very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR KOKO:  I am very familiar with this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no, no the one thing that I have 
noticed is that you read Mr Koko – you read these 
documents and you know where – what is what. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he watches Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he watches.  Ja I would have thought 
that being familiar with that specific issue he was raising in 
3.1 you would have done something – so I am surprised 
when you say you did not – you did nothing. 
MR KOKO:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So if you do not have an answer to that 
that is okay.  I am just expressing myself. 
MR KOKO:  No, no. I do.  Chair it is not surprising at all. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  My first day when I came to work I sent an email 
to Mr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20 July 
MR KOKO:  20 July and I told him we need to comply to the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 228 of 354 
 
cost containment the requirement of National Treasury or we 
get a – an approval from National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you sent an email to? 
MR KOKO:  Mr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chairman. 
MR KOKO:  That is the email – one of the emails that he 
denies that I discussed it with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  And I also told him that Mr Ngubane once he 
understood what we need to do he was very clear to Ms 
10 
Daniels, comply or we will get the approval from Mr 
Treasury.  At all material times, that is what directed me.  
Guys, you know the rules.  You comply or you get...  You 
get national consult... division.  There is...  So I did not 
have to get(?) anything.  You know the rules, chaps.  You 
must comply or you must go to Mr Treasury.  Mr Treasury 
must agree with you but you cannot simply not comply.  
And I have no other interventions to do and the board, as a 
matter of fact and that is what I told Dr Ngubane, the board 
has no authority to let you carry on without complying.  Ja, 
20 
look at this.  There is nothing you could have done.  It is 
as simple as that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your answer that:  I did not do – 
that you did not do anything because you had already clear 
to them what they were supposed to ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 229 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   They knew my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   They knew exactly what ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...answer will get for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I remember those emails which 
you say are to Dr Ngubane, which he has denied, but I do 
10 
not recall in any of those emails that you are saying you 
need Treasury approval.   
MR KOKO:   Chair, go to my transcript.  I do not think we 
should waste your time.  My transcripts are very clear of 
my discussion with Dr Ngubane.  It was all about National 
Treasury’s compliance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember you were saying, when you 
were giving evidence at some stage, that you raised I think 
the issue with him and you said you listened to you very 
attentively ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And once he saw your point, he ran with 
it. 
MR KOKO:   It was on this point, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 230 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   So we are wasting your time if you put...  The 
transcript will show this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This matter was decided by BTC.  
Dr Ngubane was not a BTC.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But that does not necessarily mean he 
did not send an email to him or ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...discuss with him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Or 
discussed 
with 
him 
as 
the 
chairperson of the whole board.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I...  Yes, I have the emails which 
Mr Koko sends out to Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have opened to them.  Maybe 
Mr Koko should check and tell us which one says to 
Dr Ngubane you need Treasury approval ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No, Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...for the MSA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I make a proposition to you that of all 
the emails I have sent to Dr Ngubane, I am happy to deal 
with them one by one, explain to you why I sent to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 231 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Sent those emails through to him.  You gave 
us that opportunity.  I took that opportunity to deal with two 
of them.  Both of them on that latch(?) the MSA.  And I told 
you that the reason I sent this Dr Ngubane is because the 
board was carried away giving the cost constraints at the 
time to go with the risk approach which started in my time 
before I was expanded.  And I told Dr Ngubane that you 
cannot proceed on this line until or and unless you have 
National Treasury’s approval.  The transcript will deal with 
that straightforward. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you may wish to do Mr Seleka 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   I mean, it is quite simple here, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka’s assistants are just quick.  They 
can just go to the transcripts   
CHAIRPERSON:   what you may wish to do if there is an 
issue about what Mr Koko may have said or did not say in 
his evidence about his discussion with Mr Ngubane or the 
20 
email would be that maybe your junior look it up, check 
that.  If necessary, Mr Koko is coming back on Monday, is 
it not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That can be ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 232 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...clarified on Monday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Or 
even 
by 
way 
of 
a 
written 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, when I come on Monday we will deal 
with this.  It will disappear quickly because I know what I 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe your junior can make a note 
and it can be sorted out on Monday.  In the meantime, she 
can look it up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct] [Speaker moves away from 
microphone – unclear]  That is fine, Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we make progress, ka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will also – ja, let me not say 
upfront but...  Then Chair, let me – maybe this might be the 
last or...  Mr Koko, let us go to page 829.36 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Six...  Page - I mean, 829.36.  I 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I listened last time, Mr Koko, 
when you were saying there was a payment to be made in 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 233 of 354 
 
terms of this agreement. 
MR KOKO:   [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The people are saying there was no 
figure but there was an amount to be paid.  Is my 
recollection correct? 
MR KOKO:   No, your recollection ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not correct? 
MR KOKO:   Your recollection is not correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have not asked the question yet, 
except those that you have answered.  Now in this 
document, we have seen that your feedback to the BTC is 
that the value of the contract is zero, correct? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   The value of the contract ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read to you then. 
20 
MR KOKO:   The value of the contract is zero and it has 
got 
an 
upfront 
payment 
of 
R 475 million. 
 
That 
R 475 million, if I recollect, will be deducted out of future 
invoices.  That R 475 million was not in the original 
mandate and it was...  If you read the minutes and I hope 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 234 of 354 
 
we will go to it now, now that we are in it.  You will see the 
meeting clearly says that the R 475 million is rectified 
because it was not in the original mandate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let us go to paragraph – the 
introduction on page 829.36.  It says: 
“In accordance with the mandate approved by 
the Board Tender Committee via Round Robin 
on 6 July 2015 to negotiate with McKinsey to 
develop 
the 
current 
Top 
Engineers 
Programme...” 
10 
 
And it goes on and on.  The next paragraph 
says: 
“The mandate provided as follows. 
The mandate to negotiate with McKinsey and 
to 
develop 
the 
current 
Top 
Engineers 
Programme into an internal consulting unit that 
can 
provide 
broad 
class 
management 
consulting 
services, 
capable 
of 
resolving 
emerging company wide risks by driving the 
saving 
and 
unlocking 
cash, 
is 
hereby 
20 
approved, subject to the following: 
1.1 
The contract value will be zero rand 
as this initiative is self-funding and the project 
duration is limited to a maximum of three 
years...” 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 235 of 354 
 
 
It is repeated somewhere else in the document.   
MR KOKO:   Chair, the mandate that was given on the 
6 t h of July 2015, this is the mandate that was given and 
that is why the... had to be rectified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say when the mandate was 
originally given, the value was zero? 
MR KOKO:   yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But later on, there was this amount of 
R 475 million ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and that was ratified later? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  And the minutes say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ye. 
MR KOKO:   I hope Mr Seleka will take you through the 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, let us see how that comes 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it is not ratification of 
20 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page 829.39 because that 
repeatedly says the contract is zero because it is self-
funding.  It is risk based.  Then on page 829.39, you have 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 236 of 354 
 
two columns.  The second two columns and on the right 
side of it where it starts with:   
“McKinsey has not accepted initial position 
concerning project setup costs and expenses 
payment all having been paid from real-life 
savings.   
McKinsey would require project setup and fees 
from value packages as a down payment as 
McKinsey is of the view that they will be 
exposed to a higher ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whereabout are you reading from it – 
point 39? 
MR KOKO:   The second column.  329 there.  The second 
column on the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one starting with ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...McKinsey has not accepted. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Okay continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the second one is: 
“McKinsey would require project setup and 
fees for value packages as down payment as 
McKinsey is of the view that they will be 
exposed to a higher than acceptable cash-flow 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 237 of 354 
 
risk. 
This risk would not be acceptable to McKinsey 
as a company. 
McKinsey has, therefore, proposed.   
They receive down payments in view of project 
setup costs as consulting fees for each work 
stream, 
that 
they 
will... 
pay 
after 
the 
commencement of each work packages. 
The down payments will be paid equally over a 
predetermined duration of 6 or 12-months 
10 
depending on the individual work stream...” 
 
And it talks about the size and duration of the 
down payments will depend on the nature and scope of 
work of each individual work stream.  The – then I – well, 
let me go to the last bullet point in that block, Chair.  It 
says: 
“The proposed setup costs plus consulting 
fees to be paid as a down payment for the 
procurement stream is R 15 million payable 
after commencement of each work package at 
20 
equal tranches of R 8.3 million over a 6-month 
period. 
If McKinsey defaults, immediately initiates a 
refund process... will have the right to call up 
the bank guarantee thus ensuring that the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 238 of 354 
 
principle 
of 
zero 
rand 
value 
contract 
is 
maintained...” 
 
And it is as a result of that, is it correct Mr Koko 
that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is maintained for Eskom, hey? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is maintained for Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “There will, however, be a timing  
“difference from cash-flow perspective in terms 
of realising the zero rand value principle...”   
10 
 
It is correct, Mr Koko, then is it that it is as a 
result of McKinsey’s insistence that the down payment of 
R 475 million was arrived at? 
MR KOKO:   [Indistinct] [Speaker unclear] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, remember what your counsel said?  
Straight answer.  Yes or no? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, this is what it says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  [laughs] 
MR KOKO:   But Chair now that I have answered the 
20 
answer yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Look at the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   On the left-hand side ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 239 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   It has got a title that says approved mandate 
objector(?) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   You will find that on 327. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And on the right-hand side it says results 
achieved.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   The team is doing a wonderful thing there, 
10 
Chair...  [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   This is what we came to tell you on the 
6 t h of July.  This is what we achieved.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   And Chair... [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   This is what we asked.  This is what we 
achieved.  Condone or rectify the deviations.  It is up to 
20 
the Board Tender Committee to say we do not accept or we 
accept.  Now that I have answered the answer yes, I am 
also giving you information that will benefit you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   There is nothing wrong. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 240 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the next page, Chair, which deals 
with recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that point 40? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 5 – paragraph 3.  First it 
says:  Financial Evaluation of Negotiated Contract Price.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry.  I thought you 
were already reading on page – point 40, were you not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   40? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You... reading there yet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I have finished the part I 
wanted to read there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that you said on the next page.  
So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for me that was the page we were on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 241 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go to page 829.43.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you have paragraph 3, Financial 
Evaluation of Negotiated Contract Price.  And it reads: 
“Due to the fact that the contract value will be 
zero rand... is self-funding, Eskom’s financial 
evaluation was usually not done. 
10 
However, 
the 
proposed 
down 
payment 
necessitated that the financial evaluation be 
done. 
The process is currently in the process(sic) 
and 
a 
financial 
report 
will 
be 
submitted 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The process is currently in progress. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In progress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
20 
“...and the financial report will be submitted to 
the members at the meeting...” 
 
Was that done Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   I cannot recall, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then paragraph 4, Recommendation: 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 242 of 354 
 
“To 
ratify 
minor 
differences 
between 
negotiated outcomes and approved mandate 
parameters Eskom in sub-clause 4.1 to 4.4...” 
 
And that aspect deals with the down payment of 
R 475 million.  Was that down payment made to McKinsey? 
MR KOKO:   I do not know Chair.  The project manager will 
know.  Chair, I consistently have told you that this 
Commission has got the wrong person answering these 
questions but id o not know.  All that I - all that I am happy 
with and all what I power(?) over(?) is that the team played 
10 
open cards to the decision maker and the decision maker 
made the decision with the eyes wide open and if the – if 
the money was paid, it was approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now, Mr Seleka, I thought you 
were not so convinced that there was ratification as 
Mr Koko said.  So I thought you were taken us or are we on 
our way there? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there was ratification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I know you have said that but I 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Because the minutes says so 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought Mr Koko was saying – was 
kind of questioning whether the ratification was for that or 
something like that.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 243 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the way you lost me, it looks I may 
have misunderstood you Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  Chair, he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The ratification of 475? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
remember 
whether 
you 
were 
questioning that or not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I was not questioning that.  I was 
questioning how the amount came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The down payment came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the sake of completeness.  Can you 
tell me – can you show me Mr Koko where the ratification 
20 
is? 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka must take us to the minutes of the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the BTC? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  It says – it is very clear.  I can tell you. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 244 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look, if you do not find it immediately, it 
is fine.  I thought you might just ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  Mr Seleka, must take us there.  If I 
am there, I would know it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there are minutes that I see at page 
830 but that must be the board because I see it was 
checked by Dr Ngubane.  No, it is fine.  We can find it 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have got the minutes on my computer.  
So during the break I can take them out and give you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   But I can tell you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I stand by this submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And this submission is complied in all 
aspects.  And I remember, I cannot tell you how the 
ratification came about because I was not part of the 
Negotiating Team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   That I have no knowledge of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But what I am happy with, however it came 
about it was transparent to the BTC and the BTC approved 
it and in the event that it was paid, which I will not know, it 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 245 of 354 
 
was paid lawfully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, just give me the date of the BTC 
meeting? 
MR KOKO:   21 October 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page reference? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue then.  If he has found it, 
you can have a look quickly.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh it is not the minutes.  It just an 
10 
extract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, do not worry.  We will find them the 
minutes ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   But even the extracts of the minutes also. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have read them before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay let us continue.  We will see 
after the break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, there is also something I was 
looking for here which I am not immediately finding which 
is that you also recommended additions to the project. 
MR KOKO:   I also recommended additions to the project.  
Chair, that is the affidavit ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 246 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not you personally but ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   You cannot say you.  Eskom has got 44 000 
employees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Mr Koko.  The people who signed 
the recommendation is – are here.  Charles Kalema 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Govender, Mandla Nobinga(?) if I am 
pronouncing it correctly.  And then Matshela Koko.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  But Chair, Eskom a delegation to 
10 
authority.  What does the Group Executive signs for?  It 
signs for compliance.  It does not sign for...  He cannot be.  
So he cannot be.  He is not a specialist.  [Speaker unclear] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So you cannot bring a transaction that is – 
that has got to do with – let me give you an example of 
Eskom Treasury where you say because Mr Koko signed 
therefore he signed for National Treasury.  He cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Koko ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I think ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know what exactly you are 
talking about but to the extent that you are talking about 
this document that we are dealing with and the fact that 
you signed it at page 829.44.  There is nothing I see on 
this document or even next to your signature that suggests 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 247 of 354 
 
that you signed it or any reason other different from the 
reason why the others signed it.  Because the last 
paragraph is 4 and the heading to 4 is Recommendation 
and it says: 
“To 
ratify 
minor 
differences 
between 
negotiated outcomes and approved mandate 
parameters is contained in sub-clause 4.1 to 
4.4...” 
 
So as I read it, it says it is a recommendation for 
the ratification of the so-called minor differences and that 
10 
seems to suggest to me that all of these people who have 
signed here are saying to whatever authority this document 
is directed at:  We are recommending that you ratify these 
minor differences.  That is how I read it. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   Fortunately, on this transaction ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I can live with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Fortunately ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no problem with that? 
MR KOKO:   On this transaction.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have no problem with that.  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 248 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Fortunately, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But your understanding is not right.  Upon this 
document... ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see what you are saying may 
well be so if you say not necessarily in terms of what is 
written in this document but in – on the basis of what is 
written in Eskom policies or regulations. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say, in terms of those internal 
documents, when I was the Group Executive signs any 
document such as this, I am not signing to say I go along 
with what they are saying in substance. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am signing to say there has been 
compliance with A, B, C. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which, of course, I will not know. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So I am saying to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   The Group Executive Technology and 
Commercial at that point held the position of the Chief 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 249 of 354 
 
Procurement Officer who is an official at the Board Tender 
Committee who is accepted to sign every single document 
that serves before the Board Tender Committee to be 
compliant with the requirements of the Board Tender 
Committee.  It is impossible for him to be an expert on 
everything.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I understand  I think what 
should happen in that situation is that something should be 
written to indicate that that is what you are signing for 
because in the absence of that, one read this and says:  
10 
Oh, Mr Koko was recommending this as well. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But all... It is not done that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I do hope in defence of my colleagues 
that are still there, the documents get revised and written 
that way.  The 32-10-34 has got a requirement of who signs 
for what.  So if you go into the 32-10-34 it will tell you 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...who signs and why he signs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR KOKO:   So...  But this – I mean, I have signed many 
of these documents which says there you signed to say 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 250 of 354 
 
everything is correct.  So it is impossible.  So let me give 
you an example.  I am not a nuclear scientist.  When the 
nuclear scientist in Eskom goes to the... committee, I must 
sign to make sure that all the governance processes have 
been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But in any event, Chair.  In this document that 
is before you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...I am happy to have signed for it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the recommendations then have 
that 4.4 as well above the signatures or just before the 
people signing.  The SOE format Service Level Agreement, 
format of contract can be approved with its associated 
conditions.  And then that condition included Clause 22 
about you will do nothing until you have received Treasury 
approval.  You remember the clause? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that Mr Seleka. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
It 
included 
a 
clause 
twenty 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat from the question, from the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 251 of 354 
 
beginning.  I have missed it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So 4.4 reads: 
“The SLA, Service Level Agreement, which is 
one 
of 
the 
recommendations 
format 
of 
contracting, be approved with its associated 
conditions...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that SLA included, it was 22, in 
terms of which Eskom undertook that it will do nothing – 
and I am paraphrasing – until it has received Treasury 
10 
approval.   
MR KOKO:   In other words, the gatekeeper to this contract 
is compliant to National Treasury Regulations.  So.  And 
this is normal, Chair, the – because it is a bespoke(?) 
contract, the Board Tender Committee has to agree to it 
with the necessary conditions.  So this is – I understood 
exactly what that meant when I signed it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you.  Then lastly is 4.5 
which says: 
“That 
recommended 
that 
the 
Generation, 
20 
Primary Energy and Claims Management Value 
Packages as contained in Appendix 7, 8 and 9 
be accepted and included as part of this 
transaction...” 
 
So those packages, you were recommending that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 252 of 354 
 
they be added to the original proposal when they were not 
there initially. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Is 
that 
not 
consistent 
with 
Ms Matshepo’s evidence? 
MR KOKO:   No, Ms Matshepo’s evidence is nonsense, 
man.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you and Mr Anoj added to the 
original proposal that had been made by McKinsey and 
Regiments ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...or Trillian. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this is where you have to demand 
paperwork.  This is where Mr Seleka has to show and tell.  
Ms 
Matshepo’s 
emails 
are 
after 
this... 
December.  
Ms Matshepo says... after – in November/December and 
then comes in and says we have added, it is after this 
Chair, it is not that type of evidence.  If you become 
pedantic and you just follow paperwork, Ms Mothepu is 
going to be exposed and she needs to come and explain to 
20 
you why she says I have changed and added items when 
the additions served on her to the board on the 6 October 
and she refers to the November and December.  
And in any event, Chair, in any event, Ms Mothepu, 
and here is one issue that makes her argument fall.  One 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 253 of 354 
 
of the things that she says I added was master – vendor 
procurement, which is not part of 4.5.  Vendor procurement 
is not part of Generation, vendor procurement is not part of 
[indistinct], vendor procurement is not part of claims 
management.   
So the things that she says I have added, two of 
them, Duvha insurance and master vending are not part of 
4.5.  She was blatantly lying to you.  Now you need to 
understand, 
given 
the 
documents 
here 
because 
the 
documents are telling you something different and we will 
10 
get to other witnesses.  I mean, I received a document, an 
affidavit from witness 3, that all of a sudden she says I did 
not know Mr Koko in 2013 but I saw him and recognised 
him.  Why would somebody who does not know me, saw me 
seemingly.  The evidence before you, Chair, that you must 
go, when you sit on your own, making your report, must 
just look at the documents and the evidence. 
Duvha insurance, master services, is not part of 
this 4.5.  That is the evidence before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Ms Mothepu – I 
will read from the affidavit, it is one of the bundles, but 
Chair, paragraph 14 – bundle 14, let me read.  It says: 
“From October 2015 my team was introduced to 
[indistinct] Matshela Koko, Prish Govender, Andre 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 254 of 354 
 
Pillay and Edwin Mabelane.” 
She has you actually written twice. 
“Each initiative steering team would meet regularly 
with designated Eskom representatives at Megawatt 
Park.” 
And 27: 
“Matshela Koko and Anoj Singh added initiatives 
that were not provisionally on the proposal.  This 
were online vending and Duvha insurance claim and 
rebuild Hitachi insurance settlement.” 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am saying to you all the three – and I 
am glad Mr Seleka and God is with Moses, I always say so, 
I have got nothing to do with 4.5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the claims management, there the 
package is. 
MR KOKO:   The claims management is Medupi and Kusile, 
it is building – it is the issue that is on the headline of 
Maake.  They now raise it is Maake saying - before we 
finish this, before you finish your report, all your witnesses 
that are star witnesses will be behind bars soon, but 
20 
anyway.  The claim management is Group Capital, it is 
Maake, it is all the claims in Medupi and Kusile, it is purely 
Kusile and Medupi and Ingula(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So are you saying to the Chairperson 
what Ms Mosilo is saying here as initiatives added, online 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 255 of 354 
 
vending, Duvha insurance, rebuild Hitachi, were they in the 
proposal or were they not in the proposal? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am saying to you what is in the 
proposal is here.  What is in the proposal I signed off on it 
on the 6 August 2015.  It served on the board on the 21 
October 2015.  There is no vendor management here, there 
is no Duvha systems here.  There is no rebuilding of Duvha 
boilers here.  It is things that are added, are tabulated, 
Chair, you will find them, they are here, they are detailed 
and they are not added by me, they are added by 
10 
negotiating team that negotiated them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so the answer is, no they are not 
in the proposal. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They would not have been part of the 
MSA. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, can we go to bundle 
16(b) just to finish off on this point? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Can I take this away? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just keep it there.  16(b), this is Mr 
Anoj’s bundle.  Did I say 16(b)?  Ja, so Mr Singh has 
provided a supplementary affidavit to the Commission.  The 
affidavit starts on page 1016 but I want – I would like you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 256 of 354 
 
to go to page 1018, paragraph 11 with the heading: 
“Top consultants programme steering committee 
meeting.” 
MR KOKO:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the Chairperson there?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph 11 
reads: 
“The first Top Consultants Programme Steering 
Committee meeting was held on 9 February 2016.  I 
10 
attach hereto the PowerPoint presentation as AS5 
which was presented on the day setting out inter 
alia: 
1. An overview of the MSA. 
2. Steering committee terms of reference. 
3. Role and responsibility of steering committee. 
1 of 2 and 2 of 2 and then 11.4: 
“Programme steering and leadership.” 
Turn the page: 
5. The contract currently includes work packages. 
20 
6: Work packages initiative proposal and Steerco  
    approvals.” 
Now we go to AS5 which is from page 1108 of Eskom 
bundle 16.  So that is the presentation he has provided to 
the Commission which he said was made through the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 257 of 354 
 
Steerco on the 9 February 2016.  On the first page, Chair, 
you see: 
“Steering committee meeting agenda.” 
You have: 
1. Opening 
and 
welcome 
by 
the 
Chairman, 
safety 
briefing introductions and apologies. 
2. Overall description of the mechanics of the contract.” 
And there is valid points there: 
“High level MSA overview, description of the work 
packages, approval by steering committee.” 
10 
And it goes on 3, to deal with the packages.  The next 
page you see members of Steerco.  Mr Anoj Singh, their 
passport photos are there.  Mr Anoj Singh is there, the 
Group CFO, Mr Matshela Koko, Generation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the Matshela Koko who appears in 
that picture does not look very much like the one in front of 
me. 
MR KOKO:   It is the same person, Chair, I can confirm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let us continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The fault must be with whoever took the 
20 
picture.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the rest of the Eskom team is 
there.  Well, ja, those who constituted Steerco and then 
you have other members from McKinsey and Trillian.  Ms 
Mothepu is also there.  Then the agenda is repeated.  You 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 258 of 354 
 
turn the page, Chairperson: 
“MSA 
overview, 
three 
year 
contract, 
100% 
performance-based.” 
And, Mr Koko, when I read the three year contract this may 
– you may or may not be able to comment, it reminds me 
what Ms Goodson’s evidence in her affidavit that she was 
told when she joined Trillian in – I think when she joined, 
in November or December 2015, the activity started there 
in 2016 that the operations of Trillian are for this 
dispensation and the dispensation she was told about was 
10 
a three year period.  I thought what a coincidence with this 
contract being for three years. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have no personal knowledge of the 
discussions Ms Mothepu had with other people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Then on the next page, Chair, you 
have the block talking of: 
“Role and responsibilities of steering committee” 
And they give you the roles and responsibilities.   
1 of 2 and again 2 of 2.  Turn the page, Chair to 
1112: 
20 
“Programme steering leadership” 
Then you have the steering committee members’ names set 
out and then under that you have the various packages or 
initiatives to which the work will relate.   
So one is procurement with Mr Edwin Mabelane, as 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 259 of 354 
 
the first name. 
Two 
is 
Primary 
Energy, 
the 
first 
name 
Luis 
Mboweni. 
Three is Generation and the first name there is Mr 
Matshela Koko. 
Claims is Abram Masango, finance is Anoj Singh. 
Mr Koko, so those are the various packages within the 
MSA. 
MR KOKO:   Yes and, Mr Chair, I do not want to get 
emotional and get upset, this – where is – if you take this 
10 
as a basis, and really it upsets me now, if you take this as 
a basis of what was presented on the 9 February – and I 
have a very vague memory of it, it lists the packages.  So 
if you say Master Services you will see that it cannot fit in 
where my name is.  It cannot.  And if any witness come and 
say Mr Koko caused a change or added a topic and that 
topic is vendor management or insurance, then you come 
here, but it does not fit here.  It actually fits in finance 
which is what I have always been saying and you will see – 
look at Ms Mothepu’s name.  Look at it, Chair, it is under 
20 
number 5, it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Do see that?  My name is not 
there.  So she could not have negotiated with me on issues 
that under number 5.  She is not on number 3 which is 
where I would be.   
Any package that you add under Generation will 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 260 of 354 
 
have to be authorised by me.  Any package that gets done 
under finance, where she is, will have to be financed by 
others and, Chair, once again, once again, I am begging 
you to just follow the evidence.  I have told you that I had 
a very soft spot for her, I liked her, I like how she carried 
herself, she had difficulty talking to people in Eskom and I 
would assist her.  If she want to talk to people in Treasury 
I would pick up the phone and say talk to this young lady.  
If she want to talk to people in insurance, I would assist 
her.  That is the – I actually tried to play a mentoring role 
10 
to her but the record speaks for itself, Chair, just focus on 
the records, forget the gossip.  Do not be like Ms Thuli 
Madonsela who took the gossip.  The documents are here, 
let us stay with the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chairman, may I …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I apologise, Sir, but I am very emotional 
because I have been through this hundred times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Barry? 
20 
ADV BARRIE SC:   The updated version of the bundle 16 
has not been sent to us, so we do not have these 
documents.  I did not want to interrupt but they can even 
be sent to us electronically or emailed to use right now, 
that is fine, but our bundle stops at page 792 and that was 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 261 of 354 
 
at the end of March, so we were not given access to the 
updated bundle.  It can just be sent to us even as we sit 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I do not believe that is correct 
because I have asked for this bundle after it was updated 
to be sent to Mr Ndou.  He is nodding his head.  Yes 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is nodding? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I was copied in the email that 
10 
went to him, witnessed his statement. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, which Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
MR KOKO:   I think Mr Seleka is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I remember seeing these document from Mr 
Ndou. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I think, I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe they were not passed on to 
20 
Mr Barrie.  Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I think so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, so maybe that is what 
happened. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Ndou is right. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 262 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Witness 3 …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Prof Lourens, I have seen the document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja and Prof Lourens because they 
asked for it. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Ndou sent them to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Koko, the Chair will look at the 
emails from Ms Mothepu because Ms Mothepu testifies 
about the emails that she sent to you.  I do not think they 
10 
can be called gossip.  The emails say: 
“Thank you for meeting with me.” 
And go on to say this is what is being – needs to be 
discussed and then, in some of them, arranges that we 
should have a meeting. 
MR KOKO:   And there is no confirmation those meetings 
took place, to discuss those specific topics, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but wait, that is not the point.  
MR KOKO:   What is the point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I am saying to you is this.  The 
20 
Chairperson will look at the emails which is not gossip, it 
is emails that has been sent one, to you – I mean, one, to 
your PA that copied you and the others are sent directly to 
you and she is thanking you for having met with you and 
she also arranges to have a meeting.  And she testifies to 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 263 of 354 
 
the extent of those emails, nothing more, nothing less. 
MR KOKO:   The Chairman will also look at the transcript 
that Ms Mothepu says I gave her an Indian man to work 
with on these topics and this Indian man turns to be my 
professional assistant who is a black lady.  So the 
Chairman must also take into account that she lied to you.  
And, Chair, you must also take into account that I 
responded to none of those emails.  I could not respond to 
any of them because they are not in my scope. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, what I wanted to 
10 
try and remember… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is whether, Mr Koko, you accepted that 
you received those emails but did not respond or whether 
you disputed that they were sent to you. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I cannot even remember receiving 
those emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I cannot remember receiving those emails and 
even if I received them I would not have acted on them 
20 
because they were outside my competency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, except that if she says she met 
with you when you know – when you knew you did not meet 
with her you could respond and say what are you talking 
about, I never met with you. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 264 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is what I am saying to you, I have 
said it categorically that I have never met Ms Mothepu to 
discuss the issues that are on those emails.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have never, I could not.  The best I could do 
is to refer her to the people that are dealing with those 
topics. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the point that I am putting to you is 
that if you knew that you did not meet with her and you 
receive an email from her saying that she met with you and 
10 
discussed those topics with you that would be all the more 
reason why, if you did receive such an email from her, it 
would be necessary to write back and say what are you 
talking about?  I never met with you. 
MR KOKO:   No, let me tell you a story and let me tell you 
the fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   By the 23 r d – all those emails, without fail, are 
after the 23 October when I was out of that official office.   
New person was in that office to deal with whatever comes 
20 
in that office.  When you are Deputy Chief Justice and you 
get promoted, the new Deputy Chief Justice comes in to 
deal with whatever comes into there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, except, of course, that if there 
are matters that are raised that happened while I was there 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 265 of 354 
 
and he or she was to verify whether that is actually the 
position, that person can ask me or refer and say I want to 
respond this but it happened during your time, what is the 
position?  And then I can say I never had a meeting with 
that person.  That part you understand? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, nobody came to me to say have you 
had a discussion with Ms Mothepu?  I do not remember 
getting her emails.  I have never responded to her emails.  
The bulk part of my interactions with her was to help her to 
meet people in Eskom, to introduce her to people, to drink 
10 
coffee with her and other people that were assisting, but I 
would never deal with insurance, for example.  That 
insurance claim is finance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   The Group Executive Generation has no 
competency 
in 
insurance. 
 The 
Group 
Executive 
for 
Generation has no competency in Master Vending.  He may 
know something to do, but it is not his competency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is the position not that even though 
you may have moved out of one position or department to 
20 
another you still use the same email address and therefore 
the emails would still have come to you if they were sent to 
you? 
MR KOKO:   Oh, Chair, I have come to accept – I have 
come to appreciate why people continued to send me 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 266 of 354 
 
emails on the issues that I have dealt with in my previous 
position as a Group Executive Commercial.  I now have 
come to peace with that because I had signed the contract, 
I had signed the contract.  I had signed the corporate plan 
contract.  So people for whatever reason may have not 
been – may have not accepted that I am out of the role that 
enabled me to sign those contracts and they probably 
thought that I have an influence when I was out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair and I did not want to go into this 
10 
matter but it is important to see what Ms Mothepu writes in 
the email because it is not about I am pursuing the matter 
with Mr Koko when he has already left his office or his 
position as – whichever position it was.  A person who 
writes – and these emails, we read them, you know, 
previously.  But here is the one of 30 November 2015.  She 
says: 
“Good day, Matshela, I hope this email finds you 
well and it was a pleasure meeting you last week.  I 
had a chat with Eric Wood regarding additional 
20 
financial initiatives that need to be included as part 
our balance sheet optimization and cash unlocking.” 
But that first line that I had pleasure meeting you last week 
is what we are talking about. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair, I have …[intervenes] 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 267 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is not gossip. 
MR KOKO:   I have never denied meeting Ms Mothepu.  
But if Mr Seleka reads that I have met her to discuss the 
financial issues that she refers to later is wrong.  I have 
met Ms Mothepu.  I have enjoyed interacting with her but 
to say you have met her to discuss the issues that she 
raised later, Mr Seleka is wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not me, there is nothing wrong or 
right about …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well, yes, if the emails say that is 
what you met to discuss on a particular occasion it would 
be the author of the emails. 
MR KOKO:   No but read it again, Mr Seleka, read that 
email again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let me read the other one, 5 
December 2015. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it reads: 
“Hi Matshela …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Do you want him to read the 
previous one? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you want to listen to it 
properly? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 268 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Read it, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read it.  I say: 
“I hope this email finds you well and it was a 
pleasure meeting you last week.  I had a chat with 
Eric Wood regarding additional financial initiatives 
that need to be included as part our balance sheet 
optimization and cash unlocking financial initiatives 
stream.  These include the sale and lease-back on 
the optic fibre network, prepaid electricity vending, 
10 
EFC 
disposal, 
Hitachi 
claims, 
replacement 
of 
boilers 
and 
Duvha 
insurance 
claim. 
 
We 
are 
currently compiling a business case for these 
initiatives and require some information from you 
and your team.  We would like to set up time early 
this week with yourself and your team to source the 
information in order to complete the business case 
by the end of the week.” 
MR KOKO:   Where in that letter does it say she discussed 
those things with me?  Where in that email does it she 
20 
discussed those things with me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka, I think he wanted to 
refer, as I understand it, to refer to the fact that she says 
she met with you.  
MR KOKO:   She met …[intervenes] 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 269 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think he wants to go to another 
one, I do not know whether that is the one. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, but Chair, there is nowhere in that 
email where Ms Mothepu says she discussed those issues 
with me.  She says she met me last week, she discussed 
these issues with others.  She did not discuss with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So let that be very clear.  She met with me, 
she discussed these issues with others, not with me 
because she could not have discussed them with me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair.  Mr Eric Wood or Dr Eric 
Wood, we know is at Trillian, he is Ms Mosilo’s boss.  She 
has gone back after meeting with you to discuss the 
additional financial initiatives that need to be included and 
she is saying to you we need more information and they 
would like time early this week to set up – time early this 
week with yourself and your team to source the information 
in order to complete the business cases by the end of the 
week. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Excellent and elsewhere – elsewhere, even on 
Twitter, in her book, she has written a book, she said Mr 
Koko never gave me audience. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Never what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Never gave me? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 270 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Audience on these topics.  She said Mr Wood 
had to phone her when she was on her sickbed to say go 
and wait on Mr Koko’s door and when Mr Koko and found 
me on the door, Mr Koko told me who told you to come 
here, you are brave.  That is her evidence, that is a fact.  
That is her [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, did Ms Mothepu say that she 
discussed the topics that Mr Koko says were never 
10 
discussed with him?  Did she say in her evidence or any 
email she discussed those topics with him?  Let us get that 
clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I will recall …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   the answer is no.  The answer is no.  Mr 
Seleka is not going you a direct answer, the answer is no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I have not – I 
have not looked at this recently, because I was prepared to 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   it is not that type of evidence.  If you 
become pedantic and you just follow paperwork, Ms 
Mothepu is going to be exposed and she needs to come 
and explain to you why she says I have changed and added 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 271 of 354 
 
items when the additions served on her to the board on the 
6 October and she refers to the November and December.  
And in any event, Chair, in any event, Ms Mothepu, 
and here is one issue that makes her argument fall.  One 
of the things that she says I added was master – vendor 
procurement, which is not part of 4.5.  Vendor procurement 
is not part of Generation, vendor procurement is not part of 
[indistinct], vendor procurement is not part of claims 
management.   
So the things that she says I have added, two of 
10 
them, Duvha insurance and master vending are not part of 
4.5.  She was blatantly lying to you.  Now you need to 
understand, 
given 
the 
documents 
here 
because 
the 
documents are telling you something different and we will 
get to other witnesses.  I mean, I received a document, an 
affidavit from witness 3, that all of a sudden she says I did 
not know Mr Koko in 2013 but I saw him and recognised 
him.  Why would somebody who does not know me, saw me 
seemingly.  The evidence before you, Chair, that you must 
go, when you sit on your own, making your report, must 
20 
just look at the documents and the evidence. 
Duvha insurance, master services, is not part of 
this 4.5.  That is the evidence before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Ms Mothepu – I 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 272 of 354 
 
will read from the affidavit, it is one of the bundles, but 
Chair, paragraph 14 – bundle 14, let me read.  It says: 
“From October 2015 my team was introduced to 
[indistinct] Matshela Koko, Prish Govender, Andre 
Pillay and Edwin Mabelane.” 
She has you actually written twice. 
“Each initiative steering team would meet regularly 
with designated Eskom representatives at Megawatt 
Park.” 
And 27: 
10 
“Matshela Koko and Anoj Singh added initiatives 
that were not provisionally on the proposal.  This 
were online vending and Duvha insurance claim and 
rebuild Hitachi insurance settlement.” 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am saying to you all the three – and I 
am glad Mr Seleka and God is with Moses, I always say so, 
I have got nothing to do with 4.5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the claims management, there the 
package is. 
MR KOKO:   The claims management is Medupi and Kusile, 
20 
it is building – it is the issue that is on the headline of 
Maake.  They now raise it is Maake saying - before we 
finish this, before you finish your report, all your witnesses 
that are star witnesses will be behind bars soon, but 
anyway.  The claim management is Group Capital, it is 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 273 of 354 
 
Maake, it is all the claims in Medupi and Kusile, it is purely 
Kusile and Medupi and Ingula(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So are you saying to the Chairperson 
what Ms Mosilo is saying here as initiatives added, online 
vending, Duvha insurance, rebuild Hitachi, were they in the 
proposal or were they not in the proposal? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am saying to you what is in the 
proposal is here.  What is in the proposal I signed off on it 
on the 6 August 2015.  It served on the board on the 21 
October 2015.  There is no vendor management here, there 
10 
is no Duvha systems here.  There is no rebuilding of Duvha 
boilers here.  It is things that are added, are tabulated, 
Chair, you will find them, they are here, they are detailed 
and they are not added by me, they are added by 
negotiating team that negotiated them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so the answer is, no they are not 
in the proposal. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They would not have been part of the 
MSA. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, can we go to bundle 
16(b) just to finish off on this point? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Can I take this away? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 274 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just keep it there.  16(b), this is Mr 
Anoj’s bundle.  Did I say 16(b)?  Ja, so Mr Singh has 
provided a supplementary affidavit to the Commission.  The 
affidavit starts on page 1016 but I want – I would like you 
to go to page 1018, paragraph 11 with the heading: 
“Top consultants programme steering committee 
meeting.” 
MR KOKO:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the Chairperson there?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph 11 
reads: 
“The first Top Consultants Programme Steering 
Committee meeting was held on 9 February 2016.  I 
attach hereto the PowerPoint presentation as AS5 
which was presented on the day setting out inter 
alia: 
4. An overview of the MSA. 
5. Steering committee terms of reference. 
6. Role and responsibility of steering committee. 
20 
1 of 2 and 2 of 2 and then 11.4: 
“Programme steering and leadership.” 
Turn the page: 
6. The contract currently includes work packages. 
6: Work packages initiative proposal and Steerco  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 275 of 354 
 
    approvals.” 
Now we go to AS5 which is from page 1108 of Eskom 
bundle 16.  So that is the presentation he has provided to 
the Commission which he said was made through the 
Steerco on the 9 February 2016.  On the first page, Chair, 
you see: 
“Steering committee meeting agenda.” 
You have: 
3. Opening 
and 
welcome 
by 
the 
Chairman, 
safety 
briefing introductions and apologies. 
10 
4. Overall description of the mechanics of the contract.” 
And there is valid points there: 
“High level MSA overview, description of the work 
packages, approval by steering committee.” 
And it goes on 3, to deal with the packages.  The next 
page you see members of Steerco.  Mr Anoj Singh, their 
passport photos are there.  Mr Anoj Singh is there, the 
Group CFO, Mr Matshela Koko, Generation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the Matshela Koko who appears in 
that picture does not look very much like the one in front of 
20 
me. 
MR KOKO:   It is the same person, Chair, I can confirm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let us continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The fault must be with whoever took the 
picture.  Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 276 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the rest of the Eskom team is 
there.  Well, ja, those who constituted Steerco and then 
you have other members from McKinsey and Trillian.  Ms 
Mothepu is also there.  Then the agenda is repeated.  You 
turn the page, Chairperson: 
“MSA 
overview, 
three 
year 
contract, 
100% 
performance-based.” 
And, Mr Koko, when I read the three year contract this may 
– you may or may not be able to comment, it reminds me 
what Ms Goodson’s evidence in her affidavit that she was 
10 
told when she joined Trillian in – I think when she joined, 
in November or December 2015, the activity started there 
in 2016 that the operations of Trillian are for this 
dispensation and the dispensation she was told about was 
a three year period.  I thought what a coincidence with this 
contract being for three years. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have no personal knowledge of the 
discussions Ms Mothepu had with other people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Then on the next page, Chair, you 
have the block talking of: 
20 
“Role and responsibilities of steering committee” 
And they give you the roles and responsibilities.   
1 of 2 and again 2 of 2.  Turn the page, Chair to 
1112: 
“Programme steering leadership” 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 277 of 354 
 
Then you have the steering committee members’ names set 
out and then under that you have the various packages or 
initiatives to which the work will relate.   
So one is procurement with Mr Edwin Mabelane, as 
the first name. 
Two 
is 
Primary 
Energy, 
the 
first 
name 
Luis 
Mboweni. 
Three is Generation and the first name there is Mr 
Matshela Koko. 
Claims is Abram Masango, finance is Anoj Singh. 
10 
Mr Koko, so those are the various packages within the 
MSA. 
MR KOKO:   Yes and, Mr Chair, I do not want to get 
emotional and get upset, this – where is – if you take this 
as a basis, and really it upsets me now, if you take this as 
a basis of what was presented on the 9 February – and I 
have a very vague memory of it, it lists the packages.  So 
if you say Master Services you will see that it cannot fit in 
where my name is.  It cannot.  And if any witness come and 
say Mr Koko caused a change or added a topic and that 
20 
topic is vendor management or insurance, then you come 
here, but it does not fit here.  It actually fits in finance 
which is what I have always been saying and you will see – 
look at Ms Mothepu’s name.  Look at it, Chair, it is under 
number 5, it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Do see that?  My name is not 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 278 of 354 
 
there.  So she could not have negotiated with me on issues 
that under number 5.  She is not on number 3 which is 
where I would be.   
Any package that you add under Generation will 
have to be authorised by me.  Any package that gets done 
under finance, where she is, will have to be financed by 
others and, Chair, once again, once again, I am begging 
you to just follow the evidence.  I have told you that I had 
a very soft spot for her, I liked her, I like how she carried 
herself, she had difficulty talking to people in Eskom and I 
10 
would assist her.  If she want to talk to people in Treasury 
I would pick up the phone and say talk to this young lady.  
If she want to talk to people in insurance, I would assist 
her.  That is the – I actually tried to play a mentoring role 
to her but the record speaks for itself, Chair, just focus on 
the records, forget the gossip.  Do not be like Ms Thuli 
Madonsela who took the gossip.  The documents are here, 
let us stay with the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chairman, may I …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I apologise, Sir, but I am very emotional 
because I have been through this hundred times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Barry? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   The updated version of the bundle 16 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 279 of 354 
 
has not been sent to us, so we do not have these 
documents.  I did not want to interrupt but they can even 
be sent to us electronically or emailed to use right now, 
that is fine, but our bundle stops at page 792 and that was 
at the end of March, so we were not given access to the 
updated bundle.  It can just be sent to us even as we sit 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I do not believe that is correct 
because I have asked for this bundle after it was updated 
10 
to be sent to Mr Ndou.  He is nodding his head.  Yes 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is nodding? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I was copied in the email that 
went to him, witnessed his statement. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, which Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
MR KOKO:   I think Mr Seleka is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I remember seeing these document from Mr 
20 
Ndou. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I think, I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe they were not passed on to 
Mr Barrie.  Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 280 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   I think so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, so maybe that is what 
happened. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Ndou is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Witness 3 …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Prof Lourens, I have seen the document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja and Prof Lourens because they 
asked for it. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Ndou sent them to me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Koko, the Chair will look at the 
emails from Ms Mothepu because Ms Mothepu testifies 
about the emails that she sent to you.  I do not think they 
can be called gossip.  The emails say: 
“Thank you for meeting with me.” 
And go on to say this is what is being – needs to be 
discussed and then, in some of them, arranges that we 
should have a meeting. 
MR KOKO:   And there is no confirmation those meetings 
20 
took place, to discuss those specific topics, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but wait, that is not the point.  
MR KOKO:   What is the point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I am saying to you is this.  The 
Chairperson will look at the emails which is not gossip, it 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 281 of 354 
 
is emails that has been sent one, to you – I mean, one, to 
your PA that copied you and the others are sent directly to 
you and she is thanking you for having met with you and 
she also arranges to have a meeting.  And she testifies to 
the extent of those emails, nothing more, nothing less. 
MR KOKO:   The Chairman will also look at the transcript 
that Ms Mothepu says I gave her an Indian man to work 
with on these topics and this Indian man turns to be my 
professional assistant who is a black lady.  So the 
Chairman must also take into account that she lied to you.  
10 
And, Chair, you must also take into account that I 
responded to none of those emails.  I could not respond to 
any of them because they are not in my scope. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, what I wanted to 
try and remember… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is whether, Mr Koko, you accepted that 
you received those emails but did not respond or whether 
you disputed that they were sent to you. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I cannot even remember receiving 
20 
those emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I cannot remember receiving those emails and 
even if I received them I would not have acted on them 
because they were outside my competency. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 282 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, except that if she says she met 
with you when you know – when you knew you did not meet 
with her you could respond and say what are you talking 
about, I never met with you. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is what I am saying to you, I have 
said it categorically that I have never met Ms Mothepu to 
discuss the issues that are on those emails.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have never, I could not.  The best I could do 
is to refer her to the people that are dealing with those 
10 
topics. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the point that I am putting to you is 
that if you knew that you did not meet with her and you 
receive an email from her saying that she met with you and 
discussed those topics with you that would be all the more 
reason why, if you did receive such an email from her, it 
would be necessary to write back and say what are you 
talking about?  I never met with you. 
MR KOKO:   No, let me tell you a story and let me tell you 
the fact. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   By the 23 r d – all those emails, without fail, are 
after the 23 October when I was out of that official office.   
New person was in that office to deal with whatever comes 
in that office.  When you are Deputy Chief Justice and you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 283 of 354 
 
get promoted, the new Deputy Chief Justice comes in to 
deal with whatever comes into there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, except, of course, that if there 
are matters that are raised that happened while I was there 
and he or she was to verify whether that is actually the 
position, that person can ask me or refer and say I want to 
respond this but it happened during your time, what is the 
position?  And then I can say I never had a meeting with 
that person.  That part you understand? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, nobody came to me to say have you 
10 
had a discussion with Ms Mothepu?  I do not remember 
getting her emails.  I have never responded to her emails.  
The bulk part of my interactions with her was to help her to 
meet people in Eskom, to introduce her to people, to drink 
coffee with her and other people that were assisting, but I 
would never deal with insurance, for example.  That 
insurance claim is finance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   The Group Executive Generation has no 
competency 
in 
insurance. 
 The 
Group 
Executive 
for 
20 
Generation has no competency in Master Vending.  He may 
know something to do, but it is not his competency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is the position not that even though 
you may have moved out of one position or department to 
another you still use the same email address and therefore 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 284 of 354 
 
the emails would still have come to you if they were sent to 
you? 
MR KOKO:   Oh, Chair, I have come to accept – I have 
come to appreciate why people continued to send me 
emails on the issues that I have dealt with in my previous 
position as a Group Executive Commercial.  I now have 
come to peace with that because I had signed the contract, 
I had signed the contract.  I had signed the corporate plan 
contract.  So people for whatever reason may have not 
been – may have not accepted that I am out of the role that 
10 
enabled me to sign those contracts and they probably 
thought that I have an influence when I was out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair and I did not want to go into this 
matter but it is important to see what Ms Mothepu writes in 
the email because it is not about I am pursuing the matter 
with Mr Koko when he has already left his office or his 
position as – whichever position it was.  A person who 
writes – and these emails, we read them, you know, 
previously.  But here is the one of 30 November 2015.  She 
20 
says: 
“Good day, Matshela, I hope this email finds you 
well and it was a pleasure meeting you last week.  I 
had a chat with Eric Wood regarding additional 
financial initiatives that need to be included as part 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 285 of 354 
 
our balance sheet optimization and cash unlocking.” 
But that first line that I had pleasure meeting you last week 
is what we are talking about. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair, I have …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is not gossip. 
MR KOKO:   I have never denied meeting Ms Mothepu.  
But if Mr Seleka reads that I have met her to discuss the 
financial issues that she refers to later is wrong.  I have 
met Ms Mothepu.  I have enjoyed interacting with her but 
to say you have met her to discuss the issues that she 
10 
raised later, Mr Seleka is wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not me, there is nothing wrong or 
right about …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well, yes, if the emails say that is 
what you met to discuss on a particular occasion it would 
be the author of the emails. 
MR KOKO:   No but read it again, Mr Seleka, read that 
email again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let me read the other one, 5 
20 
December 2015. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it reads: 
“Hi Matshela …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Do you want him to read the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 286 of 354 
 
previous one? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you want to listen to it 
properly? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Read it, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read it.  I say: 
“I hope this email finds you well and it was a 
pleasure meeting you last week.  I had a chat with 
Eric Wood regarding additional financial initiatives 
10 
that need to be included as part our balance sheet 
optimization and cash unlocking financial initiatives 
stream.  These include the sale and lease-back on 
the optic fibre network, prepaid electricity vending, 
EFC 
disposal, 
Hitachi 
claims, 
replacement 
of 
boilers 
and 
Duvha 
insurance 
claim. 
 
We 
are 
currently compiling a business case for these 
initiatives and require some information from you 
and your team.  We would like to set up time early 
this week with yourself and your team to source the 
20 
information in order to complete the business case 
by the end of the week.” 
MR KOKO:   Where in that letter does it say she discussed 
those things with me?  Where in that email does it she 
discussed those things with me? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 287 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka, I think he wanted to 
refer, as I understand it, to refer to the fact that she says 
she met with you.  
MR KOKO:   She met …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think he wants to go to another 
one, I do not know whether that is the one. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, but Chair, there is nowhere in that 
email where Ms Mothepu says she discussed those issues 
with me.  She says she met me last week, she discussed 
these issues with others.  She did not discuss with me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So let that be very clear.  She met with me, 
she discussed these issues with others, not with me 
because she could not have discussed them with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair.  Mr Eric Wood or Dr Eric 
Wood, we know is at Trillian, he is Ms Mosilo’s boss.  She 
has gone back after meeting with you to discuss the 
additional financial initiatives that need to be included and 
she is saying to you we need more information and they 
20 
would like time early this week to set up – time early this 
week with yourself and your team to source the information 
in order to complete the business cases by the end of the 
week. 
MR KOKO:   Excellent and elsewhere – elsewhere, even on 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 288 of 354 
 
Twitter, in her book, she has written a book, she said Mr 
Koko never gave me audience. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Never what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Never gave me? 
MR KOKO:   Audience on these topics.  She said Mr Wood 
had to phone her when she was on her sickbed to say go 
and wait on Mr Koko’s door and when Mr Koko and found 
me on the door, Mr Koko told me who told you to come 
here, you are brave.  That is her evidence, that is a fact.  
That is her version Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, did Ms Mothepu say that she 
discussed the topics that Mr Koko says were never 
discussed with him?  Did she say in her evidence or any 
email she discussed those topics with him?  Let us get that 
clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I will recall …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   the answer is no.  The answer is no.  Mr 
Seleka is not going you a direct answer, the answer is no. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I have not – I 
have not looked at this recently because I was prepared to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 289 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I wouldn’t hold his hand, I would 
hold his hand ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine, because I am trying to 
make sure we don’t spend too much time on something that 
might not be an issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   The answer is no Chair, and I know 
...[indistinct] the answer is no.  In fact she said to me, her 
own writing that Mr Koko refused to ...[indistinct] to 
discuss this thing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And when I forced myself on him and waited 
Mr Koko told me you are brave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m okay.   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I will read this other one Chair 
which is on the 5 t h of December 2015 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but if it doesn’t say what is in issue 
why do you read it, because as I understand it, one, Mr 
Koko doesn’t deny that he had interactions with Ms 
Matshepo and that they even met. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All he is saying the two of them never 
discussed this specific, those particular issues, so if 
whatever email doesn’t say they discussed those issues, I 
am not sure whether you need to read it. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 290 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair there’s no such an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  
MR KOKO:   I can tell you now there is no such an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay, my junior has opened up to 
something, this email suggests, can I read it into the 
record Chair, that’s all ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me first what it says before 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says, it attaches a financial – what 
10 
is this, attached please find the financial stream initiative 
for your review and comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is addressed to Mr Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is addressed to Mr Koko Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay tell us where to find it and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and she says “I am available on 
my mobile phone ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where do you find it first?  What 
bundle? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   SM Bundle 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [c] on page 811.256. 
MR KOKO:   Bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   14[c]. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 291 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   811? 
CHAIRPERSON:   811.256 
ADV SELEKA SC:   .256. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it is an email from Masilo Matshepo 
to Mr Kokomm@eskom.co.za Mr Eric Wood is copied, the 
subject is Eskom initiatives, the email was 5 December 
2015, ten past nine in the morning: 
“Hi Matshela  
Attached please find the financial stream initiatives 
for your review and comment.  I am available on my 
10 
mobile phone should you wish to contact me and 
can come to the office should you wish to discuss.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, of course it doesn’t say there 
discussed, but it clearly is an email that from her side she 
contemplates could be a subject of a discussion if Mr Koko 
wished that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   Pause there Chair, just pause 
there Mr Koko, the transcript which my junior has just 
opened, her evidence on the 14 t h of January 2021 on page 
20 
185 you – the Chairperson is asking she is talking about 
these emails and the next page, on the next page and the 
Chairperson when you say on the next page you mean 
588.150, she says yes.   So the previous email I sent at 
nine minutes past eight I had time to go to meet with Mr 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 292 of 354 
 
Matshela Koko.  He had made up the itinerary views and so 
I sent him the updated proposal at the same day, the 7 t h of 
December this time a 12:33, so it reads, and then she 
reads, 7 December.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is a different email? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
That’s 
another 
yes, 
it 
will 
be 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It must be different because this one is 
five to seven. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but do we know whether that one of 
the 5 t h talks about discussing, that they discussed those 
topics? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one of the 5 t h? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the 7 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the 7 t h, okay, Chair let me read 
what she says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She says ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   We read the email. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think they  might not have that intent, 
this is where – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because we were taking it with 
chronology of the email.    
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 293 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says yes so the previous email I 
sent at nine minutes past, so let’s check, we can check the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s not the one of the 5 t h of 
December because that’s ten past nine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It’s ten past nine.  And then she says I 
had time to go to meet with Mr Matshela Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He had made updates and reviews. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   He had made? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He had made updates and reviews. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so I sent him the updated proposal 
at the same day, the  7 t h of December, this time at 12:33, 
so it seems to me there are two emails on the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is the one I was asking about ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And is it not convenient that they update it 
later, not before you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are here to, they attach even in 
the email of the 5 t h Abbie, yes there are annexures 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Is it ...[indistinct]? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 294 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I don’t know who ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Maybe it should show ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that’s – but Mr Koko we talk 
about ones that he is alleged to have made. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, have you got the 7 t h December 
one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me go there Chair.  But then Chair 
in that evidence or oral testimony there is Mr Koko who is 
saying I am not giving you a direct answer, you ask 
10 
whether did they  meet to discuss this, there’s the answer. 
MR KOKO:   No Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He said no, Ms Matshepo – I don’t 
have to speak for her, because I couldn’t remember what 
she said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s look at the – in the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...page 811.278. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   278? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   278.  And it is eight minutes past nine 
that email.  Again to Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Monday 7 December 2015 at 809, she 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 295 of 354 
 
said 
emailing 
from 
Matshepo@regiments, 
kokomm@eskom.co.za 
updates 
proposal, 
Eskom 
cash 
unlocking and balance sheet optimisation initiative 7 
December. 
“Good morning Matshela  
Attached please find the update proposal for your 
consideration.  
Kind regards,” 
And then the document follows Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that of course is an update from 
10 
Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not one made by Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No Chair, well ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair you will not find that any update 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on don’t speak at the same time.   
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, yes, this is from one side Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, from Ms Matshepo’s side? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 296 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   Chair in my language, I don’t if Mr Seleka 
speaks the same language, but in my language we talk 
about [speaking in vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Which don’t stink, I am telling you again 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What does it mean? 
MR KOKO:   I am going to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t translate it. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I am going to have to difficulty if I translate it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
[laughing] 
but 
the 
actual 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   What I am saying to you is Chair, and I am 
saying it again, there is no email where Ms Matshepo says 
it is discussed with me, there will be no email where I have 
made updates on any document that Ms Matshepo has put 
to you.   Let me read to you what Ms Matshepo says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No before that, here is an email that 
maybe ...[indistinct] to what Mr Seleka seems to be looking 
20 
for, same bundle, page 811.303, it is an email from Ms 
Matshepo to you Mr Koko, subject is updated proposal an 
there are attachments and she says: 
“Dear Matshela, 
Attached please find the updated financial proposal 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 297 of 354 
 
document for this afternoon’s meeting at 14h00.” 
Now I don’t know whether that’s a meeting between the two 
of you she is talking about or another meeting? 
MR KOKO:  Excellent, when you probed that did this 
meeting happen she said no.  She didn’t say she met me at 
...[indistinct] she didn’t say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think to say the least what some of 
the 
emails 
suggest 
is 
that 
she 
wanted 
to 
discuss 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   She did, she is not doubt she did, let me give 
10 
you, let me read you what she said.   Let me read you what 
Ms Matshepo says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, reading from what? 
MR KOKO:   I am reading from her book. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MR KOKO:   No but it is very important Chair because it 
tells you her mindset. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay just read ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No, no, no Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just read it. 
20 
MR KOKO: 
“One December morning I woke up with chronic 
sinus infections, so bad that I was coughing my 
blood, by GP booked me off on sick leave and I sent 
Eric Wood a message explaining how ill I was and 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 298 of 354 
 
that I would not be coming to the office.   He was 
having none of  it, he told me to drive to Megawatt 
Park and wait in the executive reception area to 
ensure Matshela Koko reads our MSA proposal.  I 
have previously sent ... [listen to this] ... I have 
previously sent the document to Matshela and 
unsuccessfully tried to get an appointment with him, 
so I dragged myself out of bed, showered and drove 
to Eskom where I waited Matshela’s arrival.  I 
greeted him and he told me why are you there, 
10 
young lady you are brave.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:  Now she sent, whatever she sent, she writes 
whatever she writes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you say there was no discussion 
...[intervenes] . 
MR KOKO:   There was no discussion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On the topics. 
MR KOKO:   ...of the topics. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:  And you will not find an email that says as we 
discussed or as we ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, we have finished two 
hours, let’s take a ten minutes adjournment and then 
depending on what you have Mr Seleka maybe we should 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 299 of 354 
 
make progress and move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When we come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or shall I do when we come back? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you want to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I wanted to answer your question as to 
whether the meeting did take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This one, because her evidence is here 
Chair, what Mr Koko is reading is about 1 December, we 
are now on the 7 t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then I ask him now the email – the 
email – the email Ms Matshepo on – I gave the page 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat what transcript this is on, so 
it can be checked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is – the date is again the 14 t h of 
20 
January 2021, the page is 187. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I am reading from the top of the 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 300 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC: 
“Now the email Ms Matshepo on page [and I use the 
number] dated 7 December 2015 at 12:33.” 
I think it is this one: 
“...at 12:33 to Mr Koko it alluded to a meeting in the 
afternoon at 14h00.  Did that meeting take place?” 
And Ms Matshepo answers: 
“Yes that meeting takes place, that is how it is tied 
down.” 
If you go to page 588.75, then she says you must go to 
10 
that page.  It says: 
“Remember I said Hi Matshela, and Edwin as per 
your request as in.  I say yes and during that 
meeting at two o’clock we sat with your technical 
team 
and 
provided 
– 
and 
they 
provided 
the 
...[indistinct] information if you see that after that 
two o’clock meeting we met with the team hence we 
worked, we worked through the night and up until 
almost eight thirty in the evening in the – then I 
don’t know what they typed there ...[indistinct] 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, when ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Does she say she met with me at two or she 
met with my team at two? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember when I read that email I 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 301 of 354 
 
said when she talked about the meeting at two I said I 
don’t know whether she meant a meeting with Mr Koko or 
with somebody else. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it true that from her evidence it 
appears that she met with the technical team? 
MR KOKO:   She met with the technical team, she didn’t 
meet with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes she says we met with the technical 
10 
team, let me see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s take the adjournment and 
then I think when we come back let’s try and make some 
progress. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I will go back to my plan Chair, 
thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  We will adjourn for ten 
minutes.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
20 
INQUIRY AJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair, so we can leave aside 
that before I raise the emails of Ms Matshepo. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 302 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which ones are we putting aside? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one with the emails of Ms 
Matshepo, I think it is 14[c] ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   14[c]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  [c] ja.  Mr Koko I just want to go back 
to the presentation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So we just need to do the best we can to 
make progress, tomorrow we must finish, not tomorrow 
Monday 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Monday yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   On Monday, Mr Koko is still looking for 
the right file, in fact bundle 16? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   16[b] yes.  Just one item ...[indistinct] 
Mr Koko ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   16? 
CHAIRPERSON:   16[b].  What about this one that you 
have got this side of your desk, is it not that one?  Will 
somebody help ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Registrar I do need help. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let’s go to page 11.17  So Mr Koko 
at the bottom of 11.17 the next block which is approval – IL 
to 
approval 
of 
fixed 
grants 
contracts 
Kemden, 
the 
executive sponsor there is indicated as yourself, minimise 
R/L cost of fixed priced contracts for uncontracted volumes 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 303 of 354 
 
at Kemden and your name appears in the next one so I am 
going to go through them then you can explain them to the 
Chairperson.  Fixed price contracts Grootvlei, you also 
appear there a executive sponsor, fixed price contracts 
Arnot, you also are the executive sponsor, next page 
Dutuka Kemden ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Please remind Mr Seleka what is the 
point about all of these? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is for Mr Koko to explain Chair, he is 
there as the executive sponsor in what on the face of it 
10 
seems to be issues relating to the price of the contract, 
which would suggest the financial part of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[indistinct] if he was involved in it 
and then what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If he – well Mr Koko has said to the 
Chairperson my involvement was just generation and I was 
dealing with generation, the finances were not my part 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course he was not in the finance 
department. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of course he was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would need the finance department 
for that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You need people in that department. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 304 of 354 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would you accept if he says I 
wasn’t involved in finance? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me add the last one Chair then 
we can finish, page 11.23, that block at the top, number 5, 
finance, must have vending agent as Eskom lead is 
Matshela Koko and at the end you have conclusion of the 
Duvah insurance claim and Eskom lead again is yourself 
Mr Koko.  And in particular there’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So what is the point about them? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC  Yes there is Duvah insurance, Mr Koko 
said he is not part of the Master Services Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Remember Ms Masiva said it was 
added, it wasn’t in the original, it was added by Messrs 
Singh and Mr Koko as some of the new initiatives and Mr 
Koko said it was not but here we see it in the presentation, 
one, and number two it falls under finance and Mr Koko 
features 
there, 
maybe 
you 
can 
explain 
that 
to 
the 
Chairperson and we move along.  
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair Mr Seleka has been talking about 
Kemden and other parts, they are all generation, Rand per 
ton generation, Rand per ton is the biggest contributor of 
generation ...[indistinct] cost, it is in the authority of Group 
Generation, Group Executive Generation, and it was clear 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 305 of 354 
 
cut, black and white so there is no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No issue there. 
MR KOKO:   There is on issue there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were negotiation the point of 
price there? 
MR KOKO: Where?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  In those Kemden?  
MR KOKO:   No, so the – before you got into it, it talks 
about Rand per ton, now Rand per ton is a contributor to 
kilowatt, cents per kilowatt ...[indistinct] generated so  you 
10 
start at the top, it says reduce your production costs, what 
is the biggest single item you need to reduce to meet your 
production costs it is your coal cost, and how do you that 
Chair?  It is what we call, and I deal with this elegantly, 
nicely in my main affidavit.   We talk about spatching on 
married order, so the most – the cheapest generation units 
must be available so that you dispatch them first before 
you dispatch the most expensive generation, and your rand 
per ton helps, I deal with that nicely in my main affidavit 
and I even give you a cable of how we reduce a rand per 
20 
ton of coal but increasing the EAF and dispatching the 
units on merit order.  ...[Indistinct] it is just we want 
liquidity Chair there, it is clear cut.  The ambiguity is on 
page 11.23, you see it in a finance light my name should 
not arise there because this is the CFO’s slide and I don’t 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 306 of 354 
 
remember how the discussion here unfolded or transpired, 
it would be interesting to see what the minutes says 
because all what you see in this box it is in the CFO box 
and only the CFO has the competency to deal with it, 
nobody else.    
CHAIRPERSON:   There would be no need for another 
group executive? 
MR POPO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POPO:  No the people that will be here will be the 
10 
subordinates of the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the CFO? 
MR POPO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are not one of them? 
MR POPO:  And I am not one of them, so I don’t even 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They are finance people, you are not a 
finance person. 
MR POPO:   They are, they are finance people and let me 
tell you those who normally at Eskom your ...[indistinct] 
20 
finance is at your biggest risk and I always get the right 
people to support me, no Chair I had nothing to do with 
that, I had nothing to do with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes of course that is one aspect of it 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 307 of 354 
 
Mr Koko that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka I come back to my point, 
reference to these pages is meant to prove what point, or 
is relevant to what point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson the bigger picture is this, 
the 
stakeholder 
This 
stakeholder 
which 
is 
allocating 
responsibilities to each other on the 9 t h of February 2016 
has gone ahead to do this meeting in respect of this 
contract when they know that there is no National Treasury 
approval. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Matshepo in addition to that says 
Duvah insurance was added, and there is the Duvah 
insurance claim which Mr Koko earlier said it wasn’t part of 
the Master Service Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But we see it in the presentation which 
Mr Anoj 
Singh 
has 
provided 
to 
the 
Commission 
as 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And how then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But why didn’t you go straight to the one 
at 11.23 which has got as I understand it the – that 
...[indistinct] because we have been going through almost 
page by page and if the issue is that this Duvah issue that 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 308 of 354 
 
is at 11.23. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes Chair it shows two things that 
page, well there’s a multi-faceted issues about this, 
because I was pursuing – I was pursuing one particular 
issue in regard to Mr Koko’s involvement, even in this area 
of finance which according to the presentation he was 
there, he has given you his version and then what Ms 
Masilo said was one of the aspects or initiatives added, but 
we have come to the end of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see to the extent that you were 
10 
saying this committee made certain decisions or was 
discussions certain issues knowing that there had been no 
approval from National Treasury that I understand, but that 
shouldn’t take long because the – Mr Koko doesn’t dispute 
that there was no approval from National Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but the one about the Duvah what is 
the point about it, other than according to Ms Matshepo it 
was added, was it – was ...[indistinct] why should we 
spend so much time trying to establish whether Mr Koko 
20 
was involved in any discussions concerning it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair I read the paragraph in 
Matshepo, where she said what she says, Mr Koko denies 
that, I heard that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you don’t to follow spend too 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 309 of 354 
 
much time on everything Mr Koko denies because some of 
it might not be important, so that is why I am asking what 
is the significance of this Duvah element and whether Mr 
Koko discussed it, was involved in any discussions on it, 
where does it take us? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC:  
Well 
Chair I have to test the 
correctness or otherwise of a witness either version or a 
denial of a particular aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I understand that, all I am simply 
saying is if it is nothing important we shouldn’t spend too 
10 
much time on it, let’s spend time on what you know is 
important, so that is why I am asking, I was asking why – 
what is the significance of whether or not Mr Koko was 
involved in discussions of the Duvah issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I haven’t answered the Chairperson’s 
question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I haven’t heard why it is 
significant other than putting one witness version to 
another. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, with Mr Koko Chair it is one follows 
20 
the broader picture that Mr Koko goes into certain details 
and unless one goes into these details you are going to 
leave them hanging.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but we can leave them hanging if 
they are not important, what would not be right is to leave 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 310 of 354 
 
hanging those that are important.  Those that are not 
important we can leave them hanging otherwise when we 
have four hours we can spend three hours on those that 
are not important instead of spending three hours on the 
important ones.  So I am just checking because I am not 
sure that I appreciate why you are spending so much time 
on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No Chair I am done on it, it is the 
bigger picture, but I am done with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bigger picture is the process 
engaged in the negotiation of the MSA, the team that was 
involved and how each one of them plays a role in the 
negotiation of the MSA, that was the bigger picture.   Now 
we have attempted to go into the details, of course as you 
say well you don’t need to address everything that Mr Koko 
says but I have tended to go there to show whether 
something is correct or not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No let us identify those important issues 
and then let’s spend time on those. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because we don’t have time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, correct Chair, that is correct. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 311 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
MR KOKO:   Chair I will provide you with the chapter and 
verse of the board meetings on the Master Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I did tell you as one of the discussions I had 
with the Chairman and I did tell you that they wanted to 
appoint Blue Labels as a Master Vendor by ...[indistinct] I 
have since acquired the minutes of the board meetings and 
I will provide them to you and you will see where the truth 
lies.  It is far away from where ...[indistinct] so by God’s 
10 
grace thanks to my name being Moses I have found them, 
so I will present them to you, I am going to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  Secondly the – by the time of this meeting we 
were all under the impression that there was National 
Treasury’s approval at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this would have been 2015? 
MR KOKO:  This is 2015 ...[indistinct]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No that is 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2016. 
20 
MR KOKO:   2016, the 9 t h of February, at this stage 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was before the writing was on the 
wall? 
MR KOKO:   It was before the writing was on the wall. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 312 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:  This was before the writing was on the wall. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
alright. 
 
So 
– 
yes 
let’s 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  So remember the letter or the email from 
National Treasury is dated the 4 t h of February, 4 t h of 
February 2016, that is the email that I said you look at it 
and you will make your own judgment on it, this meeting 
was on the 9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:  So I am going to say to you that on this 
meeting probably the team made a reference to that email 
communication that we have approval from Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see it is something like this Chair, I 
have the evidence to show that he signed Eskom positon 
paper in  August 2015 already. 
MR KOKO:   But how different is that? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, now Mr Seleka just 
go according to your plan.  If you were going to reach that 
issue sometime later you will deal with it when you reach 
it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We already addressed it Chair, it is 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 313 of 354 
 
going back to it. 
MR KOKO:   No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We did ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Because then we have got to address it again 
because it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, alright ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Then if we have done it then we must do it 
again, because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay this is what we must do, let’s 
10 
continue now, tomorrow when – not tomorrow – Monday 
before we start the two of you will have reflected on 
exactly that and then if there is something to be cleared it 
can be cleared when we start on Monday, okay, let’s 
continue.      
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of the way forward what you 
still need to deal with Mr Seleka just tell me what those 
matters are and then so that maybe you can tell me what 
exactly is important to be covered. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can traverse two aspects, as I was 
saying to Mr Koko during the break, his travel to Dubai and 
witness to his evidence in regard to what he says he saw 
Mr Koko at Saxonwold.  What then remains Chair is the 
issue of Tegeta which we can deal with on Monday.  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 314 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So let’s deal with 
the travel agent Mr Koko, which is in Bundle 18[d].  Chair 
so we move, we take away Eskom Bundle 14.  [d] page 
1565.7.    
MR KOKO:   15? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  65.7  
MR KOKO:   I am there Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the Chairperson there?  Thank you 
10 
Chair.   I will simply read from the affidavit.   Travel 
arrangements for Matshela Koko, paragraph 23: 
“During December 2015 I received ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well isn’t the position that Mr Koko has 
addressed these in an affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have not addressed this? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no that’s fine, if he hasn’t then 
you can read, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought if he had addressed on it then 
you could just ask the relevant questions without reading 
but if he hasn’t you can read. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 315 of 354 
 
“During December 2015 I received a request from 
Mr Essa to arrange flight tickets for a Mr Matshela 
Moses Koko.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a lighter note, I was wondering why 
Mr Koko  you didn’t respond to this on an affidavit because 
you do read a lot and  you write a lot.  
MR KOKO:   Chair you remember this came in, in our last, 
when we were here and I just didn’t have the time to do 
that, but let me tell you I have a lot to say about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I have a lot to say about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   And Chair I think we did Mr Barrie?  
CHAIRPERSON:   You did what? 
MR KOKO:   In our supplementary affidavit we dealt – we 
didn’t deal with the, yes it is right but we didn’t deal with 
this through my, but it came afterwards, but we dealt with 
the Dubai trip in our supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Chair I can assure you we deal with this in 
20 
an affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is alright.   Mr Seleka 
continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“I received a request from Mr Essa to arrange flight 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 316 of 354 
 
tickets for Mr Matshela Moses Koko and two of his 
family 
members, 
these 
being 
a 
Miss 
Mesima 
Elizabeth Koko and a Mr Peha Koko.  This was for 
their travel from Denpasar, Bali to Dubai on 4 
January 2016 and from Dubai through Johannesburg 
on 20 January 2016.  The tickets were duly issued 
as follows.” 
And the table is given of the tickets that were issued.  
Paragraph 26 on the next page: 
“These travel agents did not book any flights for Mr 
10 
Koko and his family members from South Africa to 
Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia  We were also requested 
to arrange for travel visas for Dubai for Mr Koko 
and his other two family members.  These visas 
were arranged through Trimax ...[indistinct] LLC 
which is situated in Dubai.  I emailed the three 
visas to Mr Essa on his salimessa@gmail.com.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Seleka, didn’t we deal with this, 
why do I think, have a recollection of Mr Koko dealing with 
the trips which were booked in December and he came 
20 
back in January. 
MR KOKO:   We did Chair but we did not have this affidavit 
is a consequence of the previous discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:  This ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 317 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I just don’t want us to repeat what 
we have done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes no this affidavit has not been dealt 
with in relation to Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   We had Ms Alana’s affidavit, that affidavit we 
dealt with . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. Okay. 
MR KOKO:  And I told you that Ms Alana’s affidavit is 
defective and I used – I was very polite, but I just told it is 
10 
a lie under oath and I asked you to – that she cannot get 
away with that manner, to remedy it the legal team went to 
procure this one, so this supposed to be a remedy of Ms 
Alana’s affidavit ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair let me just summarise this 
because the trip that was meant to be a return trip on the 
20 t h the ticket was changed, or the booking was changed 
and he returned on the 5 t h of January 2016. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So you know the allegations that 
Mr Essa is the one who arranged this. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that the invoice issued in Mr 
Singh’s name it was a mistake, that it had Mr Singh’s 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 318 of 354 
 
name, it should have been – well I don’t know whether it 
should have been your name or Mr Essa but the expense 
for the trip were allocated again to Mr Essa as they say 
and then paragraph 32 Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let us start with the most important 
thing. Did this trip take place? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the dates that are applicable? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You left South Africa on the date given 
10 
and you came back to South Africa on the date given? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you went to the places that she says 
you went to? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, then you can talk about the 
other things, who paid and so on, and who made bookings, 
at least those important things are covered, the trip did 
happen and on the dates given and to the places that are 
given. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, and the payments is in paragraph 
32 on page 1565.9, she says on January 2016 I received a 
call from either Mr Essa or his secretary indicating that the 
driver would be dropping off the money to settle the invoice 
in respect of Mr Koko’s travel arrangements.  The driver 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 319 of 354 
 
dropped 
R100 000 
cash 
at 
my 
house, 
which 
I 
turn 
deposited at the bank into our bank account and indicate 
the reference as S.Essa, the reference of EFT on the 
receipt was an error.   So I think on the receipt Mr 
...[intervenes]   
MR KOKO:   Can we go to the receipt? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko you would have seen 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Can we go to the receipt? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Is it S34?  So they had ticked off 
10 
EFT, there are three options, cash, cards, EFT, paid by 
cash, cards, EFT, they ticked off EFT and the way I 
understand her she say that was a mistake.   But I think 
you need to tell the Chairperson Mr Koko ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s – and she says it was Mr Essa or 
his secretary who asked her to make the bookings, is that 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Koko just tell your side of the 
story with regards to your knowledge who made the 
20 
bookings for your travelling and who paid and so on.  Who 
was supposed to have something to do with it and who was 
not supposed to have something to do with it. 
MR KOKO:  Chair thank you. I gave you my covering 
arrangements when I was here.  First I told you that the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 320 of 354 
 
affidavit of Ms Alana Lima was a lie – was a lie in all aspects 
and it was an affidavit that was given to the Hawks in 2018 
and now I understand why nothing has come out of it 
because lies can only take you this far. 
 
So Ms Alana had alleged that they booked a trip for 
me from Johannesburg to Indonesia to Dubai and back to 
Johannesburg for the period of the 5t h to the 20t h and Mr 
Essa paid for it.  That was – that is a lie. 
 
Hundred percent of it is a lie.  So now they have 
come back and they have taken the Alana Lima’s lie and they 
10 
have parked it.  So it is no long applicable and I am glad 
they have done that they made good progress.  We are going 
to make excellent progress here today. 
 
So I have given you your team my travelling 
arrangements.  It is in the bundle I think – it is Sundown 
Travelling it is the one that has got a price of 332 if you can 
take the Chairman to the page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is it Mr Seleka? 
MR KOKO:  Oh ja, ja it is 1565.59 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point 9 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  1569 – 1565.59 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Pont 59. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got that.  The travel agent 
there is Thompsons is that right? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 321 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  Correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I found it. 
MR KOKO:  Right.  And that is a booking for my wife and I 
and five of my kids. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many kids? 
MR KOKO:  Five kids. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  From Johannesburg to Indonesia on the 23r d of 
December 2015 and back on the 5t h of January 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on I am still at Point 59. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not see the destination. 
MR KOKO:  Chair if you go to the pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is it in the next page.  23 December  
MR KOKO:  In fact if you go to 1565.63 you will find the 
travelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  63. 
MR KOKO:  1565.63. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there is an email there. 
MR KOKO:  And there is – it has got the covering 
20 
arrangements for all my members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay it is addressed to you and those you 
were travelling with.  It says: 
“Thank you for allowing us to provide you 
with your 00:03:40 free travel arrangements. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 322 of 354 
 
Please confirm your flights a minimum of 72 
hours prior to departure and to check for any 
scheduled changes.” 
 
And then it says whatever it says there and then in 
terms of the departure it is 23 December 2015 from 
Johannesburg International Airport for Doha Qatar Airways 
that is at 14:00 you were to arrive in Doha at twenty past 
eleven in the night on the same day.  And then you were to 
depart the following day 24 December from Doha at 35 
minutes to 9 Qatar Airways and arrive at Nborra [?] arrive 
10 
airport on 24 December at ten past eleven in the night and 
then the next page that is 1565.64 then there provision for 
transfers there is – there I guess to your destination is that 
right?  Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay and in terms of that booking you 
were to arrive back in Johannesburg on 5 January 2016 at 
five to nine in the morning.  Yes.  And this I would take it 
coincides substantially if not exactly the same as the travel 
arrangements made by Travel Excellence or not exactly? 
20 
MR KOKO:  No, no, no.  These are the travel… 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is Thompsons that I know. 
MR KOKO:  This is Thompsons Travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  This has nothing to do with Travel Excellence.  I 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 323 of 354 
 
do not know Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no remember I asked you when we 
were still on the affidavit of the travel of Ms Alana 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Alana yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja when we were dealing with the affidavit 
I asked you whether.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or Sulliman sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sulliman ja. 
MR KOKO:  No, no it is Sulliman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I asked you – hang on.  I asked you 
10 
whether you took the trip on the dates given by her to the 
destinations given by her and you said yes.  So we must – if 
that is correct in regard to her it must be correct in regard to 
this.  That is what I am talking about. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  Yes Chair I was – when you say her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I was answering the question of Ms Sulliman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no no – ja. 
MR KOKO:  Ms Sulliman affidavit is false in all aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:  So we  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no we are talking about Sulliman ja. 
MR KOKO:  Ms Sulliman aff… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
those 
– 
this 
information 
from 
Thompsons what I am saying is in accordance with what you 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 324 of 354 
 
agreed to. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When I was. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we were talking about Suleiman’s 
affidavit. 
MR KOKO:  Yes and the bookings were not done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  By Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no this one is Thompsons. 
10 
MR KOKO:  This is Thompsons and it is done by my family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  And while we are on that paid for by my family 
and Chair I now have a confirmation from Thompsons on the 
payment and the date the payment was received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And we have given it to you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that separate – is that separate from the 
bundle? 
MR KOKO:  Yes it is separate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  New 
MR KOKO:  Chair we have prepared a very nice bundle for 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And we have sent it to the team unfortunately Mr 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 325 of 354 
 
Seleka was busy the whole so he did not have access to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  But we have got a – in line to your guidance last 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay that is fine yes. 
MR KOKO:  We have done it in addition – it is a nice pack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  00:07:59 referenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is good ja. 
MR KOKO:  So the documents you will see here are not 
10 
marked but they put in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they will be marked in due course. 
MR KOKO:  You have got the same documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  That are properly marked in that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But I can – I can – they can be given 
to me to see for now and then … 
MR KOKO:  You have to see them Chair otherwise we are 
not – we will not make progress if you do not see them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:  I told you that we are going to work from the 
documents today and we are going to take away the gossip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We – I see the first document and 
these documents will be in a bundle that will handed – and 
handed up at some other time.  The first document in front of 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 326 of 354 
 
me is from Kgomotso Koko sent to Desdifano Vanessa 
subject invoice and proof of payment request.  It says: 
“Hi Vanessa thank you, thank you greatly 
appreciated.” 
Oh it is dated 3 March 2021 at ten past one in the afternoon. 
“Thank you, thank you greatly appreciated so 
there is no way to find the actual deposits ? 
are you able to see the branch it was made 
from at least …” 
MR KOKO:  You have to read the emails from the bottom. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I forgot that.  I should start with the 
one at the bottom.  So that one is from Vanessa to Kgomotso 
and it says – it is dated 3 March 2021 at five past one.  It is 
to – it is from Destifano Vanessa to Kgomotso Koko and the 
subject is Invoice and proof of payment request. 
“Hi Kgomotso I can find history of two 
deposits to 
us from 
FNB 17 November 
R113 000.00, 
25 
November 
R270 800.00 
hope this helps you.  Regards Vanessa.” 
And then Kgomotso responds on the same day a few minutes 
20 
later I think. 
“Hi Vanessa thank you, thank you greatly 
appreciate it so there is no way to find the 
actual deposits – are you able to see the 
branch it was made from at least?” 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 327 of 354 
 
The next document starting from the bottom is from Vanessa 
Destifano to Kgomotso. 
“Can I have your contact number please as 
the below is not making any sense to me.” 
And then Kgomotso to Vanessa. 
“I will appreciate the call” 
And gives the number.  And then the next one is – there is 
an email from Vanessa Destifano to Kgomotso. 
“Sorry I do not what is it that you need this 
for as I am honestly concerned that we will 
10 
not be able to help you we do not keep 
information 
for 
longer 
than 
five 
years 
(mumbling) at all.” 
And then Kgomotso writes to Vanessa. 
“Hi Vanessa I am sure you have bank 
statements for November/December 2015.  
Can you kindly use my reference to check 
the payment amounts that 00:12:00 the date 
would be after the date of the deposit slip 
that I sent you as that was the first payment.”

I am not going to read all of them.  I think they can be read 
when there is a file properly but I wanted just to have an 
idea what they say.  They can be read once they – ja. 
MR KOKO:  Yes Chair but what they say is that we have 
made a booking. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 328 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And we have paid for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And they confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  My family paid for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Now – but what is also 00:12:44 before you take 
I need to make another – I need to make a very important 
point.  So you see that the confirmatory affidavit – the 
10 
confirmatory invoice was to the value of R332 255.00. The 
payment that has been confirmed that you have just read 
now 
is 
R383.800.00 
it 
is 
R51 000.00 
more 
and 
the 
R51 000.00 more was a budgetary quote that my wife 
received from Thompson to change to Dubai because she 
was determined to go to Dubai on the 24t h of November 
already.  So she paid that amount. The email that you – 
there is another email Chair and I am going to beg you and 
ask you to look at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:  It is part of the bundle I gave you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me see.  Yes Registrar. 
MR KOKO:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This no – Thank you.  Which one is it? 
MR KOKO:  It is the one from Tato. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 329 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Document number what from the top? 
MR KOKO:  It is the last one – it is the very last page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the last one. 
MR KOKO:  Very – single page – it is a single page like this.  
It is just 00:14:12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes I have got it.   
MR KOKO:  And it comes from Tato. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  To Terry.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Terry Gunther. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Kuzakona.  Tato is my daughter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And you will see 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is dated 14 December 2015.  It is sent 
by Tato at 11:47 subject is additional arrangements for Mr M 
Koko, Mr P Koko and Ms M D Koko to Terry Gunther and it 
says: 
“Hi Terry I hope this mail finds you well. The 
parties in – the party in the subject would like to 
add a trip to Dubai on the already planned trip to 
20 
Bali.  Below are the specs. 
• Depart 18 December to Dubai. 
• 00:15:98 until the depart to Bali from Doha 
on the 23 December.  Please quote as soon 
as you can so that I can revert from my 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 330 of 354 
 
side.” 
 Yes. 
MR KOKO:  So all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is 14 December. 
MR KOKO:  14 December. What is – what this tells you for 
me – we were going to Indonesia.  My family had plans to go 
to Dubai.  They planned for it. We paid for it. The difficulty 
that we had Chair is that my daughters had problem and you 
will see it is three names it is Piha, it is Masema, it is me 
which are the names that comes on the Salim Essa emails.  
10 
So there was no – we planned for it.  We paid with our 
money but we had difficulty with passports.  So we could not 
– my daughter’s – my daughter could not get passports. So I 
went to Ms Daniels because between Ms Daniels and my 
professional assistant they never battled with visas – things 
happens quickly.  I gave all the documents we have to Ms 
Daniels. I says we have booked our trip to Dubai.  We have 
paid for it.  It is paid for.  I do not need anybody – I do not 
need Salim Essa to pay for it.   There is the evidence that we  
paid for it.  I know – and – they were good in organising.  
20 
Please see if you can sort out the visas for us.  And if you 
cannot succeed then we will simply 00:16:49 we will not go – 
we will just go to Indonesia and back from Indonesia but we 
will not do the Dubai trip.  We left South Africa without visas 
confirmed.  They were confirmed when I was in – when I was 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 331 of 354 
 
in Indonesia.  They came to me and that is what we 
discussed earlier in – infoportal email address and that is 
when I also said when I came back I said to her how did I get 
this?  She says it was for convenience.  I had no clue who 
she used to get the visas for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The visas. 
MR KOKO:  I had no clue at all.  But secondly I did not 
expect to pay because the evidence I have showed you we 
have paid for it.  But I never got any refund that somebody 
ever paid for us.  That is how far I can take the story. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  But Chair but here is a 00:17:51 for you.  When I 
received the affidavit of Alana and we – you joked about it 
and say R100 000.00 I said to you nobody pays R100 000.00 
for you and you do not know about it.  Nobody.  It is not my 
culture.  No – nobody will pay R100 000.00 for me and I do 
not know anything about it.  Chair I am going to give you a 
communication between my attorneys and the attorneys on 
record of Mr Salim Essa.  I know them because we are in a 
case together in the SIU and this is where I said the people 
20 
who come to you to lie under oath cannot get away with it 
because they – they make it impossible for you to get to the 
truth.  So I am going to give them to you Chair and you will 
then understand what I – what I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that still under the trip? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 332 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  It is under the trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  It is – it deals with the payment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  It deals with who paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I see you have stopped sanitising 
documents.  We – I  the Minister of Health says we are 
entering the third wave.  Chair Ms Suleiman says she was 
called on the 20 t h by either Mr Essa or the secretary that 
10 
somebody will dropping the cash on the 20t h and she – and 
somebody dropped the cash in the house. That somebody is 
a person by the name of – I will tell you – Shaheed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  That person his name is Shaheed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shaheed. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Now if you go to the last page of the document 
from Shannon Little it is an email communication between Ms 
20 
Sulliman and Salim Essa.  Again you read it from the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there is a letter Shannon Little 
Attorneys.  There is the letters two pages and then there is – 
do you want me to go to the last page? 
MR KOKO:  Yes it is the email. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 333 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the last page is Travel Excellence – 
just tell me –  
MR KOKO:  It is an email conversation, 
“just thanking you at all times 
Sameera Suleiman.” 
It is Sameera Suleiman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but it must – ja it could be on the 
previous page is it not. 
MR KOKO:  Yes second previous page yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell me. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Ja you read from the bottom up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell me about it.  Only the relevant 
parts. 
MR KOKO:  It is an email from Salim Essa on the – no, no.  
It starts from the bottom.  So the bottom – it is an email from 
Sameera Excellence – Travel Excellence on the 18t h of 
January 2016 at 20 past – 18 minutes past 9. 
“Salam Saliem please see your bookings 
below.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You are – okay I see where 
20 
you are.  Ja that is from  
MR KOKO:  Sameera 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sameera Sulliman. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is writing to  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 334 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Salim Essa. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she says: 
“Please see your booking below.” 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  She says: 
“Salim Saliem see your bookings below.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And she gives the bookings of Mr Essa and this 
tells – these are the bookings of Mr Essa and Mr Essa’s kid 
10 
and the wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And Salim – and the next email is from Salim 
Essa – salimessa@gmail.com the affidavit of Ms Sulliman 
says that is the email that she communicated with Salim 
Essa on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It is 8 – it is Monday 18 January 2016 twenty 
past eleven from Sameera Sulliman.   
“RE 
please 
see 
below 
Mr 
Salim 
Essa 
20 
responding to Ms 00:23:49 and he says 
perfect.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  The next email comes from Salim Essa – from a 
Blackberry Ms Salim is Ms Sameera Sulliman sends an email 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 335 of 354 
 
to Salim Essa at 21 past 9 Sameera she says: 
“Can I issue your ticket?” 
And then the next email comes from Salim Essa at January 
18 22 minutes past 11 Salim Essa says: 
“Yes please sending 100K with Shahied to 
cover this and the 11t h and levelling – and 
leave me with some credit.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And this is the R100 000.00 that Ms Sulliman 
received in his house. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  That was brought by Shahied that she says it is 
mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And she has kept these emails communications 
from you.  So – so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Ms Salim – Mr Salim – and we received these 
emails – this communications from lawyers of records of 
Salim Essa on the 24 t h – on the 24t h of March. At that point 
20 
we only had the affidavit of Ms Alana.  We only received the 
email of Ms Sulliman on the 25 t h.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you say you got them through your 
interaction with Mr Salim Essa’s lawyers. 
MR KOKO:  Attorneys. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 336 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the SIU. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Investigation. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wish that Mr Salim Essa could make 
himself available to the commission. 
MR KOKO:  I wish so too because he can – he can break all 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Because 
his 
lawyers 
wrote 
to 
the 
commission and said he was complaining that he was being 
10 
defamed in the commission and the commission wrote to 
them and said where is he?  Could you give us – can you 
give us an undertaking that if we allocate a date for him to 
come and appear before the commission he will come?  And 
I am told there has been no answer to this. 
MR KOKO:  Chair it is my wish that he comes here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  He will – he will – this commission needs him 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we want him – we want him to come and 
20 
explain things and you know all kinds of things have been 
said about him he could explain to the nation what 
happened. 
MR KOKO:  Ja I do not have contact him Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 337 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  I actually went into the SIU documents search 
for the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Contract attorneys. 
MR KOKO:  And hence give it here.  But Chair the point is – 
the point I am making to you is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that – that I guess we will get – we 
have got to  
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will keep them there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know I need to – okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  The point I am making Chair is this is relevant to 
10 
who paid for Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Mr Salim Essa says I brought the R100 000.00.  
I know the R100 000.00 you are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  It was brought by Shahied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Here is the email communications then that tells 
you what this R100 000.00 is for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was for ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:  It was not for Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  But Chair if you go to – if you go to page 
1565.58.  If you are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 338 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  Bundle 18 1565.58. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is point 58. 
MR KOKO:  Yes Point 58. 
CHAIRPERSON:  58 
MR KOKO:  Yes. And you will realise Chair I do not buy the 
story of mistakes you know.  I have come to the point where 
people are allowed – everybody else is allowed when he lies 
to represent a mistake – well I do not – when it is Mr Koko it 
impacts on his credibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes right. 
10 
MR KOKO:  So  
CHAIRPERSON:  Right I am there. 
MR KOKO:  So – so Ms Sulliman says: 
“I have received the money in my house.” 
Who received the money in – that is a receipt.  Who received 
the money there?  Whose name is there?  You can see it at 
the bottom right.  Received by: 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also the – the date when that is 
received is 20 January 2016 it seems to me not 18.  But that 
is a receipt at the office and did she not say the cash was 
20 
delivered to her house? 
MR KOKO:  The cash was – just – in the house and she took 
it to the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was – and the receipt – did she say 
she took it to the bank or to the office? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 339 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:  No she took it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka what is your recollection? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She said: 
“I in turn deposited at the bank into our bank 
account.” 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay.   
“And indicated the reference as SE Essa” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR KOKO:  Either this is fraudulent or she is lying.  This 
10 
cannot both be correct.  Either she – in fact Chair we will get 
into the detail.  This is either fraud or she is lying.  But Chair 
there is another important part. Me and my counsel spent 
nights looking at the receipt number.  That receipt number 50 
or 595TE what do you read there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  505. 
MR KOKO:  If you – we have asked for original of this.  It 
reads - if you look at closely within this 595. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And you can start with, like, if 595 is 1040. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Is 1040. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And that is why we have asked for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 340 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   But in any event.  Ms Halima who lied to you 
in an affidavit before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Who lied to the Hawks before.  The Hawks 
said in Section 205 notice and says: We need the person 
who interacted with Mr Essa to write an affidavit which 
number is point(?) four.  She wrote it.  She did not refer 
them to Salim – to Ms Suliman.  But this document, Chair, 
you should not take it lightly.  I am asking you.  I am 
begging you.  Because it is simply fraud.  These people are 
10 
misleading you from getting to the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what is – what needs to be looked 
at is that we have travel agents – agencies, Thompsons 
and Travel Excellence. 
MR KOKO:   I think I know what happened there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I think I know what happened there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They both seem to claim to have made 
bookings.  I know that there was – there is a portion of the 
– one of the affidavits from travel agents which seemed to 
20 
say there is a part of a lack of the trip that they did not 
make bookings for but they say they made bookings for the 
others.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the same affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So we have got two travel agents.  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 341 of 354 
 
So the first thing is to see whether there is actual conflict 
in terms of the versions and it on the face of it, it does 
appear to be so.  But the one thing, Mr Koko, that would be 
very interesting is to the extent that you had never used 
Travel Excellence.  You had never interacted with either 
Ms Alana or Ms Suliman.   
 
There is the question of how they would have 
come to know about your trip and when and what time you 
would leave for what destination and come back in what 
flight if, one, the position, as you put it, as I understand it 
10 
that you had never had anything to do with them.  And two, 
if nobody had told them about those details, they say or 
one of them says Mr Salim Essa told them about it or his 
secretary.  What do you say about that? Are you able to 
say anything? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I have gone through this evidence and this is 
where tried and really tried to help you.  It is a fact that my 
travel arrangements or my changing(?) arrangements from 
20 
Indonesia to Dubai was done by Travel Excellence.  The 
documents say so.  I am not a type of guy who... a 
document, unlike many.  The documents, if you look – the 
flight number that is there, is the flight number that I used.  
So I have no doubt ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 342 of 354 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That part you accept, that they did that? 
MR KOKO:   I have no doubt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Look, Chair, when – and this is what I keep on 
asking you.  When documents speaks for itself.  You really 
look stupid to...  I mean, I have seen many people... look 
stupid because the every – the document say so when you 
try ...[intervenes] [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...take people for a ride.  The document say 
10 
so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   So.  And that is not a debate.  You have got 
limited time and I do not want to spend time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So that is... [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   From Indonesia to Dubai was done by Travel 
Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
20 
MR KOKO:   They lied before and I do not know why they 
lied that they booked my... plan.  [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   Because they were lying.  They did not think 
that I would have the documents.  I will find the documents 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 343 of 354 
 
to show that they were lying but...  [Speaker unclear]  But 
now they have... [Speaker unclear]  Now when I – when my 
daughter battled with a visa and I asked Ms Daniels.  My 
proposition is simple.   
 
And that is why I spend a lot of time, trying to 
show you the proximity between Suzanne and Mr Essa.  
That is why I – I even now I have printed emails to show 
you that these people know each other.  Ms Daniels in his 
– 
in 
her 
disciplinary 
hearing 
says 
he 
has 
been 
communicating with Mr Essa since March – since April 
10 
2015.   
 
You got – again, if you do not have it.  I only – 
your legal team, I will go and show it to you.  They know 
each other, these people.  It is no coincidence that Ms 
Essa offered him – offered her R 800 million bribe.  It is no 
coincidence that you would wake up on a Saturday morning 
and go to meet people in Dubai with pyjamas, wearing 
pyjamas.  They know each other   
 
I think, instead of her going to where I sent her 
because I gave her the documents – I gave(?) her where to 
20 
go.  She went to her friends.  She went to her friends.  
Now you keep on saying to me.  Why is Salim following 
you?  Salim is not following me.  Ms Daniels went to her 
friends.   
 
I had no reason, Chair, to get anybody paying for 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 344 of 354 
 
me.  I have given you confirmation that I will pay 
R 383 000,00.  I have given you documents to show you 
that as early as December 2014, we have – my family 
planned go via Dubai.  We just could not – had a problem 
with the visas which Ms Daniels sorted for us.  I do not 
know he(sic) sorted of us.  But clearly, clearly he(sic) 
solved it brought his(sic) friends in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So.  But you say from you side you had 
instructed her to deal with Thompsons? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And I gave her the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I gave her man to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had she dealt with Thompsons at your 
instance in regard to anything before or she had not? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I – Suzanne used to – Suzanne 
introduced herself in Parliament as the Chief of Staff in my 
office.  That is how she introduced...   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR KOKO:   So that tells you what a type of relationship I 
had.  A professional one.  We are not friends.  But we are 
professionals that I can ask her such things.  Granted, at 
that point, I asked her.  It was December 2015.  She had 
already moved to the Chairman’s office but we still kept the 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 345 of 354 
 
relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   We still kept the relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you have no recollection whether she 
might have dealt with Thompsons Travel Agents at her(?) 
instance out of this? 
MR KOKO:   No, I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not...  Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I do not – I do not have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   But these are – the travel arrangements, I 
think that between her and my professional assistance, 
there would – I would just get my to my office and pick up 
my travelling documents and I will go.  Between them, they 
were very efficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your evidence that, one, in regard 
to this part of the leg or this leg of the trip from Indonesia 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   To Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to Dubai, she is the one who asked – 
who must have asked Travel ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Travel Excellence ...[intervenes]  
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 346 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to make bookings for you? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that she is the one also who decided 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
visas 
to 
use 
Travel 
Excellence 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...without your knowledge? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, and here I am saying her associate which 
concerning Salim Essa. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Because the thing with Salim Essa is there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I mean, you all – we had to go through Salim 
Essa.  [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why would you think she would go to 
Travel Excellence when she knows you wanted her to use 
Thompsons?  Because it is not like – it would be different 
you said:  You know, I need to travel.  Find a travel agent 
and make this – ask them to do this for me without 
20 
specifying which one.  But if you were using Thompsons 
and you said to her:  Ask Thompsons to do this for me.  
Why would she go to Travel Excellence? 
MR KOKO:   Remember when I told you – I dealt with this 
topic before, when we get into the visas.  I said to you but 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394

this email address is an email address that you gave to me 
that I must use it when I want to talk to the Chair but is the 
same email address that brings me a visa.  And by the way, 
I have since changed my mind.  I think she – Ms Daniels 
had – that was a portal that Ms Daniels had access to.  
Given the evidence, that is what it is.  And she answer she 
gave me was convenience.  And I said to you then the 
mistake I did not do, I did then, was not to probe this 
convenience thing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And in regard to her having, probably, 
10 
because I think that is what you are saying, probably 
approached Travel Excellence whether directly or through 
Salim Essa ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No, I think she – I think she approached 
Travel Excellence through Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  When did you discover that 
actually that leg of your trip had been booked for by Travel 
Excellence? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this is interesting conversation.  Long, 
long. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Soon after ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Not soon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After coming back? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, much later? 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 348 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2018? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Dr Bonn(?) was even gone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And how did it come about that you 
found out? 
MR KOKO:   Because Eskom went into – and this is the 
point.  So I was so transparent with these emails that I – 
on my phone used my Eskom email address.  You know, it 
10 
is not a characteristic of a person trying to hide.  So I used 
my email address, Eskom email address to sent the emails 
to the receptionist to claim(?) the visas.  And then it died 
there.  Two years later, Eskom comes back to me and say:  
Actually, this email trail, somewhere along the line it has 
got Salim Essa in it.  What was going on?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  And then, did you contact her 
that time, Ms Daniels, to say:  On whose authority 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   By that time we were no longer on speaking 
20 
terms, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   She was calling out, telling everybody that I 
stole money from Eskom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now, Ms Suliman says she 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 349 of 354 
 
was asked by either Mr Salim Essa or his secretary 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Or his secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or his - Mr Salim Essa’s secretary to 
make bookings for you. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  And the visas, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and the – well, I did not remember 
about the visas in terms of her but yes, okay.  And you – 
we have reached a point where you are able to say:  Well, 
as far a particular leg of the trip from Indonesia from Dubai 
10 
that was – booking was made by Travel Excellence 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No, the documents say so... ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   You cannot argue that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But to – we have gone further because 
you have said this must have happened in this way.  
Ms Daniels must have spoken to Salim Essa and Salim 
Essa must have spoken to Travel Excellence ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to an extent and maybe it is a limited 
extent, the two versions fit in there although it comes from 
different angles. 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 350 of 354 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because in regard to that part of the leg, 
then Ms Suliman must be correct to say either Mr Essa or 
Mr Essa’s secretary spoke to me and – in regard to that 
part of the trip. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you accept that. 
MR KOKO:   That part ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That part is not a problem. 
MR KOKO:   It is not a problem for me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  We are at about twelve 
minutes past nine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We did not talk about when we would 
20 
stop. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think we should stop and then on 
Monday we can continue.  On other times, I would go – I 
would be prepared to go further but I have got to – I think 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 351 of 354 
 
we should stop now.  And then on Monday we try and 
finish.  I do not know whether Mr Seleka you had to or 
three questions you wanted to put in regard to this before 
we adjourn or you – they can wait until Monday? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We – I can ask two or three or – ja.  Or 
should they wait?  Let them wait, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They can wait? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let them wait. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it is fine.  But before we adjourn, I 
want to raise something and I want mister – to hear what 
Mr Barrie might say about it, if it is something that he 
would want to respond to only on Monday, that is fine.  I do 
not know, Mr Barrie, whether, one – once Mr Seleka has 
finished questioning Mr Koko you wish to re-examine, 
number one.   
 
Number two.  If you wish to re-examine, I do not 
know what you have in mind as to how long it might take.  
But having said that, I want to say either if Mr Seleka ends 
20 
up using all the time on Monday or uses most of the time 
and the time that is left is not enough for you to finish, I 
have begun to say to legal representatives of persons who 
wish to re-examine that maybe they could consider whether 
in 
the 
place 
of 
oral 
re-examination, 
they 
would 
be 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 352 of 354 
 
comfortable with filing an affidavit after the evidence 
leader has finished to question the witness.   
 
Within an agreed period, filing an affidavit which 
clarifies all the issues that they would have wished to 
clarify.  Some have said that is fine but obviously it 
depends on each legal representative.  But that is simply 
because of the time constraints.  So I do not know whether 
you wish to think about it or is there something that you 
want to say something? 
ADV 
BARRIE: 
 
 
Chair, 
something 
that 
we 
know... 
10 
[Speaker ’s microphone not working properly] ...but we have 
filed a new bundle, a further bundle today.  It was sent to 
the team which we asked to be added to Bundle 50. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE:   And we hope that will be made available to 
you by Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE:   Our problem is.  This is Mr Koko’s – I think 
it his eight day here and it is a very – it is in a sense wide-
ranging.  In another sense, they are actually very – the 
20 
issues 
are 
actually 
simple. 
 
But 
the 
way 
that 
the 
examination has gone in relation to each and every point 
because every time Mr Koko comes to testify, then the 
work stream goes and they find witnesses who contradict 
him and then he comes back and that is put to him and 
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 353 of 354 
 
then – and it is an endless process.   
 
And then we need to deal with that in some way 
or another and I am not quite sure that it is practically 
possible to deal with that comprehensively in an affidavit.  
What I would propose is that, yes, we will do a – do 
something to that effect but it might still be necessary to 
hear Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE:   Something to elucidate in some instances 
but I am sure that it will cut the proceedings ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Considerable. 
ADV BARRIE:   ...considerable but we need a bit of time.  I 
just need a bit of breathing space.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughs]  No, that is alright.  That is 
alright. 
ADV BARRIE:   But yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BARRIE:   ...we have actually considered that 
because we know that you have these time constraints. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, thank you  Thank you, thank 
20 
you.  Okay we are going to adjourn for today.  For the 
benefit of the public.  Tomorrow I will be hearing witnesses 
who will give evidence in connection with the State 
Security Agency.  Mr Koko will resume his evidence on 
Monday, the evening session.   
13 MAY 2021 – DAY 394 
 
Page 354 of 354 
 
 
But I want to thank you Mr Seleka and your 
team.  I want to thank the investigation team.  I want to 
thank you Mr Koko.  I want to thank Mr Barrie and his 
instructing attorney.  And the staff and the technicians for 
your cooperation to enable us to sit so late in order to try 
and finish the work.  I appreciate all the sacrifices that 
everybody is doing – is making to assist us.  Thank you 
very much.  We will adjourn now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.
