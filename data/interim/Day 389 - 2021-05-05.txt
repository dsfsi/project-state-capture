PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 05 MAY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson today is scheduled for the 
evidence of Mr Kevin Wakefield – Mr Wakeford.  Mr 
Wakeford Chair you will remember he applied to cross-
examine Mr Agrizzi.  Mr Agrizzi had given evidence wherein 
he referred to Mr Wakeford.  On that basis Mr Wakeford 
10 
applied to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi. 
 
Now Mr Wakeford then was in – is scheduled to 
testify today in response to the evidence of Mr Agrizzi 
before he could cross-examine him.   
 
But unhappily Chairperson it – the matter for 
testimony is not ready today because of two things. 
1. The evidence of Mr Agrizzi refers to two other people 
who are involved – who are alleged to be involved in 
the 
activities 
of 
Mr 
Wakeford. 
 
That 
is 
Mr 
Radhakrishna and Mr Papadakis.  Both those persons 
20 
have given affidavits but there was a delay in getting 
those affidavits seen by Mr Agrizzi and responded to 
by Mr Agrizzi.  Mr Agrizzi has now responded to those 
and now they are ready to be given to Mr Wakeford.  
We gave them this morning.  Mr Wakeford therefore 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 4 of 140 
 
could not be able to test – to finalise his affidavit 
before he testifies today.  He will finalise it this 
afternoon and then the matter will be ready to 
proceed tomorrow. 
I must also put on record that ideally it – the affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are requesting that the matter be 
adjourned until tomorrow? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  We request that the matter be 
adjourned until tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the –  
CHAIRPERSON:  You said the matter will be heard 
tomorrow.  I decide when the matter will be heard. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, no I am sorry – I beg your pardon 
Chairperson it is a – we are requesting that the matter be 
adjourned from today to tomorrow to hear the evidence of 
Mr Kevin Wakeford. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was another matter you saying you 
want to place on record. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the issue – the other matter 
20 
we want to place on record is that Mr Wakeford wanted 
access to the evidence given by Mr Agrizzi in the inquiry – 
there is a litigation inquiry that had been held regarding 
the liquidation of BOSASA.   
Apparently 
Mr 
Agrizzi 
testified 
there 
and 
Mr 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 5 of 140 
 
Wakeford would have loved that evidence to be part of his 
affidavit.   
 
We have unable to get that but that has also 
delayed the finalisation of the affidavit.  And – but the – 
that part will not form part of the affidavit that is being 
finalised this afternoon. 
 
And then the – when I receive the affidavit of Mr 
Agrizzi – sorry of Mr Wakeford I will then give it to Mr 
Agrizzi but we will not be able to get the response of Mr 
Agrizzi before the testimony of Mr Wakeford tomorrow. 
10 
 
So Mr Wakeford will testify without a response from 
Mr Agrizzi tomorrow. If Chair grants us the permission for 
the postponement to tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I – Mr Wakeford is represented 
let us just get counsel for Mr Wakeford to place himself on 
record. Good morning – just put on the mic.  Just switch it 
on.  Ja press somewhere there? 
ADV WILLIS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV WILLIS:  Good morning Mr Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning yes. 
ADV WILLIS:  I did act for Mr Wakeford. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIS:  As you know surname Willis for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 6 of 140 
 
ADV WILLIS:  My attorney Ms Conradie from Maphalla 
Mokate Conradie . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIS:  I confirm everything that Mr Notshe has 
informed you of Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
ADV WILLIS:  In prevailing on you to stand the matter 
down for one day might I – might I just make the following 
submissions? 
 
The first is that unfortunately logistically issues and 
10 
obviously the response of Mr Agrizzi has – has created the 
situation where we only received information as late as this 
morning. 
 
We have been waiting for it Mr Notshe and I have 
been in continued contact.  The – the fact is - is that Mr 
Wakeford would have been ready to give the evidence this 
morning – he is ready – he is on standby but of course it is 
for the benefit of this commission and your good self that 
you have the affidavit. 
 
Because it is an affidavit not merely a statement 
20 
and it has got to be testified to and certainly as his legal 
representatives we cannot recommend that he signs off 
under oath on something when there is other material that 
we are aware of.  That is very unfortunate.  
 
Mr Chairman the fact is and not to labour the issue 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 7 of 140 
 
and you will recall in relation to Mr Wakeford he was one of 
those in this commission unfortunately in circumstances at 
the time did not get his Rule 3.3 Notice. 
 
He has been prejudiced from the outset we are now 
28 months down the line he is one of those and not the 
only one but there are many have breached your rules and 
directives who has not had his say in the media. 
 
He has obeyed your rules where he has been forced 
to publish a media statement in denial that is all that it has 
amounted to and he has waited and abided his time. 
10 
 
One we cannot lose this opportunity for him to give 
his evidence.  We do believe we can be finished tomorrow 
– we may have to prevail on you to work after hours but it 
is our intention not to waste more than today in making 
sure that the matter is properly ripe be heard before you 
and dealt with by you. 
 
And those circumstances I second Mr Notshe’s 
request that you stand the matter down until tomorrow.  It 
was set aside for the two days – we will lose today but I do 
believe 
it 
can 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
expediting 
the 
20 
proceedings tomorrow and bar an hour or two or three into 
the evening your days and your commission will not – the 
days in this commission will not be lost on account of 
standing it down. 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 8 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you – thank you very much. 
Thank you.  Of course as everybody would know I am very 
concerned about the need for the commission to use all its 
available 
time 
because 
there 
time 
constraints 
but 
I 
understand the logistical challenges that I have been told 
about. 
Maybe 
things 
could 
have 
been 
handled 
in 
a 
different way but I will adjourn the matter until tomorrow. I 
do have an evening session tomorrow and it may well be 
that to the extent that it might be thought there might be a 
10 
need to go into the evening with Mr Wakeford’s evidence 
tomorrow it may well be that we should start earlier than 
normal so that we try as far as possible not to interfere 
with the evening session of tomorrow.  So I think maybe let 
us start at half past nine.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Half past nine suites me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  So – so it is fine I am going to 
adjourn Mr Wakeford’s matter then and tomorrow we will – I 
will hear his evidence – we will start at half past nine.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you – thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – for the public we are meant to have 
an evening session this evening and depending on what 
arrangements will be made maybe the witness who is 
supposed to give evidence this evening could start earlier 
maybe in the afternoon but there will still be another 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 9 of 140 
 
session of the commission sometime either this afternoon 
or this evening.  Okay we – we adjourn. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Hulley, good afternoon 
everybody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good afternoon Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has been a long time I have not seen 
you. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It has been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in a long time. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It has been Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Good 
afternoon 
Mr 
Mabuyakhulu. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Good afternoon Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you for availing yourself  
for purposes of the commission.  Yes Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair the 
proceedings today arise from a – from a directive that is 
20 
dated 16 April 2021 that was sent to Mr Mabuyakhulu calling 
upon him to come and testify to deal with matters where the 
– as to a conflict between himself and two witnesses who 
have implicated him. 
 
I will take you to that in a short while.  If I can in the 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 10 of 140 
 
meantime as a matter of housekeeping just ask you to 
consider the bundle LEA27 which is before you Mr Chair.  
That bundle will largely be the bundle that is required for 
today’s purposes. 
 
The – if I could give some background to how this 
matter has come before the commission Mr Chair you will 
recall that two witnesses a certain Mr Trevor White of 
PricewaterHouse Cooper testified sometime in January of 
2020 and a certain Mr – Colonel Piet Du Plooy also testified 
sometime in February of 2020. 
10 
 
Now they testified about a number of matters some of 
which is of importance for today’s purposes but specifically 
they testified about a certain Mr Gaston Savoy who was the 
director and the owner of a number of companies which are 
referred to as the Intaka Group of Companies amongst the 
various transactions of that company those companies were 
responsible for were the sales of certain units to the 
KwaZulu Natal provincial government via its Department of 
Local Government in Provincial – oh sorry Local Government 
and Traditional Affairs. 
20 
 
Arising out of those – out of those transactions there 
was an – they – Mr Savoy was required to pay over a certain 
amount of money as a donation – the indication that was 
given to him was that it would be a donation of R1.053 
million that would be paid over to the ANC. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 11 of 140 
 
 
Now what the days’ proceedings are concerned with 
is the question of the R1.053 million and a – which was 
supposed to – from the evidence that had been led by Mr 
Trevor White what it showed was that the amount had been 
paid into the firm of attorneys Khobone and Shezi Attorneys 
and from that it had been disbursed to various creditors of a 
certain Mr Sipho Shabalala. 
 
Mr Mabuyakhulu’s involvement is in – in this matter 
relates to the fact that he provided an affidavit at some stage 
and provided support or the view that Mr Shabalala had in 
10 
fact paid over that amount of money or paid over an amount 
of money of R1 million to the ANC  
 
So on the 16t h of April of 2021 a directive was sent to 
him that appears at Bundle – at RR7 page 130 this is part of 
the Bundle LEA27 in which he was called upon to come and 
testify at paragraph 1 and in the quotation 1. 
“Before Mr Mabuyakhulu’s application for 
leave to cross-examine Mr White and Colonel 
Du Plooy can be decided it is necessary for 
Mr 
Mabuyakhulu 
to 
testify 
and 
subject 
20 
himself questioning via a member of the 
commission’s legal team where after an 
assessment will be made on exactly what 
allegations of fact remain in dispute between 
Mr White and Colonel Du Plooy on the one 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 12 of 140 
 
hand and Mr Mabuyakhulu on the other.” 
 
And then he is instructed: 
“Mr 
Mabuyakhulu 
is 
hereby 
directed 
to 
appear before the commission” 
And it is given today’s date and on the following page 
he is told: 
“To give evidence and be questioned with 
regard to the matter of R1 million donation 
dealt with in his affidavit delivered to the 
commission.” 
10 
 
And it is in that context that Mr Mabuyakhulu has 
been called to come and testify today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV DICKSON SC:  Mr Chair I am sorry I think I missed 
being able to state my representation.  AJ Dickson SC from 
Pietermaritzburg. I am instructed by PKH Attorneys and I am 
representing the witness Michael Mabuyakhulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was not aware that there was legal 
representative where you aware Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I was aware Mr Chairperson I should 
20 
have drawn that to your attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Much earlier my sincere apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes to my attention.  Yes okay.  Now at 
least he does appear there.  Good – good afternoon Mr 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 13 of 140 
 
Dickson. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   Good afternoon Mr Chair nice to see 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes nice to see you too.  Okay so you have 
just placed on record that you represent Mr Mabuyakhulu. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Mr Hulley are you done? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am done with the introduction Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Done in terms of outlining what? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In terms of outlining how the matter 
10 
comes before the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If Mr Mabuyakhulu can be sworn in so 
that I can take him through the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  00:06:20 to the issues that have raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Dickson at this stage there is 
nothing you wish to say otherwise if there is nothing we 
would have Mr Mabuyakhulu sworn in. 
ADV DICKSON SC:  Mr Chair I wonder if I could ask for an 
20 
indulgence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DICKSON SC:  Mr Mabuyakhulu once he is sworn in 
would like to make an opening statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 14 of 140 
 
ADV DICKSON SC:  It may be on the lengthy side for an 
opening statement but that will be his evidence as it were 
and all his contentions that he wishes to make and if he is – 
if he is permitted to do that then Mr Hulley can ask questions 
afterwards.  If that is in order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand it although you refer to it 
as an opening statement as – what you actually mean is he 
would like to tell his side of the story. 
ADV DICKSON SC:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct?  Yes before he is 
10 
questioned. 
ADV DICKSON SC:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  Let us – let us 
have him sworn in first and then I will hear what Mr Hulley – 
whether Mr Hulley has anything to say about that. 
ADV DICKSON SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Mabuyakhulu the Registrar 
will administer an oath or affirmation to you at this stage 
maybe you can unmute yourself and then you will appear – 
your picture will appear. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I understand Mr Mabuyakhulu you 
should talk and when you talk – start talking then you will – 
your picture will appear. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I am hearing the Chairman awaiting to 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 15 of 140 
 
be 00:08:31. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Alright okay.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  My full name is Michael Mabuyakhulu. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to making the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I have no objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  What is – just repeat. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to making the 
prescribed affirmation? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I have no objection Chairman. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if 
so please raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley do you have anything to say 
about the request? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair I have got no difficulty per se as 
long as Mr Mabuyakhulu of course understands that the 
purpose of today’s’ proceedings is very limited. It is not on 
the question of his overall testimony relating to all the 
matters that have been raised by Mr White and Colonel Du 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 16 of 140 
 
Plooy.  It relates to a specific and a very narrow – but 
subject to that I have got no difficulty with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine.  Mr Mabuyakhulu 
what is your estimate of how much time you need in order to 
just tell your story – you side of the story? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I only need about fifteen minutes not 
more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I give you this opportunity 
10 
now.  You can go ahead. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Good afternoon Mr Chairman and the 
commission as a whole.  Please allow me Mr Chairman to set 
out the context of the issues that have resulted in my 
appearance before this judicial commission. 
 
Its parameters to investigate the existence of state 
capture, corruption, fraud in the public sector including 
organs of state. 
 
The first matter Mr Chairman that I wish to place on 
record is the matter that I have raised in my supplementary 
20 
affidavit in paragraph 1 to 5.  
 
I place before you Mr Chairman a concern of 
significant importance.  On the 9 t h of January 2020 the 
commission informed me that Messrs Trevor Shaun White 
and Petrus Johannes Du Plooy who mentioned my name in 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 17 of 140 
 
their evidence and after being served with their respective 
affidavits that were submitted to this commission I made an 
application to the commission in terms of Rule 3.3.6.3 to 
cross-examine the two witnesses on the allegation they had 
made about me. 
 
Instead of being afforded an opportunity to cross-
examine these witnesses based on their testimonies to this 
commission I have been advised that the Chairman has ruled 
that before my application is decided I must first give 
evidence and submit myself to questioning. 
10 
 
I confirm to Chairman that I am appearing before this 
commission in order to honour that directive as I hereby do. 
 
Mr Chairman I wish to make it clear that I welcome 
the opportunity to give evidence before this commission.  I 
however Mr Chairman wish to place on record that I would 
have expected the commission to firstly allow me the 
opportunity to cross-examine the said two witnesses on 
aspects of their evidence that I regard not to be based on 
facts, logic and rationality. 
 
Yet I am now expected to negate the evidence 
20 
against me before the version of their evidence is even 
tested by this commission. 
 
The major concern I have here is that I am now 
giving 
evidence 
in 
denial 
of 
unfounded 
opinions 
or 
inferences before showing how following roles unfounded 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 18 of 140 
 
opinions or inferences are. 
 
I therefore place this concern on record at the outset. 
 
I also wish to point out Mr Chairman that I have been 
advised that I need to remind that the matter in the – is still 
before the various courts of the Republic of South Africa 
where some individuals and companies are currently being 
prosecuted by the state.   
 
I raise this matter only for the 00:13:01 by this 
commission.  And now we are trying to deal with some of the 
key issues as I understand them. 
10 
 
Mr Chairman I wish to confirm that I received a letter 
from my colleague Dr Zwelini Lawrence Mkhize who was the 
MEC 
of 
Finance 
and 
Economic 
Development 
in 
West 
00:13:19 at the time.  In his letter dated the 15 t h July 2005 
Dr Z L Mkhize proposed that he will establish a joint 
interdepartmental team. They will consider the purchase of 
the water purification plants that would be installed in the 
various 00:13:37 municipalities that were highly accepted by 
the Judge. 
 
So then Zwelini Mkhize further explained that these 
20 
water purifications plants were to be funded from the 
00:13:51 fund that was located in the Department of Finance 
and Economics.  My role here Mr Chairman was to support 
the 
proposed 
work 
by 
Dr 
Zwelini 
Mkhize 
for 
the 
establishment of the committee headed by the joint HOD’s of 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 19 of 140 
 
the Provincial Treasury and Local Government. 
 
It was this committee that dealt with the procurement 
issues 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end. 
 
With 
the 
establishment of the committee he has basic authorities had 
no further role to play in the procurement processes save 
that may have received a report of those. 
 
The other very important matter Mr Chairman is that 
we know from the indictment on the interim matter and from 
the affidavit of one Mr Gaston Savoy the dependent on the 
R1 053 million was paid into the trust account of Khobone & 
10 
Shezi Attorneys [?] on the 12t h of March 2007. 
 
In his evidence before this commission Mr White 
presents TSW19 and TSW21 in the bundle of documents 
where it illustrates how the R1 053 million was dispersed 
from the Khobone & Shezi Attorneys Trust account. 
 
In regards I am showing in TSW21 Mr White details 
that 29 payments were made between the period of 19 
February 2007 and 21 August 2007.  Mr White clearly 
illustrates that all of the 29 payments were for the benefit of 
Mr Sipho Shabalala and Ms B N O Shabalala.   
20 
 
And I place on record Mr Chairman that none of the 
29 payments that were made were either made directly to me 
or for my benefit and or for the benefit of the ANC. 
 
What is in dispute there Mr Chairman is the illogical 
inference or link by the forensic 00:15:54 who showed us 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 20 of 140 
 
how the whole amount of R1 056 204.98 was paid to various 
14 various companies. 
 
What is absurd is the similar terms to connect 
R1million that was donated in cash to the ANC while myself 
in my capacity as the Provincial Treasurer of the ANC then 
by Mr Sipho Shabalala with the fund that Intaka had paid into 
the Khobone and Shezi trust account. 
 
Mr Trevor White develops a red dotted arrow in which 
he is attempting to link the amount of R1 million that was 
received by me for the ANC by joining two small dots on 
10 
boxes outside of the square in the centre of TSW21 where he 
shows how the funds were dispersed. 
 
Clearly he has Mr Chairman Mr White needs to 
explain to this commission how many millions did Intaka pay.  
We know from Mr Gaston Savoy’s affidavit that is before the 
Pietermaritzburg High Court that only R1 million was paid so 
where does this other R1 million that Mr Trevor White shows 
come from? 
 
If Mr White is saying that he is referring to the same 
funds that were paid by Intaka then my question is how can 
20 
it be Mr Chairman?  We now know for a fact from Mr White 
himself how the Intaka money was used and for whose 
benefit. 
 
Where are the facts of Mr White’s conclusion and 
inferences coming from?  Where are the facts of logic and 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 21 of 140 
 
rationality?  Mr White should account for his unfounded 
claims that he made in TSW21. 
 
Just 
on 
these 
aspects 
alone 
Mr 
Chairman 
I 
respectfully submit that this commission should grant me the 
opportunity to cross-examine Mr Trevor White. 
 
The third issue Mr Chairman is the fact that I 
received a cash donation of R1 million from Mr Sipho 
Shabalala on or about the 11t h of June 2008.  I place on 
record Mr Chairman that the said amount of R1 million was 
received by me in my capacity as the Provincial Treasurer of 
10 
the ANC at that time. 
 
I further place on record the contents of my affidavit 
that I deposed to when I was first approached by the 
investigators on this matter.  That affidavit is the same 
affidavit that my lawyer submitted to this commission and is 
now part of the commission’s documents of record. 
 
I would also like to further place on record the letter 
from my lawyers dated the 2 nd of February 2010.  The third 
letter records that I was the author – the person to receive 
the donation on behalf of the ANC.   
20 
 
I further clarify that I authorised the utilisation of the 
funds for various purposes related to the 00:19:01 ANC 
Provincial Conference that was held between the 20t h and 
the 22 nd of June 2008. 
 
I am intend Chairman as I did back then at the time 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 22 of 140 
 
like the deceiving to receive a donation was bona fide on my 
part and as such the donation was received as a legitimate 
contribution to fund the ANC in KwaZulu Natal. 
 
I further respectfully submit Mr Chairman that the 
donation that I received from Mr Sipho Shabalala was in 
response to a call made to ANC member supporters, 
sympathisers and friends to contribute resources in order to 
fund ANC activities. 
 
My submission Mr Chairman in this regard 00:19:41 
a. It is common cause that the donation I received from 
10 
Sipho Shabalala was not the funds that Intaka had paid 
into the Khobone & Shezi trust account.  Because Mr 
Trevor White tells us in TSW21 that those funds were 
used to pay 14 companies for the benefit of the 
Shabalala’s. 
b. It was neither a requirement of the ANC nor necessity 
that donors needed to reveal the sources of their 
donated funds at that time.  I add for the benefit of this 
commission Mr Chairman that our legal situation is now 
different as we all know. 
20 
c. The receipt of the R1million was neither unlawful, 
irregular or the commission of a kind.   
d. Accepted in the area I have no knowledge – I have no 
knowledge of any other source of the R1 million except 
from Mr Sipho Shabalala. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 23 of 140 
 
Let me repeat myself on that one Chairman as stated earlier 
I have no knowledge of any other source of the R1 million 
except from Mr Sipho Shabalala. 
 
I place before this commission for noting that the R1 
million donation was paid almost ten months after the funds 
show in TSW21 had been used in its entirety by the 21s t 
August 2007. 
 
Mr 
Chairman 
I 
now 
deal 
with 
the 
unfounded 
allegation 
that 
there 
was 
political 
interference 
in 
the 
withdrawal of charges against me.  Those who made these 
10 
ridiculous claims Mr Chairman do so for malicious intent. 
 
I wish to submit a 00:21:31 on this matter Mr 
Chairman state that there was never a need for me to be 
charged in the first place. 
 
I make no representation to have the charges against 
me withdrawn. 
I wish to bring to the attention of this commission some of 
the relevant documents.  The first is the records filed by the 
Director of Public Prosecutions in Case No 4962/2013 held 
in KwaZulu Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg and attach 
20 
as marked MN6.  The record was filed in terms of the court 
order 
in 
this 
application. 
 
It 
provides 
the 
relevant 
documentation to the withdrawal of the charges against me 
and other accused and includes an internal memorandum by 
Advocate Duniwa which negates 00:22:24 deploys inferences 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 24 of 140 
 
it shows that the decision to withdraw was taken by a 
meeting of officials who met in March 2012 and deliberated 
over two days. 
 
The second document is a memorandum written by 
Advocate Mpho [?] explaining various decisions made by her 
in various prosecutions.  A copy of the document is attached 
my 00:22:50.  The document has been widely circulated and 
is in the public domain. 
 
The withdrawal of the charges against me is set out 
in paragraph b on pages 13 to 16 of that document.  
10 
Reference is made by therein to the memorandum by 
Advocate Duniwa which is the same one relate – referred to 
earlier and included in the record. 
 
I 
submit 
Mr 
Chairman 
that 
both 
00:23:20 
memorandum in which they explained the process that led to 
the withdrawal of the charges and Advocate 00:23:27 to the 
then National Director of Public Prosecutions Mr Nxasana 
and Dr Rama [?] . 
 
I would like therefore to question Colonel Du Plooy 
regarding the allegations he has been making that the 
20 
withdrawal of the charges against me was as a result of 
political interference. 
 
What was this interference?  Where did it come from?  
Who interfered with the NPA process?  It would be a big 
concern Mr Chairman if I had to be denied the opportunity to 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 25 of 140 
 
cross-examine 
Colonel 
Du 
Plooy 
on 
the 
unfounded 
allegations that he has made in his affidavit to this 
commission. 
 
I 00:24:00 Mr Chairman that Colonel Du Plooy’s 
assertions are unjustifiable and unreasonable. 
 
In conclusion Chairman I submit that this commission 
in about establishing facts and it cannot become a platform 
for rumour mongering and baseless conjuncture. 
 
Once the facts are established the commission is 
expected to distil the truth from those facts.  It is my 
10 
respectful 
submission 
Chairman 
that 
in 
the 
quest 
of 
establishing the truth from the facts we should seriously [?] 
those who would waste the precious time and the staff 
resources 
of 
everybody 
including 
this 
commission 
by 
00:24:51 wild goose chase. 
 
It took the release of me Mr Chairman if I end this 
opening statement without indicating that for the last twelve 
years I have endured character assassination and had my 
dignity impugned due to the unfounded allegations that were 
caused by my unlawful arrest in the Intaka matter. 
20 
 
When you search my name in the Internet I am the 
referred to as one of those who were arrested in the 
00:25:21 case.  These resulted in untold reputational 
damage that I have incurred when I have done nothing – 
nothing and nothing wrong against the state or anyone. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 26 of 140 
 
 
The 
statement 
made 
by 
Mr 
White 
before 
this 
commission on the very painful matter and his repetition of 
baseless accusations against me only for to further impugn 
my character.  That is why I feel strongly that he should 
explain his rights on the inconsistencies of his evidence to 
this commission. 
 
And I hope that our country can at the very least 
accord the fundamental principle of our constitution that we 
are all equal before the law and to uphold it is not selective.  
If we cannot lead by the 00:26:15 of the proverb that says 
10 
what is good for the goose it is good for the gander.  I will 
leave the experiences to 00:26:24 that we are truly equal 
before the law. 
 
I am hoping Mr Chairman that this commission will 
ensure that I too is there to get justice against those who 
have deliberately dragged my name, dragged me into 
criminal matter that had nothing to do with me. 
 
At the very least I would expect of this commission 
the confirmation that the charges have been legitimately 
withdrawn by the constitution authority as the facts and the 
20 
truth shows. 
 
On that note Mr Chairman my opening statement 
ends and thank you for the opportunity Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Mabuyakhulu. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Mabuyakhulu. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 27 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to mention that part of the 
purpose or if not main – the main purpose is of these 
proceedings today is to see exactly where the differences 
are in your version and the version of Mr White and Colonel 
– is it Du Plooy? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Colonel Du Plooy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but particularly Mr White and yourself in 
relation to the – to the donation and so that if leave to cross-
examine is granted it is clear what the differences are in the 
two versions so that is part of the reason and it may well be 
10 
that from what you have given as your evidence call it 
opening statement one can see where you stand but Mr 
Hulley can now put questions. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Mabuyakhulu 
just to get some context to what we dealing with before we 
actually get into the matter. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   Mr Chairman Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Dickson yes. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   I am sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DICKSON SC:   Can I – can I just be of assistance.  I 
do not if this question asked but if I can be of assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   The witness referred to certain 
documents and if I could just give you page numbers. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 28 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   Because they have different page 
numbers in RR7.  TSW19 is at page 038 – OR7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   038. Oh yes. 
ADV DICKSON SC:   038 TSW22 is 039.  The record that 
was referred to as being filed in the Pietermaritzburg High 
Court case starts at 040 and the statement by Advocate 
Mpho which was referred to starts at page 073.  That is just 
that.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DICKSON SC:   So that we can get our bearings Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is – that is helpful.  The 
last one was 073. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, page 73. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Hulley.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Mabuyakhulu, 
from 
your 
opening 
statement 
I 
gather 
that 
you 
are 
confirming, and if I can take you to the two affidavits.  You 
have deposed to an affidavit which appears in Bundle RR7.  
That is LEA-27, Mr Chair but it appears at page RR7-
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 29 of 140 
 
MM005.  It is in red at the top right-hand corner of the 
bundle that you have. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
just 
to 
make 
sure 
we 
all 
understand.  When we refer to the page numbers, we will 
just call the number that comes after MM without starting 
with RR7-MM so that it will make things quicker.  You said 
05? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page, 005,  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   005. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Mabuyakhulu? 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I am still looking for it Mr Chairman.  
Zero, five.  Yes, I found it Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if you look between the tram lines, 
you will see that it refers to an affidavit of Michael 
Mabuyakhulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Do you see that? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think he said he has got it.  That 
20 
is 005.  Oh, you have got two numbers there mister... 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The one is the sequence number and 
that is an application but it is the uppermost number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, for the record.  We must say that 
when we refer to page numbers it will be the ...[intervenes]  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 30 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Uppermost ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...come after MM and the upper number 
and not the lower one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct, Chair.  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  What you have there 
Mr Mabuyakhulu is your affidavit.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if you go with me to page 16 of 
that document. 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Page 16.  Chairman, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is your signature above the word 
deponent.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is right, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this was deposed to n the 
10 t h  of February of 2020.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then more recently you have 
deposed to a second affidavit and if I can take you to that.  
IT appears at page 32 of the same bundle.   
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And it reads between the tramlines:  
Supplementary Affidavit of Michael Mabuyakhulu.  Do you 
have the same document? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 31 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then if you would turn with me to 
page 37 of the same bundle.  Above the word or the words 
Mr Mabuyakhulu is a signature.  Is that your signature? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this purports to be an affidavit that 
was deposed to by you on the 29 t h of April of 2021.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  So these are the two 
affidavits that you filed with this Commission.  Is that 
10 
correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now if you turn back with me to the – 
one of the annexures to the first affidavit.  You will see 
there is an Annexure MM3 which appears at page 23 of the 
same bundle.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Do you have it? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   MM, 23.  Yes? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if you would turn to me to page 29 
20 
of the same – page 29 of the same bundle.  That is one 
document. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   This purports to be an affidavit and 
above the word deponent on that last page is a signature.  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 32 of 140 
 
Is that your signature? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   It is my signature, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this purports to be an affidavit that 
was deposed to on the 19 t h of October of 2010.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  Now if you – and I will get 
back to that shortly – if you would not mind turning with me 
to Bundle RR-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle RR-4? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a different bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is a different bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I do not have that Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says he does not have that one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, he ought to have it because 
certainly made – as I understand it, it was certainly made 
available to him.  That is part of RR-4, it is Mr Trevor(?) 
White’s affidavit together with all the annexures. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I may look for it... [Speaker not 
clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be written on the spine.  Is that 
right? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It ought to be written on the spine. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 33 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So look at spine of the files you have. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I have got Chebo White’s – 
Trever(?) White’s affidavit but it is not where – it is R after 
the M and 142. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the same bundle or in another 
bundle?  In the same bundle that ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   In the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that we were using earlier? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That same bundle... [Speaker not 
clear]  MM-7, MM-1149(?) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   The affidavit of Mr Trevor(?) White.  
[Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us see.  Yes, I see that.  Is that the 
same Mr Hulley?  It is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Perhaps if we can just go to the 
specific page that he is referring to.  If he can just refer 
me to the page so that I can understand what he is 
referring to?  I imagine that what Mr Mabuyakhulu is 
referring to Mr Chair is an annexure to the affidavit.  Sorry, 
20 
to the Rule 3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But is it the same affidavit that you 
are ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is the same affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we can use this one or can we not? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 34 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if we can stay with the same 
bundle it makes things easier. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   As far as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if we have to go to another bundle 
we can go if Mr Mabuyakhulu and his counsel have got the 
other bundle. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  It seems to me 
that it would be necessary – I am not sure if the 
representatives can actually hear what we are saying but 
10 
they should made the bundle available because there is a 
number of documents related to this matter that are only to 
be found in that bundle and not part of this bundle that we 
are referring to as RR-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, was it sent to them at the same 
time as the other one? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I understand that it was sent through to 
them and that appears at page 144 of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Of the present bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is ...[intervenes]  
ADV DICKSON:   Chairman, can I help? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV DICKSON:   We do have – we have a different role to 
a witness. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 35 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV DICKSON:   But if we are permitted just to take then 
RR-4 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV DICKSON:   ...we can take that to him and then we 
are all on the same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  You may do so. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
ADV DICKSON:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Okay so.  Yes, 
he has it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay he has got it now.  Okay fine. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Speaker not clear] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, Mr Mabuyakhulu, you referred to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just indicate what page in that bundle 
we should go to. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  The specific 
document is to be found at page 149(?). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1999? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, it should be – that is correct, 
Mr Chair.  Sorry, it would be – and for your purposes Mr 
Chair, if you can just turn to – it is Bundle RR-4 and then 
in brackets lower case (d).  That is D for Delta.  So you 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 36 of 140 
 
would have four different bundles that are part of RR-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must just not confuse my registrar.  
[laughs]  Is my bundle not the same as theirs? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It ought to be identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But it is divided in – it is a bundle that 
is divided into four lever arch files.  So it is the fourth of 
the four lever arch files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, each lever arch files should be a 
bundle or a continuation of a bundle.  So it should have A, 
10 
B, C, D or something. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct.  This one is D ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So which one must ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   D for Delta, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 4(d)? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Bundle RR-4 and D, D for Delta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, RR-4(d).  What page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   At page 1999. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Speaker not clear] 
20 
ADV DICKSON:   I am sorry, Mr Chair.  We just do not 
have that.  We have RR-4...  [Speaker not clear] 1359 
through to 1404(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Speaker not clear] ...1865. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 37 of 140 
 
ADV DICKSON:   And we have got another one... [Speaker 
not clear] ...which goes to 1065(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV DICKSON:   We cannot go as far as Mr Hulley’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But to specific.  This is an annexure 
that was attached as Annexure TSW.  That is Trevor 
White’s annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think maybe what we should do is.  Let 
10 
me 
adjourn 
for 
about 
ten 
minutes. 
 
You 
talk 
to 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to Mr Mabuyakhulu’s legal team and 
compare what you have, whether it is the same as what 
they have and what both of you have and whether both – 
what you both have is the same as what I have. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that when I resume we have – we 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...everybody has got the same thing. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am going to adjourn for that 
purpose for ten minutes.  We adjourn. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 38 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Okay.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  
Mr Hulley, can you hear me? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I can.  How are you? 
ADV DICKSON:   Okay.  Fine, thanks.  How are you?  Can 
we ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   I cannot complain.  I would say 
...[intervenes]  
ADV DICKSON:   [laughs]  Can we just sort it out so that at 
least we have got what the witness needs?  What TSW 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   [Indistinct]  
ADV DICKSON:   ...that is not in our RR-7?... 
RECORDING PAUSED 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Has it been sorted out? 
ADV DICKSON:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, okay.  Thank you.  Please 
switch on your mic, Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   My apologies, Mr Chair.  It seems that 
I was referring to a document that was not in the 
chronology that the witness had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So if I can refer to a different page, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 39 of 140 
 
same document that I want to refer to but to a different 
copy of that document in the same bundle.  This one would 
appear at page 1841 of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...of bundle – of RR-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I have got it.  Have you got it 
Mr Mabuyakhulu? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes.  Mr Chairman ...[indistinct] RR-
14-W1801(?).  [Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
I 
am 
referring 
to 
1841, 
Mr Mabuyakhulu.  I did not catch that quite. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he has got it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you referred during your, what you 
referred to as an address or an opening statement, you 
referred to a letter from your attorneys which you said was 
20 
dated the 2 n d of February of 2010.  I imagine that you are 
referring to this document.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Speaker not clear] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   A letter from Ngubane & Walls

MR MABUYAKHULU:   I want to be sure that – what I have 
Mr Chairman it is referred to as 1841.  That is the one that 
– and if that is the document, that is the document that I 
am referring to here that my attorney sent me 2010. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  And it is a letter dated 
2 February 2010 
and 
it 
is 
from 
Ngubane 
& 
Walls 
Incorporated [00:02:11] and it is addressed to Advocate W 
O’Brien, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, correct Mr Chairman. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well.  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Mr Hulley, just for the sake of 
completeness.  Let me indicate that Ms Mgubane(?) and I 
assume that she is the one who is referred to in the name 
Ngubane & Wills Incorporated who appears to have been 
involved in the drafting of the affidavit of Mr Mzila(?)  
...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was asked to provide the Commission 
with an affidavit setting out her role in regard to that 
20 
affidavit.  I am not aware that she has submitted such an 
affidavit but I do not know if you know Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am not aware of it of the top of my 
head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 41 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It might have been drawn to my 
attention 
on 
a 
previous 
occasion 
but 
I 
cannot 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...on this occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Shabalala was also directed to 
deliver an affidavit in regard to or giving his version in 
regard to the donation.  He has responded through his 
attorneys and indicated that because he has been charged 
he 
– 
appears 
that 
he 
may 
prejudice 
his 
rights 
or 
10 
incriminate himself if he gave the information that the 
Commission was asking for.  The Commission, of course, 
respects the right or privilege against self-incrimination but 
I thought I would indicate that he has responded.  I am not 
aware that Ms Mgubane has responded herself.  So I just 
thought ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...let me mention that so that we are all 
aware of it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  You may continue 
Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  So just to 
confirm then and I think you have already done so but I 
want to confirm that this firm of attorneys, Ngubane & 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 42 of 140 
 
Walls Incorporated [00:05:21] is in fact or was in fact at 
the time your attorneys.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this letter purports to be a letter 
that has been addressed to Advocate O’Brien on behalf of 
the 
ANC 
and 
your 
behalf. 
 
Is 
that 
an 
accurate 
...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  I will revert to the letter in 
due course.  What I want to understand insofar as the 
differences between your testimony and that...  Sorry.  
Insofar as the differences between your testimony and that 
of Mr White is concerned.  If I understand your testimony 
correctly.   
 
You say that an amount of R 1 million was paid 
to you in cash by Mr Shabalala but that amount that was 
paid to you, you questioned whether it could be the same 
amount of one point o five three million rand that was paid 
20 
or that is referred to by Mr White in his affidavit as having 
been paid by Intaka into the account of Khobone & Shezi.  
Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I think let me answer in this way, Mr 
Chairman.  I am starting - my starting point is that 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 43 of 140 
 
Mr White makes the allegations that there could be a 
connection between the R 1 million donation that I received 
as the then Provincial Treasurer of the ANC ...[indistinct] 
of 
the 
ANC 
as 
R 1 million 
donation 
in 
cash 
from 
Mr Shabalala, whom I received ...[indistinct] Chairman, 
now that the records are clear.  Ten months after the so-
called Intaka Funds that had been disbursed or that had 
been paid into the trust account – the attorney’s trust 
account.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think the question is whether 
10 
it is a correct understanding of your standpoint via vie 
Mr White that you are saying there is no basis for him to 
link 
the 
amount 
– 
donation 
that 
you 
received 
from 
Mr Shabalala to the money that was paid by Intaka Group 
to the attorneys, Khobone and – it is Khobone and who, 
Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And Shezi Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Shezi Attorneys.  So the question is 
whether that is a correct understanding of what your issue 
is. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...I am saying there is absolutely no 
basis or rationality or logic ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 44 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...or the link of that amount to 
myself(?) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And it is in respect of that issue 
that you wish to be granted leave to cross-examine 
Mr White? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Absolutely, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  In other words, 
you say to the extent that Mr White connects the amount 
that was paid to you in cash was the amount that was paid 
10 
into the trust account of Khobone & Shezi by Intaka?  You 
say to that extent you wish to cross-examine him because 
you do not see ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...a connection between the two 
amounts? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   What I am saying, Mr Chairman.  
What 
I 
am 
saying 
is 
Mr 
Chairman 
is 
that 
I 
know 
20 
...[indistinct] from Mr Trevor White himself who tell that in 
...[indistinct] that an amount of R 1 053 000,00 that was 
paid into the Khobone & Shezi Attorney’s trust account that 
that money was disbursed between the period of 19 
February and 21 August 2007 and it was disbursed in its 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 45 of 140 
 
entirety.  This is Mr White’s affidavit that says that and 
also ...[indistinct] W-21.   
 
I am saying, therefore, it is clear that Mr White 
himself does not explain the rationality or the logic how 
bad(?) he says the money that was paid to 29 payments to 
14 different companies and was disbursed in its entirety.  
That the very same amount of money that ...[indistinct] 
became the same amount of money that Mr Shabalala may 
have paid to me in cash as a donation to the ANC.  
[Speaker not clear] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We will get back to Mr White’s affidavit 
in a moment and to this issue but I just want to take you to 
something else before we get back to issue.  You will recall 
that we referred to your affidavit that was deposed to you 
by in 2010.  Can I take you back to that?  And that is in 
the, for your purposes Mr Chair, Bundle LEA-27 and for 
your purposes, Mr Mabuyakhulu, it is the Bundle RR-7 at 
page 23.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do we get different references? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Because Mr Mabuyakhulu does not 
know about the LEA-27.  He does not have a physical 
bundle like this with a spine.  So your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So you have got the bundle with the 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 46 of 140 
 
spine, Mr Chair.  So if you look at the spine, you want to 
see Bundle LEA-27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But he does not have a physical 
bundle.  So that is why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But even though this might not be a 
physical bundle it could have the same – it could be 
referred to as bundle ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   I will refer to it as Bundle RR-7 then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because if the contents are the 
10 
same, there is no reason why it should not bear the same 
reference because when you give me a different reference 
and you give him a different reference ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   It will be confusing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it will be confusing, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Indeed, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So it is Bundle RR-7, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the specific page is 23. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what you may wish to do if it is 
not going to cause any problem, is to tell Mr Mabuyakhulu 
that his bundle that is written whatever the reference is 
from now on you will refer to it as the same as mine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 47 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he can make a note ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...whatever so that when you refer us to 
– make a reference to any pages it is the same reference 
for all of us. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Mabuyakhulu, your bundle that we 
have – that is referred to as RR-7 ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...in future, what I will do is, because 
we have got a physical lever arch file and our lever arch 
file is LEA-27 marked on it.  So when I refer to LEA-27 just 
bear in mind that is Bundle RR-7. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct] [Speaker not clear] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   LEA.  That is Lima, Echo, Alfa 
...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   A-e-l. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, LEA, Lima, Echo, Alfa, 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is like Lea, l-e-a, 27. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  Now is this the affidavit 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 48 of 140 
 
that we referred to previously.  It is an affidavit which is 
attached to your affidavit that you have deposed to in this 
– before this Commission and I have referred to you earlier 
on.  It is an affidavit dated 19 October 2010.  What were 
the 
circumstances 
and 
why 
did 
you 
depose 
to 
this 
affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You said we should go to 
what page in this bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me, Mr Chair.  Page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:   23? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am there.  Yes? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I thought what I have done 
Mr Chairman 
because 
there 
was 
a 
legal 
criminal 
investigation that was happening during the ...[indistinct] 
matter.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   And what – but what was the purpose?  
Why were you called upon to testify or to depose to an 
affidavit at all? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I was approached by the states(?) 
20 
and the investigators who actually asked me to actually 
clarify what I had knowledge of at the time and then they 
asked me to depose to an affidavit and I duly complied. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the reason why they got aware 
that you had knowledge that might be relevant was 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 49 of 140 
 
because of your letter or rather because of your attorney’s 
of the 2 n d of February of 2010.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   In other words, the letter from Ngubane 
& Walls Incorporated ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...my attorney’s letter was in...  No, 
Mr Chairman.  My attorney’s was in response to the 
request from the investigators and the prosecution for them 
to actually know what was happening.  So all of these 
issues were at the instance of the investigations and the 
10 
prosecution. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
is 
the 
position 
that, 
as 
you 
understood it, in effect, the investigators wanted to hear 
your side of the story? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Absolutely, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And your understanding is that the 
investigators 
were 
investigating 
the 
question 
of 
the 
R 1 million donation that have been made or allegedly 
20 
been made to the ANC.  Is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   My understanding Mr Chairman was 
the investigators were investigating the allegedly money 
that had been paid and they were actually trying to 
establish whether there was a link for the donation 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 50 of 140 
 
received by the ANC and the money paid into the trust 
account whether there was any link between the two. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, so when you say a link between 
the money that had been paid to the ANC, what money are 
we referring to now?  Are we talking about the R 1 million? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I think let us go back for the record, 
Mr Chairman.  I was hoping that counsel would have 
understood that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   There is an amount of about 
10 
R 1 053 000,00 that had been paid into the trust account of 
Khobone & Shezi’s trust account by Intaka.  And then there 
is a R 1 million donation that was donated in cash that was 
received by me in my capacity as the ANC Treasurer on or 
around the 11 t h of June 2008 and that the two, as I said 
earlier, and the Chairman had asked me that question and I 
have said I am actually saying there is no basis in linking 
the two, as far as I am concerned. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now I understand the point that 
you are making.  You are making the amount that the 
20 
amount that had been paid into the account of Khobone & 
Shezi was paid in 2007, in March of 2007 to be precise.  
The amount that was given to you was paid to you in June 
of 2008.  Correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he also makes the ...[intervenes]  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 51 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he also makes the point that in 
between on Mr White’s own version, if I understand him 
correctly, the amount that came from Khobone & Shezi 
Attorneys that was sent to Mr Shabalala was used for 
various purposes by ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   He said it was disbursed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He said it was disbursed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Disbursed, yes. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I think that that is part of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what he says, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the point ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, he says.  What is the basis 
for saying that if that amount was disbursed by Shabalala, 
it was the basis for saying the amount that I received on 
behalf of the ANC came from Intaka.  I am interpreting your 
20 
evidence correctly? 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
You 
are 
absolutely 
correct, 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 52 of 140 
 
Mr Mabuyakhulu.  So I understand the basis of the 
distinction between the two amounts from your perspective.  
What I am trying to understand is.  When the police were 
making an enquiry or the Hawks were making enquiries 
about the link between these two amounts, who told the 
Hawks or who told the police about the R 1 million that had 
been paid to you in 2008?  Where did they get that from? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I did not know any other witness 
that may have said that but I know for a fact that when I 
was approached I did honestly ...[indistinct] that I did 
10 
receive a donation of R 1 million in cash on or around the 
11 t h of June 2008 and that is actually also confirmed in my 
affidavits. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  So let us consider that question 
but 
let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
letter 
of 
Ngubane 
& 
Walls 
Incorporated which is now – if we can go back to RR-4, 
Mr Chair at page 1841. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Bundle RR-4(d). 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And page? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   1841. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1841.  That is the letter from Ngubane & 
Walls Incorporated 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is so, Mr Chair.  Now let us just 
read through this letter if we could?  It says: 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 53 of 140 
 
“We refer to our previous correspondence 
regarding the above and advise that we have 
consulted with a senior member of our client, 
the ANC, MEC, Michael Mabuyakhulu who, at 
the material time, was the Provincial Treasurer 
of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal...” 
 
Is it correct that they have consulted with you, 
your attorneys? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct... 
ADV HULLEY SC:   They then say: 
10 
“We are instructed to convey the following...” 
 
Now is it correct that you gave them instructions 
to convey anything before we ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That Mr Chairman to actually act on 
our behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think you can take it Mr Hulley 
that if these were his attorneys, what they wrote here was 
with his instructions unless he indicates otherwise. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now they say over here, paragraph 1: 
“In his capacity as the Provincial Treasurer at 
the time, Mabuyakhulu authorised the receipt 
of the R 1 million donation from the ANC 
member, Mr Sipho Shabalala...” 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 54 of 140 
 
 
Correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then paragraph 2 they say that: 
“He wishes to place on record that such a 
donation 
was 
received 
in 
cash 
and 
was 
verified to be R 1 million...” 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Paragraph 3 that: 
“He, that is Michael Mabuyakhulu, further 
authorise the funds to be utilised for various 
10 
purposes related to the Kwazulu-Natal ANC 
Provincial Conference that was held between 
the 20 t h and the 22 n d of June of 2008...” 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Four: 
“That 
the 
R 1 million 
donation 
given 
by 
Mr Sipho Shabalala was used as part of the 
package of donations received in the run-up to 
the ANC Kwazulu-Natal Provincial Conference 
to repay some of the costs of the Provincial 
20 
Conference...” 
 
Correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then on the following page at page 
1842, paragraph 7 it is said 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 55 of 140 
 
“Although our client wishes to be helped in this 
matter, however, we are instructed to place on 
record 
that 
Mr Mabuyakhulu’s 
residence 
stance and that of the ANC as well that under 
no circumstances does the organisation wishes 
to compromise its donors and/or its operations 
by disclosing information concerning same. 
It is safe to say that the particular donation 
was included in the report to the conference in 
the Treasurer ’s report. 
10 
Specifically it was included in the globular 
amount of R 7 227 707,00 listed as a donation 
in the income statement...” 
 
Correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now we can accept, of course, that 
everything that is contained in this document or in this 
letter is based on instructions that were received from you.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I can confirm that in the strength of 
the question that counsel has put to me that I do confirm 
20 
those. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thanks.  Now it seems from what I am 
reading over here and correct me if I am wrong but it 
seems that the question of the R 1 million being raised and 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
had 
received 
R 1 million 
from 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 56 of 140 
 
Mr Shabalala that that was something that was raised by 
your attorneys pursuant to instructions that you had given 
to them. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, let me, once again, put it 
correct Mr Chairman as I have answered earlier.  That was 
all in response to the investigators and the prosecution 
that wanted to ask us further on this aspect.  So we, 
therefore, actually provided the information to clarify that 
matter. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now if I understand correctly what the 
10 
– and please correct me if I am wrong and if this is your 
understanding as well – the police or the Hawks in 
particular were investigating a payment of R 1 053 000,00 
and they were investigating such a payment that was made 
in 2007.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   In response to that and in relation to 
them raising that issue an explanation was given that in 
fact you received from Mr Shabalala an amount in cash of 
exactly R 1 million as it is said over here:  It was verified 
20 
to be R 1 million.  Do I understand that correctly? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I do(?), Mr Chairman.  [Speaker not 
clear] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So what I am saying to you is that they 
were investigating an amount that was paid over in 2007.  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 57 of 140 
 
You told them about an amount that was paid in 2008.  
They were investigating an amount of R 1 053 000,00.  You 
told them about an amount of R 1 million.   
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
[Indistinct] 
I 
think 
the 
first 
...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   The first one that when I was asked 
of – when I had known anything I actually only responded 
to the fact – to the matter that I had knowledge of the 
donation and therefore the state itself, as we all know now, 
10 
knew then because they were actually in the whole 
investigation, how this other money was different from the 
other one but the first that I placed on record, I only 
...[indistinct] 
place 
on 
record 
that 
I 
had 
received 
R 1 million donation that had been verified on behalf of the 
ANC and it was a structural(?) situation.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Look, my point is this.  They were 
investigating the question of a payment of R 1 053 000,00 
and they were investigating – and the payment of that 
amount in 2007.  In response to that investigation, they 
20 
were told that actually you did receive an amount of money 
and you received an amount that was R 1 million, not 
R 1 053 000,00 but R 1 million and you did receive it from 
the – from Mr Shabalala but you did not receive it in 2007, 
you received it in 2008. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 58 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is actually Mr Chairman that I 
received 
money 
in 
June 
2008 
on 
or 
about 
the 
11 t h  of June 2008 and that amount of money which I 
actually said to when I was asked whether there was any 
money that I received.  The question was:  Was there any 
money that you had ever received in your capacity as the 
Provincial Treasurer of the ANC?  I said it is a factual 
situation that I had received R 1 million in cash which had 
been verified by ourselves.  And that statement, Chairman, 
which has become common cause that there is not 
10 
necessarily a link between the two.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   So if I understand you correctly.  They 
were – they asked you, as you say, whether you had 
received any money in your capacity as the Treasurer of 
the ANC at any stage?  In other words, you were the 
Treasurer between 1998 and 2008, in June of 2008, are 
you saying that their query related to the length and 
breadth of your period as the Treasurer? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   No, their query was:  Have you ever 
received any money from Mr Shabalala?  And my response 
20 
was:  Yes, I had received money from Mr Shabalala.  And I 
said the period around which I were able to see that money 
which both my affidavits and the letters of my attorneys all 
of them attached to the very factual situation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the query was specifically in 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 59 of 140 
 
relation to Mr Shabalala, so are you saying that the only 
time you received money from Mr Shabalala was this 
particular occasion on the 11 June of 2008.  Is that your 
testimony? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I am saying that at the time when I 
was asked and the only time I can ever recollect and I can 
come out of in my memory would that period that I took 
money from Mr Shabalala.  That is the period that I 
remember I don’t remember any other. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well.  Now if I understand from 
10 
your affidavits correctly, this amount that you received 
from Mr Shabalala was paid over to you in cash and you 
never issued a receipt in respect of that money, is that 
correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if I understand correctly, you did 
not enquire from Mr Shabalala as to who the donor was, is 
that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I did not, Mr Chairman, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand Mr Shabalala to be 
20 
the donor or was there an understanding that it was money 
that he was just passing on that was being donated by 
some –that party that he might not have told you about? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I never asked Mr Shabalala whether 
he was personally the donor or whether the money is 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 60 of 140 
 
raised from any other person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is the position that he approached 
you and said he had some money to donate to the ANC? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, that is the position, Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That position was probably my call 
which have made to the members, supporters, the friends, 
sympathisers of the ANC to donate for the activities or 
funding of activities of the ANC. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when he told you that he had money 
to donate did he at that stage mention how much, how 
much money he had that he wanted to donate? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   He did not mention, Chairman, I 
only knew when I then received the money.  At the time he 
did not mention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when he gave you the money, 
was that in your office, was it in his office, was it in your 
home or residence or in his home or what was the venue? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   We met at the ANC office because 
20 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was at the ANC office.  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   He came to the ANC office and went 
to my provincial treasurer ’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and he was carrying the money as 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 61 of 140 
 
cash, in cash? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   And he brought the money to us in 
cash and then he received the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you recall how he was carrying 
it?  Was it in a bag, was it in his pockets, was he – how – 
R1 million is not – how was he carrying it? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  The fact, Mr Chairman, although I 
cannot precisely recall the finer details because I am 
talking about almost something that happened more than 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   10, 12 years ago. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   But definitely it was not in the 
pockets.  That definitely… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   But whether it was in one bag, 
whatever, I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   But he was carrying it in some 
container he had with him so I honestly cannot recall 
whether it was a bag or a plastic, whatever. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I would be misrepresenting myself 
in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So he gave it to you while you 
were at ANC offices. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 62 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you as treasurer of the ANC at 
the time have had an office that you used as treasurer of 
the ANC at the ANC offices? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I had …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do have your own office? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I was one of the officials, I was one 
of the top five.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You were fulltime actually, is that 
right?  Oh no, you were not fulltime. 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   But I was one of the top five 
officials of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in the province. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   In the provincial offices of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   You can still see them now, right 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay and what is the procedure for 
donations in the ANC?  When you receive a donation what 
is expected of you in terms of processing it and how – who 
20 
may use it, who may not use it, what do you do with it? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, I am not sure, I cannot speak 
for now, Mr Chairman, because I have been out of the 
[indistinct] of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 63 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Since June 2008.  I can only speak 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   About that. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   For that particular period when I 
was treasurer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [indistinct] of the ANC, empowered, 
that the treasurer should the one who is doing fundraising.  
He should see to it that resources of the organisation are 
maintained.  Of course, the one compounding factor in this 
10 
particular instance, Mr Chairman, was the fact that we 
were already left with nine days before the provincial 
conference which was due to take place on the 20 t h to 22 n d 
June 2008 and hence therefore, we already were swamped 
by the needs for us to be able to actually pay for 
conference, the costs associated with the hosting of the 
conference. Hence we took a decision, I took decision 
there as provincial treasurer that we would then actually be 
able to use the money in paying some of the costs that 
were associated with the preparation of the provincial 
20 
conference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is what you did but what was 
the procedure, the official procedure.  Was there not a 
procedure to the effect that if you receive a donation, for 
example, you must issue a receipt, you must have it 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 64 of 140 
 
banked, deposited in the ANC’s account before it can be 
used?  Was there not such a procedure? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, let me say, Mr Chairman, at 
the time – I maybe actually speak out of recollection, I 
cannot all of the exact details but what I knew for myself 
that I needed to report, for instance, that I have received 
donation and that was needed to be part of the report that 
goes to the structures of the movement of the ANC so that 
I can confirm that money has been received and we can 
use the money, how we would use the money so that we 
10 
can properly account, both to the relative committee of the 
ANC at the time, in particular the provincial executive 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your answer that you do not know 
or you cannot remember what procedure, if any, was in 
place in the ANC as to what should be done when a 
member of the ANC or a leader of the ANC receives 
donations mean for the ANC?  Is that what you are saying? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   What I am say, I cannot recall the 
nitty gritties of what procedures may have been there.  
20 
However, will say, Mr Chairman, I stated that there was an 
obligation for one to report to the structures once you have 
been able to received money for donations and that is what 
I actually duly did, that at the time reporting  receiving 
these disbursements, we then duly reported. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 65 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  And when you 
say that you had to report to the structures, precisely what 
do you mean, who are the individuals who occupied those 
or what are the structures and who are the individuals that 
you have to report to? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   We had to the report to the 
provincial executive committee, the PEC.  But in this 
particular instance because already the PEC term was at 
its tail end, we had actually then reported as part of the 
10 
treasurer ’s report to the provincial conference.  Hence in 
the letter from the attorneys, my lawyers on the 2 October 
2010, they clearly indicate that this was also reported as 
part of the globular monies donation that had been raised 
that totalled around about 7.2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course you concede, would you not, 
that it would not be an acceptable way of doing things on 
behalf of any organisation to say any member who receives 
donations means for the organisation may begin to use that 
donation before it is recorded in the books of the 
20 
organisation even if he is using it for the organisation.  
Would you not concede that that would not be generally 
speaking an acceptable way because otherwise if you are 
going to do that and Mr Dlamini is going to do that, Mr 
Msomi is going to do that, it is just going to be chaos, you 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 66 of 140 
 
know, everybody can receive money and they do not submit 
it to official processes of the organisation in terms of 
receipt and to make sure there are records.  Anything can 
happen.  So it cannot be an acceptable way, generally 
speaking, would you accept that? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Chairman, I think the truth of the 
versions now I respectfully wish to raise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   The fact, Chairman, is that at the 
time 
I 
was 
the 
authorised 
person 
as 
the 
provincial 
10 
treasurer of the ANC to be the one that should actually 
have authority over the utilisation of the resources of the 
organisation.  Of course I am not saying that it would have 
been a responsibility entirely for the individual but for the 
office. 
 
Secondly, Chairman, with the benefit of hindsight 
we can all make various conclusions of how we could have 
done this better of differently than this or that one.  I think 
on that point, Mr Chairman, it becomes a matter of saying 
with the after effects what differently could we have done 
20 
differently at the time.  But, as I say, we did actually even 
at that time meet what one may say would have been the 
minimum requirements of ensuring that the report is able to 
be given to the structures of the organisation.  Of course 
suffice to say with the benefit of hindsight you can come to 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 67 of 140 
 
any different conclusion that you could have done this 
differently or that way. Mr Chairman.  I think that is open, 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, part of this is just to determine 
whether you accept that whatever the position may be, it is 
not the way one would expect a big organisation, such as 
the ANC, it is not the way one would expect how it would 
deal with monies that it receives or even donations – and 
this is a big amount, you know?  I do not know whether you 
might say well, R1 million is not big in the ANC, so it is not 
10 
a big amount but it is a big amount, it is unlike somebody 
maybe who says here is R50 I am donating to the ANC and 
somebody says go and buy x, y, z.  It is a big amount and 
therefore one would expect that a responsible organisation 
would have a procedure that says if you received donations 
on behalf of the organisation, what you are required to do 
is put the money, get the money deposited into the account 
of the organisation so that there is a record, an official 
record that it was received and then it can then be used 
after that, it was received and put into the bank account 
20 
and then it can be used after that but at least there is an 
official receipt.  You would accept that, I would imagine? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, yes, I do accept it, Mr 
Chairman, because at that stage we did receive that, that 
was a donation. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 68 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   We do have of course have 
deposited them so that we can ensure we use them.  In 
this particular case, Mr Chairman, I will only make one 
caveat though to say [indistinct] because at that particular 
instance we were facing the pressure of expenditure that 
needed to be disbursed for the purposes of – for a 
conference which was nine days away.  We may then have 
responded to that pressure but I think the procedure that 
the ANC had, the procedure that the ANC had, the 
10 
procedures that they had before, there was one and I am 
not saying there was not, and therefore, in that regard, Mr 
Chairman, that were processes that we actually ordinarily 
followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I wanted to say, you know, 
because when you talk about an organisation such as the 
ANC, you are not talking about some spaza shop.  There 
would be …[intervenes] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I would be [indistinct] on that one.  
And it is not even saying in terms of a million rand, it is a 
20 
small amount of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   What I am saying, Chairman, we 
may have acted with the pressures of the time because of, 
as I say, that we already had got expenditures that needed 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 69 of 140 
 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
the 
preparations 
of 
the 
impending 
conference that was that was due to take place on the 20 t h 
to the 22nd of June 2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also when you talk about the 
pressures of the time the other issue that arises is this is 
not like a situation where you are Provincial Treasurer of 
the ANC in Kwazulu-Natal and this donation is being given 
to you when you are in Limpopo for a weekend or 
something, it is being given to you at the ANC offices.  So 
why can you not get it received and deposited properly 
10 
even if there are pressures because it is just the following 
day or – and it is cash the following day or two days, 
should be available for the ANC to use.  So unlike if you 
receive it when you are far away and have to travel but you 
are at the offices where whatever you may need to do is 
there and should be available.  You understand that? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   No, no, no, I do understand the 
Chairman, but as I say at the time one’s mind was the base 
that we needed that to be able to ensure that now that we 
need to respond to these expenditure pressures we have, 
20 
let us be able to therefore use the money to be able to pay 
some of the things already that we are outstanding which 
actually needed to be paid for upfront so – but the points 
you are raising, Mr Chairman, I think with the benefit of 
hindsight it is taken into cognisance, it is [inaudible – 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 70 of 140 
 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now if I recall 
correctly, you were the Kwazulu-Natal MEC for Local 
Government and Traditional Affairs, is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you were also the Kwazulu-Natal 
Provincial Treasurer for the ANC. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if I understand correct – well, let 
10 
me just understand this.  What were your qualifications? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   In terms of what? 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Did 
you 
have 
any 
tertiary 
qualifications, 
did 
you 
have 
any 
professional 
qualifications? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I do, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Which is what? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I told an honours degree in 
management, I also hold a post-graduate Diploma in 
Business Management and I have a number of certificates 
20 
which I do not think it is relevant for the purposes of 
today’s proceedings. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now at the time that you were the MEC 
and at the time that you were the Provincial Treasurer, did 
you hold these qualifications, the honours in Management 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 71 of 140 
 
and the post-graduate diploma in management? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I did. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, I mean, you would obviously 
understand the importance, no doubt, of keeping proper 
records for financial purposes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I think the points that the Chair has 
canvassed 
with 
me 
and 
I 
have 
actually 
made 
an 
observation 
on 
that 
point, 
Mr 
Chairman, 
therefore 
I 
respectfully say, Mr Chairman, the points you have raised 
with me is the same points which I have accepted anyway, 
10 
with the benefit of hindsight.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, the only point I am getting to or 
the only point that I wish to make about this is that it would 
strike me as not being an issue of hindsight, you had the 
qualifications at the time when you were doing these 
things. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Mr Chairman, the point I am raising, 
without 
getting 
into 
an 
argument 
with 
counsel, 
Mr 
Chairman, I have said – I have explained the position at 
20 
the time and with all due respect, Mr Chairman, I do not 
think I need to be able to belabour the point once more. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Let’s – pardon, Chairperson, my 
apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine, that is fine, that 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 72 of 140 
 
is fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  If we could move on then.  
Insofar as the  - to the extent, as I have confirmed, if I 
understand correctly, your testimony is that you used the 
money from the R1 million for the purpose of paying for the 
expenses for the upcoming ANC conference, the provincial 
conference that was coming up, is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is precisely so, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And where are the records in relation 
to those expenses? 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   They are in the ANC, Chairman, 
because the ANC would know the expenses.  Now treasurer 
ever takes when you leave office and take the records of 
the organisation away. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the position be that when you say 
they are in the ANC, would the position be that there would 
be distinct documentation that relates to payments that you 
made using that donation or is the position that one will 
never be able to say these payments came from that 
20 
donation, 
these 
other 
payments 
came 
from 
other 
donations?  What would be the position? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I am not in a position to be able to 
make those kinds of clear decisions, Chairman, as I appear 
now.  As I say, what one did at the time was to be able to 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 73 of 140 
 
ensure that in one’s report to the council(?) where I stand 
as the provincial treasurer and I was not elected back into 
the very committee, it was to report and therefore having 
reported then of course the organisation would have then 
been able to deal with those matters going forward but 
there is those – the details of those would not be within my 
purview as I speak right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when – after you had received the 
donation at the offices of the ANC after Mr Shabalala 
handed over the cash, did you keep the cash with you until 
10 
you gave it out to pay or you gave somebody to pay or was 
the cash kept with somebody else for some time before it 
was used to make payments? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   As I recall, Mr Chairman, today I am 
now speaking out of memory in terms of having to recall all 
those finer details, I would say, Chairman, as I recall the 
money [indistinct] I think one practice in the ANC office, in 
the safe in the ANC office.   But I cannot recall now the 
details of the actual expenditure because I think I cannot 
be able to recall that but it was, you know, not – yes, it 
20 
would not have been me would be sitting down and dealing 
with this and that and paying that but it is a matter of 
memory on how it would have been done but I would have 
actually made resources available for the payment of those 
pressing expenditure at the time. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 74 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be – would that have been a 
safe in the ANC where you would have put it after 
receiving it or when you say – ja, when you say you would 
have put it – placed it in the ANC …[intervenes] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   As I recall there was a safe but it 
was – yes, it was not one of those built in, almost vault 
safe but it was - there was a safe that was there at the 
time in the office of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And …[intervenes] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Not only that, it 25.10 when you 
10 
received it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Because  there was, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you would have kept the key 
or somebody else would have kept the safe key? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, at the time I would have 
actually been able to have access to the safe and either 
[indistinct] or the bookkeeper that would have been the 
person that I work with but I think I would have actually 
either had the access to the safe, as my memory – as I 
20 
recollect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you have a recollection as to 
how long you might have kept in the safe before starting to 
have it used to make payments or authorising somebody to 
take from it to make payments? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 75 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I honestly cannot remember, Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Except to say – I am saying we 
were nine days away from the provincial conference and 
therefore this pressure that we needed to actually be able 
to ensure that we start paying for some of the very 
outstanding preparatory expenditure that was required for 
the conference, so that would have actually been done so 
how long they would have kept it, I really do not recall, Mr 
10 
Chairman, but I think, as I say, there was already an 
existing pressure to ensure that actually we start paying 
for the conference activities(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said you did not issue a receipt 
to Mr Shabalala when you got the money? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   No, no, I did not, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That I think – I do not remember 
issuing, that is why I even went back after the [indistinct] 
and I could not recall issuing any receipt to Mr Shabalala. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you say you accept or did you 
say you are not sure whether the policies or procedures of 
the ANC required you to issue a receipt for a legitimate 
donation being made by somebody to the organisation? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I said, Mr Chairman, I do not 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 76 of 140 
 
remember all of that nuances regarding the policies of the 
time, save to say there was a policy that [indistinct] that 
required one that you actually needed to be able to report 
to the structure of the organisation if you received any 
funds on behalf of the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course you – at this time you were – 
you said your term was coming to an end, your term of 
office as Treasurer, is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Because the conference that you 
10 
were busy preparing for was a conference where there was 
going to be an election of office bearers, is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one would think that you would have 
over the period of your term of office, over your term of 
office you would have received many donations from 
people.  Would that be correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And some of those would have 
been cash or most of them or all of them?  Do you recall 
20 
normally what – how people donated to the ANC.  Was it 
normal to give cash or was it not normal? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, it was back then, Mr 
Chairman, each of the receiving – making donations  
occurred was a normal feature.  Of course, though you 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 77 of 140 
 
would have others being able to then [indistinct] making 
money into – making money into the ANC sub-regional 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   But I think it was common that you 
would actually get people donating in cash back then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And I guess cash even in large 
amounts such as hundreds of thousands rands or even a 
million or more?  So, in other words, when you say it was 
common, in terms of amounts it sometimes it was amounts 
10 
that were in cash or – or what was the position?   I just 
want to see whether R1million in cash ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I always ...[indistinct – mic off] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I will simply be speculating 
Chairman if I say I can recall over what period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Then I will tell you, and say how 
much, I would only be speculating ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I would have thought, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of the issuing of receipts in 
regards to those other cash donations.   Where - did you 
issue receipts in regard to others?  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I may have to recall Chairman, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 78 of 140 
 
when I say honestly, as I say, I cannot recall whether in all 
others or with others if there were or that I am saying, 
some would come in and if they come in without me being 
there of course the officials that were there would be able 
to receive information.  
But as I say, the requirement is that if they would 
have been a procedure, I just cannot follow the detail of 
the procedure of the time but there would have been a 
procedure 
that 
would 
have 
been 
operational 
at 
that 
particular time.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair, and as the 
treasurer 
for 
the 
ANC, 
presumably, 
one 
of 
your 
responsibilities 
would 
have 
included 
ensuring 
that…[intervene] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Sorry, Mr Chairman I am just 
struggling with the camera here.  I am not sure whether my 
attorney just can assist me before the question is asked, 
so the camera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you cannot see us or what? 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I cannot.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay well, maybe the technicians 
this side could assist.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   If you would allow them to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if they can assist, that's fine they 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 79 of 140 
 
may do so.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Oh, so I am being advised that it 
may be probably on the other side, at the Commission side.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, the technicians will - somebody 
is talking to the technicians, you must just tell us when you 
are able to see us, but you can hear us.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I can hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, maybe what we should do is 
in the interest of time, is let us continue, even though you 
do not see us as long as you hear us because we can hear 
10 
you to and you will let us know when you can see us.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Of course Chairman, I will so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Mr. Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now what I was 
suggesting, or rather inquiring about is whether amongst 
your duties as the treasurer was the responsibility to 
ensure that the annual financial statements were prepared 
by the relevant auditors for the ANC. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   It was, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now over the years, that was - you 
20 
came into office as the ANC Treasurer, KwaZulu Natal 
Treasurer in 1998, you left office in 2008.  So during that 
period of time, you would have been responsible for 
ensuring that all the annual financial statements were – or 
rather the responsibility for the preparation of the financial 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 80 of 140 
 
statements was handed over to the relevant auditors, is 
that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you would obviously appreciate, 
given your management - your background, as with a 
postgraduate degree in management, and an honours 
degree in management.  You would appreciate of course, 
that it would be vital for them to have a record of all 
documentation to be able to give a fair reflection of the 
financial statements, correct? 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Just repeat the question again? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In order for the auditors to conduct a 
proper audit to prepare annual financial statements and to 
properly or fairly reflect the affairs – and I am talking 
specifically the financial affairs of the ANC in KwaZulu 
Natal, they need proper records for that purpose, correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if they do not have proper records, 
they cannot present their audit report fairly, is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, if I can once again refer you 
to…[intervene] 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU:   Sorry Mr Hulley before you 
continue.  Chairman I now can see you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can see us, okay, alright, thank you.  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 81 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Although the picture is not bright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it’s not clear oh okay, maybe it is 
going to improve the technicians hear what we are saying, 
Mr Mabuyakhulu can see us but the picture is not as clear 
as it should be, okay alright.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, of course, the other point Mr 
Mabuyakhulu would be that if donations are not recorded 
and there are no official records of the donations in the 
organisation.  The organisation - there might be difficulty 
10 
in paying tax on those donations, is it not?  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well my understanding, I am not 
sure Mr Chairman I will ask to be advised on this element.  
That 
the 
ANC 
was 
really 
start 
as 
a 
non-taxpaying 
organisation at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I am - what the situation may have 
been done so I think the issue of tax, paying of taxation 
with regard would not come to being paid but I still would 
want to take counsel on that aspects.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Hulley, you want to take it from 
there.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  If you could turn 
with me to Bundle RR4 at page 1849. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   14? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 82 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   1849. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I am at 18, 
RR4 1849. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Now, 
these 
are 
the 
financial 
statements, the ANC’s annual financial statements for the 
year ending 31 March 2009. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if I understand correctly, or the 
10 
auditors 
who 
are 
Manasi 
and 
Associates, 
chartered 
accountants and auditors.  They reflect the income of the 
ANC - or if you turn with me to page 1853. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   For the year ending 31 March 2009 to 
be R7,277,706, do you see that? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, if I understand correctly from the 
letter from Ngubane Wills Incorporated, that we referred to 
earlier on in your testimony, the figure of R1million would 
20 
have been captured in this figure of income, is that 
correct? It was part of this globular amount.  Is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And that was based on an instruction. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Even though, let me put a caveat 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 83 of 140 
 
here as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   At the time when these financial 
statements were made, I was no longer provincial treasurer 
but I think the point raises, I take. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And when you give that caveat, I am 
just trying to understand why you provide the caveat.  Are 
you saying - is there anything about those figures that you 
disagree with?  Obviously, you were not responsible 
10 
because - you were not responsible for the way in which it 
was prepared because you were no longer the treasurer.  
But subject to that, is there something - is there some 
criticism, as it were, that you have of those financial 
statements? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   No, no, I am just placing for the 
record for the benefit of the Commission and Chair that at 
the time when those financial statements were concluded, 
were finalised, I was no longer treasure, I was no longer in 
the office of the provincial treasurer. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now I would like us to go back if we 
could to Bundle LEA27. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Bundle LEA27 on both le a 27 and 
specifically, to the affidavit that you deposed to in 2010, I 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 84 of 140 
 
would like you to turn to page 28 of that bundle.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you say there at paragraph 12.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is the page number? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me Mr Chair, autumn it is page 
28.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and the? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And it is paragraph 12.2.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You say: 
10 
“I seize to be the provincial treasurer of the ANC 
immediately after the election of the new provincial 
treasurer during the during June 2008 conference.  
I therefore was not responsible for the way that 
these were cheated in the next financial statements, 
which was prepared sometime after March of the 
following 
year. 
 
For 
that 
reason, 
I 
cannot 
specifically say if the donation was included, in the 
Treasury Report to the Provincial General Council 
or in the globular amount of R7,227,707 listed as a 
20 
donation in the income statement.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I do see that, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, I am trying to reconcile that, with 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 85 of 140 
 
what was conveyed by your attorney on your instructions, 
in 
paragraph 
7, 
of 
the 
letter 
by 
Ngubane 
Wills 
Incorporated, would you turn your…[intervene] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   What I said Mr Chairman, I said 
earlier, is that I gave the report to conference on 
information and the issue of that in the actual financial 
statements would have been treated primarily, when the 
financial 
statements 
were 
put 
together 
would 
have 
happened when I was no longer in office.  
I think that is a context Chair, is given there in 
10 
firstly to Well, isn't the position that whatever the auditor's 
in 12.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well is it not the position that whatever 
the auditors would have looked at would have been money 
that had been receipted in the organisation in terms of 
what they work with, they would have - they would not have 
taken into account money that never officially came into 
the books of the organisation and the accounts of the 
organisation, is it not? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I do not know how the auditors 
20 
would have dealt with it in this particular case, however, in 
my mind Chairman the clear methods here is that there was 
an expenditure on the items that we have to pay for, for the 
organisation that were paid for and that those would have 
been part, not only of the treasurer but that would have 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 86 of 140 
 
been part of the expenditure writer that management spend 
on behalf of the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So after the money had been spent, 
would you have taken the trouble to make sure that all the 
receipts that are related to payments made from this 
money that you knew had not been officially receipted were 
preserved and were known to say these receipts relates 
this donation that will not be reflected in the books of and 
the account of the organisation, would you have taken 
trouble to do that or that would not have been done?  
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, Mr Chairman in this particular 
instance, as I correctly actually indicated to the Chair and 
the 
Commission 
is 
that 
the 
details 
of 
capturing 
expenditure, 
excuse 
me 
post 
conference 
would 
have 
happened after I vacated office.  So the question of, how it 
would have been treated but as I say, I do not doubt that 
they would have been reported because expenditure was 
incurred but I would not be able to simply say, I would have 
done 1,2,3 when I was no longer in office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what it was talking about prior to the 
20 
conference, I assume that the money was dispersed as you 
put it, prior to the actual conference taking place.  But 
maybe you mean that, even during the conference, but if it 
was used, and since you knew that it had not been 
officially receipted I can imagine that it would have been 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 87 of 140 
 
possible to say, you know what, because this money has 
not been receipted at least we must make sure that 
receipts that relates to payments that come from it are 
preserved and put aside. 
But I am looking at before the conference started, 
obviously, after the conference, you might not - you would 
not have been part of the PEC, I guess or you would not 
have been part of the top five in the province, there would 
have been another treasurer.  
But I am wondering whether you would not still be 
10 
concerned to say, you know, there is this money that has 
been used, and maybe I should even tell the incoming 
treasurer about this money, and I must make sure that 
officials, well by officials I mean, the staff in the ANC, who 
deal with money, they put these receipts aside so that I 
can account properly for that amount.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   There was an official handover 
process Mr Chairman, to the incoming provincial treasurer.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   And as I say there was a process, 
20 
in fact of actually identifying those expenditure items, 
because they had been given expense items that were not 
directly paying for it, the bank account of the ANC at the 
time had actually been paid through those donations., 
okay. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 88 of 140 
 
And it is a point that I think, that the bookkeeper in 
his affidavit makes the point that he actually does concede 
that there were actually payments that were made, and it is 
not actually done through the account of the ANC but they 
were done through these donations.  
And I think that information ordinarily in terms of 
major expenditure items, would have been the money 
incurred for – was of course actually known and available 
plus it is just a matter - for the only thing for the 
information of the provincial treasurer but there was of 
10 
course a handover process that identified all of the 
donations and other things that is in place.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. Now, you have 
referred to an incoming official, and you refer to a 
bookkeeper, is this one and the same person or are these 
two different people? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I am referring to the incoming 
provincial treasurer as an official of the ANC. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, who is that person do you recall? 
20 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
It 
was 
Madam 
Mthandeni 
Dlungwane who became the provincial treasurer at the 
time.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And who was the bookkeeper that you 
were referring to, who gave an affidavit or a statement? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 89 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   The bookkeeper was Mr   as to who 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Who? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it Mr Delani Mzila? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Delani Mzila.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Delani Mzila, ja okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay, now can you turn with me if you 
do not mind to Bundle RR4 that is the letter of Ngubane 
Wills, and I want you to turn to page 1842. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Ngubane Wills, yes page 142. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 1842, so it is the second page of 
10 
the letter from Ngubane Wills Incorporated. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That we referred to earlier.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now in that letter you see that 
paragraph or rather they see that paragraph 7 are the 
instructions from you: 
“Although our client wishes to be helpful in this 
matter, however, we are instructed to place on 
record, Mr Mabuyakhulu resolute stance and that of 
the ANC as well, that under no circumstances does 
20 
the organisation wish to compromise its donors and 
or 
its 
operations 
by 
disclosing 
information 
concerning same.” 
Now let me understand about this policy, when you do not 
wish to compromise the donors.  Is this the identity of the 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 90 of 140 
 
donors?  Is it a secret, not only from the public at large, 
but also from the other ANC members as well? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Mr Chairman we must speak in 
terms of, at the time we are speaking of.  That is why 
earlier on in my opening statement, I made the point that 
at the time, there was absolutely no requirement or no 
policy that required us to be able to reveal the donors and 
donors would elect, whether they wanted to be known or 
not known.  
It was a choice the donor had to do and there was 
10 
absolutely no legal requirement for donors to be made 
known to anybody other than if there was any insight with 
the ANC.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, I am just trying to understand 
what was the policy, did the policy include keeping it a 
secret, also from the rest of the ANC as well?  That is my 
only question, I want to know how far that policy went. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Mr Chairman, it is that if there was 
a need to know of information within the ANC that 
information was made available to those who needed to 
20 
have legitimate reason to know.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why was it necessary to make that point 
in paragraph 7 of that letter?  That is now the point that Mr 
Hulley has asked you about, why was it necessary to make 
that point in this letter because in this letter, that Mr 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 91 of 140 
 
Shabalala was the one who were giving you the R1million 
was disclosed.  
So 
this 
letter 
says 
in 
paragraph 
4, 
that 
the 
R1million donation given by Mr Shabalala was used as part 
of a package of donations received in the run up to the 
ANC KZN provincial conference. So the question - and then 
in paragraph 7 the letter says: 
“Although our client wishes to be helpful in this 
matter, however, we are instructed to place on 
record, Mr Mabuyakhulu’s resolute stance and that 
10 
of the ANC as well, that under no circumstances 
does 
the 
organisation 
wish 
to 
compromise 
its 
donors and its operations by disclosing information 
concerning the same.” 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, Mr Chairman, you are 
speaking to a laymen and when you give instructions you 
do not see the client that you have to say constructive 
word for word, such presumption Mr Chairman will be 
taking that stance to another level.  
However, let me give the spirit of the import of that 
20 
as I understood it, that was just to place on record a 
matter of principle of how we believed at the time that we 
needed to have an obligation to also protect the donors 
that I have indicated earlier Mr Chairman that were 
instances where the donors did not want to be revealed 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 92 of 140 
 
and there was absolutely no policy or legal planning for 
that to happen.  
And I guess therefore, what these paragraphs 
actually attempted to do in paragraph 7 was too makes – 
and the reason why I say so Mr Chairman is that it is not 
making specific requests to the matter where you say in 
paragraph 4 which has been said but it was also just to 
state for the record here in terms of principle, that is how I 
read and understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, when I read it seems to me to 
10 
give rise to an understanding that you and the ANC when 
Ngubane Wills Incorporated attend to clients did not want 
to disclose the identity of the donor that is why the letter 
says both of you were resolute, I think that is the word 
used if I am not mistaken.   
Resolute, that under no circumstances will you 
disclose the identity disclose or compromise the donors 
and 
operation. 
 
So 
one 
stays 
- 
but 
if 
you 
your 
understanding was that Mr Shabalala was the one who was 
giving the donation. You had already disclosed him in the 
20 
letter there would be no need to put this paragraph.  But if 
your understanding was that, Mr Shabalala was not the 
donor he was just the caveat then one would understand 
why you would emphasise that point, do you understand 
the reasoning? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 93 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I understand it Chair, but I beg to 
differ.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, by all means, but I just want you 
to - I want to give you a chance to deal with that 
understanding to say, maybe you say you understand it 
differently and these are the reasons and you can say, 
here are the reasons why one should not understand it the 
way I am understanding it.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Here is the reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Him. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   The point or the first of all, the first 
point that we make under paragraph 4 as you have 
correctly mentioned that, who was the donor of R1million?  
Had we concealed that we would not be able to venture 
that 
upfront. 
So 
I 
therefore 
say 
Mr 
Chairman, 
that 
statement Mr Chairman had is negated by the fact that 
under 4 we do state who the donor is.  The second element 
is if you read it under 7 and I respectfully say MR 
20 
Chairman, is the reading of a laymen is that it is couched 
in such generalities that it is not specifically talking about 
the donor, it is talking about donors or each operation 
which is now in fact a generality that has expressed a 
presupposition and that is how I actually say Mr Chairman, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 94 of 140 
 
my understanding at the time and it is my understanding 
that was simply to convey a principled position.  
But in having been accepted that in this particular 
case, we had already are able to disclose who the donor 
was.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I must hasten to say you do 
not say expressly, that Mr Shabalala was the donor.  What 
you do say is the donation was given by him of course, he 
could give the donation if it came from him, but also he 
could give the donation if he was simply a caveat.  You 
10 
would accept that, is it not?  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, I would accept that, Mr 
Chairman however, the truth that I actually said yes which I 
want to say it right Mr Chairman, is the fact that I do not 
know of any other person other than Mr Shabalala and I 
never asked Mr Shabalala whether this money comes from 
him or it is raised from anybody else.  So I see, so that is 
the factual situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course when you put it like that it – it 
follows that then you cannot say Mr Shabalala was the 
20 
donor. All you can say is he gave you the  donation but 
whether he was donating it himself or he was just a conduit 
you cannot say.  Would you agree with that? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Well I agree with that Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 95 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  That is why I need 00:00:35 in saying 
that he will come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  That you received the donation from 
Shabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  And he cannot go beyond that Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Conger up something that is not 
10 
based on any facts or logic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Then if we 
continue with that paragraph 7 you go on to say or at least 
the attorney’s gone to say but save to say that the particular 
donation was included in the report to the conference in the 
Treasurer’s Report specifically it was included in the 
Globular amount of R7 227 707.00 listed as donation in the 
income statement.   
 
Now we know from your affidavit that you gave in 
20 
October of 2010 you said  
“I cannot specifically say if the donation was 
included in the Treasurer’s Report to the 
provincial general council or in the globular 
amount of R7 227 707.00 listed as a donation 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 96 of 140 
 
in the income statement.” 
 
So I am trying to understand the conflict between the 
instructions that you have given to the attorneys and that the 
attorneys have conveyed to Ms O’Brien and the statement 
that you have given in your affidavit they clearly two 
different statements.  In fact they are in direct conflict. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Let me attempt to be able to clarify 
matters Mr Chairman as I understand them.  The first matter 
there is a report that was presented by myself to conference 
which the report say that it was included in the report to the 
10 
conference in the Treasurer’s Report.   
 
Now which I gave that report to conference.  And the 
second element is then dealing with why then the report 
would have been 00:02:35 cause conflict meaning the PEC. 
 
The PEC 00:02:30 conference commercial conference 
anymore it is a provincial general council that would have 
taken later – either later in the year or in the following year 
and therefore that is where the matter I think would have 
been muddled in the writing.   
But I think it is attempting to explain the two things 
20 
firstly that it would have been part of the report to 
conference but then because you then dealing with the 
report of the PEC or the financial statement that are 
processed after one have left office.   
I think that was the issue that even there when you 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 97 of 140 
 
say that maybe there would have been clarified a little bit 
more by those who wrote the letter but I think the point of 
departure is the attempt was to try and distinguish between 
the provincial conference, the PEC and the treatment of the 
financial annual financial statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – so you say that in the Treasurer’s 
Report to conference – to the provincial conference that was 
this donation was included.  Is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes if I remember very well Mr 
Chairman it would have been included as part of the – the 
10 
sum of the other monies that have been raised because it 
was not about raising one donation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  So I – the letter would have said that 
it had been part of those monies that were raised.  That is 
where I can simply say whether then the – the – we can 
argue about whether the actual amount was R7.2 at the time 
I cannot recall all of that now but I think there was the report 
to conference that listed by me in the donation bag then I am 
saying it was part of the global amount of the donation that 
20 
one have reported to conference.  
But reporting to conference is just by one.  You then 
need to then treat it into the subsequent reports which is the 
PEC – the reports of the PEC and the provincial general 
council 
and 
the 
financial 
annual 
financial 
statements.  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 98 of 140 
 
00:04:48 try to clarify the distinction between those elements 
to some of them occurred when I was no longer in office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So in the Treasurer’s Report when 
you say you think it was included you do not sound very 
definitive and maybe one should understand that.   
But would it – would the report have made it clear 
that you were talking about a particular donation of R1 
million because I think if you just mentioned a globular 
amount I am not sure that the report can be said to have – to 
have made it clear that you were reporting that you received 
10 
some – this donation? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I have the matter of practice Mr 
Chairman for the benefit and my attorney 00:05:54. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I never went to conference and to – 
donations from individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  We never did that because the day 
that – we never went itemised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  In the public records of – made to and 
from individuals or from companies.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Because that 00:06:12 would have 
easy lead find its way into the … 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 99 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  And that is why we also build the 
00:06:22 in the globular amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Even if you 00:06:25 so we never then 
identify donor A, donor B, donor C and therefore… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Identify them we would not do that Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay so when you say you – it was 
10 
included is it correct that all that you are saying is the 
globular amount that conference was told about of donations. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of donations that were received included it 
in the calculation. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was part – it was calculated but there 
was – there would have been nothing in the report that 
specifically indicates that there is this particular donation.  It 
would just be part of donations received. 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  That is how Mr Chairman we always 
treated donations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  And in my tenure I never actually ever 
put a report that itemised the donations. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 100 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Nor either my predecessor that 
actually (talking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Yes.  So – so if you had received 
various donations from different sources including this one 
you would simply calcu – add them up and then say in the 
report we received like R100 million donations which one 
came from whom and how it came nobody would know that.  
Is that correct in terms of the report? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  No Chairman that – we would have 
10 
received the R100 million and I do not remember ever seeing 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us say R10 million. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  What we will do Mr Chairman we 
would do a 00:08:22 and say but we would then take a report 
and then we would share that report with the leadership in 
terms of the finance committee and provincial because at 
that level you are able to share information.   
And I must indicate to you Chairman that there was 
always 
positivity around the 
protection of the donors 
20 
because if I say some used to express you indicate that they 
would not want to be made known published and there would 
be those donors that would make themselves available in 
that instance we would then be able to ensure that we – we 
therefore acknowledge them and therefore we actually write 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 101 of 140 
 
letters to – of acknowledgement to them but that would only 
happen to those donors that do not have the difficulty but 
even in those instances we would not see it and then in a 
meeting with the  3000 or 4000 people and therefore 
00:09:30 yourself presenting the Treasurer’s financial report 
which itemises all of the donors because we never did that 
individually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at twenty – nearly twenty five to 
10 
eight I think we should try and see whether we can finish by 
eight. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course you need to deal with the – 
put questions – such questions as you wish to put to Mr 
Mabuyakhulu in regard to the issue he raises of the leak 
between the donation given to him by Mr Shabalala and the 
donation given to Khobone and Shezi Attorneys by Intaka 
Group. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair I will in fact conclude 
20 
with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now – so if I understand what you saying 
correctly the – in essence and I am not saying that this is 
necessarily what occurred as a fact but the reality is the 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 102 of 140 
 
validity of an – of the record the Treasurer’s Report is 
dependent 
entirely 
upon 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
relevant 
treasurer.  In truth the Treasurer could have received 20 or 
30 million more but nobody would know that on the ANC 
because it is simply not recorded in the books.  Everything is 
given as a globular sum.  Would that be a fair statement? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I (speaking over one another) Mr 
Hulley on that issue Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Even though I do not agree. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I – I ja just start afresh giving 
your answer Mr Mabuyakhulu.  You were speaking softly I 
could not hear. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I am saying – oh sorry Mr Chairman.  I 
am saying Mr Chairman I do not necessarily agree with the 
proposition made precisely because that proposition does 
not recognise the fact that I said Mr Chairman that there 
structures that will legitimately be taken into conference on 
the donation made by the organisation and therefore even if 
you were not actually giving to the whole of the – the 
20 
structures under the membership would mean many people 
but you would have actually of course been able to take 
00:12:05 confidence your colleagues that you serve with 
particularly in the provincial executive committee and I am 
meaning here in the officials as well as in the finance 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 103 of 140 
 
committee that you would be able to then actually then brief 
them in that regard.   
So it is not necessary that it would be simply if I put 
it only on the good will of the Treasurer no I do not – I do not 
necessarily agree with that assertion. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well if I – perhaps I have misunderstood 
then.  My understanding is that when you take them into the 
– into your conference you would give them – you would give 
them information of the globular figure of what was received 
unless I misunderstood that.   
10 
So you giving – you telling them that an amount of in 
this case R7. Odd million was received and that includes all 
the donors they are not itemised though each donor is not 
itemised. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes for the purposes of the report that 
would go to the conference you would not be able to actually 
itemise those donors and we did not do it at the time. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am talking about the reports to the 
structures – the structures of which you speak. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Sorry. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am talking about the report to the 
structures – the people that you have taken to your 
conference. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I am saying Mr Chairman you would of 
course have the people that you serve within the officials 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 104 of 140 
 
that you would actually be able to report to them that we are 
actually working on these matters or we are 00:13:46 these 
donors because the Treasurer although he is the Treasurer 
in terms of the constitution 00:13:55 but also he served you 
together with other officials.   
So the point I am raising – making there to the 
distinction between going to a meeting with a number of 
comrades or leaders when you could actually then report on 
the details because those details would easily find their way 
outside of the ranks of the organisation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I think the – Mr Hulley’s question is 
whether when you tell official let us say the provincial 
executive committee of the – of which you would have been 
part whether as Treasurer whether  
1. Though they are some of the people that you would tell 
about that you would tell about this – this kind – about 
donations number 1 in confidence. 
2. Whether when you tell them you would give details or 
whether you would simply still say you know we have 
received R7million in terms of all the donations or 
20 
whether you would give more details.  
That is what he is asking – when you speak to those that are 
your colleagues serving for example in the PEC or the Top 5. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Well I (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the Top 5 maybe not the PEC. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 105 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Top 5 ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I am (inaudible) that Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Of course the sharing information with 
the Top 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  But in – not necessarily share that 
information with a (inaudible) because when you prepare 
those statements – financial – you will not prepare your 
10 
report for instance you would have to be able to then tell 
your Top 5 on grounds those officials that is to report.   
So they will be able to indicate some of the things 
and as I said Chair I said earlier they could then be 
questioned that even others would ask at that level everyone 
I think would be in 00:16:14 because of the – the level of – 
at the Top 5 level let me say it that way they would be 
therefore entitled to ask questions the way there must be 
questions of clarify then we would explain to them how are 
we dealing with these issues of donations.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you disclose the identity of the 
donors to the Top 5 or you have not disclosed even to them? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  (talking over one another) unless 
there was a question we would not have said it just go there 
but if the Top 5 wanted to ask who is 00:16:52 in these 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 106 of 140 
 
donors then – then you would know it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Because you would actually be able to 
do it but we worked on the basis of being able to account to 
one another but also to report to one another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But that report to the Top 5 would not 
be in writing or would it – or would it be in writing? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Normally what 00:17:21 happens 
because these are the official meetings.  You would actually 
be able to then say when you are preparing your report that 
10 
you are going to be taking then you therefore share that 
report with the officials.   
In that instance and if there are questions it normally 
would be they would want to – be actually sharing with them 
what I am going to report on so that everybody then is part 
of that process of the official would.  If they ask questions 
you then answer on the report.  And you can give them no 
details which ordinarily would not actually be able to give the 
details to the others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the report that you are talking about 
20 
that you would share with them is the report that would go to 
for example conference or to a bigger structure, is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – but that report is the one that 
you said will not have details and will not indicate individual 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 107 of 140 
 
donations, is that right? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  That is right Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  It is (inaudible) that if there are for 
instance who are the donors that have given us this money 
amongst the officials then you can share that information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  The officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that – then that would be verbal is that 
correct it would not be in writing? 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  It always will be – will always be 
actually doing for the basis of verbally because it would be 
taking either into a confidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Now if you could 
turn with me to page 18 – sorry this is Bundle LEA27 again.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I ask this question while you are 
moving to the other bundle?  In the letter from Nkhubane 
Wills it says – that letter says that you handed the money – 
the donation to the – to the ANC, is that correct? 
20 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Just repeat if for my clarity Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am – that letter is at page 18421 of 
Bundle RR4 and I think the particular part is in the second 
page of the letter.  I am – it is the second paragraph on page 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 108 of 140 
 
1842 – it says: 
“The opposite seems true in this instance.  
On the one hand we have an individual 
member who states that he handed over a 
donation of R1 million to the ANC which he 
received from a donor and on the other hand 
we 
have 
an 
organisation 
which 
through 
various officials confirms that it received the 
donation from the individual concerned.” 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Well here in the Lacuna here Mr 
10 
Chairman that was the Lacuna that occurred at the time and 
I was not responsible for it.  When this matter first arose this 
legal firm acted both for the ANC but also acted for Mr Sipho 
Shabalala.   
Now it was later when we became aware that that 
ordinarily in our view would have been a conflict of interest 
and hence you would see that we would not have given an 
instruction to the extent that would actually be constructed in 
that particular way.  I am just only 00:21:43 for the 
commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I guess your – is your answer to my 
question that it is not true that you handed the money over 
to the ANC? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I think what the writer might have 
meant there Chairman they may have meant that Mr 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 109 of 140 
 
Shabalala handed money to the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Because I accept on record that I 
received the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  So I am not contradicting that version.  
So I would not have said to the (talking over one another.) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  Let me just see maybe I 
missed something.   
“On the one hand we have an individual 
10 
member who states that he handed over a 
donation of R1million to the ANC which he 
received from a donor.” 
 
Now if the reference to individual member is a 
reference to Mr Shabalala as you seem to be suggesting 
then it would mean that what they are saying is that Mr 
Shabalala handed a donation of R1 million to the ANC which 
was to you. Okay.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I – sorry Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Which was to you but then they say 
20 
which he – which he received from a donor.  That which he – 
that he cannot be you if this is to make sense.  It would have 
to mean to be a reference to Mr Shabalala.  Okay.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:  With respect Mr Chairman I am 
expected to answer on a letter written by lawyers here.   
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 110 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no but I – I want – I want to – to 
tell you what I understand this to mean so that you can 
comment.   
Now I initially thought – I initially thought that they 
were talking about you having handed the money over to the 
ANC and you – you made the point that probably they meant 
that Mr Shabalala handed over – handed the money over to 
the ANC meaning to you, you – that was the – that is what 
you said. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  That is what my – my understanding 
10 
of the (talking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. No, no I accept. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  (Inaudible) 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I accept  that you are saying that is 
your understanding but what I am then saying is on that 
understanding the reference to he when is says which he 
received from a donor would have to be Mr Shabalala and in 
other words they would be saying Mr Shabalala said he 
received the money from a donor and he handed that money 
over to the ANC. And of course this – this may become 
20 
important in terms of what we discussed earlier on.   
 
You remember that we talked about whether Mr 
Shabalala was just a conduit or whether he was the actual 
donor and you said well earlier on when we were discussing 
parts of this letter you said well you disclose – you disclosed 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 111 of 140 
 
Mr Shabalala as the donor but then I said well maybe it 
might not mean that.   
You know he might not be the donor and then we 
came to a point where you said you actually do not know 
whether Mr Shabalala was actually the donor or whether he 
was just giving you money that had been given to him to 
pass on to the ANC.  You remember with that discussion? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I corrected Mr Chairman and I still 
concur with your articulation that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Providing it (inaudible) because I said 
to the commission I have never asked Mr Shabalala whether 
he was himself the donor or whether he had raised the 
money from other people I did not ask that. So I do not have 
to or cannot vouch for whether Mr Shabalala was therefore 
the donor for the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Donation from him.  So for the 
purpose of this commission we received a donation from Mr 
Shabalala. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No that is – but you also 
understand you might agree – you might not agree – you 
might not be able to comment you also understand the 
approach that says where the letter says which he received 
from a donor that must refer to Mr Shabalala if the earlier 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 112 of 140 
 
reference to an individual member is Mr Shabalala.  Or you 
say ay this is too complicated now. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I am saying Mr Chairman what is put 
to me is a version that I cannot be able to answer so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One way or another. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  By knowledge – I have no knowledge 
of such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  And rather leave to those who may 
have the first comment about it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  I do not have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is – that is fine.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  In – if you would 
turn with me in Bundle LEA27 to paragraph 6 on page 24.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:  On page 24? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct – paragraph 6. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now at paragraph 6 say: 
“I recall that Mr Sipho Shabalala was one of 
20 
those ones who was quick to raise funds on 
behalf of the ANC.  Prior to the conference 
he informed that he had fund raised and 
wished to pay funds to the ANC.  I do not 
recall the exact date that he informed me of 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 113 of 140 
 
this but believe it was approximately two 
months 
or 
so 
before 
the 
provincial 
conference.” 
 
Now we know that the provincial conference was in 
fact from the 20t h to the 22n d of June so that would have 
mean – meant that we talking about approximately in April of 
2008. 
“Thereafter I received 
payment from 
Mr 
Shabalala in the amount of R1 million.  To 
the best of my recollection I received the 
10 
funds from Mr Shabalala on or about the 11t h 
of June of 2008.” 
 
The point over here is that as far back as April of 
2008 on your understanding Mr Shabalala was already in 
possession of the R1 million in cash, is that correct? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:  No I am not saying that Mr Chairman.  
I said Mr Chairman there was an indication that Mr Shabalala 
was going to raise the money that part of those were going 
to actually assist us in the call of raising the money.   
 
Now I only received the money and I did not know 
20 
how much Mr Shabalala was going to be paying to me until I 
received the money on or about the 11t h of June. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay now I understand.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  My point is a different one.  My point is 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 114 of 140 
 
that you say in this paragraph 6 that prior to the conference 
which we know was approximately two months prior you say 
he indicated that he had fund raised and that he wished to 
pay the funds to the ANC.  Now it may be that he was 
talking about a different amount of money but that was not 
your understanding.  Your understanding was that the 
amount that he subsequently gave you on the 11 t h of June 
and the amount that he was referring to two months 
previously 
for 
the 
same 
amount, 
that 
was 
your 
understanding.  Correct? 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Mr Chairman, he never raised any 
amount.  You are referring at the just infer(?) like he was 
speaking and talking and saying:  We know, Treasurer, that 
you have made a call for us to be able to support the ANC.  
And therefore I also want to see what I can do to support...  
Now I am saying it means almost along those lines that you 
have indicated but at that stage he did not say there was 
an amount of so much that was available.  No.  I only then 
knew 
how 
much 
Mr 
Shabalala 
has 
raised 
when 
he 
presented to me.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
I 
think 
what 
Mr 
Hulley 
is 
suggesting to you is this.  That based on paragraph 6 of 
your affidavit, you have to say or you had to understand at 
the 
time 
that 
this 
donation 
was 
not 
coming 
from 
Mr Shabalala’s own pocket, it was part of the funds he had 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 115 of 140 
 
raised for the ANC because in paragraph... 
 
Because I think you say in one of your affidavits 
that you had made a call or the ANC had made a call to its 
members and supports to raise funds for it.  And he say 
you say he said to you that he had undertaken to raise 
funds on behalf of the ANC and says: 
“Prior to the conference, he informed me that 
he had funds raised and wish to pay funds to 
the ANC.   
I do not recall the exact date that he informed 
10 
me of this but I believe it was approximately 
two 
months 
or 
so 
before 
the 
Provincial 
Conference. 
Thereafter, ANC payment from Mr Shabalala in 
the amount of R 1 million...” 
 
So I think Mr Hulley is suggesting to you that in 
the light of this when you received that donation from him, 
you could not have thought that he – it was coming from 
his pocket.  You had to think it was part of the money that 
he had raised.  What do you say to that?  Mr Hulley, is that 
20 
what you ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is accurate, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say to that?  Yes? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 116 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ....in the construction of paragraph 
6 it means, of course, under the guidance and advice I 
would be constructed but the ...[indistinct] the inference(?) 
that I am making to the Commission is that Mr Shabalala 
had indicated or intimated to me prior that he was 
responding to the call that we were making to the ANC 
members but at that stage Mr Chairman he did not indicate 
that there was already money, as I recall, recollect.   
 
It may have been not properly captured here 
that, as I recollect, he did not say that there was money 
10 
then that are available and the only time I ever knew how 
much Mr Shabalala was actually handing over is when he 
actually gave the money to us.  [Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the point is.  Based on 
paragraph 6 of your affidavit, what you are saying is.  One, 
you recall that Mr Shabalala was one of those who had 
undertaken to raise funds on behalf of the ANC.  That is 
the one point you make, okay? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The second point you make is.  Prior to 
20 
the conference he informed you that he had funds raised.  
In other words, when he was telling you he had already 
done the fundraising and he said to you he wishes to pay 
the funds to the ANC.  One, there was a call by the ANC or 
by yourself on behalf of the ANC to say:  Member of the 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 117 of 140 
 
ANC and those who support the ANC, please, the ANC 
needs funds.  There is going to be a conference.  Please 
donate or raise funds and so on.   
 
And you are saying that you will recall that he 
was one of those who made the undertaking that I will 
raise funds on behalf of the ANC.  And then you say, 
having made that undertaking prior to the conference, he 
then told you:  I have actually fundraised for the ANC and I 
wish to pay funds to the ANC.  That is what you say he 
said to you.   
10 
 
And then you say you do not recall the date 
when he informed you of this but you believe it was 
approximately two months or so before the conference.  
And then you say, thereafter you received payment from Mr 
Shabalala in the amount of R 1 million.  So when one reads 
this paragraph it seems that it can only mean that the 
R 1 million was part of other part of the fundraising that he 
was talking about it was the whole amount that he had 
fundraised on behalf of the ANC.  Would you accept that 
that is what it means? 
20 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
Let 
me 
start 
that 
version, 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Certainty(?) on the basis that he did 
not need, Mr Shabalala, that he was going to – the one 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 118 of 140 
 
who was going to respond to our call and that he himself 
was going to ensure that he was - a donation that is made 
available to the ANC.   
 
Now along those lines that is all.  Whether that 
donation came from in or paying from another person, that 
is the only point Chairman that I would not be able to make 
but other than that I think the version should be accepted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he would not say he had conducted 
fundraising if he was donating, taking from his own pocket, 
is it not? 
10 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If he would be donating himself, his own 
money, he would not be fundraising from himself.  [laughs] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct] only speak with the any 
...[indistinct] Shabalala himself but for me, the important 
thing is that, he might have actually been able to fundraise 
the money(?) which is the version I accepted Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I would say that it is not vague(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
They 
have 
raised 
it 
from 
...[indistinct]  The fact of the matter that I never asked him 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...the funds. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 119 of 140 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  But I think the 
...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the proposition was simply to say, 
on this version or on what you say he told you and the 
sequence of events leading to the payment of the handing 
over to you of the R 1 million donation, it seems that he 
was giving you either the total amount of the funds he had 
raised on behalf of the ANC or part of it.  I think that would 
– that was the proposition, in effect.  And therefore that 
10 
you ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I can live with that proposition 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...save to say that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...I do not know ...[indistinct].  The 
only person that can say so is Shabalala himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   But I can live ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can live with it, ja.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We – at half-past ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, I think we can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We must stop at quarter past. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 120 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Ja, I think we can wrap it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   My understanding ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think if you are able to – it may well be 
that some further questioning of Mr White is necessary in 
terms of that diagram. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you are able to ask questions to 
Mr Mabuyakhulu in relation to that diagram, I think that is – 
that will be important because he – for him the issue of the 
10 
link is quite important and I think it is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If I can tell you, I will take you to the 
diagram in a moment and I will wrap up with the diagram 
but to be able to explain what Mr White is saying, can I 
take you to page – to RR-4 at page 1383? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   One, eight...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   1383, Bundle RR-4.  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Is it RR-4, one... 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   One, three ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   One, three ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   One, three, eight, three. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...eight, three.  Mr Chair, this is R-4, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 121 of 140 
 
Bundle C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Indistinct]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   One – page 1383, Bundle RR-4.  It says 
Summary of Findings.  1383, Bundle RR-4.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Hey, Mr Chairman, I am trying to 
find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the right bundle? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I think I am having Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think this one we might not have used 
earlier. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We have not used it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is a new bundle that we did not 
use earlier.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   It is one, eight, three...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   1383.  What page can you find?  I will 
tell you whether you are in the right bundle.  What page 
are you on at the moment? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I am, Chairman, on 1834. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think you are in the wrong bundle 
because this one does not have one, eight something.  
This one – the first document on this bundle is Mr Trevor 
White’s affidavit, TSW-12.  Mr Hulley, are you able to 
assist him with more particulars? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 122 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the very first document in this 
particular bundle which starts with ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   ...337(?) [Speaker not clear] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I did not catch that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe his legal representatives can help 
him to find it? 
COUNSEL:   ...Mr Chairman, I think we have found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you found it? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   1383. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes, continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Mabuyakhulu, 
look at page 6 – sorry, paragraph 65.  If ...[intervenes]  
MR MABUYAKHULU:   [Speaker not clear] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He says: 
“Based 
on 
the 
information 
explanation 
provided by Mzila...” 
 
And we do not – we have not looked at that yet, 
so do not worry about that for present purposes.   
“...regarding 
the 
discussion 
you 
had 
with 
20 
Mabuyakhulu 
a 
while 
after 
the 
Provincial 
Conference about the donations used to fund 
certain expenses. 
It is evident that the receipt of this donation of 
R 1 million and the creation of an explanation 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 123 of 140 
 
for the non-accounting therefore was only 
started after enquiries in May 2008 and that 
Mabuyakhulu has played a significant role in 
assisting Shabalala with creating the scenario, 
no matter how improbable, based on the 
documents, to support Savoi’s explanation that 
the donation was to the ANC...” 
 
So what he is saying is that your version that 
you received R 1 million from Mr Shabalala, he is saying in 
the first instance, there is no evidence to support that, that 
10 
you actually received R 1 million in cash.   
 
But he says in the second instance, that the 
reason why you have created that explanation is in order to 
assist Mr Shabalala to explain that when he received the 
amounts from Mr Savoi to Intaka that he had in fact paid it 
back.  So you were coming to his assistance.   
 
In a nutshell what he is saying is that he does 
not accept that you actually received R 1 million in cash 
from Mr Shabalala.  He is saying that is a fabricated story 
that you did so in order to assist Mr Shabalala.   
20 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
Mr 
Chairman, 
...[indistinct] 
...whatever he sees ...[indistinct] on evidence.  And 
therefore 
in 
their 
evidence, 
why 
would 
I 
assist 
Mr Shabalala and for what benefit and for what purpose?  I 
flatly deny Mr Chairman that I was – I ever played any role 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 124 of 140 
 
in assisting anyone in this instance.  All that I reported was 
the factual situation that I received R 1 million donation.   
 
And I never at any stage ever showed that I 
acknowledged about the source of the money ...[indistinct]  
which I do not.  And in his own version, which I think it is 
Mr White himself who can only explain this illogical reason 
...[indistinct] he connects that R 1 million which I said I 
received from Mr Shabalala.  And what would I benefit in 
this particular – part of the scheme or ...[indistinct].   
 
I, therefore, deny Mr Chairman that it is an 
10 
illogical inference, that is not borne by facts, that is not 
based on any rationality, that is simply a figment of his 
imagination.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, he is not saying that there is a 
connection between the R 1 053 000,00 that was paid over 
by Intaka to Shezi’s Attorneys.  He is – and the amount of 
R 1 million that was paid to you.  He is saying there is no 
connection between those two amounts.  He is saying the 
second amount does not exist.  That you came up with that 
story in order to assist Mr Shabalala.  So he is going to 
20 
agree that there is no connection but where the two of you 
differ is on the basis of whether the R 1 million exists at 
all.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   There are two aspects of that 
Mr Chairman.  I place on record, as I have done, that I did 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 125 of 140 
 
receive R 1 million donation and there was no reason 
...[indistinct] factually said I received a donation if I did 
not.  For what purpose?  For what intention?  Now for him 
to make this allegation ought to be the one that is actually 
cross-examined on the basis and the bona fide of these 
allegations.   
 
So I am actually saying Mr Chairman.  I did 
receive R 1 million for the benefit of the ANC.  And there is 
no reason that I would have created a story that would 
have placed me into a matter that I really I am not 
10 
player(?), I have no knowledge and as I said earlier in my 
opening statement, where I have been dragged into a 
criminal matter that has absolutely nothing to do with me.   
 
And I said ...[indistinct] my image has been 
impute, my character both politically and socially has been 
assassinated.  So there is absolutely no logical basis that I 
would have manufactured something like that if I really 
...[indistinct]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if you go over to the following 
page at page 1384 at paragraph 6.  He is now providing a 
20 
summary 
of 
his 
findings. 
 
He 
says 
the 
following 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Hulley.  Where does 
Mr White 
says 
there 
is 
no 
connection 
between 
...[intervenes]  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 126 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, that is my inference.  I am saying 
Mr White is saying that this money does not exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you put it as if it comes from him 
or that is how I understood it but ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You see if...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   So this is Mr White’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But why do you – what makes 
you say that there is no connection.  That he would 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that is there no connection? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If I can just read paragraph 6 so you 
can see the two are connected to each other Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He then says, this is now, as I have 
said a summary of his findings.  He concludes by saying: 
“Mabuyakhulu alleged that he had received 
R 1 million in cash from Shabalala on behalf of 
the ANC...” 
20 
 
In brackets he says: 
“And not R 1 053 000,00. 
There is no other evidence that the said money 
was received by the money and I have to date 
not been provided with a copy of a receipt 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 127 of 140 
 
issued by the ANC confirming a receipt of 
R 1 million. 
Mabuyakhulu has further not provided any 
explanation as to why it took 14-months from 
the 
date 
purportedly(?) 
received 
R 1 053 000,00 
from 
the 
Intaka, 
12 March 2007 
until 
11 
June 
2008 
when 
Mabuyakhulu alleges he received R 1 million 
from Shabalala. 
The latter only occurred after the enquiries 
10 
were made within the ANC regarding the 
donation in May 2007 as it was the subject of 
investigation by the DSO...” 
 
So the way I read those passages, what he is 
saying is that the R 1 053 000,00 which was paid over in 
2007 and this R 1 million over here, if it existed there is 
not sufficient evidence to show that it existed at all and 
that is why his question is.  He says:  There is no evidence 
that the said money was received by the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I understood Mr White to say the 
20 
opposite.  I understood Mr White in his evidence to say the 
opposite and that is why the whole issue is where it is that 
he was – he accepted that Mr Mabuyakhulu who received 
the money but his approach or understanding was.  From 
the Intaka Group ...[intervenes]  
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 128 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...this 
money 
was 
intended 
for 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the ANC, ultimately.  And therefore it 
makes sense that it should be received by the Treasurer of 
the ANC. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But whether then the Treasurer of the 
ANC at the time hands the money over to the ANC or not, 
10 
is another issue but I did not understand him to dispute 
that the money - that Mr Mabuyakhulu did receive money.  
As I understand it, Mr White who was linking the money 
that Mr Mabuyakhulu received with the donation from 
Intaka Group.   
 
But that is where Mr Mabuyakhulu raises the 
issue.  He says:  I do not deny that I have received 
R 1 million.  I have always said that I did receive it.  What 
I am saying is – at least what he is saying here is.  What is 
the basis for linking that amount that I received on behalf 
20 
of the ANC to the donation made by Intaka Group to 
Shezi’s Attorneys. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja. 
 
That 
has 
always 
been 
my 
understanding.  It may well be that what should happen 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 129 of 140 
 
and maybe that is fine because part of the purpose of 
today’s proceedings was to really establish where the 
disputes of facts are in the two versions.  That what should 
happen is that clarification can be obtained from Mr White 
urgently and either before the clarification is granted or as 
soon 
as 
possible 
thereafter, 
I 
can 
decide 
on 
Mr Mabuyakhulu’s application for leave to cross-examine 
Mr White.   
 
And of course, what would happen is that at any 
stage, 
either 
before 
Mr Mabuyakhulu 
cross-examines 
10 
Mr White if I grant leave or after – or before he cross-
examines him, he could avail himself for further questions 
in the light of whatever clarification comes from Mr White 
before he then cross-examines Mr White.   
 
Or maybe, if the explanation or clarification 
given by Mr White is such that Mr Mabuyakhulu says:  
Well, then I do not need to cross-examine him in light of 
the clarification because I did not understand his evidence 
to be what he is now saying, then we can take it from 
there. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, if 
I could just elaborate in the lateness of hour?  What 
Mr White is basing his conclusions on or in part is on the 
document, the two documents which appear at pages 1843 
to 
1848. 
 
Those 
are 
the 
two 
affidavits 
of 
what 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 130 of 140 
 
Mr Mabuyakhulu refers to as the bookkeeper, Elani(?) 
Mzila.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   This is part of Bundle RR-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What pages?  One, eight...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   1843. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you have to – there is one – there 
is 43 ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   This Bundle RR-4.  Pardon me, 
Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Four only without an Alphabet?  This one 
that I have in front of me is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   This is all part of D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Part of 4 and the bundle of the specific 
– the specific lever arch file is Bundle D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you – each time you have got to say 
whether it is 3 or D. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise, one gets confused.  Just give 
20 
me the page numbers again.  One, eight...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So it is 1843. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1843. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And there are two affidavits and they 
go up to page 1848.  So there are two affidavits that are 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 131 of 140 
 
encapsulated there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
And 
that 
is 
what 
Mr 
White 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us talk about this one of 
Mr Elani Mzila which starts at 1843. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying there is something that is 
said in this affidavit on which you base your understanding 
that Mr White ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...he 
is 
saying 
that 
there 
is 
no 
connection between Intaka Group’s donation and the 
money that Mr Mabuyakhulu received? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So what he say is, if you read what 
Mr White is saying.  Mr White is saying that the issue of 
the R 1 million donation arose after.  If you read through 
these two affidavits, the issue of the R 1 million arose after 
May of 2008 where it became – it came to the knowledge of 
Mr Mabuyakhulu at the DSO which was the Directorate for 
20 
Special Operations was investigating, the old Scorpions 
was investigating the issue.  So he arose as part of this is, 
if one has consideration or has regard to his affidavits.  So 
he is saying that is when it arose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but when it arose, on the face it 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 132 of 140 
 
could arise at a particular time and still have a connection 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no sure.  But what he is saying is.  
So if you go back to his affidavit.  What he says is, as I 
read the affidavit, my understanding of the affidavit is that 
he is saying the connection – if there is a connection 
between those two amounts, then they are going to have to 
explain how it is that the amount that was paid over in 
2007 to Mr Shabalala but only – sorry, to Shezi’s Attorneys 
but was only handed over to the ANC in 2008 and what he 
saying with reference to these affidavits is that it is clear 
10 
that the amounts were only handed over in 2008, so that is 
the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is in terms of when Mr 
Mabuyakhulu got the money that he got.  I think there is no 
dispute about that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  In terms of when the donation of 
money was paid to Khobone and Shezi Attorneys by 
00.00.36 there is no dispute about that.  So that is common 
cause.  So but what I was saying is what is it actually that 
20 
you use as a basis to say – to support your understanding 
if Mr White says there is no connection between the money 
received by Mr Mabuyakhulu and any money donated to the 
law firm.  What is the actual basis for that understanding 
on your part? 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 133 of 140 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So what is said in paragraph 7.1 on 
page 1846, it says the following: 
“On the 20 to the 22 June 2008, ANC provincial 
conference was held in Pietermaritzburg, Kwazulu-
Natal. 
 
A 
while 
after 
the 
conference 
I 
was 
approached by former Provincial Treasurer, Mr 
Michael Mabuyakhulu.  He asked me whether I had 
noticed that certain items of the budget for the 
conference 
have 
not 
been 
paid 
by 
the 
ANC 
Provincial Treasurer ’s office and further informed 
10 
me that these items had been paid for by donations 
money.” 
So that what he gets informed.  He then goes on later on in 
paragraph  - under the heading – I am sorry, under 
paragraph 8 he says at paragraph (c). 
“I was informed by Mr Mabuyakhulu, I have no 
personal knowledge and details of the donation 
used to pay for the items not paid for by the office 
of the KZN.  This question can be directed to Mr 
Mabuyakhulu save for the last paragraph where I 
20 
explain how the statement was commissioned on 
the 29 August of 2009.” 
So what – the point that I am making – and it is not the 
interpretation that I am – or at least I do not - - I 
understand Mr White to be basing his interpretation on 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 134 of 140 
 
these two statements and if one considers what he is 
saying, he is saying that these two amounts of money, the 
one that was paid over in 2007 and the amount which has 
been spoken of in 2008, he says that that amount does not 
exist because there is no sufficient evidence of it.  But 
what he is saying also is that if that amount was not 
designed to – sorry, if I can just refer to one further – if I 
might, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  No, I do not think 
you need to go further. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Actually, I think paragraph 2 on page 
1843 is important, he says: 
“In the course of my duties I confirm that a donation 
of R1 million was received by the African National 
Congress from a donor who I am advised was a 
certain Dr Savoy.” 
So that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   None of the parts you have read to me 
seem to me to support the point you make but I think the 
proper way is let us get Mr White to clarify this. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As soon as possible so that  - I would 
see 
in 
the 
meantime 
whether 
I 
can 
decide 
Mr 
Mabuyakhulu’s application even before that clarification is 
given but if not, as soon as possible after he, Mr White, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 135 of 140 
 
has clarified I will make – I will decide.  Let us leave it on 
the basis that you understand it in a certain way but the 
person who was doing the investigation, let him clarify. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand, Mr Mabuyakhulu?  Of 
course what Mr Hulley is saying you would have no 
problem if that is what Mr White is saying.  I imagine 
because your main point, why you want to cross-examine 
him is …[intervenes] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Well, I (indistinct – recording 
10 
distorted) 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am saying your main 
reason …[intervenes] 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   The main reason, Mr Chairman is 
this affidavit.  You see, if you have got the TFCW21, which 
is Mr Hulley’s illustration before this Commission, if that 
indicates as the centre of the square all of the payments.   
He then makes these very red - dotted red lines with the 
boxes outside.   
 
Now my question, Mr Chairman, you have money 
20 
being - we are being told by Mr White himself how the 
money is being disbursed.   
 
Now clearly, if I received money, we now know 
from Mr White himself that the money that I received was 
not the same amount of money and at no stage would I 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 136 of 140 
 
actually be able to [indistinct] anybody by manufacturing 
something like this when there is absolutely there no link 
between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   It is his report because it is the 
truth, he is making it.  It is not the other way around as Mr 
Hulley is saying.  He has actually linked …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He links it. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Because he linked it, it is the one 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what page again is that, Mr 
Mabuyakhulu, you mentioned the page just now, the page 
where you are looking at, where the diagram is. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   That is – I think it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Hulley might know the heart(?) 
of the diagram. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   439. 
CHAIRPERSON:   439? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   039. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle first?  The one we are 
20 
currently using? 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   (indistinct – recording distorted)   
ADV HULLEY SC:   LAM27, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 137 of 140 
 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   And I say, Mr Chairman, it is 07.13 
there, you will see that Mr White is making that link 
through the black dotted line and there are arrows as well 
as the boxes on top there.  The question, how do come into 
that equation? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is page 39 of bundle RR7 or it 
starts at page 38, is that right? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   They are two different documents, Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Those are two different documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The one is TFW19 at page 38 and the 
one at page 39 is a different diagram, which is TFW21. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but Mr Mabuyakhulu is referring to 
page 39. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Yes, that is (indistinct – recording 
distorted) 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
MABUYAKHULU: 
 
 
That 
is 
one 
of 
the 
three 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, that is my understanding as 
well, Mr Mabuyakhulu, that in that diagram Mr White 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 138 of 140 
 
connects 
the 
donation 
by 
Intaka 
to 
Khobone 
Shezi 
Attorneys and says it goes to various entities connected 
with the Shabalalas and then with that broken line says R1 
million comes to you.  Of course he has got to - the broken 
line to the ANC as well.  But I do not know if there is a key 
here.  Some of the lines are solid, these two are broken.  
Does he give an indication, Mr Hulley, whether the broken 
one means… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   My understanding, which is the one 
that I have just indicated, was that this broken line is a 
10 
reference to the version that has been provided to support 
what Mr Shabalala… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So it is not supported, he is not saying 
that this is the correct version.  He is questioning that 
version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is questioning it? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is my understanding is that he is 
questioning that version, he is saying – he has given a 
broken line specifically because it was – it is not part of 
20 
his case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, let us leave it at that, let 
us get him to clarify and including what he says what this 
means and then once he has provided that clarification 
then Mr Mabuyakhulu can be furnished with the affidavit, 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 139 of 140 
 
Mr White’s affidavit.  If he does it in an affidavit it would be 
better if he does that, an affidavit but such an affidavit can 
be obtained within a matter of days. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes.  No, I will consult with him as 
soon as …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is just a brief point. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, let us leave it at that, Mr 
Mabuyakhulu, let us get clarification from Mr White so that 
you are questioned on the basis of something that he has 
10 
clarified but also then I will apply my mind to your 
application in the meantime. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Thank you, Mr Chairman, let me 
take this opportunity to thank you for affording me and 
opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   I say, Mr Chairman, I have been 
waiting for a long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Because innuendos and allegations 
20 
were made in a matter that I still strongly believe, 
Chairman, I had no criminal role to play or any wrongdoing 
whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Because I – I therefore welcome 
05 MAY 2021 – DAY 389 
 
Page 140 of 140 
 
this opportunity, pleased to be able to place on record on 
my own view that I believe, Mr Chairman, I was brought 
into a criminal matter that had absolutely nothing to do 
with me from the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Dickson.   
MR MABUYAKHULU:   Thank you, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Dickson? 
ADV DICKSON SC:   Yes, thank you very much, Mr 
Chairman, we will take as you have directed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, no, that is fine. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much to everybody, 
thank you to Mr Mabuyakhulu and to Mr Dickson.  Thank 
you to you, Mr Hulley and your team and thank you to the 
staff and the technicians for making it possible for us to sit 
until this time. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we will now adjourn and I indicated 
during the day that tomorrow I will hear the evidence of Mr 
Kevin Wakeford in relation to BOSASA.  We adjourn.
