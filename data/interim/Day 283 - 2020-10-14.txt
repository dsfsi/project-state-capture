PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 14 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson this sitting of the 
commission as you know involves the Transnet stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now we intend to lead evidence on 
four main topics.   
Firstly the reinstatement of Mr Gama as the Chief 
Executive of Transnet Freight Rail in 2011.  
Secondly the settlement of litigation against Abalozi 
Risk Advisory Services formerly known as GNS in 2014.  
That is on pause at the moment and we hope to bring that 
to evidence next week.   
Thirdly corruption in relation to the Manganese 
Expansion Project known as MEP in 2013 and then 
20 
Fourthly some new and different evidence in part in 
relation to the acquisition of locomotives in particular the 
1064 locomotives. 
We intend to call these witnesses in relation to Mr 
Gama’s reinstatement, Mr Mapoma, Mr Todd and Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 4 of 209 
 
Mkwanazi.  In relation to Abalozi, Mr Todd in relation to 
MEP, Mr Bester and Ms Strydom we also would seek leave 
to present an affidavit from Mr Bierman who is in Australia. 
And then in relation to the locomotives we intend to 
call Mr Callard and Mr Leher.  Mr Leher ’s evidence will 
also cover his Rule 3.4 Application. 
Chairperson in relation to the bundles you – there 
have been five files that have been produced.  If we were 
to run through them Bundle 1 and 2 contains what is 
referred to as Exhibit BD15.  Now Chairperson… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Transnet Bundle 01 and Transnet 
Bundle 02? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is Exhibit BB15 and those two 
files 
contain 
documentation 
relating 
to 
the 
Gama 
investigation. 
 
The first file is a series of affidavits.  The second 
file is a series of key documents.  Then Transnet Bundle 03 
contains Exhibits BB16 that being Mr Mapoma’s affidavits 
20 
and BB17 that being Mr Todd’s affidavits. 
 
Transnet Bundle 04[A] that contains Exhibit 18 
being Mr Mkwanazi’s affidavit.  19 Mr Bester ’s affidavit.  20 
Ms Strydom’s affidavit and then also an Exhibit BB4 F1 
now that appears out of sequence but that was bundled 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 5 of 209 
 
before this proceedings and that is part of the affidavits 
relating to Mr Leher. 
 
And then the final file is Transnet Bundle 04[B] and 
it contains two exhibits in relation to Mr Leher.  BB4[F]2, 
BB4[F]3 and Exhibit BB4[H] in relation to Mr Callard. 
 
Mr Chairperson we intend to start with evidence 
relating to Mr Gama’s reinstatement.  The facts, the 
background are – is probably well known to the public.  Mr 
Gama as you will recall… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think it might help. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To just help the public to see where this 
fits in.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Gama… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to give some background. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As you please.  Mr Gama was the 
Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail a very big division 
of Transnet.  And he was dismissed for serious misconduct 
in June of 2010.  He referred an unfair dismissal dispute to 
the Transnet Bargaining Council.   
20 
 
Chairperson then came a change in the Minister of 
Public Enterprises from Ms Hogan to Mr Gigaba and the 
appointment of a new board of directors at Transnet. 
 
You will recall the evidence of Ms Hogan which was 
in summary that former President Zuma was a devout 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 6 of 209 
 
supporter of Mr Gama.  There was a change in Minister, a 
change in board.  Within a few months of that the new 
board decided to reinstate Mr Gama with full retrospectivity 
and undertook and agreed to pay his costs and that was a 
decision that was taken in February of 2011. 
 
Mr Gama would go on to be appointed as the Group 
Chief Executive of Transnet.  Mr Mapoma was the General 
Manager Group Legal Services.  Mr Todd was the attorney 
that 
represented 
Transnet 
in 
the 
Gama 
disciplinary 
proceedings and related litigation and Mr Mkwanazi was 
10 
the new chairperson of the board of directors. 
 
With you leave we would ask to call our first 
witness Mr Mapoma. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well 
maybe 
just 
to 
add 
on 
the 
background you have given because I have the advantage 
that I have been here all along. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have heard all the evidence.  Just to 
emphasise that two things may be relevant before the 
dismissal of Mr Gama. 
20 
 
One is that his dismissal came about as a result of 
a disciplinary hearing that was chaired by an independent 
chairperson senior counsel at the Johannesburg Bar.  He 
was represented by lawyers at the disciplinary hearing.  He 
was found guilty of I think three acts of misconduct.  That 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 7 of 209 
 
is the one thing. 
 
The other thing is that prior to that that is now in 
2000 and I think and 2009 or – and maybe early 2010.  
According to Ms Hogan who was Minister of Public 
Enterprises at the time there was a vacant post for the 
Group Chief Executive Officer at Transnet which was 
created after Ms Ramos – Maria Ramos had left and Mr 
Gama was a candidate together with other candidates. 
 
One of the candidates ultimately was Mr Sipho 
Maseko I think and the board which had conducted the 
10 
interviews recommended that Mr Maseko – Mr Sipho 
Maseko should be appointed as the Group Chief Executive 
Officer.  And they considered that Mr Gama was not yet 
ready for such a position of responsibility. 
 
But also it happened that there were allegations 
that 
were 
being 
investigated 
or 
were 
about 
to 
be 
investigated against him relating to tender irregularities at 
Transnet. 
 
So according to Ms Hogan when she presented to 
the former President Mr Zuma the name of Mr Sipho 
20 
Maseko as the candidate who was recommended by the 
board – according to her Mr Zuma said that he had only 
one choice for the position of Group CEO for Transnet and 
that choice was Mr Siyabonga Gama. 
 
According to Ms Hogan when she said to Mr Zuma 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 8 of 209 
 
that the board has recommended somebody else they think 
he is not – Mr Gama is not ready and also mentioned that 
there were investigations or there were about to be 
investigations into certain allegations – serious allegations 
against Mr Gama which could lead to a disciplinary 
process. 
 
According to Ms Hogan Mr Zuma said that then the 
position would have to wait and not be filled until the – 
those processes relating to Mr Gama had been completed. 
 
Ms Hogan says she tried to emphasise the need for 
10 
he filling of the position but she said Mr Zuma was not 
prepared to change his view.   
 
Mr Zuma has testified and has denied this evidence 
by Ms Hogan and said that he could not have adopted such 
an approach because if the board had gone through the 
processes he would have gone along with that. 
 
But the position did remain unfilled until I think 
2011.  So when Mr Gama was dismissed the position was 
still not filled.  It was then filled by Mr Brian Molefe I think 
early in 2011.  I hope I am right with regard to the year.  Ja 
20 
I think 2011 and then as you said in February the new 
board of Transnet that had been appointed I think in 
December or October I am not sure then seems to have 
decided to reinstate Mr Gama and concluded a certain 
settlement agreement with him and he was reinstated with 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 9 of 209 
 
full back pay and benefits as I understand the position and 
the board undertook to pay certain costs to him. 
 
And then about three years later I think in 2015 
when Mr Brian Molefe was seconded to Eskom Mr Gama 
was made acting Group CEO for Transnet.   
 
I think – I thought I would use the benefit – my 
benefit of having listened to all the evidence just to 
mention those features. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes you may call your first 
10 
witness. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mapoma.  Mr 
Chairperson I have mentioned that the bundles that are 
relevant to this witness are 1, 2 and 3 that is Exhibit 15 
and Exhibit 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will you be using them at the same time? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes in certain respects we will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – ja okay alright.  I think he will bring 
me 16.  Oh you know but – I think just do as you normally 
do as in – so what he will do Mr Myburgh as you refer to 
20 
another bundle he will bring me that bundle. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 10 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:  Siyabulela Xhanti Mapoma. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
ADV MAPOMA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
10 
me God. 
ADV MAPOMA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Mapoma.  You may be 
seated.  Mr Myburgh my Registrar has given me Transnet 
Bundle 1 but that one does not have Mr Mapoma’s 
statement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should I have … 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It should be Bundle 03. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Containing Exhibit 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mapoma do you have Bundle 3? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is a – there should be a tab in 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 11 of 209 
 
there 16 could I ask you to turn to that please?  As you 
please thank you Mr Chairperson.  Two pages or so into 
that bundle you will find an affidavit.  I am going to as I 
have said to you I will refer to the black numbers that is 
the page number in the bundle.  So I am referring here to 
page 3.  Are you there? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is this an affidavit of yours? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I please just ask you to turn to 
10 
the end of that affidavit at page 14.  Would you confirm 
that that is your signature and that you signed it under 
oath on the 31 July this year? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I confirm that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now there is a series of three 
affidavits in this exhibit.  I am going to take you Mr 
Mapoma through them one by one. 
 
Let us start with this affidavit.  You start of by 
saying that you are an Advocate in private practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh do you request 
20 
that I admit this affidavit as Exhibit BB17 – no BB16.  – we 
– what we would do is admit each affidavit as an Exhibit on 
its own. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that it is not the file that is the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 12 of 209 
 
exhibit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The actual documents.  Then when we 
admit it it would be the affidavit plus its annexures. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well perhaps Mr Chairperson let me 
just go through because there are three affidavits here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps I could just deal with all of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then ask you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  To admit all of them at once. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Mapoma you have dealt with 
your first affidavit page 3 through to 14 and would you 
confirm that it then included annexure A, annexure B at 
page 17 which ends at page 22 – would you confirm that? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I confirm Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then there is another affidavit 
20 
starting at page 23 is that your affidavit? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I ask you please to turn to 
page 28, is that your signature? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes it is my signature Chair. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 13 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you attested to that affidavit 
under oath on the 31 August this year. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at page 29 is that the 
commencement of your third affidavit? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And could I please take you to page 
32, is that your signature? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes it is mine yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  And did you attest to that 
10 
affidavit under oath on the 8 October? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That affidavit I would ask you to 
confirm and it contains annexures SM1 starting at page 31,  
Annexure SM2 starting at page – sorry SM1 starting at 33 
the black numbers.   
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  SM2 starting at page 36 and SM3 
starting at page 39 and running until 42. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I confirm. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson I would ask you then 
to admit those three affidavits together with the annexures 
making up Exhibit BB16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I suggest that we – we do not make them 
all Exhibit BB16 but rather that we make them Exhibit 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 14 of 209 
 
BB16.1, 16.2, 16.3. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes it is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That has been pointed out to me by 
the Secretariat as per the index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  16.1, 16.2, 16.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Siyabulela Xhanti 
Mapoma starting at page 3 is admitted and will be Exhibit 
BB16.1.  Just guide me again in terms of where the next 
starts Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The second affidavit Chairperson 
starts at page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  22? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  The affidavit of Mr Siyabulela Xhanti 
20 
Mapoma starting at page 23 is admitted as Exhibit BB16.2.  
Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The third affidavit starts at page 29 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Siyabulela Xhanti 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 15 of 209 
 
Mapoma starting at page 29 is admitted as Exhibit BB16.3.  
Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mapoma could I ask 
you please to turn to page 3, are you there? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now you say at paragraph 1 that you 
are an advocate in private practice – where do you 
practice? Are you – and what bars are you a member of? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I am a member of the Bisho Society of 
Advocates with its offices in East London and I am also a 
10 
member of the Mthatha Bar with its offices in Mthatha all in 
the Eastern Cape so I practice in the Eastern Cape. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At paragraph 3 you deal with your 
work history at Transnet could you deal with that please? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Do you want me to read from paragraph?  
The paragraph reads and which I confirm: 
“I started working at Transnet on 1 February 
2007 as a legal advisor Litigation and 
Administrative Law.  Later I was appointed 
as 
a 
General 
Manager 
Group 
Legal 
20 
Services which position I occupied from the 
1 September 2008 to 31 January 2012.  I 
was 
based 
in 
the 
Carlton 
Centre 
Johannesburg which was the head office at 
the time.  I resigned from Transnet to do 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 16 of 209 
 
pupillage at the Johannesburg Bar after 
which I have been in practice since.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I just want to confirm then that 
you were General Manager Group Legal Services 2008 
through to January 2012. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The time of Mr Gama’s reinstatement 
in early 2011 you would have occupied this position? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Myburgh.  I do not 
10 
know it looks like it is quite dark this side.  I do not know if 
there is a lighting that is not there today that is usually 
there.  So – or whether there is a light that is not directed 
where it is normally directed.  So if somebody can look at 
that.  Yes you may continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mapoma 
in paragraph 4 you have set out various positions of 
responsibilities that you held whilst at Transnet what were 
those? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes Chair I occupied other positions of 
20 
responsibility at Transnet during my time there.  I was a 
member of the Transnet Forensic Working Group which was 
a sub-committee of Group Internal Control Committee.  I 
was a member of the [00:24:32] Committee which was a 
committee under Group Risk.  I also chaired the Transnet 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 17 of 209 
 
Acquisition Council for some time although I am sure if this 
is the correct of the committee but I think at the time it was 
called the Transnet Acquisition Council.  I also acted as 
CO of Autopax Pty Ltd which was then a subsidiary of 
Transnet for about eight months.  Manager of the transfer 
of Autopax to PRASA.  During that time I was doing both 
the duties at Autopax and as a GM at Transnet.  I was also 
a Trustee of Transnet.  I was also a board member of a 
company called Commerce Pty Ltd which was a company 
that Transnet had an interest in.  And I know that I might 
10 
have been in one or other committee which I do not recall 
now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And to whom did you initially report? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Initially I reported to Mr Vuyo Kahla who 
was a member of EXCO and when Mr Kahla left I then 
reported to Ms Zola Stephen who replaced Mr Kahla as the 
Group Executive responsible for Legal.  I was reporting 
then to her. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Ms Stephen was the Group 
Executive Legal? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then you go on in paragraph 6 to 
explain the request for information that was made on you 
by the commission. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 18 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Over the page you then attach the 
letter Annexure A and then you quote paragraph 2 of the 
letter – paragraph 7 of your affidavit. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it reads: 
“That in this regard it seems prima facie 
strange 
that 
Transnet 
agreed 
not 
only 
reinstate Mr Gama despite him having been 
10 
found 
guilty 
of 
three 
serious 
acts 
of 
misconduct but also that he wants to be 
paid full back pay and Transnet was to pay 
75% 
of 
his 
unsuccessful 
high 
court 
application, 75% of his costs relating to his 
unfair dismissal dispute.” 
 
It would seem that Transnet abandoned its costs 
that the high court had ordered Mr Gama to pay Transnet.  
Just ask you to confirm then it is those issues that you 
address in your affidavit? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In paragraph 8 you then attach the 
draft settlement agreement concluded on the 23 February 
where you say that you witnessed the signature of Mr 
Mkwanazi? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 19 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Who at that time what was his 
position? 
ADV MAPOMA:  That time Mr Mkwanazi occupied two 
positions at Transnet.  He was the acting Chief Executive 
Officer and he was also chairman of the board. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Mapoma so as to give 
context to your evidence and to the other related witnesses 
I would like to take you to the settlement agreement that 
you attach as annexure B to your affidavit.  That you will 
10 
find at page 17 through to 22. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I would just like to take you please to 
the preamble.  It refers to the fact that an unfair dismissal 
dispute has arisen between the parties following the 
dismissal of Mr Gama as the Chief Executive Officer CEO 
of TRF on the 29 June.  Do you confirm that? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that Mr Gama then referred an 
unfair dismissal dispute to the Transnet Bargaining Council 
20 
at 2.2. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And 2.3 records that that dispute is 
now settled in terms of this agreement. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 20 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  3.1 Mr Gama returned to Transnet 
with effect from 23 February 2011 and he is to resume his 
duties as CEO of TRF on 1 April 2011. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So nine months after he was 
dismissed. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  3.2 Any employment benefits that 
were due to him for the intervening period of 30 June 2010 
to 23 February  2011 in terms of his employment contract 
10 
should be deemed to fully restored. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes audit reports. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it goes on to record at 321 The 
full restoration of benefits entails sub 1 payment of Mr 
Gama’s short term benefits and they are described.  Sub 2 
payment of Mr Gama’s long term benefits and they are 
described. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sub 3 Restoration of Mr Gama’s 
salary and that is described. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at 3.3 Mr Gama is deemed 
to have served the 6 months final written warning.  The 
final written warning will be deemed to have been effected 
or effective from 29 June to 29 December 2010. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 21 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This agreement as you have said in 
your affidavit was concluded on the 23 February 2011. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Had that warning then lapsed by the 
time that the agreement was concluded? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes by the look of paragraph 3.3 that 
warning had lapsed by the time the agreement was 
concluded. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then a clause that is of particular 
10 
relevance to your evidence 3.5 Transnet will make a 
contribution equivalent to 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed legal 
costs incurred during Gama’s high court application and in 
respect of his unfair dismissal dispute referred to the 
Transnet Bargaining Council. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  3.6 deals with the time within which 
payment would be made.  3.7 the parties agree to 
formulate a common statement. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I see that. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then there are a number of boiler 
plate clauses confidentiality, full and final settlement and 
then under general – perhaps I could just direct your 
attention please to clause 6.4.  The parties agree that the 
terms of this settlement agreement are in final settlement 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 22 of 209 
 
of any claims and disputes which each party to the 
agreement may have against the other in respect of Mr 
Gama’s employment as CEO of TFR, confirm that? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I confirm that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let us then go back to your affidavit.  
At paragraph 9 you record that your recollection might not 
be perfectly accurate and that you may wish to put in a 
supplementary affidavit once you see any documents. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let us then turn to paragraph 10 
10 
you deal with that. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes at paragraph 10 Chair I recorded that 
and I confirm it.  But initially when the disciplinary hearing 
of Mr Gama was initiated the matter was dealt with directly 
by Mr Kahla. I was not involved at all and the reasoning as 
I understood it at the time was that Mr Gama was EXCO 
member and I was – it was deemed appropriate that a 
junior member like myself should be directly involved in the 
disciplinary hearing of a senior executive. 
 
However I know that initially Mr Brian Briback [?] 
20 
had been requested – been briefed or consulted by Mr 
Kahla on Mr Gama’s disciplinary hearing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then at paragraph 11 you say that 
you were later informed that Mr Todd of Bowman Gilfillan 
known as Bowmans Attorneys handled the disciplinary 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 23 of 209 
 
matter.  Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let us then turn to paragraph 12 
where you say coming to the matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh – I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  I 
would prefer if Mr Mapoma as far as you are able to you 
just give your evidence and not read it.  Obviously you can 
look at your statement to refresh your memory because 
some of the details might need that.  So Mr Myburgh might 
see how to formulate his questions so that you can 
10 
respond in terms of your knowledge of your involvement.  
But obviously when there is something – details that you 
need to look at you can look at them. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Thank you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now at what point in time did you 
then become involved in the matter relating to Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I came involved in this matter when Mr 
20 
Mkwanazi joined Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And can you remember when that was 
approximately? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I do not recall approximately but I think it 
was in 2010 – 2010 towards the end. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 24 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  And what – had Mr Gama 
taken any action or laid any complaints at that time that 
caused you to become involved in the matter? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes Mr Gama had laid a complaint with the 
Public Protector.  It was alleged that he had been unfairly 
treated by Transnet.   
The other allegations that were in that complaint 
with 
the 
Public 
Protector 
was 
investigating. 
 
Now 
complaints from the Public Protector at the time will come 
to my office.  So this complaint also came to my office.  Mr 
10 
Mkwanazi came to know about it because I think it was 
reported in the various committees – it would have been 
reported at EXCO and it would have come to the attention.  
So I was dealing with that response that Transnet 
had to make to the Public Protector.  It was a huge 
investigation.  
 We had to get external service providers to assist 
us because of the – of the number and the areas of 
investigation that – that were required to be done.  So that 
we could have the comprehensive response to the Public 
20 
Protector.  Ultimately I did that.   
So this is I think the first time that I came to direct 
with Mr Mkwanazi on the Gama – on Mr Gama. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can I take you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that complaint laid by Mr Gama at 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 25 of 209 
 
the – after he had been dismissed or before he was 
dismissed?  Do you remember? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I think he laid it after he was dismissed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was dismissed at the end of June 
2010? 
ADV MAPOMA:  2010 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mapoma perhaps I 
could take you for the first time to Bundle 2 Exhibit BB15.  
Could I ask you please to turn to page 24.   
10 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is a letter from the Public 
Protector dated the 22 December 2010 addressed to Mr 
Mkwanazi. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Headed Investigation alleged tender 
irregularities and abuse of power at Transnet. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Do you recall this document? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I recall this letter but I have not seen it in 
20 
a long time but I do recall it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is this the Public Protector complaint 
that you have told the Chairperson about? 
ADV MAPOMA:  This is the complaint I am talking about 
yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 26 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now if I could just ask you please to 
go to the second paragraph.  The complaint alleged 
irregularities in procurement at Transnet further that the 
then Transnet board had unfairly conspired to prevent Mr 
Gama from successfully applying for the vacant post of 
Group Chief Executive. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Which was about to be vacated by Ms 
Maria Ramos. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In a meeting with him Mr Gama 
alleged that the motive for his suspension could only have 
been to scupper his chances of successfully applying for 
the post as seen from the following.  And so the letter goes 
on. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now you mentioned that in dealing 
with the Public Protector complaint you engaged certain 
service providers.  Who were those? 
ADV MAPOMA:  We engaged the services of Konvisizwa 
20 
[?] We engaged the services of Norton Rose.  One of the 
partners there at the time Mr Goola was the [00:38:39] in 
responding to the complaint. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And did you… 
ADV MAPOMA:  We also – I think at the time also engaged 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 27 of 209 
 
with Services of Senior Council and Advocate [00:38:52].  
So I know that we had those service providers with us. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you – did you then in the fullness 
of time did Transnet respond to the Public Protector 
complaint? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes Transnet did respond to this complaint 
in time.  I remember I think I took that myself to the Public 
Protectors office in Pretoria before the due date or on the 
due date but we did respond to it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So if I can direct your attention to 
10 
paragraph 13 of your affidavit you said: He ultimately 
provided the response to the Public Protector.  You say you 
do not know what happened to the complaint.  Could I in 
relation to the response ask you please to turn to page 48 
of the same bundle, Bundle 2.  There from page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say 48 – did you say 48 Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes Chairperson 48.  Mr Mapoma, 
there you see a letter addressed to the Public Protector and 
if you turn forward then at page 55, you will see that it 
appears to have been signed by Mr Mkwanazi ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...on behalf of Transnet on the 
30t h of June 2011.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Was this the response that you speak 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 28 of 209 
 
of? 
ADV MAPOMA:   This is the response that I speak of. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But I think the response had certain 
attachments to it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But I am not sure.  But this would be the 
response ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...that I speak of. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, were you aware of the fact that 
Mr Gama had referred an unfair dismissal dispute to the 
Transnet Bargaining Council? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I am aware.  Because after the 
dismissal of Mr Gama, such a referral was then made. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, I want to deal with your 
interaction with Mr Mkwanazi.  When he initially interacted 
with you, what did he tell you?  What did he want you to do? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Mr Mkwanazi told me that I needed to 
assist him to bring Mr Gama back to Transnet at the time.  
20 
And I advised my immediate supervisor about this.  Then she 
had no problem with Mr Mkwanazi working with me on this in 
relation to what I have mentioned earlier that Mr Gama 
was... had been a Senior Executive of Transnet and my 
supervisor was on the same par with Mr Gama.  So Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 29 of 209 
 
Mafika Mkwanazi then asked me to assist him to do this, to 
bring Mr Gama back to Transnet.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to clarify something.  Why 
did you, when you say you informed your supervisor, you are 
referring, I understand, to Ms Stephen.   
ADV MAPOMA:   I am referring to Ms Zola Stephen, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you find it necessary to speak 
to her about this? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I found it necessary because normally from 
where Mr Mkwanazi’s position was as CEO.  CEO’s will 
10 
normally interact with the Group Executive and so for Legal 
and then I will get the instruction from my executive.   
 
So in this instance, Mr Mkwanazi wanted to talk to me 
directly and he wanted me to assist him directly and not 
through my supervisor, Ms Stephen.   
 
So I had inform her because I do not want to have any 
tensions in the office about why would the chairman of the 
board, why would the CEO be interacting with me directly 
instead of her. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now when you first were approached 
20 
by Mr Mkwanazi in this regard, was that before or after the 
board resolved to reinstate Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:   At the time that Mr Mkwanazi first approach 
me, I think his instruction was that the board had resolved 
already to do it but I am not certain at the time.  But I was 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 30 of 209 
 
aware that he had the authority to do the reinstatement 
either from the board or from elsewhere.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now were there times before the 
settlement agreement was concluded that you attended 
meetings relevant to the reinstatement of Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I had a number of meetings with 
Mr Mkwanazi himself where he would tell me how he wanted 
to do this.  And his words, at the time was, that he wanted to 
do this cleanly, in the light of the fact that Mr Gama had 
been dismissed.   
10 
 
So he wanted to do the reinstatement cleanly.  And I use 
this word cleanly because it is the word that he used with 
me.   
 
So I had a number of meetings with him.  We also had a 
number, that is Mr Ghule myself.  We had a number of 
meetings with Mr Langa, who were Mr Gama’s attorneys at 
the time.   
 
There was a meeting as well where we... there was Mr 
Gama, Mr Langa, it was myself, Mr Ghule and one of his 
associates at the time ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ... Mr Sangoni(?) which was held at Inanda 
on a weekend.  We arrived there in the morning.  We had a 
caucus.  Mr Mafika, Ghule, myself and somebody on the 
side.  And then later on, Mr Mkwanazi went meet to Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 31 of 209 
 
Gama, separate, in another room where we were not.  I 
personally 
got 
to 
meet 
Mr 
Gama 
but 
I 
would 
meet 
Mr Mkwanazi fairly regularly about this thing.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what did Mr Mkwanazi report to 
you about that meeting at Inanda? 
ADV MAPOMA:   At the meeting of Inanda, Mr Mkwanazi told 
us that he had no... he could not agree with Mr Gama on a 
number of things.   
 
One of the things that Mr Gama wanted at the time, 
according to Mr Mkwanazi was that. in order to be reinstated 
10 
as CEO of Transnet and Mr Mkwanazi was refusing with this.   
 
He was also... there was also the issue of the bonuses 
at the time.  But the specific thing I recall, was that 
Mr Mkwanazi was refusing that Gama must be reinstated as 
CEO.   
 
He and Mkwanazi had proposing that Gama must go 
back to Transnet Freight Rail or he must come and work as 
Group Executive in his own office, that is the chairman’s 
office.   
 
But the main thing at the time was the return of Mr Gama 
20 
as CEO of Transnet but Mr Mkwanazi was not agreeing to.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just to go back to the first time that 
Mr Mkwanazi asked you to assist him.  Did you say that he 
asked you to assist him to bring back Mr Gama to Transnet? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 32 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how he put it? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is how he put it.  He said, we need to 
reinstate Mr Gama ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...back to Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your understanding is that, at that 
time when he approached you, the board had already 
resolved to reinstate Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is how I understood it at the time, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But this... there was no settlement 
agreement concluded as yet? 
ADV MAPOMA:   There was no settlement agreement.  There 
was no detail ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...on the terms of the reinstatement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So I had no detail at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now this resolution of the board 
which you seem to say seems to have been made before the 
20 
settlement agreement was concluded.  Did you ever see that 
resolution or did you hear from Mr Mkwanazi that there was 
such a resolution? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never saw it? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 33 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I never saw it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did Mr Mkwanazi say that the board 
had already resolved to reinstate Mr Game or are you not 
sure about that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   He did say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because at the time, I understood that he 
had a mandate to talk to Mr Gama.  He had a mandate to 
agree to terms with Mr Gama.  The details of which he would 
have received from the board, I suppose.   
10 
 
And at the time my advice to him was this.  Because you 
are, Mr Mkwanazi, you are acting CEO, you are also 
chairman of the board, there might be some conflict 
somewhere.  And you have no authority to reinstate Mr Gama 
to be CEO of Transnet because it is the board that must 
make that decision.   
 
So my interactions with him at the time was, was always 
to say that:  Whatever it is that you do, the terms that you 
agree with and so on, make sure that the board agrees to 
this because it is the board that has the power to do this.   
20 
 
That the board has the power even if... which you have 
to answer if some that needs to be done at some stage.   
 
So that was my kind of advice that I would give him that 
the board must be at all times be the one that makes the 
decisions on this thing. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 34 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was your understanding at the time that 
Mr Mkwanazi approached that the board had or may have 
had, made a resolution in principle that Mr Gama should be 
reinstated without, at that stage, talking about the terms 
under which he should be reinstated? 
ADV MAPOMA:   So it was certainly and I needed to 
understand him.  But I never asked him for a board 
resolution or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But I understood that he had the authority. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To do... 
ADV MAPOMA:   To do what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...he asked me to assist him with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be that he said to you something 
to the effect that the board had given him the mandate or 
authority to negotiate a settlement with Mr Gama which 
would include a reinstatement or to negotiate Mr Gama’s 
reinstatement?  Is it possible that he might have put it, more 
or less, along those lines? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is possible.  And I also understood 
that, at the time he also had instructions from elsewhere to 
do this because we interacted with him quite a lot. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 35 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And then I would... we would continue(?) to 
each other and I was comfortable to ask him certain 
questions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...but not certain questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because he is my senior. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So you have to differ(?).  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And then have some sort of different 
streams(?).  So you do not ask him certain things but your 
understanding was all too clear that Mr Gama must be 
reinstated and he needed to do it cleanly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now you say that you understood or 
he had instructions from somewhere.  You want to elaborate 
on that?  Did he say he had been instructed or what was the 
position? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, he did say Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Make a reference to that.  Can you just 
tell me? 
ADV MAPOMA:   He did say that he was under an instruction 
to do it as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under instructions to do what? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 36 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   To reinstate Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To reinstate Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ask him who had instructed him? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I never asked him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you did not? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I know I had directions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   At various times, I would be made to 
understand that the instructions came from the presidency. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now when you say that you are not 
saying specifically in relation to the instructions but you are 
talking in relation to other matters relating to Mr Gama. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I am talking Chair in relation to the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
reinstatement 
of 
Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the discussion you had with him were 
to the effect that on the reinstatement of Mr Gama, the 
understanding was that the instructions came from the 
former President? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, and that the board had made that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 37 of 209 
 
decision as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the board had given him the 
mandate? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  You were 
speaking about a meeting that you held at Inanda. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that the meeting that you deal with 
in paragraph 9?  Sorry, in 19 of your affidavit, page 8? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is the meeting that I am referring 
to at paragraph 19.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I take it then that that meeting would 
have 
happened 
before 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
was 
concluded? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The meeting happened before the 
settlement agreement was concluded? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes.  Yes, I agree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Elsewhere in your affidavit, you talk of 
20 
a meeting held in the Magaliesberg area  Can you just name 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Mr Myburgh, before you go there.  
What was the purpose of that meeting at Inanda? 
ADV MAPOMA:   The purpose of that meeting was for 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 38 of 209 
 
Mr Mkwanazi to sit with Mr Gama and process the details of 
a settlement document, that is between Transnet and 
Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You also make reference to a meeting 
in the Magaliesberg area. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you deal with that meeting, 
10 
please? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I am just looking for the paragraph so that I 
just remind myself.  But I know that there was a meeting that 
was held.  It was an Exco meeting.  And my understanding at 
the time that because the board had made that decision, 
Mr Mkwanazi had to now brief Exco on the decision that had 
been made by the board because he was also chairing Exco.  
So he had now to brief the Exco members.  That is my 
understanding of that.  But I did not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And Exco being the Exco of Transnet? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The senior management.  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   The senior management of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Which was comprised by various people, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 39 of 209 
 
namely the CEO’s of the various divisions of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now in paragraph 21 and further, you 
go on to explain your involvement in the payment of legal 
fees. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is now, obviously, at a time 
after the conclusion of the settlement agreement. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have told the... highlighted 
for the Chairperson the provision of Clause 3.5 of the 
Settlement Agreement. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  I may be 
mistaken but I thought that when or rather, during or around 
the Magaliesberg meeting ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that there was an occasion when 
20 
Mr Mkwanazi met with Mr Gama alone which he knew about.  
I do not know whether that was a different one or that is a 
reference to the Inanda meeting. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is a different meeting, I would like 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 40 of 209 
 
to hear more about it.  Was there one meeting where 
Mr Mkwanazi had a one-on-one meeting with Mr Gama or 
were there two? 
ADV MAPOMA:   In my presence, there was one meeting 
where Mr Gama and Mr Mkwanazi met.  So in another 
meeting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...where I was but they met separately in 
some other room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   And we were in some other room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   At the Magaliesberg meeting, Mr Gama was 
not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Mr Mkwanazi... they informed me that 
he wanted to brief Exco there as to the board’s decision and 
what was happening with the reinstatement and so on and so 
on.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   So he... that is what he wanted me to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But he asked me to come to be there, so 
that if he needed me for something ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 41 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...he will then call me to... I do not know 
whether to explain to Exco, where we were, I think 
...[intervenes] . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...as Transnet.  But I was not an Exco 
member.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So I was not attending the meeting but I 
was at the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   But not inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, maybe he might have needed 
you in case there are legal... there were legal aspects to be 
explained to Exco. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So... Okay, I may have misunderstood 
when I thought there were two such meetings. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And they also used Magaliesberg very 
20 
cautiously because, I am not familiar with the time, but it 
might even out of Transnet ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...in the Magaliesberg area. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 42 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I am not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
might 
not 
accurate 
about 
Magaliesberg. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But the name, Magaliesberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because I remember of the news 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...in that area and we were in one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no.  That is fine. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But because Mr Myburgh is going to take 
you to the time when you deal with payments.  If we go back 
to the meeting in Inanda.  You say, Mr Mkwanazi wanted to 
have a meeting with Mr Gama where it would just be the two 
of them? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is what happened? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when... after that meeting, did 
20 
Mr Mkwanazi brief you about the discussion or some aspects 
of the discussion? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, he did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And which aspects were those? 
ADV MAPOMA:   The one that I remember specifically is the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 43 of 209 
 
one about when Mr Gama will be reinstated to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
MAPOMA: 
 
 
Mr 
Gama 
had 
been 
asking 
from 
Mr Mkwanazi to be reinstated as CEO of the group, just that 
group.  And Mr Mkwanazi was refusing that.  He wanted to 
reinstate him at TFR.  The CEO at TFR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the position is that there was a 
pending unfair dismissal dispute in terms of which Mr Gama 
sought to be reinstated in his position as CEO of TFR, that 
at that meeting, according to Mr Mkwanazi and in terms of 
10 
what he had told you, Mr Gama was no longer seeking 
reinstatement to the position at TFR? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he was in effect seeking to be 
appointed Group CEO of Transnet? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is a position he did not hold 
before? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is the position that he did not hold 
before and this was the position that Mr Mkwanazi was not 
20 
agreeing to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Mkwanazi did not agree to that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  So I was 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 44 of 209 
 
going to or let me take you to paragraph 21 and further of 
your affidavit, where you now deal with your involvement in 
trying to resolve the issue of legal costs.  Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How did you become involved in that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Okay.  Under the settlement agreement that 
was then signed, the reinstatement now became effective, as 
it were.  Although it had at a date that Mr Gama was going to 
start working in April somewhere.   
 
But there was the issue now of the payment of 
10 
Mr Gama’s legal fees.  The legal fees were in respect of his 
dispute, the labour dispute, up to the referral to the 
Bargaining Council.  That is my understanding of it.   
 
And before the disciplinary hearing started, Mr Gama 
had issued an application to the high court, seeking to stop 
the disciplinary hearing from going ahead.  So the court 
ruled against him.   
 
And Transnet was giving the cost order in the chamber.  
Now Mr Gama had incurred costs there.  Transnet had 
occurred costs there.   
20 
 
And it is Transnet who was supposed to pay his legal 
costs.  And the lawyers... I mean, Transnet’s legal team were 
instructed accordingly to cover those costs for Mr Gama.   
 
Now on the Bargaining Council of the matter, Mr Gama 
had incurred costs and Transnet had incurred costs as well 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 45 of 209 
 
there.  And Transnet wanted to recover its costs from that 
process as well.   
 
However, the settlement agreement now said something 
different.  It changed what was normal and asked Transnet to 
contribute.   
 
So 75% of Mr Gama’s legal costs that he had incurred at 
these two processes and there was a date that it must done, 
within 
14-days 
after 
he 
had 
presented 
certain 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the settlement agreement... in terms of 
10 
the settlement agreement, Transnet undertook to pay 75% of 
Mr Gama’s costs in regard to the high court application that 
Mr Gama had brought against Transnet? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which he had lost? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the high court had ordered him to pay 
Transnet’s costs? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, but in the settlement agreement, 
20 
Transnet undertook to pay him 75% of his costs in regard to 
that application? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Chair, the wording of the agreement on 
these aspects needs to be interpreted very carefully.  Firstly, 
the 75% or the 75% of taxed costs, not 75% of the costs but 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 46 of 209 
 
it should be taxed first.   
 
And this was costs that he had incurred.  So there was 
actually, that must have happened that he must have 
incurred these costs.  Now what happened ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of course, you know when they say... 
when an order says you are to pay somebody costs, it is 
always understood that those costs are either agreed or 
taxed.  So in this agreement there is no issue. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if there is no agreement, then it ought 
10 
to be taxed, ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   The agreement, the term of the agreement 
was specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Specific that it must be taxed? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That it must be taxed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Now subsequent to that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us finish with regard to what 
20 
Transnet undertook to pay in terms of costs.  In regard to the 
high court litigation that Mr Gama had brought which he had 
lost and he had been ordered by the high court to pay 
Transnet costs.  The settlement agreement said it was... they 
said, 
Transnet 
undertook 
to 
pay 
his 
taxed 
costs 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 47 of 209 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in regard to that application.  And then it 
said or Transnet also undertook to pay 75% of his taxed 
costs in relation to the unfair dismissal matter. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Chair, with your permission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...so that I do not misquote this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   At page 19 of the Exhibit 17, I think it is 17, 
10 
which is the third bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Which is the annexure in my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is where the settlement 
agreement is.  Ja? 
ADV 
MAPOMA: 
 
 
Now 
that... 
what 
is 
relevant, 
are 
paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   2.5 reads: 
“Transnet will make a contribution equivalent to 75% 
20 
of Mr Gama’s taxed legal costs incurred during 
Mr Gama’s high court application in respect of his 
unfair dismissal dispute referred to the Bargaining 
Council.” 
 
2.6: 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 48 of 209 
 
“Transnet undertakes that such contribution towards 
the legal costs incurred by Mr Gama, will be made 
within a period of 14-days after submission by 
Mr Gama after the relevant supporting documents.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So this is what I was asked to implement 
after this agreement was concluded.  And there were 
happens that then emanated from this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you talk to me about what 
happened when you were asked to implement, let me ask 
10 
this question.  This agreement, this issue of the legal costs, 
the undertaking by Transnet to pay Mr Gama’s legal costs, 
taxed legal costs or contribution to his legal costs in regard 
to the high court application is very unusual. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, I have never [laughing] in my 
experience of many, many years heard of a party undertaking 
to contribute to the costs of the other party who lost in the 
case against that party and that party had been ordered to 
pay this party’s costs.  I have never heard of anything like 
20 
that.  So it is very unusual.   
 
Now what I want to find out is, you being in the Legal 
Department of Transnet and you being somebody that 
Mr Mkwanazi had been taken along to some meetings 
relating to Mr Gama.   
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 49 of 209 
 
 
Were you asked to advise on any of the terms of the 
settlement agreement including the issue of costs, to give 
advice whether Transnet should agree to any such terms? 
ADV MAPOMA:   How this process Chair, as I recall it, 
happened, it goes like this.  When Mr Mkwanazi interacted 
with me or with Ghule and so on or with me, even 
individually, he would not say:  This is the term I want to 
include in the settlement.   
 
He would talk about options and that he had and I would 
advise him.  I will not... he will not say specifically:  This is 
10 
what I want in the agreement.  Must I put it there?  Do you 
say yes or no?  Would you recommend that I should put it 
there or not?   
 
He will not do it like that.  He would be very general with 
how he interacted with us and you will not even know that 
this is something that will end up in an agreement or this 
nature.   
 
Now in respect of legal costs, I never advised him to put 
that agreement in.  He did not ask me.  But later on, I learnt 
that Transnet had agreed to this, to this.  I would never have 
20 
advised ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Never advised ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   I agree with you, it is unusual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I never had heard of it myself. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 50 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   As the time, I did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I have never heard of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And when now the bill came, it was within 
14-days, they had to give us these documents, which is 
supporting them, what they said we must pay.   
 
They came with a long bill of costs which was 55 pages 
long which was in excess of R 12 million and I refused to pay 
10 
it at the time.   
 
And there were lot of interactions subsequently which I 
referred to in the affidavits.  I do not want to preamp my 
counsel.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he will take you through it. 
ADV MAPOMA:   He will take me, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   We will get it but... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Then a lot of problems then started when 
20 
all of this was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Would you have known if 
Mr Mkwanazi 
sought 
and 
obtained 
advise 
from 
some 
attorneys on whether to include these terms about costs in 
the settlement agreement or you might not have known? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 51 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I will not know, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not know? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I would not have known. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  I interrupted you when you 
were 
dealing 
with 
Mr 
Myburgh’s 
question 
about 
implementation.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, Mr Myburgh you can take it from 
there.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mapoma, I am going to deal with 
10 
the actual payments that were made when we deal with you 
second affidavit because there they are set.  But I just 
wanted to pick up from paragraph 22 and further of your 
affidavit.  You have already mentioned to the Chairperson 
that you received a 55 page bill of costs.  Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is correct Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And from whom did you receive that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   We have received it from Mr Langa who 
was the... Themba Langa.  Themba Langa Attorneys who 
were representing Mr Gama at the time. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what was the total amount of that 
bill? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It was in the excess of R 12 million. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what view did you form in relation 
to the bill? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 52 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I formed the view that it was ridiculous.  
There were a lot of faults in it.  Inaccuracies.  I went through 
it very carefully.  And on the face of it, prima facie, it was 
ridiculous.  I told Mr Langa that I am refusing to pay it.   
 
There were a number of things that I had pointed out to 
him at the time and how they calculated the distances for 
instance, how they calculated the time of consultations.  I 
 
It just did not make sense to me at the time.  So I was... 
I refused to pay it outright.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you mentioned later on in your 
10 
affidavit that there was a point where you indicated to 
Mr Langa that you might report him to the Law Society.  Is 
that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is correct Chair.  That is correct 
because he was insisting that we must pay this money.  And 
at the time, there are correspondence, there are phone calls 
as pressure to pay the money.   
 
And I did say to him:  Look, this bill is overrated and I 
have a good sense to report you to the Law Society but I 
never reported at the time. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you ever receive a letter from 
Mr Langa in relation to this issue? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Mr Langa sent me a letter which was 
very insulting.  He was accusing me of many things.  It was 
either transformation.  I was resistant(?) to assist the black 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 53 of 209 
 
people.   
 
He was saying that because I had a job at Transnet.  I 
brought a new other thing and so on and so on.  So it was a 
letter that was full of insults which I not agreed(?) to at the 
time.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you turn to another topic and I 
will come back perhaps to the issue of costs when we are 
concluding this affidavit.  But in your affidavit your referred 
to a Mr Siyabonga Mhlango.   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who is he? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Siyabonga Mhlango was a special advisor 
to the Minister of Public Enterprises at the time, Minister 
Gigaba.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you have any dealings with 
Mr Mhlango around this time? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, in the reinstatement of Mr Gama and 
whatever was happening, I received a call from him in the 
evening going home and he was questioning the delay that 
Transnet was...  
20 
 
He was accusing Transnet of delaying the reinstatement 
of Mr Gama and the sort of actually it to me at the time.   
 
And he was not angry or anything but he was just raising 
it to me as a concern that he had, that the minister had to 
say that Transnet is doing and I should make it a point that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 54 of 209 
 
things are speeded up.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And he called me two times.  He called me 
once and I told him that this is not my responsibility.  I am 
merely assisting Mr Mkwanazi to do what he says I must do.   
 
And the last conversation we had, I was a bit stern with 
him and told him not to call me again because I did not 
report to him or his minister to the president.   
 
So he must stop calling me and he never called me 
again.  I never spoken to Siyabonga Mhlango again. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You made a reference to the 
president and the minister but I did not hear what you were 
saying about them. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I told him the second time that he must not 
call me again about this issue of Mr Gama because I am not 
answerable to him, that is Mr Mhlango.  I was also not 
answerable to the minister.  I am also not answerable to the 
president.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   So he must not call me about this and 
speeding up of things and so on.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   They need to talk to Mr Mkwanazi if they 
talk about anything relating to Mr Gama.  So this was not 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 55 of 209 
 
something I had to answer to them at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Why did you refer to the minister 
and the president when you said that to him? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is because Mr Mhlango indicated to 
me that there was a concern of the delay from the 
presidency and from the minister.   
 
And what was strange to me is that he, even though 
there was a delay from them, but he... I did not think that he 
had the authority or the right to what he related to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   So this was my annoyance with him at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Which I explained to him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did Mr Mhlango refer to the president 
or did he refer to some other term? 
ADV MAPOMA:   He referred to the presidency but he did 
not say the president. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What did he say? 
ADV MAPOMA:   He would use a language that made you 
20 
understand that he was referring to the president. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What language? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Let me see in my affidavit because I think 
in my affidavit I did mention this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can refresh your memory in your 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 56 of 209 
 
affidavit if you... 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I ask you to go to paragraph 27, 
please.  At page 12. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, he referred to number one.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That you understood to mean the 
president? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is how I understood, yes.  And this 
was not... the involvement of the presidency in sorting(?) of 
things was not strange to me because we had previously 
10 
received a complaint from the presidency about some matter 
that we had.   
 
Someone 
who 
had 
sued 
Transnet, 
allegedly 
that 
delivered some wheels at Transnet Rail Engineering.  So 
suing Transnet for R 8 million plus.   
 
And we find that this claim at the time, we were briefed 
Advocate Natal(?) and we investigated and found that no 
wheels were ever delivered.   
 
But the plaintiff at the time was insisting that he must 
paid and laid complaints up to the presidency and the 
20 
presidency wrote us a letter which I had to answer.   
 
So to me there was nothing new about queries coming 
from the president’s route about Transnet was doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do you remember who the plaintiff 
was in the matter you are ...[intervenes]  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 57 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I can find out Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can find out? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because I know the specifics ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
MAPOMA: 
 
 
...of 
the 
particulars 
of 
claim, 
the 
enterprise(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   I forget the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the gist of the president’s letter 
or complaint? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   The gist Chair... sorry to interrupt.  Was 
that why were we not settling the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what the letter was saying? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, why was the matter not settled or it 
had been settled?  And at the time, this was a matter that 
was also reported to at the board because we had a legal 
report that we did for litigation matters ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...which I will hand to my supervisor to take 
and table it at Exco.  It would be a report about the 
20 
decision(?) of Transnet.  And this was this matter including 
some of the bigger(?) matters at Transnet, also became part 
of the board that said we will now have to meet with the 
board itself.   
 
But ultimately, that matter was settled because the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 58 of 209 
 
plaintiff withdrew the case on the day of trial at the high 
court here in Johannesburg because we totally, totally 
decided that we are not going to pay it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, did you say that this was a case 
where the plaintiff was supposed to have delivered some 
goods to Transnet? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja, indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and he alleged or it alleged that I had 
delivered the goods. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your investigations at Transnet 
revealed that no such goods had been delivered. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was claiming payments for those 
goods. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would defend the matter. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there was a letter from the 
president ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...asking why you were not settling the 
matter. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Despite that letter, you did not settle the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 59 of 209 
 
matter. 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You continued to fight it. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then ultimately the plaintiff withdrew the 
claim. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, on the morning of the trial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Without Transnet paying anything. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Without Transnet paying anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  It is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at seventeen past eleven.  
Let us take the short tea-break.  We will resume at twenty-
five to twelve.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, I have been asked 
by the secretariat to bring to your attention a letter.  I do 
not know if you have been given a copy, from NPM 
Attorneys representing Abalozi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, I have not seen it. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 60 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps if I could hand it up? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson in summary it seems 
that what has happened here is that a 3(e) was served on 
Abalozi.  You will remember they were previously GNS and 
they were provided with a 3(3) in relation to Mr Todd’s 
affidavit dealing GNS.  They write to you effectively saying 
that what Mr Todd says in his affidavit is privileged, they 
say it is unuseful.  At paragraph 3, that is simply is his 
opinion, it is a legal memorandum and they, it appears, 
10 
want a ruling from you that they – the affidavit must either 
be knocked out or that they do not have to respond to it.  I 
do not think this is something that needs to be dealt with 
now, subject to your view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if they want to come and move any 
application they should do so.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  Before 
the tea adjournment you had dealt with your interaction 
with Mr Mahlangu.  I just want to go back and ask you, did 
you know Mr Mahlangu? 
20 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, I know him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how do you know him? 
MR MAPOMA:   Well, Mr Mahlangu had been a partner at a 
firm of attorneys called [indistinct] 02.35 Mahlangu, might 
not be naming it correctly but they were a member of the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 61 of 209 
 
Transnet legal panel.  Subsequently they merged – again, I 
do not know whether I am using the right word, with 
Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs and he was director at 
Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs.  So he would visit me at 
times regarding legal work that his firm of attorneys were 
engaged in with Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did – Mr Mahlangu, does he hail 
from the Eastern Cape? 
MR MAPOMA:   Not to my knowledge but I know that he 
was friends with somebody I knew from the Eastern Cape 
10 
or his family I knew. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you have told the Chairperson 
about your discussions with Mr Mahlangu and what you 
said to him the last time that he phoned you. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you report on that discussion 
that you had with Mr Mahlangu to anybody? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To whom did you report? 
MR 
MAPOMA: 
 
 
I 
informed 
Mr 
Mkhwanazi 
of 
the 
20 
conversation the following morning and the reason for that 
was I was worried that Mr Mahlangu might report our 
conversation to his minister and the minister might call Mr 
Mahlangu – I mean Mr Mkhwanazi to complain that I had 
not spoken – know well with Mr Mhlanga, something like 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 62 of 209 
 
that.  So I thought that I should warn Mr Mkhwanazi that 
this conversation between me and Mahlangu and this is 
how I responded to him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you did that? 
MR MAPOMA:   I did that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then if we go back to your 
affidavit at page 12 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, when you did that what was 
Mr Mkhwanazi’s reaction to that report by you? 
MR MAPOMA:   No, he really did not do anything, there 
10 
was nothing to be done, I think just took note of 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you just wanted him not to be 
surprised? 
MR MAPOMA:   I just wanted him to be aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he got a call. 
MR MAPOMA:   If he got a call about my conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MAPOMA:   There was that conversation that had 
happened. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  If you go back to your 
affidavit at page 12 you discussion at paragraph 28 and 
then 
at 
paragraph 
29 
you 
deal 
with 
the 
settlement 
agreement, we have dealt with that.  And just a few things 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 63 of 209 
 
to finish off this affidavit, we come to the second one.   
 
You have already told the Chairperson, Mr Mapoma, 
about a letter that you received from Ms de Lange.     
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you ever bring that letter to the 
attention of anyone within Transnet?  
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, I showed it to my colleagues, I 
showed it to Ms Stephen, who was my supervisor at the 
time, and asked her, you know, to intervene on my behalf 
and talk to Mr Gama about this because the letter was very 
10 
– it was in very unsavoury terms and in my view it was 
tantamount to me being insulted by one of the executives 
because a letter from his attorneys, in my mind, it is a 
letter from him so I showed it to Ms Stephen at the time 
and I asked her to intervene because it is written, should 
not be dealing like this with me and/or anybody else.  I 
thought it was very wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying the letter was from 
Langa Attorneys. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who were Mr Gama’s attorneys? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But because they represented Mr Gama 
you took what they were saying as coming from Mr Gama. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 64 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you reported it to your senior. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that he could – she could take it up 
with Mr Gama. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:     And at this time had Mr Gama been 
reinstated? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, Mr Gama was back at work at the 
time. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what was the reaction of Ms 
Stephens? 
MR MAPOMA:   She laughed at me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She? 
MR MAPOMA:   She laughed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She laughed.  Did she read the letter? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, she did, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said the letter was quite 
insulting as far as you were concerned. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mapoma, was there a 
time where other employees of Transnet spoke to you 
about Mr Gama’s costs? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 65 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry again, Mr Myburgh, maybe 
just to conclude.  Ms Stephens laughed after reading the 
letter and that was the end of her involvement on the issue 
or was there some discussion that followed between the 
two of you after she had laughed? 
MR MAPOMA:   Nothing, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of her 
reaction? 
MR MAPOMA:   She did not see the significance of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She did not see the seriousness of the 
10 
issue? 
MR MAPOMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you left it at that? 
MR MAPOMA:   I left it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I had asked you 
whether there were other employees of Transnet who 
approached you in relation to Mr Gama’s costs. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, I was approached as well at different 
times by Ms [indistinct] 08.03 Sekela(?) and Mr [indistinct] 
20 
08.08 at different times who came to my office and 
discussed this issue of Mr Gama’s legal fees that I was 
refusing to pay and I also explained to them the times they 
were there my reasoning by the time.  So they did come to 
my office to ask about this. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 66 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of why 
they – where they came into the matters of Mr Gama’s 
costs?   
MR MAPOMA:   Chair, they were colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In legal language what was their locus 
standi on the matter? 
MR MAPOMA:   They had no locus standi in legal language 
but we were colleagues, we got on very well together and I 
– at the time I took no offence by them coming to enquire.  
I just explained to them …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is how it ended. 
MR MAPOMA:   And then that is how it ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR MAPOMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you and then the last two 
paragraphs of your affidavit you say that: 
“Mr Molefe was then appointed as the CEO.  He 
never asked me about legal fees of Mr Gama.” 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes.  Yes, Mr Molefe then came in and he 
20 
never interacted with me on this except when there was a 
query from the ministry, Public Enterprise ministry about 
Mr Gama’s fees.  And he wrote a note on a memo pad that 
I must draft a response for him to the ministry, which I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then perhaps I can just ask you 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 67 of 209 
 
two questions, were you – and you might have already 
dealt with this, were you involved yourself in negotiating 
the settlement agreement with Mr Gama?  
MR MAPOMA:     No.  I have never met Mr Gama, I have 
never interacted with him at all.  If I would meet in the lift 
perhaps, it would be greeting but I absolutely had no 
interactions with him at all. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want now, Mr Mapoma to take you 
please to your second affidavit.  That you find at page 23 
and further. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that, Mr Myburgh.  I know that 
you have said that you had no part in negotiating the 
settlement agreement.  
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but you were – you held a senior 
position in the legal department of Transnet and Transnet – 
part of your job was to give legal advice to Transnet, is 
that right? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now when you did see the 
20 
settlement agreement and you saw its terms you obviously 
saw that one of the terms was that Mr Gama I think was 
being given a final written warning which would be – which 
was valid for six months but retrospectively.  A settlement 
agreement was being concluded on the 23 February 2011, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 68 of 209 
 
that warning was said to have commenced on the 29 June, 
is that right? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2010. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore would have expired on the 
29 or 28 December 2010. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you have an understanding of what 
that part of the settlement agreement meant at a practical 
10 
level?  Are you able to say something, being a legal 
adviser to Transnet knowing that you were not asked for 
your opinion but seeing that, did you take a view about 
what it meant to have that kind of clause in the settlement 
agreement? 
MR MAPOMA:    One of the terms [indistinct] 12.44 it was 
[indistinct] 12.49 that Mr Gama could come back to work 
immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But to the extent that the 
settlement agreement said the warning would have been 
20 
valid for six months did it not mean that by the time the 
settlement agreement was signed there was no warning 
anymore? 
MR MAPOMA:   I would mean that the sanction had been 
served, as it were. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 69 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MAPOMA:   And the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even before the settlement. 
MR MAPOMA:   Even before the settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:   Because at the bargaining council, as I 
understood this thing at the time, that Mr Gama was 
complaining about the actual finding of guilt, he was 
complaining about the sanction itself.  So if now the finding 
of guilt stands and then the sanction has been made the 
10 
way it was, it means that the matter was finalised and he 
could come back to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:   Without the matter going to the bargaining 
council for it to determine the sanction that he had been 
given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:   So Transnet took it upon itself to decide on 
the sanction, as it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:   Because the sanction had been decided by 
whereby [indistinct] 14.12 was chairing the disciplinary 
hearing, so they sought to view [indistinct] 14.19 I suppose 
without it going to any form of formal legal process like the 
bargaining council, through that.  So this is what they had 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 70 of 209 
 
decided to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At a practical level did it mean that there 
was any risk to Mr Gama in any way of this warning being 
taken into account if there was  - he committed another 
misconduct after he came back or far as you know? 
MR MAPOMA:   As I am sitting here, Chair, there would 
have been no risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There would have been no risk. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Had there been any settlements 
10 
before in relation to dismissal disputes at Transnet which 
had been settled on a basis where a warning was given but 
it had lapsed before a settlement happened? 
MR MAPOMA:   Not to my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to your knowledge? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes because matters like this, dismissals, 
disciplinary hearings and so on were mainly dealt with by 
HR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:   Were not through legal. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay. 
MR MAPOMA:   So there will be ones who will be better 
positioned to answer that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 71 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you do not know whether they were 
involved in advising on this? 
MR MAPOMA:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr 
Mapoma, at paragraph 4 of your second affidavit at page 
24 you make reference to the fact that you had then 
received two affidavits from the Commission. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One from Ms Mohlabi the Group 
10 
company secretary of Transnet and the other from Mr 
Mhlangu.  
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have been asked to 
comment on them. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to identify those 
affidavits because I am going to cross-refer you to them in 
your evidence.  If you could please go to – keep that 
bundle open where it is, now turn to bundle 1.   You should 
20 
have flags there, stickers.  Could you turn please to flag 
number 2?  There you find an affidavit of Ms Mafabe(?) 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes,. I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That deals with legal fees and there 
is a whole series of annexures which we will come to in a 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 72 of 209 
 
moment.  Is that the affidavit that you received? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, that is the affidavit I am referring to 
that I received.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then the affidavit of Mr 
Mahlangu, could I ask you - you have the stickers as me – 
to turn to flag 4.  4 And 5 are together. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you there? 
MR MAPOMA:     Yes I am. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is the affidavit of Mr Mahlangu at 
10 
page 169 and if you turn forward to page 172 you see that 
he addresses the allegations that you had made against 
him.    
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is this the other affidavit that you 
received?  
MR MAPOMA:    Yes it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now if we go back to your 
second, did these affidavits help you in working out the 
sequence of events at all?  
20 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how did they assist you in that 
regard? 
MR MAPOMA:    Well, firstly, they would have helped me – 
well, they helped me in relation as to when Mr Mahlangu 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 73 of 209 
 
would have called me.  And secondly, as to the payments 
made for the legal costs that were referred to on the 
settlement agreement and later on I also remembered that 
later on it was also on the opinion that was sought in 
relation to the bonuses as well that are referred to in the 
affidavit.  But, I do not think they referred them in the 
affidavit, I am not sure.     
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What did you conclude then as to 
when did Mr Mahlangu phone you? 
MR MAPOMA:   It will have been before the settlement 
10 
agreement.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the demand from Langa 
Attorneys? 
MR MAPOMA:     It would have been after settlement 
agreement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then you say at paragraph 6 that: 
“The 
information 
sought, 
presumably 
from 
the 
Commission, relates to the unsuccessful High Court 
application by Gama and costs relating to his unfair 
dismissal dispute.” 
20 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now at paragraph 7 and this is text 
that you have already given or evidence that you have 
already given.  I just want to take you for the purposes of 
the record to that judgment.  You mention here that Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 74 of 209 
 
Gama has sued all the board members of Transnet and 
there had been a defending of that action by different legal 
firms.  Can I just take you please to bundle 2?   Are you 
there?  
MR MAPOMA:     Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And could I ask you to turn to page 
142? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So as an advocate you will be 
familiar with this, this is a judgment extracted from SAFLII. 
10 
MR MAPOMA:     Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it is in the matter of Gama v 
Transnet dated the 7 October 2009.  Do you see that? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I would like you please to go to 
the end of the judgment which you find at page 162.  At the 
foot of the page, paragraph 121 the order made by the 
court is: 
“The application is dismissed with costs including 
the costs of the 1 s t to 3 r d respondents and the 4 t h to 
20 
13 t h 
respondents 
excluding 
the 
10 t h 
and 
11 t h 
respondents.  Such costs to include the costs of two 
counsel.” 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I see that.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then over the page at 163 it 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 75 of 209 
 
reflects 
there 
that 
the 
1 s t 
to 
3 r d 
respondent 
was 
represented by Bowman Gilfillan Attorneys, correct? 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that the 4 t h to 9 t h and the 12 t h to 
13 t h were represented by Eversheds Attorneys. 
MR MAPOMA:     Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Some familiar advocates involved 
too. 
MR MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now at paragraphs 8 and 9 of your 
10 
second affidavit, this is evidence that you have already 
given, you have explained to the Chairperson that while Mr 
Gama was supposed to pay the costs of Transnet and the 
board members, Transnet agreed to reverse that and pay 
75% of his costs.  
MR MAPOMA:    Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what was your view of that?  I 
think you have already expressed it but then you deal with 
it in paragraph 9. 
MR MAPOMA:   This was an usual – this was strange, to 
20 
say the least and I found  no rationality for this, Chair.  I 
struggled with it, I could not find the legal basis for it and 
because there was an instruction that later came verbally 
again that the money must be paid from Group Legal.  I 
then took a particular interest as to how one was going to 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 76 of 209 
 
account to auditors for this and I was reluctant to pay it but 
the instruction came that Transnet must pay the money. 
 
And this came after Mr Langa was struggling to 
provide documents which are referred in paragraph 2.6 of 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
which 
would 
have 
justified 
Transnet paying the money.  So these documents were not 
forthcoming except the 55 page bill of costs which I had 
rejected. 
 
So after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, correspondence, 
emails, telephones and so on, then a decision was taken 
10 
somewhere and then to me that Transnet instead of it 
asking for Mr Langa to bring proof of the costs that he had 
incurred, Transnet must then pay 75% of the taxed costs of 
its own attorneys.  In other words, Transnet had deemed to 
costs that it incurred as costs that were liability to Mr 
Langa that they will have to pay, so they must just pay it 
in, that money.  This is very difficult to explain. 
 
And then after I received that instruction, being 
uncomfortable with it, I went to see Mr Singh, who was the 
CFO at the time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that Mr Anoj Singh? 
MR MAPOMA:    That is Mr Anoj Singh, yes.  So that he 
can give me the go-ahead to pay this money in the manner 
that I explain and he agreed that I should pay and then I 
made a note on the bills by my own handwriting at the time 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 77 of 209 
 
and instructed my office to pay the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in terms of the settlement agreement 
between Transnet and Mr Gama, Transnet had undertaken 
to pay  - to pay, to make a contribution… 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …of 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed legal 
costs. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In respect of his unsuccessful High 
Court application. 
10 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And another contribution of 75% of Mr 
Gama’s taxed legal costs in relation to the unfair dismissal 
dispute that he had referred to the Transnet Bargaining 
Council. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what the settlement agreement 
said about costs. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now are you saying that Mr Gama’s 
20 
attorneys failed to provide supporting documents in order 
for Transnet to pay its contribution to Mr Gama’s legal 
costs in regards to the two matters in accordance with the 
settlement agreement? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 78 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And because they were struggling to 
furnish 
such 
supporting 
documents, 
somebody 
within 
Transnet or a group of people within Transnet came up with 
the idea that what you must do in order to solve this 
problem of Mr Gama’s attorneys not being able to furnish 
supporting documents, what you must do is look at the 
legal costs that Transnet had paid to its own attorneys or 
to its own lawyers in regard to the two matters and 
calculate 75% thereof and then pay that amount to Mr 
Gama’s attorneys?  Is that what you are saying? 
10 
MR MAPOMA:    Just a little bit of correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAPOMA:    On what you are saying, Chair.  Transnet 
had a cost s order against Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    Which was taxed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    This money was supposed to be paid by 
Mr Gama to Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    So instead of him paying it to Transnet, 
the decision then was that 75% of that cost that was due to 
Transnet must then be deemed to be due to Mr Gama and 
would be paid to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So that relates – that is the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 79 of 209 
 
cost order that had been granted by the High Court in 
favour of Transnet against Mr Gama in regard to the High 
Court application? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That cost order had said Mr Gama 
should pay Transnet’s legal costs as well as the legal cost 
of various directors of the board of Transnet who had been 
cited. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And had opposed his application. 
10 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Transnet then said Transnet must 
calculate those costs. 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which Mr Gama was supposed to pay to 
him. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then calculate 75% thereof and pay 
that to Mr Gama’s attorneys. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, that was the [indistinct] 29.08. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MAPOMA:    Just that there were two attorneys on 
Transnet’s side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    Because the board members, they decided 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 80 of 209 
 
to use different sets of attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    So there were two attorneys now against 
whom Mr Gama had to pay costs, as it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja because he had lost and both attorneys 
for the different board members had cost orders against 
him.  So this is what he had to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Mr Mapoma, let us go 
through the documents and this may become clearer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, I just want to mention this 
because it is in my mind. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can see how you deal with it, 
maybe that you deal with it later.  I am wondering whether 
the – what Transnet decided to do might have ended up 
giving Mr Gama more than he should have got if the 
settlement agreement is to be interpreted as meaning that 
20 
Transnet was supposed to pay 75% of his cost to his own 
lawyers. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am wondering whether this would 
not have ended up being much more than that.  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 81 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We will come to those figures, it 
certainly did because as has been clarified Chair it seems 
that the bills of Eversheds and Bowmans were used as a 
proxy really for Mr Gama’s costs, strange as that may be, 
but what then happened is he was paid his costs in any 
case, as we will see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And of course he was absolved of 
responsibility or liability of paying our costs so it is really a 
sort of a three way issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mapoma let us go to the 
documents, at paragraph 9 you say three lines from the 
bottom: 
“However I auctioned it as instructed.” 
I also refer the Commission to the handwritten notes dated 
28 March I made it the time on two bills, one from Bowman 
Gilfillan and one from Eversheds.  I want to go to those 
handwritten notes and then your evidence might I think 
become clearer.  If you go to file one, bundle one, could I 
20 
ask you to turn please to page 93.  This is an annexure to 
Ms Mxlabe’s affidavit.  There is a handwritten note, is that 
the note you refer to? 
ADV MAPOMA:   This is the note I am referring to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if you turn to page one 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 82 of 209 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you talking about the handwritten 
annotations at page 93? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At the foot of the page yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come back to that 
Mr Mapoma but if you go to page 88 could you confirm that 
this is a bill of fees and disbursements due to Bowman 
Gilfillan? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, so let’s go back to 93, so it 
had been taxed and allowed in the sum of R353 457, 
correct?   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what does your handwritten note 
say?  
ADV MAPOMA:   My handwritten note reads as follows: 
“Transnet to pay 75% [Seventy five percent] of the 
taxed costs above, that is 75% of R353 457,36 
[Three 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
three 
thousand 
four 
20 
hundred and fifty seven rand thirty six cents].  
Payment has been approved as the attached memo 
[discussed with Anoj] and I signed it and there is a 
date of 28 March 2011.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, now we will come to that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 83 of 209 
 
memo in a moment but you made the same annotation if 
you go over the page to page 94 there is another taxed bill 
in relation to Bowman Gilfillan. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go to page 96 would you 
confirm that you made the same annotation on that 
...[intervenes]   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I definitely did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then those are the Bowman 
Gilfillan documents, if you go to page 112 these are fees 
10 
and disbursements due to Eversheds. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I could ask you to turn forward 
then to page 117 we find the same annotation there, is that 
correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then over the page another tax 
bill in respect of Eversheds and if you go to page 120 we 
find the same annotation. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes that is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you say in all of these 
annotations that you had discussed the matter with Mr 
Singh. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a particular reason why you 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 84 of 209 
 
made these annotations what you wrote at the bottom of 
each one of them.     
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes normally attorneys’ bills when they 
come to my office I would not go to Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And discuss them.  I will not even go to 
my direct supervisor to discuss them.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I had authority to make payments when 
payments were due to attorneys for work done, but in this 
10 
particular instance I was not happy with how this one was 
to 
be 
paid 
and 
Mr 
Mkhwanazi 
has 
asked 
me 
to 
...[indistinct] as I am explaining it to you.  Now out of my 
unhappiness I struggled in my mind how this can be 
explained towards that, because when auditors come they 
will ask me how do you explain that, so I went to him and 
said to him I don’t recall the particular conversation, the 
words, but I would have said to him this is what my 
instruction is and I am asked to pay this money.   Now from 
your position as CFO must I do this, because when the 
20 
auditors come I wanted to have somebody who has seen 
enough, this thing with the CFO who had agreed that 
payments must be made in this fashion and I think I will 
have asked or told Mr Makonas as well that I am going to 
go and ask Mr Singh around this, he would known about it, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 85 of 209 
 
I would not have done it behind his back, so I had this 
instruction and this comfort at least of knowing that this is 
what the executives approved and I made the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you say in your annotations that 
you had discussed it with Anoj, Mr Singh and you’ve 
explained that and why you escalated it to him, but you 
also talk of approval as per the attached memo.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And this is something that you deal 
10 
with at paragraph 10 of your affidavit, you say I also refer 
to the memo I wrote to Mr Singh dated 23 March.  Could I 
take you please to that memo.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle one, same bundle that you 
are in, at page 104.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that the memorandum? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That’s the memorandum I am referring to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it is addressed to Mr Singh and 
20 
from you dated the 23 r d of March? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I want to take you to your 
motivation, your quotes, the relevant clauses from the 
settlement agreement and then you deal with the financial 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 86 of 209 
 
implications. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say 75% of the attached 
invoices have to be paid to Gama’s attorneys and then if 
you go down the breakdown of cost is as follows, talk 
about the South Gauteng High Court litigation, over the 
page tax costs awarded to Eversheds Attorneys were X and 
Transnet in terms of the settlement agreement must pay 
75% and then you go on to say the tax cost awarded to 
Bowmans were X and in terms of the settlement agreement 
10 
Transnet must pay 75%. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you say we’re still awaiting 
the tax costs from Langa, Mr Gama’s attorney.  It is 
recommended that when such has been obtained payment 
of 75% of these costs is also approved.   You go on to seek 
a recommendation that based on the motivation of that I 
recommend that the contribution to legal fees must be paid 
as per settlement agreement and you sign that and then 
who are the signatories after that? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...[Indistinct] and Ms Stephan and 
...[indistinct] Stephan, and Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what – there’s a handwritten 
annotation there, whose writing is that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is Mr Molefe’s handwriting. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 87 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what does it say? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It says Mapoma I do not see the need for 
a letter on the PFMA list and the ...[indistinct] opinion.  If 
you don’t want the document to leak why do you make 
copies and attach it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there something in the memo where 
you were giving a lecture on the PFMA and risk and 
Deneys Reitz opinion? 
ADV MAPOMA:   The page prior to that one Chair where 
we had signed, at the top of the page this is now page 105. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV MAPOMA:   There is reference to the Public Finance 
Management Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MAPOMA:   And then below that there’s a paragraph 
written to an opinion where it is said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:   And then on page 104 under the heading 
“motivation” there’s a sentence that says a ...[indistinct] 
agreement is attached. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, okay.  Oh I am sorry is this a 
memo that Mr Singh saw or would have seen before giving 
you the go ahead to pay? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 88 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You also refer to later on in your 
affidavit at paragraph 12 to a memorandum that you wrote 
to Mr Molefe, so we have dealt with the memorandum to Mr 
Singh.  The memorandum to Mr Molefe could I ask you 
please again in Bundle 1 to turn to page 142. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Just before we go there counsel I just 
want to bring to your attention and the Chair ’s attention the 
dates on the memo that you are referring to that is at page 
106, and the ...[indistinct] handwritten notations as well 
because all of that would have come after the approval that 
10 
we received in that memo if you look at the dates.  Then 
we can go to the memo that you are referring to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I think the point that you make 
is that Mr Molefe signs on the 28 t h of March and that is the 
same day as your handwritten annotations, is that what you 
say? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Fair enough, so if we then go to your 
memorandum to Mr Molefe at page 142 of Bundle one is 
this the memorandum?  
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes that is the memorandum. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To Brian Molefe, Group Chief 
Executive and it is cc’d to Mr Mkhwanazi the Chairperson 
of the Board, and it is from you, dated 17 August. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 89 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What gave rise to this memorandum?  
What caused you to write it? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Okay, there was a letter that was 
received by Transnet by Mr Molefe’s office from the 
Ministry, from the Public, Minister of Public Enterprises 
regarding the complaint that Mr Gama had laid there about 
outstanding legal fees in the matter of Transnet so a letter 
would have been sent to Mr Molefe and a response would 
have been required and Mr Molefe asked me to draft a 
response for him. 
10 
 
In fact he asked me to explain to him first and then 
later on he asked me now to draft the letter but I first had 
to explain to him what had happened so that he could 
answer and then he said no I must draft the answer for 
him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright well let’s first deal with as 
you say your explanation.   And to echo what you have said 
to the Chairperson you see at page 142 paragraph 3, it 
records the Director General of the Department of Public 
Enterprises sent a letter to the Group Chief Executive 
20 
dated 
16 
August 
advising 
that 
Langa 
Attorneys 
is 
complaining etcetera about the fees.   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I want to – because things are 
clarified now very clearly, just deal with the headings how 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 90 of 209 
 
were the figures calculated.  You say at paragraph 6 that 
Mr Gama incurred legal costs in two matters, the first is his 
application in the High Court, in which Transnet used two 
sets of attorneys, Bowman Gilfillan and Deneys Reitz, is 
that correct, Deneys Reitz? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I might be mistaken, it could have 
been Eversheds, but there were talks about Deneys. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well we’ve seen from the judgment 
that it was Eversheds. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So I agree, the reference there should be 
10 
to Eversheds and not Deneys. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The second matter in which he 
incurred costs is the labour matter, in which he was 
charged in a disciplinary process, the costs at paragraph 7 
in the High Court were granted in Transnet’s favour by the 
Court, these costs were supposed to have been paid by Mr 
Gama, on reaching settlement with Mr Gama Transnet 
sought and obtained the tax bills from these two firms of 
attorneys and paid 75% of the total costs.  The taxed 
amount included the fees of counsel which are indicated as 
20 
disbursements in the attorneys’ bills. 
 
The amounts of R696 000 and R319 000 were paid 
to Langa Attorneys on 28 March 2011 being 75% of the tax 
costs incurred by Transnet to its attorneys. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 91 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The total amount paid to Langa 
Attorneys on 28 March was therefore R1 016 000.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is that right?  
ADV MAPOMA:   That’s correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then you go on and you say at 
paragraph 8: 
“Mr Gama’s own attorneys in both the High Court 
application 
and 
the 
labour 
matter 
was 
Langa 
Attorneys.” 
10 
And then I think you explained already that there were 
concerns about its bill. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is that right.  Can you then pick up 
please at paragraph 9, what do you say there?  
ADV MAPOMA:   In paragraph 9 I say after a number of 
meetings from which it becomes clear that the parties will 
not reach agreement Transnet instructed its legal advisors 
to instruct the private taxing master to tax the bill which 
was done, and the total amount came to R2 293 627,68, 
20 
according to the taxing master.   ...[Indistinct] consultants 
...[indistinct] the bill was instructed not to cooperate with 
the taxation process.   Normally in a taxation process the 
parties who represent to justify its various costs its claims 
it is entitled to.  If the party opts to be absent they cannot 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 92 of 209 
 
claim ...[indistinct].  Transnet then paid some of – I 
mentioned the amount, on 9 June 2011 to the attorneys 
being 75% of the taxed costs. 
 
Now these are in reference now to it’s another 
process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Well so Transnet instruct its legal 
advisors to instruct a private taxing master to tax the bill.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This was done and the amount came 
to as you say R2.293million and then 75% of that was paid 
10 
which was R1 720 000.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now did you ever see the Taxing 
Master ’s memorandum and the taxed bill?  
ADV MAPOMA:   I would have seen it at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me take you please to Bundle 2 
and could I ask you to turn to page 167. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So 167 reflects a payment to Langa 
Attorneys of R1 720 000, the same figure you refer to at 
20 
paragraph 9 of your memo to Mr Molefe, correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you will see over the page at 
168 there’s a page of the memorandum that is stamped 
Transnet paid/betaal. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 93 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
We 
then 
sourced 
the 
full 
memorandum and that you see at 169 and it runs all the 
way through to 174, do you see that?  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And at 174 the tax consultant comes 
to an amount due of R2 293 000, it is the same figure that 
you referred to at paragraph 9 of your memo to Mr Molefe. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what the consultant concludes at 
10 
19 is when the above figures are considered kindly bear in 
mind that as per my instructions I marked the bill as 
liberally as I thought possible, taking into considering the 
difficulty of the matter, the importance to client and the 
fact that the agreement stated that the respondent agrees 
to pay payment of fees and disbursements as between 
attorney and own client, do you see that?  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I see that. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
And 
then 
attached 
to 
this 
memorandum was the taxed bill and it runs from page 175 
20 
through to 209, do you see that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you see this at the time? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Well I am not sure whether it is the same 
one that I saw, the one that I refused to pay the time.  At 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 94 of 209 
 
this particular moment we had asked Norton Rose I think to 
appoint a Taxing Master to deal with the thing which I think 
they did, but I am not sure whether I would have seen this, 
but if it was sent to my office I would have seen it.   I will 
not deny that I saw it but I can’t recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if I could, I am going to take 
you to the bill but perhaps you can go back to the 
memorandum. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At paragraph 3.8 at page 170 I have 
10 
not allowed any travelling for the attorney to consultations 
with counsel, in a number of cases they’d frowned upon 
attorney charging for travelling to attend anywhere but 
court and only to court, when the courthouse is outside of 
the area etcetera. 
 
What I want to just ask you to comment on is this 
tax bill of costs it certainly does include I think 14 days of 
disciplinary hearing but it also includes the cost of the 
High Court litigation doesn’t it?   
ADV MAPOMA:   Mmm.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well let us start by looking at page 
177, at 39, consultation with Advocate Kennedy SC re the 
letter.  Advocate Kennedy we know represented Mr Gama 
didn’t he in the   High Court proceeding, that we saw from 
the judgment. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 95 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes.  Oh yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Over the page at 178, 49, 
consultation with Advocate Kennedy, at 179 at number 71 it 
talks about a notice to oppose the application. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perusal of answering affidavit.  Do 
you see? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I see. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At 86 attend court with counsel, 
postponement, travelling time. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Mmm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And so we can go on Mr Mapoma but 
this tax bill would you accept deals with both the high court 
litigation and Mr Gama’s disciplinary hearing. 
ADV MAPOMA:   It seems so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in fact what you see in the first 
seven or eight pages of the bill it all relates to the High 
Court application, because let me take you to page 192, or 
in fact page 190, right at the bottom, remember the high 
court litigation preceded, as you know the disciplinary 
20 
hearing. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At 190 right at the bottom there is 
then a charge for Day 1 of the disciplinary hearing, do you 
see that? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 96 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that at page 191? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, 190. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One nine zero. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then those are involved, one 
can track the at 191 the second day, the third day, the 
fourth day, over the page the fifth day and so it goes on. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, they are in bold yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In bold and I think if my memory 
10 
serves me correctly it goes up to the 14 t h  day at page 194. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So then let me ask you is this then 
in summary what happened?  Firstly Mr Gama is absolved 
of his liability of paying costs to two different sets of 
attorneys, in the High Court litigation. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Secondly what happens is Transnet 
pays 75% of the cost that he incurs for that litigation in the 
High Court.  
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then on top of that Transnet 
pays him 75% of the cost that Transnet and Transnet’s 
directors incurred in the High Court.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 97 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In relation to this payment of Mr 
Gama’s tax costs, 1.7million, initially in your evidence you 
said that that related to his disciplinary hearing? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now we know it relates also to High 
Court.  
ADV MAPOMA:  I see that yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Was that paid by mistake or did you 
intend to pay this? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It would have been a mistake. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A mistake? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, it could not have been paid 
intentionally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the mistake relate to the disciplinary 
hearing costs? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes because then it meant there’s a 
duplication now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well why do you say duplication? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because the High Court’s matter, the 
costs thereof are also being paid again now, they are also 
included in R1.7million because the R1.7million arises from 
this ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay I am not sure I understand, I 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 98 of 209 
 
want to make sure I do.  Well there is the question, and I 
don’t know whether Mr Myburgh was asking about that or 
whether he is still going to deal with it, it is the question of 
whether in terms of the settlement agreement Transnet 
undertook any liability in relation to Mr Gama’s costs 
relating to the disciplinary hearing, there is that aspect. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you, are you able to say what your 
understanding was of whether the settlement agreement 
included Mr Gama’s costs relating to the disciplinary 
10 
hearing? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes my understanding was that it 
included Mr Gama’s costs at the labour hearing, at the 
disciplinary hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that your understanding. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So as far as to the extent that the tax 
bill related to those costs you had no problem? 
ADV MAPOMA:   To the extent that yes I did not have a 
problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, because I just want the settlement 
agreement sorted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well we will talk about that in due 
course, but I just want to understand the duplication to 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 99 of 209 
 
which you are referring? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because the previous payments that 
counsel referred to, where I had made written notes in my 
on hand were costs that Transnet incurred in reference to 
the High court matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay that’s 1.7? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And then Gama was paid that money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADF MAPOMA:  And then later on this bill now which 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Langa Attorneys. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Coming from Langa Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Then it gets sent to our attorneys then they 
send it to the Taxing Master. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:  The private Taxing Master. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Who then taxes it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:  And this deal includes both the disciplinary 
hearing and the high court matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  So that is where you say 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 100 of 209 
 
now this is a duplication. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course I take it that their bill is 
based on Mr Gama’s costs. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was supposed to be based on Mr Gama’s 
costs whereas the amount that you paid them that you had 
already paid them was based on Transnet’s own legal costs. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So the point you were making to 
10 
Counsel was that the payment of Mr – of Langa Attorneys bill 
was a mistake. 
ADV MAPOMA:  It should be a mistake that may have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which should not have been paid. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Should never have been paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Myburgh.  Now I understand 
the duplication where it comes from. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps I could just pick up on 
Chairperson’s questioning.  You understood the settlement 
agreement to provide that Transnet undertook to pay 75% of 
20 
Mr Gama’s costs incurred during the disciplinary hearing. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes that was my understanding. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let me go to page 19 of Bundle 3.  It is 
the settlement agreement attached to your first affidavit.  So 
there is a reference there to tax costs. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 101 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry which bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson page 19 – 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  19?  Okay, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is reference to tax legal costs 
incurred during the high court.  This is at 3.5. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Application and in respect of his unfair 
dismissal which it referred to the Transnet Bargaining 
Council. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  How do you interpret that to mean you 
would pay his costs of the disciplinary inquiry? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Because the referral to the Bargaining 
Council did not happen – I mean did not… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No it did happen. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Did not – I do not know how to put this 
20 
thing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is what was settled. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes it was settled in the sense that there 
was no according to what I knew at the time there was no 
hearing or anything like that they settled it. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 102 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:  It was settled. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is why he should have got buried 
in costs. 
ADV MAPOMA:  So our understanding at the time – my 
understanding and I think this was the understanding of 
Transnet at the time was that it referred to the disciplinary 
hearing that led to that referral. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But where does it say that Mr 
Mapoma?  It talks about unfair dismissal dispute referred to 
10 
the Transnet Bargaining Council.  And we talking about taxed 
costs. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You tax costs in legal proceeding 
right? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Have you ever heard of tax costs in a 
disciplinary hearing? 
ADV MAPOMA:  No. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
So 
how 
do 
you 
get 
to 
that 
20 
interpretation? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Because this is why there was this problem.  
One of the problems was this.  Because they could not 
provide or agree that those costs in that disciplinary hearing 
must be taxed.  Because they had to present these 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 103 of 209 
 
documents to us to say – or for us to go to jointly to a Taxing 
Master to tax whatever costs that they said they incurred 
there.  And this is what they were not coming with – fought 
with.  That the – these tax costs at the disciplinary hearing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You do not tax the costs of a 
disciplinary hearing. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I mean who taxes them? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Nobody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Precisely.  So how do you land up 
10 
paying the man for fourteen days of a disciplinary hearing? 
ADV MAPOMA:  This is the instruction that was there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  By who? 
ADV MAPOMA:  By the board of Transnet.  This is what 
[00:04:19] said to me must be done. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was that your own interpretation or is 
that what he told you to do? 
ADV MAPOMA:  It was what he told me to do and this is how 
20 
I understand the board interpreted it.  Because when Gama’s 
attorney Mr Langa presented this thing to me first time – the 
first question that one asks is it must be taxed.  Although I 
remember saying to him Mr Gama can be dismissed for 
ignoring a board instruction.  So here is a settlement 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 104 of 209 
 
agreement now that the board has entered into referring us 
to the taxation that must happen.  And do you expect me to 
go and pay fees that have not been taxed anyway?  So that 
was the first battle that Langa could not jump with me.  
Because this brings could not be taxed so we are not taxed 
anyway.  So all our problems started from there but then the 
understanding was that the payment must be for the cost 
that he incurred at the disciplinary hearing. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
You 
say 
understanding 
– 
the 
understanding of who? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:  The board and those who instructed me at 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you look at that clause now do you 
maintain – do you still have the same understanding or has 
your understanding changed as to whether the settlement 
agreement included payment by Transnet offering Mr Gama’s 
cost in relation to the disciplinary hearing. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Chair that is not what it says when you at it 
in another time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  But the point is at the time the only 
disciplinary hearing that had happened for Mr Gama before 
the Bargaining Council was the disciplinary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us take this step by step.  Okay it 
is the relevant clause of the settlement agreement is 3.5.  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 105 of 209 
 
Have you got it in front of you?  Okay.  The first part deals 
with the high court legal costs and the second part deals 
with the unfair dismissal dispute costs. So it reads: 
“Transnet will make a contribution equivalent 
to 75% of Mr Gama’s taxed legal costs 
incurred 
during 
Gama’s 
high 
court 
application.”   
So that – that we will leave that.  That is not what we 
are dealing with now.  And then says: 
“And 
in 
respect 
of 
his 
unfair 
dismissal 
10 
dispute referred to the Transnet Bargaining 
Council.” 
 
Now the costs relating to the second part of the 
clause do you agree they relate to an unfair dismissal 
dispute?  Do you agree that the unfair dismissal dispute to 
which they relate is one that was referred to the Bargaining 
Council?   
Do you – do you accept or do you not accept that 
therefore the costs that are contemplated there are costs 
that would have begun around when the dismissal dispute 
20 
was referred to the Bargaining Council?  You accept that? 
 
Now the dispute – unfair dismissal dispute was only 
referred to the Bargaining Council after Mr Gama had been 
dismissed is it not? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry Mr Chairman – Chairperson. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 106 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I have been asked just to ask Mr 
Mapoma to put his microphone on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay ja.  I wonder how much we – was 
not captured. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Apparently the answer was not 
captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let – I will – we will just start again.  
Okay do you accept that this clause insofar as it relates to 
costs concerning the unfair dismissal dispute relates to the 
10 
unfair dismissal dispute that was referred to the Transnet 
Bargaining Council. 
ADV MAPOMA:  I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that.  You – do you also accept 
that those costs could only have arisen around when that 
dispute was referred to the Bargaining Council? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I accept that too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you also accept that this unfair 
dismissal dispute would only have been referred to the 
Bargaining Council after Mr Gama had been dismissed? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you accept that Mr Gama was 
dismissed at the end of June 2010? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore costs relating to the disciplinary 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 107 of 209 
 
hearing 
which 
happened 
before 
the 
actual 
dismissal 
happened – before the dismissal dispute arose could not be 
included.  Do you also accept that? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that now? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should then lead to and you must tell 
me if my understanding of your evidence is wrong.  That 
should then lead us to a position where you say, this 
understanding is different from the understanding you had at 
10 
the time.  Because at the time as I understand your evidence 
your understanding was that the cost that Mr Gama had 
incurred before being dismissed in regard to the disciplinary 
hearing were included in the settlement agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  I just want to ask you one 
or two questions around that.  How did you rationalise that in 
20 
your own mind?  Mr Gama was put through a disciplinary 
hearing and he was dismissed.  There was then a settlement 
agreement where he got a final written warning. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  How did you rationalise him being 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 108 of 209 
 
reimbursed for the entire cost of his disciplinary hearing? 
ADV MAPOMA:  [00:10:52] to pay Mr Gama’s costs. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Which incurred – this clause not mine.  So 
it was not for me to rationalise or not rationalise. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.   
ADV MAPOMA:  I refused to pay Mr Gama’s costs for a 
number of reasons.  Some of them I have told you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please face this side Mr Mapoma. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Oh sorry Chair.  My apologies. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I know he is asking. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The questions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I ask the question you answer them to 
the Chair. 
ADV MAPOMA:  No, no I – my apologies – my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:  I am saying the decision to make the 
payments was not mine for me to rationalise or not to 
rationalise.  I refused to pay these costs for a number of 
20 
reasons.  Some of them which I have set out in – or before 
the Chair today.  And the instruction that I had at the time 
was that I should pay the costs from the time of the 
disciplinary hearing.  Because this is what Transnet wanted 
to do.  So I agreed.  There is no rationality for this.  Even at 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 109 of 209 
 
the time I saw no rationality for it.  There were…here were… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the instruction? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the instruction. 
ADV MAPOMA:  That was the instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAPOMA:  It was known my stance on these fees was 
known by many people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAPOMA:  And – but I ended up paying them from my – 
10 
form my group tax fees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you – are you saying that your 
understanding 
of 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
was 
in 
accordance with the understanding of those who were giving 
instructions? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes Chairperson it was them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:  I firstly first refusing them to pay them from 
Group Legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Because I was arguing that it was actually 
we are not supposed to pay these costs because they have 
been dealing with the disciplinary hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Because this was going to include the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 110 of 209 
 
disciplinary hearing.  And I said why – but why must they 
come to me?  But my complaints and protestations fell into 
deaf ears.  Because I was refusing to pay this money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so we at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you ever asked by the board or Mr 
Mkwanazi or anybody as to the opinion of whether this – the 
settlement agreement in terms of the costs relating to the 
[00:13:23] included costs relating to the disciplinary hearing?  
Were you asked for your advice opinion whether it did or you 
10 
– were you asked? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Chair I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not recall it? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I do not recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MAPOMA:  [Not audible] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright we had – we were dealing with 
paragraph 12 of your second affidavit that is at page 100 and 
– sorry not 100 – page 26 of Bundle 3.  And you had dealt 
with the memorandum that you sent to Mr Molefe  If you go 
20 
to page 144 you see you signed it and then he signed it on 
the 24 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is page 144? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  144 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of volume – Bundle 2? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 111 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 3? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In fact I am hopelessly out it is actually 
Bundle 1 I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay I got Bundle 1.  Okay and 
the page 144? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So the signatures appear at 144, is 
that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I see that yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we go back to 139 there is some 
handwritten notes at 139.  Whose notes are those? 
ADV MAPOMA:  At 139 is – the handwritten notes are at 
141.  I am on my bundle.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  141. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes 141. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes handwritten notes – whose 
20 
handwritten notes are those? 
ADV MAPOMA:  They are different people who wrote here.  
The handwritten notes at the top – the first ones is my 
handwriting.  The second written… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – are you referring to the ones that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 112 of 209 
 
have got 123? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is your handwriting? 
ADV MAPOMA:  That is my handwriting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAPOMA:  And then that is my handwriting again as to 
when I received this.  I would have received it from Mr 
Molefe’s office that is now the file cover itself.  And there are 
comments underneath there under the word comments.  And 
the name Sachs – that is Mr Molefe’s handwriting.  And then 
10 
the last comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Sachs a reference to you? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes Sachs is reference to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:  That is how I am commonly known.  I just 
missed my spelling there.  Yes and then the last handwritten 
notes I recognise that signature and I – but I am not sure it 
looks like this was Ms Phyllis Difeto’s handwriting.  Phyllis 
Difeto was an executive in Mr Molefe’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In whose office? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Mr Molefe’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So the DG at DPE who had made 
enquiries was Mr Matona? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes it was Mr Matona at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 113 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you then draft a response for Mr 
Molefe? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can I ask you please to turn to page 
147.   
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is this the draft that you prepared? 
ADV MAPOMA:  This is a draft that I prepared but when I 
look at it now I think it was amended and I have got two 
reasons why I say so.  The actual draft that I sent is not this 
10 
one.  The reason I say it was amended especially at 
paragraph – at page 147 at the bottom there is a reference 
to – there is a paragraph that reads: 
“The matter is a [00:17:47] communications 
both 
written 
and 
oral 
with 
Transnet’s 
attorneys in an attempt to resolve the issue.  
There is also further communication both 
written and oral between Langa Attorneys 
and the office of Ms Zola Stephen Group 
Executive Corporate Affairs.  The executive 
20 
responsible for legal affairs at Transnet.” 
 
That is the gist of that paragraph.  And because of 
the handwritten notes at the bottom again of the same 
document which states or reads: 
“Amended after Zola advised that she met Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 114 of 209 
 
Gama and they agreed that Mr Gama would 
provide further information which she said he 
had.” 
 
And then they agreed to have a meeting after 19 
August when Zola came back from leave.  I was not privy to 
any communication between Mr Langa or Mr Gama between 
them and Ms Stephen.  So I will not have included that 
paragraph there.  And well the handwritten notes I do not 
know whose handwritten notes is that.  There is no signature 
that I recognise.  So it is clear that the draft that I would 
10 
have sent to Mr Molefe was then subsequently amended 
because of the [00:18:58] that are recorded there. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Are 
you 
able 
to 
say 
whether 
this 
memorandum represents the draft that you had prepared 
except for the paragraph that you have read? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the handwritten notes? 
ADV MAPOMA:  It would have captured the [00:19:20] that I 
had prepared to an extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the – the substance of it. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Substance of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The second last paragraph at page 148 
Mr Gama’s own attorneys in both high court application and 
the labour matter was Langa Attorneys when Transnet 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 115 of 209 
 
received their bill being presented for payment it became 
apparent that the bill had not been taxed and then you go on 
to say the draft records that a private Taxing Master was 
appointed.  Was that paragraph I read to you is that your 
own original language?  You remember? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I think it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So it says:  Mr Gama’s own attorneys 
in both high court application and the labour matter was 
Langa. When Transnet received their bill – their bill for 
what? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:  For payment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes but in respect of what Mr 
Mapoma? 
ADV MAPOMA:  It was the bill that I – I had received from 
Langa.  Was the only one that I was refusing to pay.  That is 
the only bill that I you know that I had at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But that bill it included the costs of the 
high court proceedings and the disciplinary enquiry? 
ADV MAPOMA:  If it is the same one as this I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to – you to assist me with 
20 
something that I should have asked earlier while Mr Myburgh 
is looking at his next question.  You said earlier on that 
ultimately Transnet made a duplication in terms of payment 
to Langa Attorneys because they paid – Transnet paid Langa 
Attorneys in terms of the calculations they made based on 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 116 of 209 
 
their own legal costs but also when Langa Attorneys sent 
their bill ultimately there was a payment based on a 
calculation of – on the basis of that bill. 
Attorneys sent their bill ultimately there was a payment 
based on a calculation of – on the basis of that bill. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Roughly what was the total of the two 
payments? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:  Chair I would [mumbling]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to… 
ADV MAPOMA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sure it is somewhere.  I thought 
you might recall more or less. 
ADV MAPOMA:  Oh no [mumbling]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And – and did Langa 
Attorneys not return some of the money and say no you have 
paid us twice? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Not to my knowledge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The sum of the two amounts paid to Mr 
Gama or his attorneys was approximately R2.3 million, 
correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:  I accept. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 117 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would you go to your second affidavit 
again and ask you to have a look at page 27 and paragraph 
15.  You say:  
“In paragraph 35 of my first affidavit I stated 
the following:  When I left Transnet the legal 
fees of Mr Gama had not yet been paid.  
Further when I left Transnet I had not 
approved such payments.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry are you back to his affidavit? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes Chair at Bundle 3. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 27.   
ADV MAPOMA:  Can I answer? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay page 27? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I have just read to the witness Chair 
paragraph 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 16 you say: 
“When I so stated I was referring to any 
further payments that might have been in 
20 
respective legal fees over and above what is 
reflected 
in 
the 
memoranda 
attached 
[00:23:33].” 
 
Are 
you 
aware 
of 
a 
payment 
that 
was 
made 
subsequently?  Another payment? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 118 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I know after I had left Transnet I was 
advised that there was another payment that was made to Mr 
Gama – Mr Langa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Purporting to be a contribution to his legal 
costs? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Did you get to know about how much 
that was? 
ADV MAPOMA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:  I did not even [mumbling]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you had no interest at this stage. 
ADV MAPOMA:  I had no interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Perhaps 
just 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness and another witness will deal with this. Could I 
ask you please to turn in Bundle 2 to page 211.   
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  210 and 211 reflect a payment in 2015 
of an amount of R1 399 000.00 do you see that? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I saw it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And at 213 there was a memorandum 
in support of that.   
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It was compiled you see at 215 by Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 119 of 209 
 
Salinga and then approved by Mr Singh.  Presumably you 
have no knowledge of that? 
ADV MAPOMA:  No I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Had you left Transnet by that time? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes I left by that time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then if we go to – back to your 
affidavit page 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Myburgh this is 
something I had not picked up before about the third 
payment.  So another payment of more than R 1 million was 
10 
made in 2015? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Ja no that is okay it is – it is… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you will see Chairperson at 213 
that it relates to the same settlement agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is a quotation of clause 3.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And there is a discussion if you go to 
paragraph 6. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That a certain amount was paid and 
then there was a deduction.  And then there is a balance.  
And then interest is payable at 15.5% and that then takes 
one to R1.4 million but we – we will have to bring someone  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 120 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  To give evidence in an attempt to 
decode this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chair I see that it is one minute past 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us take the lunch adjournment.  We 
will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mapoma, before the lunch break, I 
was about to take you to page 28 of your second affidavit at 
Bundle 3 where you deal with Mr Mhlango’s affidavit.   
 
You will remember that your second affidavit, effectively, 
was an answer to two affidavits that you provided.   
 
And the sum total of what you say there is that you 
stand by your version in relation to your discussion with Mr 
Mhlango.  Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Have you had an opportunity of 
reading what he... well, presumable you did.  An opportunity 
of reading what he said? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps we could just go to that very 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 121 of 209 
 
briefly.  Could you go to Bundle 1? 
ADV MAPOMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And turn up page 169. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And perhaps then you can move to 
page 172. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So much of what Mr Mhlango has to 
say on page 172, appears to be summarised in paragraph 17 
at 173.   
10 
 
It is now not clear to me whether he denies having a 
telephonic discussion with you or he simple denies your 
recollection of what he said.  But he says: 
“I submit that the support that Mapoma gave to 
MNR... 
 
It is the attorney’s firm.   
“...the intersection between one of our social circles, 
the nature of my social interactions with him forbade 
me from being rude to him or putting any pressure on 
him.  This would have resulted in a backlash in an 
20 
important friendship circle and would have adversely 
affected my standing as an attorney amongst the 
community of lawyers in that social circle.  I am clear 
about my reputation and standing amongst my friends 
and peers.”

Page 122 of 209 
 
 
Do you have any comment in that regard? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Well, I do not have a comment.  The 
discussion was between the two of us. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Of course, I informed Mr Mkwanazi about it 
later on and I never shared it with anybody else, except 
when the Commission approached me.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then he says: 
“I had no motive or reason to pressure or call 
Mapoma about the pace or details of the settlement 
10 
between Gama and Transnet.” 
ADV MAPOMA:   He did call me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  Did you say earlier on 
he called you about two times? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I recall that he called me two times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think when you gave evidence in 
the morning, if I am not mistaken, there may have been a 
time. 
 
And I do not know whether it refers to the first call, there 
may have been a time when you seemed to suggest that he 
20 
was not pressurising you.  Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is correct Chair.  It was on the 
second time that he was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was only during the second call 
...[intervenes]  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 123 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that he was pressurising you? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the first call, he was like making 
enquiries? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph 19, he said: 
“Lastly, if I had any questions, which I did not, I 
would have raised these with Mkwanazi.  To the best 
10 
of my recollection, Mapoma was a few levels down 
in the Transnet Executive Management hierarchy.” 
 
Any comment on that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   This is quite correct because I reported to 
Ms Stephen who was an Exco member.  So in the normal 
stream of things, if he was calling on behalf of the minister, 
he would have called the CEO or the chairman of the board, 
not me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but did he call you? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, he called me. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then he goes on to say at 20: 
“I never said to Mapoma, as he alleges, number one, 
I wanted to get it done quickly.” 
 
And essentially what he says in that paragraph is that 
that is not the language that he uses.  He does not refer to a 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 124 of 209 
 
sitting president as number one.   
 
He would have referred to him as President Zuma.  What 
do you have to say to that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Well, I stand by what I said in my own 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Are 
you 
quite 
clear 
about 
this 
conversation? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I am quite clear Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   The conversation was not a long one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not a long one? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I was driving home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because that was the second one? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And I decided to... I said what I said to him 
so that it stops. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  H’m.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Can I then take you please to 
your third and last affidavit, Bundle 3, page 29? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You deal in this affidavit with two 
things and the main heading is new document.  At page 29.  
And then the payment of legal fees at the foot of page 30.  
Do you see that? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 125 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And under new documents, you deal 
with Annexures SM1, 2 and 3. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps I can take you then directly to 
those annexures.  Can we start please with SM1?  That you 
will find at page 33. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is a consultation note.  It reflects 
you as having been present.  Have you had an opportunity of 
10 
reading this note? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Does it accord with your recollection 
of what transpired at this meeting? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, it does. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you will see there listed as present 
was yourself, Mr Mkwanazi, Mr Langa, who we know by now 
who is the attorney, Mr Gama, Mr Ghule and Sangoni.  They 
were attorneys from ...[indistinct]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then in the second paragraph, it says: 
“Themba Langa and Gama were also in attendance 
but we initially had a caucus meeting between 
Mr Sebu(?), Mr Mapoma and Mr Mkwanazi and 
myself.” 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 126 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is the note of the caucus 
meeting. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you just read paragraph 4 of 
that note into the record? 
ADV MAPOMA:   The paragraph reads: 
“Mr Mkwanazi explained that he would like to assist 
Mr Gama where reasonable possible.  His intention 
is to bring him back to his “determines” offices.  He 
10 
wants Mr Gama to assist him on a number of 
strategy issues.   
He, however, needs a good motivation to do so.  His 
view is that if he is provided with an opinion, certain 
that there had been some unfairness towards Mr 
Gama at the board meeting on 16 February.   
He will persuade the other board members to make 
the decision to bring Mr Gama back into the 
organisation.” 
 
That is where it stops. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you were aware that there was an 
upcoming board meeting on the 16t h of February? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he said that if he is provided with 
an opinion setting out that there had been some unfairness 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 127 of 209 
 
towards Mr Gama, then he would persuade the other board 
members to make a decision to bring Mr Gama back into the 
organisation. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is what it says. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At the meeting of the 16 t h. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Mapoma.  I just want to share 
with you the impression I get from the... from that paragraph, 
particularly the sentence that Mr Myburgh just referred to.   
 
And you can tell me whether that is the impression that 
10 
you may have got being at the meeting when this was said 
by Mr Mkwanazi.   
 
Maybe I am being unfair to him but it gives me the 
impression of somebody who is saying:  I just need 
somebody to say in an opinion, there was some unfairness 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the dismissal of this man.  And then if 
I got that, then that will give me grounds to go to the board 
and I will get the board to agree to take him back.  Is that 
20 
the impression... does it accord with your own impression of 
what you may have got when you are this...? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 128 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Then if you 
go over the page to paragraph 5, it says: 
“He, as being Mr Mkwanazi, was to discuss details 
of such return to Transnet with Mr Gama in a one-
on-one meeting between them.” 
 
Do you recall that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I recall.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it seems that he was not 
familiar with the details.  There are, however... Sorry. 
10 
“There are details, however, that he is unfamiliar 
with such as, when was Mr Gama fired, when Mr 
Gama was suspended...” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Mapoma.  That surprises 
me.  How could Mr Mkwanazi not be aware of when Mr Gama 
was fired at that stage of the discussions about the Gama 
matter?  That just seems strange to me.   
20 
 
I would have thought that before that, he would have 
familiarised himself properly with these basic facts.  Like, 
when was this man dismissed.   
 
Had he not prior to that, because you were at the 
meeting and he had been talking to you, had he not been 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 129 of 209 
 
furnished with any memo or document that set out the 
important background? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not by me, Chair. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Not by you? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not by me.  If he had any knowledge 
of the details of the suspension, the hearing and any figures, 
he would not have got it from me. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Okay.  So to your knowledge, at this time, 
in your conversation with him, you had not... he had not 
asked you to brief you about these facts? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, but I did also asked that... would 
have explained him at the time to have that kind of 
information.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that it seems strange to me, you 
know.  He already wanted to meet with Mr Gama on a one-
on-one meeting to discuss.  I think he was already wanting 
to discuss a possible settlement. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, to discuss Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And I am not sure how you discuss a 
possible settlement of an unfair dismissal if you do not know 
20 
when the person was dismissed because that is like one of 
the first things you look at because you are going to...  
 
You may have to apply your mind to, will this man or will 
this person wants back pay.  If he wants back pay or she 
wants back pay, for how long could they be demanding back 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 130 of 209 
 
pay.  You know that kind of thing.  But I guess you cannot 
assist. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I cannot assist the Chairperson, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Perhaps if 
you can just have a look at paragraph 6.  It does record: 
“Once he is clear on those details, he can then 
formulate a proposal.” 
 
Was that said? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I am going to take you to the 
balance of this note but I just ask you to confirm that at 
paragraph 16 at page 35, the note ends on this basis: 
“At that point, the caucus ended so that Mr 
Mkwanazi could meet alone with Mr Gama.” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And is that what happened?  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you surprised by his decision of 
which to exclude you from and anybody including the 
20 
Transnet attorneys from this meeting he wanted to have with 
Mr Gama? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Chair, he could exclude me because of my 
position in the company.  Mr Gama is an executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 131 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   So the decision to meet with him is on a 
separate level. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Not mine.  But with the attorneys who were 
at Transnet, he would have taken them ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...to the discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because they were there on Transnet’s 
behalf. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And he was perfectly entitled to take them 
along in my absence.  But with me, I was not surprised that I 
was not part of the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The exclusion of the attorneys, did that 
surprise you? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It did at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
MAPOMA: 
 
 
But 
we... 
well, 
at 
least 
from 
my 
understanding was that they still needed to talk about the 
20 
details of the settlement which we knew nothing about.  I 
certainly knew nothing about.  So I was not going to be able 
to what they were going to talk about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because I did not know what the mandate 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 132 of 209 
 
Mr Mkwanazi had in terms of the details of the settlement.  
He had to negotiate with Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because he never shared that with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Had you been involved in a number 
of settlement negotiations in regard to legal disputes relating 
to Transnet and other parties at all or ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is that not your role? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Sorry, Chair.  My apologies.  Not with 
10 
Transnet because there were units that dealt with such 
matters at Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, it just strikes me as 
strange.  Well, you had provided a reason why you say you 
were not surprised by your own exclusion.   
 
But then one would have thought that Transnet attorneys 
would have been allowed to be part of that meeting because 
otherwise, why were they there?  You know.   
 
Did he not need them to be part of the negotiations or 
did he not need to get advice from them as the discussions 
20 
happened? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Then if we go to page 36.  
On the face of it, this is an email from you on the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 133 of 209 
 
14t h of February to Messrs Ghule and Sangoni. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say: 
“The chair has asked that we prepare a two-pager 
for him for the board meeting.” 
 
What board meeting was that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   This was not(?) calling board meeting.  The 
fact(?) when the... in that consultation of the 16 February. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   16 Feb? 
ADV MAPOMA:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “I have started the process.  Please 
look at the attachment and finalise to a settle.” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But was this the favourable opinion 
that Mr Mkwanazi was looking for? 
ADV MAPOMA:   This was the start of the process of what 
Mr Mkwanazi was asking us to do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because he wanted something that he 
could take to the board and table there. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And he wanted some memorandum of some 
sort, setting out the history of the matter, what is considered 
and the proposal that he was going to make to the board. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As he had described at the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 134 of 209 
 
consultation on the 22 nd of January? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at pages 37 and 38, is that 
then your work? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is my memo that I drafted. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Deal with a few things.  Under the 
heading settlement negotiations at the foot of page 37. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Please would you read that into the 
record? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Paragraph 7 reads: 
“The 
current 
board 
commenced 
its 
duties 
on 
13 December 2010.  The chairman of the board with 
the support of the shareholder minister as within his 
rights and obligations, decided to revisit the matter 
of the dismissal against Mr Gama.  His decisions 
were informed by a number of reasons, strategy and 
other.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay we will come to that.  This 
sentence:  The chairperson of the board with the support of 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Please raise your voice Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It has gone down again. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am reading at the same time.  Thank 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 135 of 209 
 
you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This sentence, the second sentence. 
“The chairman of the board with the support of the 
shareholder 
minister 
as 
within 
his 
rights 
and 
obligations, decided to revisit the matter...” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How did that sentence come to be put 
into this memorandum? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Mr Mkwanazi had informed me about that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that answer. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Mr Mkwanazi had informed me about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he tell you? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That what was he was doing, the 
reinstatement, he had supported the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay. 
 
So 
in 
preparing 
the 
memorandum, you included that ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I included it 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because he had told you about it. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are sure about this? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I am sure about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 136 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you Chairperson.  And then 
what you do is, you seem to set out a serious of factors in 
support of some sort of settlement. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I want to paraphrase because 
there is a point I am going to come to.  You talk about the 
Public Protector, complaint at 8.  At 9 you deal with 
something that is generic really to all litigation where you 
say: 
“Risk is always part of litigation. 
10 
 
At 10 another generic thing: 
“The judicial processes are extremely slow.” 
 
At 11 you deal with various acting appointments.  At 12 
you say: 
“These are not conducive to an effective operational 
environment.” 
 
At 13 you again talk about an acting appointments in the 
context of corporate governance.  At 14 you say that Mr 
Gama is highly experienced.  And at 15, another generic 
thing ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...about legal costs.  Is that right? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what you do not deal with her is 
anything about prospects of success in litigation against Mr 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 137 of 209 
 
Gama. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You accept that this... a lot of the 
points you make, you can say about any litigation? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Time, costs, inconvenience and 
litigation. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why do you not deal with prospects of 
success? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   I did not deal with those Chair because 
one, I had not been involved in that process.  I was also not 
privy to the details thereof, the disciplinary hearing.  And I 
could not find any opinion on Transnet’s prospect of success 
on that at the time.  So I simply said nothing about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Despite the request by Mr Mkwanazi that 
we should have an opinion regarding that going to take to 
the board.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that Mr Mkwanazi’s 
20 
request to you which resulted in your preparing this 
memorandum had included that you must deal with...  
 
You had to deal with the prospects of success but you 
did not deal with them because you did not have the 
information? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 138 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   It included that Chair and he had wanted us 
to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You say, it did include that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
ADV MAPOMA:   Only regards to have something that will 
show that there was an unfairness towards Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes.  And one of the things that one would 
consider on the prospect of success will be such unfairness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And I could not make that call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So I wrote nothing on that aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I think you make an important 
point.  Perhaps I have put it incorrectly.  It is not that you did 
not deal with prospect of success as much as you did not 
deal with Mr Gama’s dismissal having been unfair. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now let us get to MS3 over 
the page.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Can we before that?  Had you 
before preparing this memorandum, had you had a chance to 
read the “ruling or judgment” of the chairperson of the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 139 of 209 
 
disciplinary inquiry that resulted in Mr Gama’s dismissal? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had not? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay then.  Okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At page 39, what you see is that the 
next day, the 15t h of February, this memorandum is sent back 
to you by Mr Sangoni. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it says: 
10 
“Please 
find 
herewith 
the 
document 
which 
Mr Mapoma 
sent 
to 
us 
yesterday 
with 
our 
amendments.” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now your draft included ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Wait.  Amendments, I think. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I will point them out now.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, I thought you read with our memo, 
where it says with our amendments.  Maybe I did not hear 
you correctly. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, it is: 
“Please 
find 
herewith 
the 
document 
which 
Mr Mapoma 
sent 
to 
us 
yesterday 
with 
our 
amendments.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 140 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I will point out the amendments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Your memo included 16 paragraphs.  
Do you see that at page 38? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   One, five?  Oh, 16.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see that the memo that Deneys 
10 
Reitz sends back to you at 18? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   All of your points but they added two 
paragraphs.   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The new paragraphs are 10 and 11. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you confirm that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The rest of it is all your work? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean, so for example, paragraph 7 
that said that what you had said. 
“The chairperson of the board with this support of 
the shareholder minister, has within his rights and 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 141 of 209 
 
obligations decided to revisit the matter.” 
 
That remained unaltered. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   New paragraphs 10 and 11.  Now let 
me read to you 10.  And this is really text about prospects of 
success. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   10: 
“In the arbitration before the Bargaining Council, 
Mr Gama has challenged the appropriateness of the 
10 
sanction of dismissal.” 
 
You had not dealt with this? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“The issue of sanction is then complex and a 
perplex matter to which there is no clear and 
straightforward answer.  This is demonstrated by 
amongst other cases, the celebrated case of Sidumo 
and Another v Rustenburg Platinum Mine in which 
the Labour Court and the Constitutional Court on the 
20 
one hand and the Supreme Court of Appeal on the 
other 
hand 
came 
to 
different 
conclusions 
on 
sanctions.  The other cases dealing with the issue of 
sanction which also demonstrate the complexity of 
consideration 
of 
appropriate 
sanction 
by 
the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 142 of 209 
 
Shoprite Checkers cases...” 
 
And then they added these footnotes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“...in which the facts in the two separate cases were 
similar but the Labour Appeal Court in each of the 
cases came to a different conclusion on sanction.” 
 
Which by the way Chairperson, one of those judgments 
was yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The Shoprite Checkers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, I remember that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it goes on to say: 
“In the one case, the findings of the Labour Appeal 
Court was endorsed by the Supreme Court of 
Appeal.” 
 
That is what they give some advice on the sanction. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They inserted it.  And then paragraph 
11: 
20 
“It is accordingly our view that there is a probability 
that the Bargaining Council or a court considering 
the appropriateness of the sanction of dismissal of 
Mr Gama may reach the conclusion that dismissal 
was not appropriate having regard to the challenge 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 143 of 209 
 
on sanction advanced by him.   
In 
that 
instance, 
the 
court 
may 
either 
award 
compensation to Mr Gama or find that a lesser 
sanction ought to have been imposed and therefore 
orders his reinstatement.” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the how watermark of that is that 
there was a probability that the Bargaining Council may 
reach a different conclusion. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But... did you receive this memo? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I received the memorandum. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what did you do with it? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I forwarded it to Mr Mkwanazi’s office.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Mr Mkwanazi’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mkwanazi? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Mr Mkwanazi’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what was your expectation as to 
20 
what he would have done with it? 
ADV MAPOMA:   What he would have done with it, he would 
give... taken the documents and use his own letterhead for 
him to present it to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 144 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is what I was expecting him to do 
because this was a memorandum for him to table to the 
board and for him to discuss it there.  But we did not discuss 
that memorandum.  I just forwarded it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess you did note the new paragraphs? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I did not them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When you sent it to Mr Mkwanazi, 
did you send it to him as your memorandum or was there 
something that told him that there had... there was some 
input from the attorneys, Transnet attorneys? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Chair, as much as I will not know the detail 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...of what they would have written. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...in the email or something like that or 
what I would have said to him when I gave it to him 
personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   He would know that it came from... it was 
20 
settled by the attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he knew that it had been settled by 
the attorneys? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  What you do not remember is 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 145 of 209 
 
whether you did say to him, paragraphs 10 and 11 had been 
inserted by our attorneys. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I would not have said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes...  You would not have said that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No.  It is not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is not how I would have done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, that ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   I would have given the memo to say:  Here 
is the memo you requested.  And I would have left it there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Unless he had specific questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   That he wanted me to answer, then I would 
have answered it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The importance of that answer you give 
me is that if you did not indicate to him that there was – 
there were these paragraphs that came from the attorneys 
he would be entitled, would he not, to accept this 
memorandum as what you were saying to him as something 
20 
he could put before the board. 
MR MAPOMA:    Not in the context of our discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MAPOMA:    Not in the context of the discussions that 
he and I had with the attorneys at all times. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 146 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what was this discussion. 
MR MAPOMA:    At all times he knew that the attorneys 
were involved in the memorandum, they were going to 
assist [indistinct] 00.56 in drafting the memorandum.  So 
he knew exactly what was going on.   
CHAIRPERSON:  [inaudible – mic not on] 
MR MAPOMA:    He asked me when I was with the 
attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [inaudible] 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry.  I have spoken without 
being recorded, let me just try and capture that again.  
Was his request directed to both you and the Transnet 
attorneys? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To prepare a two pager for him? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so therefore when he received the 
document he would have known that that probably was the 
product of a joint effort. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Including yourself and the attorneys. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, I am concerned about this 
situation, that from your side you did not know anything on 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 147 of 209 
 
the matter on the basis of which you could say that there 
were probably good prospects of success or bad prospects 
of success.  You have told me you knew nothing that could 
enable you to form that opinion. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then the attorneys now insert this 
document, 
insert 
these 
paragraphs 
which 
include 
a 
paragraph which seems to just suggest that in the view of 
the author or authors of this memorandum there was a 
probability that the bargaining council could or may or 
10 
might find the sanction of dismissal inappropriate.  Now I 
am concerned whether – you do not – you did not 
effectively adopt that approach even though you might not 
have known whether it was justified. 
MR MAPOMA:    Chair, when you read the document now 
sitting here… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MAPOMA:    …as a third party, to read, this is the 
impression that you will have gained, you will gain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    And that is understandable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    But at the time this document was going 
to Mr Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 148 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    And fortunately, when the attorneys sent it 
back they also copied Ms Stephen on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    So that she also is aware that it was 
settled by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, it appears under my name here but 
the only person to whom it was intended at the time was Mr 
Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MAPOMA:    Who knew exactly the context under which 
it was produced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, I guess maybe another 
possible point in your defence is that Transnet attorneys, 
having been involved in the matter, if they put in a 
paragraph that says there were prospects of success or 
there was a probability that the bargaining council may find 
the sanction inappropriate you might have deferred to them 
on the basis that they would have – they would know the 
merits of the case better than you. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    I can agree, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mapoma, I am going 
to take you in a moment to some statements that you made 
at a meeting about your views of the fairness or otherwise 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 149 of 209 
 
of Mr Gama’s dismissal.  Are you sure you are not being 
coy here?  Did you have a view that it was fair?  Did you 
have a view that it was unfair or did you have no view? 
MR MAPOMA:    Well, I had a view. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what was your view? 
MR MAPOMA:    My view that I saw nothing wrong that it 
happened at the hearing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR MAPOMA:    I knew nothing that had happened with 
this hearing so there was no reason for me to say it was 
10 
not fair.  I had absolutely no reason to say so because 
there was a [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry …[intervenes] 
MR MAPOMA:    Oh, my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not hear, ja. 
MR MAPOMA:    It was a decision of [indistinct] 05.49 
[indistinct] which Mr Gama was only challenged on the part 
thereof.  The merits of the matter, that is the merits of the 
dismissal, he was challenging.  He was challenging the 
dismissal so …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The sanction. 
MR MAPOMA:    The sanction rather, so I do not know how 
I could have been asked for a view on its merits when the 
person affected saw it not to challenge it himself.  So I 
absolutely did not understand all this effort being made, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 150 of 209 
 
you know, at the time to reinstate us for the fees and all 
these things.  So my view as that the [indistinct] 06.37 is 
there, straight to the point.  So this was my view. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So did you think – were you of the 
view that the dismissal of Mr Gama was fair or unfair? 
MR MAPOMA:    I said I had no reason to say it was unfair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh. 
MR MAPOMA:    It was there, it was not challenged on the 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure if you are on the same 
10 
page as Mr Myburgh.  When it is said that a dismissal is 
fair or unfair, there are at least two possibilities.  The one 
– I am talking about a dismissal for misconduct such as 
this one – the one reason why it may be said it was unfair 
is because it is thought that he should not have been found 
guilty.  You understand that? 
MR MAPOMA:    I understand that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So somebody who looks at what he was 
charged with, looks at the evidence, looks at the reasoning 
of the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry in regard to 
20 
his finding that Mr Gama was guilty might say I do not 
agree with the conclusion of the Chairperson of the hearing 
that Mr Gama was guilty, okay, so therefore the dismissal 
is unfair because he was not guilty.  As far as I am 
concerned, he was wrongly found guilty.   
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 151 of 209 
 
But another possibility is that somebody might say I 
agree with the conclusion of the Chairperson of the 
disciplinary enquiry that Mr Gama was guilty but I do not 
agree that the sanction of dismissal was appropriate, was 
fair.  I think that he should have given a final written 
warning or something less than dismissal. 
But 
in 
both 
cases 
you 
talk 
about 
whether 
a 
dismissal is fair or unfair.  Okay.  Now we know that in the 
bargaining council Mr Gama was accepting that he was 
guilty of these acts of misconduct of which he had been 
10 
found guilty, he was only challenging the fairness of the 
sanction, okay?   
So when counsel asks you whether you had a view 
whether a dismissal of Mr Gama was fair or unfair, he is 
talking broadly.   
You might say I thought it was unfair because he 
should not have been guilty.  You might say I have no 
problem with the finding that he was guilty but I did not 
think that dismissal was fair, was appropriate or you might 
have some other ground or saying the dismissal was unfair.  
20 
Okay, I thought I must clarify that. 
MR MAPOMA:    No, thank you for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now what is your answer to the question 
then, did you have a view whether Mr Gama’s dismissal 
was fair or unfair or did you not have a view. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 152 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    I do not think I had a view at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not have a view? 
MR MAPOMA:    No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  No, we will come to that.  Let 
me just go back a little.  You made mention of the fact that 
Mr Mkhwanazi wanted you to prepare the memorandum 
together with the lawyers. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you just go back please to 
page 36 of bundle 3?  And I just ask you to confirm that 
10 
what you said to Mr Sangoni, was the Chair has asked that 
we prepared to page – who are your referring to there? 
MR MAPOMA:   I am referring to myself and the attorneys. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, we have dealt with the new 
paragraphs 10 and 11 that were added by Deneys Reitz.  I 
would 
like 
to 
take 
you 
please 
to 
bundle 
2. 
 That 
memorandum that we have dealt with now was produced 
the day before the board meeting, correct?  If you could go 
to bundle 2 and turn to page 19? 
 
Now on the face of it this is a report for Transnet on 
20 
settlement from Mr Gooley of Deneys Reitz dated the 22 
February and you see at the top it was cc’d to you. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you receive this document? 
MR MAPOMA:    I would have received it. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 153 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  So this, whereas your memo 
was finalised or settled the day before the board meeting, 
this report is actually produced on the same day as 
Mkhwanazi signs the settlement agreement and the day 
before Mr Gama signs it. 
MR MAPOMA:    I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that right.  Now I want to just take 
you please to page 20 and can I direct your attention to 
paragraph 1.1? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There Deneys Reitz say: 
“There 
are 
various 
opinions 
which 
had 
been 
obtained from reputable firms of attorneys with 
regard to prospects of success of Mr Gama in 
successfully 
challenging 
his 
dismissal 
by 
the 
company.  All of the opinions, including ours, which 
we gave after perusing documents pertaining to the 
disciplinary enquiry were of the view that Mr 
Gama’s chances of successfully challenging his 
dismissal are not good.” 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   These are the people that you are 
settling and writing your memorandum with. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So their view here in this report is 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 154 of 209 
 
prospects of success are not good. 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Had you seen that opinion? 
MR MAPOMA:    The one that they wrote? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, they are talking about: 
“..all the opinions including ours…” 
MR MAPOMA:    I am not sure I did.  I am not sure I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, had you seen other opinions? 
MR MAPOMA:    I am not sure.  Remember, Mr Gama’s 
disciplinary and opinions and stuff, I would come into the 
10 
matter very, very late after bargaining council and Mr 
Mkhwanazi came in. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    There would have been opinion probably 
that were returned for one or other boardroom Exco and so 
on, that would have missed me.  But if they were sent to 
me I would have read them.  I do not deny that they were 
sent to me, if they would have been sent to me I would 
have read them but I do not recall which one is this one, 
which one is that one. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you ever see an opinion from Mr 
Todd of Bowmans? 
MR MAPOMA:    I will have seen it if it was sent to me 
although I do not [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I am not asking you that.  It 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 155 of 209 
 
does not help …[intervenes] 
MR MAPOMA:    I do not recall it off my head, Mr 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mapoma, you occupied a senior 
legal position in the company. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You were being asked at one point in 
time to produce a memorandum dealing with the fairness or 
unfairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not bother to look around 
and see if there were legal opinions? 
MR MAPOMA:    I had the juniors that were working with 
me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am asking you.  You did not look 
around for legal opinions? 
MR MAPOMA:    No, I did not at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you did not look around for legal 
opinions, at least one would have expected you to call for 
20 
the ruling of the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry 
because you would know that if you went to that ruling that 
you ought to find the reasons that the Chairperson of the 
disciplinary enquiry advanced or why he found Mr Gama 
guilty of the charges that had been preferred against him 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 156 of 209 
 
and why he recommended that Mr Gama should be 
dismissed.  One would have thought that you would be 
interested at least to read those.   
Well, there were two rulings.  Actually one, on 
whether Mr Gama was guilty of the charges and the other 
one, whether or what sanction would be fair, would be 
appropriate.   
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One would have expected you that you 
would 
have 
been 
interested 
particularly 
after 
the 
10 
Chairperson, Mr Mkhwanazi, mentioned that he wanted the 
memo 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
whether 
there 
was 
unfairness.  You did not try and access those rulings. 
MR MAPOMA:    No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not? 
MR MAPOMA:    No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you accept that that is what would 
have been expected from you? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    Chair, a decision that is communicated to 
me had been taken already to reinstate Mr Gama.  So 
whatever opinion or whatever was said, it was a decision 
that had been taken already.  It was taken.  My opinion or 
analysis of that opinion say or said, I do not think that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 157 of 209 
 
would have changed much because there were, at that 
stage, negotiations for settlement already ongoing between 
Mr Mkhwanazi and Mr Gama.   
So as to opinions about the fairness or unfairness, 
the rightness or wrongness of whatever had happened in 
the past, I do not think would have amounted to much and I 
must have had that view at the time and say not – to use 
the counsel’s word, bother myself to be looking for 
opinions on whether the outcome was fair or not because 
they were already bent on doing this thing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, if Mr Mkhwanazi had not 
asked that the two pager should include – the two pager 
that should be prepared for him should include the 
question 
of 
whether 
there 
was 
unfairness, 
I 
would 
understand your answer, you know? 
MR MAPOMA:    H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would understand your answer.  But 
once he specifically request that that be addressed, I 
would expect that if you had not read that ruling and if you 
did not have a view on the fairness or otherwise of Mr 
20 
Gama’s dismissal, I would expect that you would want to 
read that but irrespective of whether the board would 
change its view or not simply because Mr Mkhwanazi 
requested that the two pager should include something on 
that. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 158 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is what makes me think that I 
would have expected that you would at least want to read 
that in order to be able to address this issue that he 
requested be addressed.  You accept that? 
MR MAPOMA:    No, I understand that.  I understand where 
you are coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    But at that time I was working with the 
attorneys. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    And the instruction was given to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    As a team and maybe I used the word 
wrongly, and we produced the two pager that he was 
looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So that is paragraph 1.1 
at page 20.  All the opinions say prospects of challenging 
his dismissal are not prospects of success. 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you go to page 21 under the 
heading Sanction, you will see that is precisely the same 
paragraph that Deneys Reitz inserted as paragraph 10 into 
your memo, with the footnote. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 159 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if you go to page 22 you 
will see that Deneys Reitz conclude in precisely the same 
terms as the inserted paragraph 11 into your memo. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where they say there is a probability 
that the sanction may be found unfair. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you read this opinion when you 
received it? 
10 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I am sure I read it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you able to reconcile 
paragraph  1.1 with paragraph 4? 
MR MAPOMA:    You cannot reconcile. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You cannot. 
MR MAPOMA:    H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What view did you form then when 
you read this report?  I mean, what is going on here. 
MR MAPOMA:    It contradicts itself. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is what? 
20 
MR MAPOMA:    It contradicts itself. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It contradicts itself? 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess Mr Myburgh is asking whether 
you did anything about this contradiction. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 160 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    I do not think I did anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not do anything? 
MR MAPOMA:    No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And just – I do not know if you had 
an opportunity of reflecting on the language.  What does it 
mean to say there is a probability that something may 
happen? 
MR MAPOMA:    [indistinct] 21.13  that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, I mean, does it make sense to 
10 
you? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I mean, it is as long that is used all 
the time, the probability of something happening. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   May. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, the language is certainly used, 
the probability of something happening but the probability 
of something may be happening is difficult to understand, 
is it not? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, it is. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes because …[intervenes] 
MR MAPOMA:    As long as it is used – and I have seen it 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because they may might just as well 
go the other way. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 161 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes.     
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So did you understand this advice? 
MR MAPOMA:    I understood it at the time but if you want 
it now and you want to interpret the language, well you can 
sitting here with all the documents you have.  At the time 
the two pager that Mr Mkhwanazi asked from me and Mr 
Gooley was delivered to him and this what you were 
referring me to earlier.  This opinion that we have here on 
the – that is dated 22 Feb. It is also an opinion that rightly, 
when you look at it now, does not seem to make sense, 
10 
while paragraph 1.1 says another thing, the last paragraph 
says something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you read that sentence which has 
got probability, did you read it as meaning that the 
probabilities were that the bargaining council would find 
the 
sanction 
of 
dismissal 
inappropriate? 
 
Did 
you 
understand it to be to that effect? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how you understood it. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And with that understanding you then 
found it in conflict with 1.1? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, oaky. 
MR MAPOMA:    Because, you see, 1.1 is what the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 162 of 209 
 
attorneys are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja, it is their opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    But they are also telling us that even if we 
say this, probably the bargaining council can see it 
differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    With the fact that what it says 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, no, you may be introducing 
new ones that may be one might not pick up.  Are you 
saying the attorneys in the two paragraphs are saying – or 
are saying in the – effectively saying on the one hand our 
opinion is that there are no good prospects for Mr Gama to 
succeed in the bargaining council, the arbitration, in 
having the dismissal declared unfair and get reinstatement.  
That is the opinion they give. 
MR MAPOMA:    H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, having said that, are you saying in 
20 
the later paragraph that has got probability, they are 
saying irrespective of our opinion we think probably the 
bargaining council  will find the dismissal unfair and 
reinstate Mr Gama?  Is that how you read it? 
MR MAPOMA:    That is how I read it, Chair.  You see, an 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 163 of 209 
 
opinion can be given to say what are your views on this, to 
give them the views but you cannot be asked to guarantee 
then what is a particular body going to – how is going to 
decide, it is about the views, strong as they may be at 
some stage.  But now if you are asked well, what is the 
bargaining council going to say?  You cannot say that.  You 
must allow for the fact that there might be somebody else 
who differs with your strong views, with your strong 
opinion.  So I think that is what the attorneys are saying.  
There [indistinct] 00.25 but despite our view that the 
10 
prospects are good, there is a possibility that the council 
can still rule in his favour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you …[intervenes] 
MR MAPOMA:    This is my interpretation of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if that is how you understood two 
paragraphs then there would be no contradiction. 
MR MAPOMA:    Well, in the sense that counsel is asking 
the questions because the way he is asking, juxtaposes the 
two so say if there is an opinion that the prospects are not 
good then for them now to say to right the probabilities of 
20 
this person seems to call it [indistinct] 25.56.  And I agree 
with him, you can read it like that.  His reason is also a 
way of looking at this thing but there was also another way 
of looking at it where I say an opinion can be g3iven, very 
strongly to say this is my view on this but be alive to the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 164 of 209 
 
fact that another body can reach a different conclusion 
despite what I say.  So that is my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you did say you saw the two as 
contradictory to each other. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I say that in the context of the 
question that he is asking me now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  I mean the one 
10 
thing you cannot do is interpret this opinion as saying that 
Transnet prospects of success were poor. 
MR MAPOMA:   Can you come again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is no way of interpreting this 
opinion as meaning that the advice was that Transnet’s 
prospects of success were poor. 
MR MAPOMA:    Paragraph 1.1 is clear that the opinion is 
that they are not good, it is almost good, is that not what it 
says? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I does not say they are not good, Mr 
20 
Mapoma …[intervenes] 
MR MAPOMA:    It says it is not good. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It highlights what you put in your 
memo.  There is a risk that comes with all litigation.  
Where does it say that your prospects of success are bad, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 165 of 209 
 
you are going to lose this case? 
MR MAPOMA:    No, it is not saying so.  Does not say so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
MR MAPOMA:    Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So do you see any basis for 
settlement on the basis of that advice? 
MR MAPOMA:    No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That it does not mean anything? 
MR MAPOMA:    No, I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let me take you to something 
10 
that I must say has been troubling me about your evidence.  
You – at the beginning, when we were dealing with your 
first affidavit you said that you first began work in relation 
to the Gama matter after the Public Protector ’s complaint, 
you worked together with Mr Mkhwanazi in addressing the 
Public Protector ’s complaint.  is that right? 
MR MAPOMA:    No, that is not a correction, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you have occasion to go to 
meetings, board of directors or subcommittees of the board 
where you would address them in relation to no doubt what 
20 
was an important thing, that being the Public Protector ’s 
complaint?  
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you please to go to 
bundle 1 and to turn up page 827?   
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 166 of 209 
 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now this is an annexure to the 
affidavit of Doris Tshepe who was a director at the time.  At 
827 you find a minute of a meeting of the Corporate 
Governance and Nomination Committee of 3 February 
2011, is that correct? 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you will see at 1.2 that members 
of that committee that were present, it seems when Mr 
Mkhwanazi, Ms Nkanya …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MAPOMA:    Mnyaka. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mnyaka, I beg your pardon, Ms 
Tshepe and Mr Sharma. 
MR MAPOMA:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if you drop down, so there 
are four, the Chairman and then three members.  You drop 
down under 1.4 you see that you were there as well. 
 ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I was there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Together with your boss Ms 
Stephen? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now perhaps I can just you please 
over the page to 828 and ask you to have a look at 
paragraph 6.7, the heading being “Report back from the 
Advert Process”, and you will see that the text there what 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 167 of 209 
 
was happening is this committee was applying its mind 
wasn’t it to the new – to filling the position of the Group 
Chief Executive.  
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes, I see that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you then go to page 830, you 
will see towards the middle of the page there’s a heading 
at 6.9, “Investigation by the Public Protector”. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And there it records at 691,  
“Mr Mapoma took the committee through Senior 
10 
Counsels opinion that was obtained with regard to 
Mr Gama’s application with the GCE position”. 
He highlighted that the legal opinion was based on the 
following issues, 
“Does the guilty verdict against Mr Gama exclude 
him from being considered in the current GCE 
selection process, how does the pending appeal, 
affect the Board decision, does the Public Protector 
complaint currently being dealt with have any 
bearing?” 
20 
 
When you talk about an appeal, I assume you’re 
talking about the Bargaining Council arbitration? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That would have been it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so we will get, in a moment, to 
a clause in one of the Transnet’s policies, clause 4.8.4, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 168 of 209 
 
you’ve heard of that clause. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I’ve heard. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what does that clause provide. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I will have to look at the minute now 
because I don’t recall it off my head. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But I think it’s got to do with the – 
somebody who had been dismissed and who had not been 
– who was supposed to not to be allowed to apply again for 
the position in the company. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, precisely. 
ADV MAPOMA:   It was to that effect. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that’s in fact, why you had 
sought Senior Counsel’s opinion.  I mean one of the 
questions that Senior Counsel was asked is, does the 
guilty verdict against Mr Gama exclude him from being 
considered, correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So, let’s then go, to what was the 
central debate at this meeting.  Let me ask you to go to 
20 
page 831 and let me direct your attention please, to 
paragraph 6.3.13 where it says deviation from clause 
4.8.4, do you see that?  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the first sub-paragraph says, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 169 of 209 
 
“Ms Tshepe and Mr Nyaka stated that the current 
settlement 
negotiations 
with 
Mr 
Gama 
were, 
presumably a rationale for deviation from clause 
4.8.4 but because there were current settlement 
negotiations that was a rationale to deviate from 
that clause”, 
 
That’s what they said. 
ADV MAPOMA:   That’s what they say ja? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Sharma disagreed and stated that 
it was not in the best interest of the organisation to deviate 
10 
from clause 4.8.4. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Next sub-paragraph, 
“Mr Sharma stated that he was unhappy with how 
Mr Gama’s matter was being handled.   He indicated 
that he was of the view that the committee was not 
considering the best interest of the company but 
that of an individual”. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean, what was being considered 
20 
here was whether a dismissed Chief Executive, dismissed 
from a division of Transnet, could be in the running for the 
Group Chief Executive, correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The next sub-paragraph, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 170 of 209 
 
“The committee voted on whether or not it should 
deviate from clause 4.8.4, there were three votes 
against one, in favour of deviation”,  
 
So, we certainly – we’ll see just now Mr Sharma 
voted against it, Mr Mkhwanazi and the two other members 
voted in favour of a deviation. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if you go to the next sub-
paragraph below that, 
“The committee resolved that it recommends that 
10 
Gama be considered for the GCE selection process, 
correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, do you accept that there was 
an extensive debate about deviating from clause 4.8.4? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, there was a debate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you participated in that debate. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I was participating, I was asked 
certain advice – questions were asked to me, I will answer 
them, so I participated. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now – and I brought this to your 
attention, Ms Tshepe, at page 833, she has produced – she 
obtained a recording of this meeting and she produced a 
transcript of it. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I saw that this morning. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 171 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And there’s a certificate of veracity, 
you see that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I saw that but having seen that, I 
just want to bring something to your attention that you 
might not be aware of.  There are instances where my 
name is written against what Mr Mkhwanazi will be saying, 
for instance he’ll be saying I want to bring Mr Gama to my 
office and that will be written against my name, so I will 
not accept that…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright we can deal with that. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   So, there will be some inaccuracies in 
respect of that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, no, that  I understand but I 
want you take you to a particular portion of this transcript 
which I have brought to your attention before. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us go, please to page 854, now I 
just want to contextualise this, this is really towards the 
end of the debate, because if you look at 855, I’m going to 
go through it in detail, you see at the foot of 855 it says at 
20 
715, 
“Colleagues I will deviate, I will do the same, I will 
not, we will record it, three against one”, 
 
So, you see there’s the voting at the foot of 855? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 172 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, this passage that I’m going to 
take you to, at the end of the debate, immediately before 
the vote.  Let’s start at 854 and I want to take you two 
lines above, what is recorded on the left as 685, you see 
that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The Chairman – Who is the 
Chairman of this meeting? 
ADV MAPOMA:   You asking who was the Chairman of the 
meeting? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who was the Chairman of the 
meeting? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It was Mr Mkhwanazi. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct, so Mr Mkhwanazi says, 
 
“Can you comment on that, the appeal process”, 
 
Now we know that’s the arbitration,  
“Can you comment and then it records opposite 
your 
name, 
CA 
is 
not 
appealing 
against 
the 
20 
dismissal 
for 
all 
intents, 
he’s 
appealing 
the 
sanction, [indistinct] Ms Tshepe but the sanction is 
the dismissal.  Nyaka, he’s not appealing against, 
we agree with that”, 
 
Then over the page opposite your name, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 173 of 209 
 
“He’s not appealing against the finding of guilty, 
he’s appealing against the dismissal, now I said”, 
 
You said that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I said that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then Ms Tshepe said,  
“Which is the disqualification, sorry Saaks I just 
want to understand which is the disqualification”, 
 
So, you refer to a Saaks. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I’m Saaks, you just misspelled my 
name a lot. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sure, you said that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   The line…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ms Tshepe said that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   He’s not appealing against the finding of 
guilty appealing against the dismissal now I said – then it 
gets cut off. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct, could you then read please, 
to the Chairperson, what you said after that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   From 695 to 703. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair, the said paragraph reads as 
follows, against my name, 
“Right, now I advise the Chair to say that, if we as 
Transnet go to the appeal and oppose the appeal, 
we stand a very good chance of winning that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 174 of 209 
 
appeal”, 
 
That was my view at the time, 
“Where I’m saying, we are not strong Doris is, if we 
have to explain the rationality of why we are 
settling, I don’t think we are on very strong grounds 
on that, that is my view but …[indistinct] of itself 
and if we go and argue the matter on the appeal we 
stand a very good chance of succeeding.  You see I 
can win, but we can also win as Transnet, but we 
have a very, very good case against him there”, 
10 
 
That is why we said, let us rather postpone to the 
24 t h of April Chair, after another hearing, so that we pursue 
the settlement process, so the dismissal – then it gets cut 
off again. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, let’s just look at this now, here 
you say that Transnet had a very, very good case. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Right, and in fact what you say, is 
that settlement would not be rationale.  
ADV MAPOMA:   I say so, that’s the fact of it. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, up until now you’ve been telling 
the Chairperson that you didn’t have any view on this 
matter, why?  Here you are expressing the strongest view, 
“we have a very, very, good case”, where we’re going to 
act irrationally is if we settle, how do you reconcile that 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 175 of 209 
 
with your evidence earlier, that you had no view? 
ADV MAPOMA:   well my view would have been formed at 
some stage…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is on the 3 r d of February, your 
view didn’t disappear, did it, before the consultation? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Or your memorandum? 
ADV MAPOMA:   This I got this morning, I record it, I read 
it and I remember it and I agree it correctly reflects what I 
said at the time. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   So, what’s important is, you got it this 
morning, before you gave evidence in the Commission, 
that’s why, I purposely, as a courtesy to you, brought this 
to your attention. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well it might have been the way the 
question was asked but my view is recorded there at the 
time of the meeting, remember this meeting happened, not 
on the same time as when we were at …[indistinct] 
because Mr Mkhwanazi’s request was when …[indistinct] in 
writing something that said Mr Gama had been treated 
20 
unfairly.  At that time…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mapoma, you’re really mixing 
yourself up now.  When you said to the Chairperson that 
you had no view on the merits, is when I was examining 
you in relation to your memorandum. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 176 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That you wrote on the 14 t h of 
February.  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is at a meeting, very, very 
important meeting on the 3 r d of February. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You’re not suggesting to the 
Chairperson that on the 3 r d of February I had a very strong 
view and then my view evaporated by the 14 t h of February, 
10 
you’re not suggesting that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I’m not suggesting that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, what is your position? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It might well be – my recollection, maybe 
I might have forgotten, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it’s something that does need 
some explanation, particularly if you were given this in the 
morning and you were able to read it and therefore you 
remember – if you had forgotten you remembered that you 
did express quite a strong view on the merits, of prospects 
20 
of success at this meeting.  Now, when you were asked in 
the course of the day, whether you had a view on the 
unfairness or otherwise of Mr Gama’s dismissal, one would 
have expected that two thins would happen.  One is, that 
you’d say, yes I had a view because you had read it, you 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 177 of 209 
 
had refreshed your memory and this was my view or you 
might say, well I had a view from a certain time but before 
that time I might not have had a view, that’s another 
possibility but to the extent that we were dealing with a 
time that is later than the 3 r d, that was later than the 3 r d of 
February where you said you did not have a view and you 
did not even say, look I have actually seen something – 
there’s a time that I expressed a view. So, it’s going to be 
important to check where – the timing that – if you had 
said that, that might be – might have been something else 
10 
but you didn’t say that you said, you said, you had no view 
and that was it. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Sir, we’ll have to look at the context of 
these questions.  I answered that in the morning because 
we were coming from the consultation note meetings, we 
were coming from a request that Mr Mkhwanazi had made 
for us to have an opinion on whether Mr Gama had been 
treated unfairly at the time, which we wanted to go and tell 
the Board and at the time that he asked me that, I still say, 
I didn’t have a view on the matter and then you continued 
20 
and you said but you then received opinions later on and 
so on and so on but his was now after Mr Mkhwanazi, at 
the time when he asked me this thing.  At the time I knew 
that – he had informed me that the Board had already 
taken a decision to reinstate Mr Gama, all that was left 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 178 of 209 
 
were the details of the settlement.  So, my views were 
irrelevant as it were or views of anybody because a 
decision had been taken already for Mr Gama to be 
reinstated…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, no, but Mr Mapoma the point – one 
of the points Mr Myburgh made which, you agreed with is 
once you had a view and you had a strong view on the 3 r d 
of February, that view was not going to evaporate after 
that. 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I agree with that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so mid February, a week or two 
weeks later or even three weeks later, when you were 
asked to formulate – prepare a two pager which would 
include the issue of prospects of success or the issue of 
whether there was unfairness in the dismissal, you knew 
that you had a strong view and the strong view was, 
Transnet had a very good chance of winning in the 
arbitration, there was no unfairness, as far as you were 
concerned in how Transnet had dealt with Mr Gama.  So, 
why did you say you did not have a view at that time 
20 
because you did have a view and a strong one at that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Maybe my view was formed at different 
times I really cannot be able to explain on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are not able to explain? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 179 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Myburgh?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me just pick up on a few things.  
If you go back to your words, “we have a very, very good 
case, then you say that is why we said, let us rather 
postpone to the 24 t h of April Chair, after another hearing, 
so we can pursue settlement”, I mean, do I understand this 
to mean that you understood that you didn’t want to go to 
arbitration because you could lose and that’s why the 
arbitration 
was 
postponed 
so 
that 
you 
could 
settle, 
correct? 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   I don’t know whether I will agree with you 
there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, Mr Mapoma you don’t postpone 
an arbitration because you have a very, very good case, 
you postpone it for some other reason. 
ADV MAPOMA:   The arbitration matter was dealt with by 
lawyers that I had no contact with.  I’m sitting at the 
meeting where different kinds of questions are asked and 
I’m asked for an opinion there and for the life of me, if you 
ask me now to pinpoint a particular reason why X and Y 
20 
was said, I might not be able to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well I just – I’m sorry I’m just going 
to ask you this once more.  What did you mean when you 
said, “we have a very, very good case against him there, 
that is why we said, let us rather postpone”? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 180 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I don’t recall even what was being 
postponed but when I look at this thing, this paragraph 
…[indistinct] I mean without context.  I would  have to 
know now whether was the hearing on the 24 t h of February, 
I’m not sure as I’m sitting here now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, so what’s happened now is – 
remember this is right at the end of this debate.  You’ve 
said we’ve got a very, very good case. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Look at what Doris Tshepe then said, 
10 
“Sorry Chair, I’m very confused, then you have to 
explain to me, why are we settling if we’re going to 
win the case”, 
 
A good question hey, so it’s a good question? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Not me, it was the Board that decided to 
do that, so she should have asked that question from them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I’m asking you, it’s a good question 
to ask, isn’t it? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct, she says, 
20 
“I’m confused then you have to explain to me why 
we’re settling if we’re going to win the case”, 
 
Then what does Mr Mkhwanazi say? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Do you want me to read? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 181 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   It means I will deviate from clause 4.8. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, what was Mr Mkhwanazi say at 
9705 in response to her? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Oh sorry, sorry then he says, “we don’t 
know”.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We don’t know? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How did you understand that – what 
did 
you 
understand 
that 
to 
mean? 
 
So, 
it’s 
put 
to…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is – I’m sorry Mr Myburgh, 
the question from Ms Tshepe is, if we have a very good 
case, why are we settling? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the Chairperson says, we don’t 
know, did you understand his answer, the Chairperson’s 
answer? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I don’t think I would have understood 
at the time but that is what is recorded there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   At the time that this meeting was 
happening, a decision to settle Mr Gama had been taken 
already, even if it was not by this committee.  So, by the 
time this committee is sitting and they have to make their 
own decisions on this, it was after this committee then this 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 182 of 209 
 
was supposed to go to the Board, so the sequence of 
events, I am also not able to explain because at this time 
the decision is already there, negotiations are happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   See, what you are saying may be an 
explanation for something else but I don’t think it fits into 
what we’re talking about because here this reflects that 
this committee is entertaining the issue of, how good are 
our chances of winning this case, in the arbitration.  So, 
there is a discussion that’s why you say, “we have a very 
strong case”, you know.  So, Ms Tshepe then asked the 
10 
question, “but why are we then settling”, and – because 
she says she gets confuse by the fact that you are saying, 
Transnet has a very good case but she knows Transnet is 
seeking to settle or something or some people within 
Transnet are talking – are saying, let’s settle.  So, she’s 
saying, why then are we settling, then the Chairperson 
says, we don’t know. 
ADV MAPOMA:   When I’m in that meeting, Chair, I mean 
that meeting with knowledge or information that the Board 
has already taken this decision because this is initially 
20 
what Mr Mafuda had told me.  So, here are Board members 
now asking these kinds of questions from the Chairperson.  
So, for me as well, I don’t understand why Board members 
who were supposed to be part of a decision already would 
be sitting in this meeting asking all these kinds of 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 183 of 209 
 
questions but then the answer is, as recorded there, we 
don’t 
know 
and 
then 
it 
continues 
further 
down…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course it goes to the question that Mr 
Myburgh posed to you earlier on, namely, where he was 
reading that you said we – Transnet has a very, very good 
case, that’s why we postponed to pursue settlement, the 
two don’t go together you see.  So, now Ms Tshepe says, 
why are we settling then, Mr Mkhwanazi says, we don’t 
know but Mr Mkhwanazi is the Chairperson of the Board. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If anybody should know or should be 
able to explain what the Board is doing it should be the 
Chairperson, the leader. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says, we don’t know, I’m sorry I 
interrupted you Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you, Mr Chairperson.  So, 
the Chairperson says, we don’t know, then Ms Tshepe, to 
her credit says, but Saaks says we stand a very good 
20 
chance of winning and then what does the Chairperson 
say? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Do you want me to read that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Chairperson, it’s a 50/50. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 184 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, this is a Chairperson who starts 
out by saying, I’ve got no idea why we’re settling, and the 
sentence later says, well actually our prospects of success 
are 50/50. He doesn’t agree with  you, you’re the lawyer, 
you say, we have a very, very good case, quite a shift isn’t 
it? 
ADV MAPOMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then – you didn’t quarrel with 
him, I mean, you didn’t think it was a 50/50 case. 
ADV MAPOMA:   No but …[intervenes]. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You thought it was a very good case. 
ADV MAPOMA:   [Indistinct] against you would not just 
jump in and – you would have to answer when – talk when 
called upon. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well let’s see what Mr Nyaka has to 
say, I just want to check – before we get to that because 
it’s an important passage.  You – in your position as, what 
is it, General Manager Legal? 
ADV MAPOMA:   General Manager Group Legal. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   General Manager Group Legal? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That’s a high legal position – high 
up legal position. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You reported to Ms Stevens?  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 185 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s just under the Executives?  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   There were a number of GM’s reporting to 
various Executives. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you were involved in this 
because of your legal acumen, I mean, you had been 
brought in to deal with the Public Protector issue, you had 
got an opinion dealing with the deviation from clause 4.6.4, 
10 
you had briefed Senior Counsel, correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And just so that we understand it, at 
this time you were legally qualified, we know that you had 
left Transnet to go and do your pupillage but this time, 
presumably, you were legally qualified? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now, Mr Mapoma how could you, on 
the 3 r d of February 2011, at this meeting say, Transnet had 
20 
a very, very good case, a very, very good chance of 
winning the case if you had never read the rulings of the 
Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry? 
ADV MAPOMA: [Inaudible mic not on].   
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Sorry 
Chair, 
the 
witnesses’ 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 186 of 209 
 
microphone is off apparently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just keep it on Mr Mapoma. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I didn’t realise that it was off.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that, when you said that 
this meeting, Transnet had a very, very good case, one, 
you had not read the reasons or the rulings of the 
Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry but two, you may 
have read somebody’s opinion on the matter – on the case. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I’m sure I must have read some opinion 
Chair because there was a lot of correspondence, writings 
10 
on this Mr Gama issue, I would have formed an opinion 
from somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you able to remember whether 
you did – you had read an opinion or you say, you are not 
sure, maybe you had read an opinion or maybe you had not 
read 
but 
you 
had 
formed 
your 
opinion 
based 
on…[intervenes]. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I must have read an opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must have read an opinion? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you can’t remember whose opinion it 
may have been? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I can’t remember, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it have been an opinion from the 
Deneys Reitz? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 187 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Possibly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Possibly? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Or the one from Mr ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:  I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Didn’t you say earlier on you had not 
read any opinions when you were saying you had no view?  
ADV MAPOMA:   I had read opinions, Chair, even in my 
own memorandum that I’d written to Anoj I referred to an 
opinion, I quoted it, one of the opinions that I had come 
10 
across I actually quoted it there. So, I know that there 
were opinions on this floating around, but I cannot pinpoint 
as to where exactly I would have read that to make my 
view what it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well part of what’s concerning to me is 
that at some stage you said you had no opinion about the 
merits of Mr Gama’s case or the fairness or otherwise of 
his dismissal and then we discover that, at some stage you 
didn’t just have an opinion, you had a very strong opinion 
but you had not read the rulings of the Chairperson of the 
20 
disciplinary inquiry and you may have read or did read 
some opinions that you can’t remember who they were 
written by and so on, that’s the sum total of what you are 
saying? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 188 of 209 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So, we have got to the 
Chairperson now saying, it’s a 50/50 case. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let’s have a look what Mr Nyaka 
then says, 
 
“I think, Chair, let’s move it from legal now”, 
 
So you had just, as the second most senior legal mind 
in the organisation said, that we have a very, very good 
case, Mr Nyaka says, let’s move it from legal now because 
10 
that’s the problem, I think let’s move it from legal, he’s 
given his opinion which I, by the way, don’t agree with.  It 
is his opinion.  I have an opinion.  He shares an opinion.  
Everyone else has an opinion.  Now the accountability and 
the decision making comes from this committee and let us 
decide at this committee that we... what we are deciding on 
this deviation.   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean, now that you read that, what 
is your sense of it that you brought the ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  I think my... not 
knowing what that Clause 4.8 says is hampering my 
understanding.  Do you ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to remind what it says, the 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 189 of 209 
 
one that ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, that is the clause.  The Clause 
8.4 and we will get to the exact text but in the context of the 
debate, it is a provision that says that if you are dismissed 
by Transnet then you should not be reappointed.  So it is to 
prevent people being dismissed and then coming back into 
their status. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the issue here was whether or not 
there could be a deviation from that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  But the... as far as you 
understand, there was nothing in the policies that made 
provision for a deviation but there was a question simply at 
the meeting whether even though there might be nothing a 
deviation was possible. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chair, I do not think I can responsible 
answer that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, without having got 
the text to the policy.  I will give that to you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what I can say is that I am aware 
of the fact that an opinion was obtained by senior counsel.  
An opinion that has been referred to and you will confirm this 
is, that the opinion was that Transnet did have a measure of 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 190 of 209 
 
discretion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it seems that the advise was not an 
absolute part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that is why they were entertaining 
the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So here you give this view.  We have 
got a very, very strong case.  And you see what the director 
10 
says.  Well, it just a view.  Let us leave it at that.  I have got 
my view.  My view is different. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What did you... what is your sense of 
it, now when you look at it in black-and-white? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I suppose that they have emphasised that 
discretion.  I do not know.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you have any idea what... when Ms 
Myanna(?) said that she does not agree with your opinion?  
Have you any idea what information she had at her disposal 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...to inform that opinion? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know if she was a lawyer who was 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 191 of 209 
 
legally qualified? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, I do not.  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I knew Ms Doris(?) to have an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   If I am correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But I just know about Ms Myanna.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know what the chairperson’s 
basis was for saying that Transnet’s prospects were 50/50?  
Do you know why he said that or is it something that you do 
not know? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know.  Okay alright.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Then just to close off on 
this.  Straight after that, the chairperson says:   
“Colleagues, I will deviate from Clause 4.8.   
Myanna says:   
20 
“I will do the same”.   
Tshepe says:   
I will not.   
Chairperson says:   
“We will record it.  It is three against one.  Yes, we 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 192 of 209 
 
will record it.” 
 
So the three would have been the Ms Tshepe, Myanna, 
the chairperson, right? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ms Tshepe on the face of it seems to 
change her mind quite fast. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, it seems so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Who?  Ms Tshepe? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, she is the one that says:  What 
10 
are we settling for?  What are we doing here.  And then a 
few sentences later, she herself agreed to the deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps, just to go back to... because 
it is captured perhaps better in the minutes as to what the 
rational was for agreeing to deviation.  Can I take you back 
please to page 831, paragraph 6.3.13? 
ADV MAPOMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sub-one: 
“Ms Tshepe and Ms Myanna stated that the current 
20 
settlement negotiation with Mr Gama were rational 
for the deviation for Clause 4.8.4.” 
 
In other words.  Look, he has been dismissed, right.  But 
we are going to settle with him and if we are going to do 
that.  Well, then we might as well deviate.  Right? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 193 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that correct? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is what ...[indistinct]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it was in that context that there 
was an interrogation of prospects of success, right? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And Ms Tshepe says:  But if you are 
going to win this case then why are we settling this case? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, is it not remarkable that this 
10 
committee was having this discussion in the first place?  Mr 
Gama remained dismissed from Transnet at the time of this 
meeting, okay?   
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he had been dismissed after having 
been found guilty of three very serious acts of misconduct.  
At least you know that part. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And it was known that he was not 
challenging the finding that he was guilty of these very 
20 
serious acts of misconduct.   
 
He was only challenging whether even if he was guilty of 
those quite serious acts of misconduct, dismissal should 
have been imposed as a sanction.  
 
Now I do not understand why there is an entertainment 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 194 of 209 
 
of the idea that somebody who has been dismissed, there 
should be a debate about whether that person should be 
interviewed 
in 
circumstances 
where 
there 
is 
litigation 
pending.  Because if at the close of the...  
 
If by the deadline for the submission of applications, he 
is still dismissed, I would have thought that you do not 
entertain him.   
 
You entertain the ones who have not been dismissed.  If 
the closing date happens to be after the settlement had been 
made and he had been reinstated and he puts in an 
10 
application, that is something else.  
 
But as at the time he remains dismissed.  Is there 
something I am missing?   
ADV MAPOMA:   Chair, I agree with you.  But it would be a 
question better answered by others, not me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What I want to... I seek to is whether that 
is something that may have perplexed you as well as to why 
this was happening? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, because you are sitting in a meeting 
like this with board members who you have been informed 
20 
were already party to a decision for the reinstatement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And you are being... you are still asked 
about the deviations from policy and all this and all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 195 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   And you give... and it has uttered the three, 
one at a time. [utterance not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So all these things were perplexing at the 
time without manage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Not very easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And you will... when you got that 
transcripts, the one that counsel was referring to, you will 
10 
see a lot of discussions there, jumping from one issue to the 
other.  Very, very difficult to follow even that discussion.  
And how I respond to what is asked of me and the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   So it was not an easy thing to manage at 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  And to end off, Mr 
Mapoma.  Perhaps I can just take you back to your third 
affidavit at page 29 of Bundle 3.  We have been dealing with 
20 
the new documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well... I am sorry, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 29 of Bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  I am sorry.  I am 
interrupting you for something else.  You know, the... 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 196 of 209 
 
yesterday and the day before and last week, I think, I was 
hearing... well, yesterday and sometime last week, I was 
hearing evidence into Eskom.   
 
One of the things that seemed to emerge in regard to 
Eskom and the suspension of certain executives at Eskom 
was that within the board of Eskom, there may have been 
certain members of the board who might have known of a 
certain agenda which would involve the suspension of those 
executives and maybe even a larger plan.   
 
But there may have been others who might not have 
10 
known about that.   
 
If you look at Ms Tshepe’s questions here, all saying:  
But if we have a good case.  Why are we settling?  It might 
be that he had too.   
 
Well, because Mr Mapoma says the board had already 
decided that they would reinstate Mr Gama.   
 
But here is a board member saying:  Why are we settling 
because we have a good case?   
 
So it may be that here too some members knew why they 
were settling the case.  Others did not know. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I am sorry.  I interrupted you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, no.  Not all Mr Chairperson.  We 
...[intervenes] 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said the bundle...? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 197 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We dealt with the documents at page 
30 of Bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 3? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  This is your third affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 30 of Bundle 3.  And there you 
see, you talk about the various annexures.  But just to end 
off.  Could I ask you to go to paragraph 8 and could you read 
that into the record?  You have already given evidence along 
these lines. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes.  The paragraph reads: 
“I mentioned in this regard that from the outset of 
my interactions with Mr Mkwanazi, he made it clear 
to me that he had been instructed to reinstate Mr 
Gama and that he wanted to find a way to do so 
cleanly.  
Although I did not consider it my place to ask who 
had instructed him, I assumed that it must have 
been former President Zuma.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just wanted to ask you.  What did 
20 
you understand the word cleanly to mean in the context of 
that discussion? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Well, Mr Mkwanazi said a number of things 
that I think he was worried about.  One of them being the 
various acting appointments in the company.  Because one, 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 198 of 209 
 
Mr Gama was reinstated to any position.   
 
So there had to be perceived of the various executives.  
And he wanted to deal also with the media, the outfall.  The 
fallout rather, that would inevitably follow or some questions 
from the media that will follow.   
 
He also had to deal with the fact that there was a 
dismissal in place which had not been reviewed.   
 
When he said he wanted to do it cleanly, I understand 
that he wanted it to be taken to board approvals, all the 
relevant committees so that it is a decision that the company 
10 
takes.   
 
And I did advise him that whatever he was doing, 
discussion that he had with Mr Gama, he should ensure that 
he takes it to the board approval because the position that 
he was holding he himself was the CEO and acting CEO and 
as a chairperson of the board.   
 
So he had to make a point that he follows proper 
governance and lead by example.  I am sure these are the 
discussion that happened.  He did use that word.  That he 
wanted to do it cleanly.   
20 
 
And we did discuss what I am saying because in the 
various discussion that we had. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But do you have any idea as to why 
Transnet capitulated completely or Mr Mkwanazi capitulated 
completely in the settlement negotiations? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 199 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I do not know.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   You know, because that settlement 
agreement, in November already, I mean in 2011, the 
...[indistinct] had been signed.   
 
We were still being asked or opinions on the process 
that led to the bonus payments and so on and so on.  
[Indistinct] had signed these.  So I do not know why they 
signed(?) it but I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted Mr Myburgh to remark that I do 
10 
not 
think 
it 
is 
accurate 
to 
say 
Transnet 
capitulated 
completely 
because 
it 
would 
have 
been 
a 
complete 
capitulation if they reinstated Mr Gama.  They gave him full 
back pay and all the benefits.  But they went further than 
that.  So I do not what you call it.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They had paid his contribution of 75% on 
his legal costs and all of that.  So it seems to me that 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, perhaps ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it is something much more than 
capitulation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Maybe reinstatement on steroids, Mr 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]

ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I mean.  Mr Mapoma, again.  Are 
you not playing coy here?  Because you are involved.  
Surely, you must have thought to yourself:  Why are we 
giving this man everything?  What is actually happening? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is going on? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What is going on? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, Mr Mapoma.  I do not think 
that the exclusion of the attorneys in that meeting that 
Mr Mkwanazi had with Mr Gama, would not have, at some 
stage, 
flashed 
back 
to 
you 
to 
say: 
 
What 
was 
the 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Not the contents (?).  I had those concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had those concerns? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I had those concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what did you think was motivating 
this? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It was the instruction that Mr Gama was 
20 
reinstated.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   From who? 
ADV MAPOMA:   From the president. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 201 of 209 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Well, that is what Mr Mkwanazi(?), you 
know, explained it to me at the time.  So the ...[indistinct], 
the reasoning was always something I never understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I do not...  I am not... I do not 
hear. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I am saying Chair.  I... the reasoning, the 
rational of the process in the settlement agreement, I never 
understood them as to why they were there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to confirm because I will 
10 
need to make sure that the Chairperson heard this.  You 
testified that you were of the view that he was being treated 
so generously because the president had instructed that he 
be reinstated. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that your evidence? 
ADV MAPOMA:   That is my evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Now in your statement in paragraph 18 of 
your affidavit, you say you assumed that it must have been 
former President Zuma. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, was it an assumption that you made 
or was there something on which... let me put this questions.  
Was it an assumption or was it not an assumption? 
ADV MAPOMA:   The reason I come to that conclusion Chair.  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 202 of 209 
 
Because at some stage, I did ask Mr Mkwanazi... you know 
in my ...[indistinct]   
 
Because we got familiar with each other and I felt 
comfortable.  I could ask him certain things although I had to 
always ...[indistinct] to who he was in relation to me in the 
company.  And he indicated ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ask him? 
ADV MAPOMA:   I asked him:  Why is Transnet doing this?  
And then he indicated initially that this was coming from the 
ministry.  And later on, he indicated that this is coming from 
10 
higher up.  And this is the word that he used.  Higher up.   
 
But the president was not mentioned.  And I will not say 
he was mentioned.  He was not.  And the assumption comes 
from that.  Because as a shareholder minister at the time, 
the minister had certain authority over Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, h’m. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And they would interact, obviously, with Mr 
Mkwanazi at his level.  So I was not privy to discussion that 
they had but I know that...  and hence and in my memo, I 
could write that I wrote there.   
20 
 
That it mentions the minister’s name because that memo 
was going to Mr Mkwanazi and he would have read that.  And 
I know that he know... he would have known that.  He told 
me so.   
 
So I had no issue putting that paragraph in the manner 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 203 of 209 
 
that I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay of course, that is that memo where 
you have a sentence that says that Mr Mkwanazi with the 
chairperson with the support of the shareholder minister 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in his rights... within his rights. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was within his rights to revisit 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the disciplinary proceedings against Mr 
Gama. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is that memo where you wrote that. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which you gave to Mr Mkwanazi at some 
stage? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, that is what I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he never queried that sentence? 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, he never queried that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But are you saying that at some 
stage you asked him why Transnet was doing this?  When 
you say why this Transnet was doing this, what did you 
mean? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 204 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   I mean the reinstatement of Mr Gama at the 
time that we were having. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   And I cannot recall exactly when but there 
were problems with the payments as discussed earlier.  And 
a lot of pressure on the government to pay the complaints to 
the minister at some stage.   
 
But I do not know exactly when I would have asked him.  
But he would... he did inform me and the word he used:  No, 
from higher up.  And higher up was, my assumption was that 
10 
it is the presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say that he mentioned that the 
instruction was coming from the ministry? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At some stage? 
ADV MAPOMA:   At some stage, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at some stage, he said the instruction 
was coming from higher up. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was that the same conversation or on 
20 
a different occasion? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It could have been a different conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A different, okay. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Because I was not interrogating him like... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 205 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   And then I will not remember now 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...the exact details of the conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   As time goes on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   ...and this thing is becoming an issue in the 
company in the ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MAPOMA:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you say higher up on that 
occasion, he had not mention the minister or the ministry? 
ADV MAPOMA:   He had mentioned that is higher up from 
the ministry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he said higher up. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, higher than the minister? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Higher than the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you understood that. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you took it or assumed that that must 
be ...[intervenes]  
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 206 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Higher up ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...reference to the president? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair that was my assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Mapoma, at 
Bundle 3, page 30.  The second thing you deal with in your 
last affidavit is the payment of legal fees.  We have gone 
through all of this.   
 
I just want you to confirm please.  At paragraph 12.2 at 
page 31, you say...  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 lines down that: 
10 
“I held a discussion with Mr Mkwanazi which 
culminated in him instructing me to pay 75% of 
Transnet’s tax costs to Mr Gama.” 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have given evidence about that.  
Do you confirm that? 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, I confirm that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you go on to explain that you 
escalated the matter to Mr Singh and that he approved it. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, we have no further 
questions.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You never... by virtue of your 
position you would not have attended any meeting of the 
board except by invitation? 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 207 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Were you ever invited to any 
meeting of the board where the reasons for settling the 
unfair of dismissal or dispute of Mr Gama were discussed or 
where the pros and cons of whether to settle or not to settle 
or to reinstate him or not to reinstate him, were discussed? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It is possible that I attended such a 
meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Although I cannot recall specifically. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   But it is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I did.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MAPOMA:   It would have been only on this matter, I 
will be invited to attend Exco even if I wait outside, then be 
called for a specific thing and then leave.  So it is possible 
that I would have been invited to a board meeting for this 
kind of... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you have a recollection in your own 
mind of being part of such a meeting where such reasons 
were discussed? 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, not at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have a recollection. 
14 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 283 
 
Page 208 of 209 
 
ADV MAPOMA:   No, not top of my head.  But it is possible 
that I might have attended chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   I will not be surprised if some minutes 
surface somewhere to say I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MAPOMA:   It is very, very possible that I could have 
attended such a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Nothing arising? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Thank you very much Mr Mapoma 
for coming to assist the Commission.  We appreciate that 
you came.  Thank you very much.  You are now excused. 
ADV MAPOMA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  I guess we will adjourn for the 
day Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And then tomorrow, we will have Mr Todd’s 
evidence? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Todd’s, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  On the same matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 15 OCTOBER 2020
