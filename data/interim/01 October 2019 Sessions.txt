PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 1 OCTOBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understand you would like me to adjourn for a 
few minutes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Put on your microphone.  Switch it on ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  Chair the reason for the delay is 
that as you noticed yesterday in the testimony difficulties arose from 
the fact that Colonel Naidoo’s affidavit was not deposed to like 
10 
Roelofse – Colonel Roelofse’s was in a redacted form.  It was deposed 
to and only afterwards redacted.  The result has been that the 
relationship with certain of the persons of Crime Intelligence have been 
redacted and in – of in many, many instances the sentences no longer 
make sense.  There were also issues that arose during the course of 
consultations with Colonel Naidoo on Sunday where it appeared that 
certain of the FM numbers were wrong and they needed to be 
corrected.  He has deposed to a supplementary affidavit to deal with all 
of these issues and the Secretariat is in the process of I believe 
preparing a bundle and the amended pages.  They just need a little bit 
20 
more time to get this into our files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  How much time do you need? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Um… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should just say ten o’clock because if we 
say quarter to as we discussed and that might be too little time. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 3 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me give you enough time to get everything in 
order because when we start I really want us to get going.  I want us to 
finish Colonel Naidoo’s evidence today. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes that is very much appreciated Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay then we will take an adjournment and we 
will resume at ten o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us start.  Good morning Colonel Naidoo are 
you there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am here Chair.  Good 
morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.  I said to Ms Wentzel this morning 
earlier it is just that I am not sure whether you were there to hear what 
I said.  I would like us to try and finish your evidence today.  So she 
will do the necessary from her part and we must just try and finish 
today. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will try my best to go as 
fast as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Obviously that is subject to the fact that we 
must not do any injustice to your evidence.  
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 4 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But we – we do not have all the time in the world 
so we have got to make the best of the time that we have and use it 
fruitfully.  We do not want to leave any important fissures of your 
evidence but at the same time we want to move with some speed.  
Okay? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Chair as I indicated earlier 
this morning Colonel Naidoo has deposed to a supplementary affidavit 
10 
which has been marked Exhibit KK1.2 and will follow after his what I 
call main affidavit or his witness statement.  I think it has been handed 
to your Registrar if it could just be admitted as an exhibit and placed in 
your file? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see.  You must please get somebody to look at 
certain pages in the bundle where the number of the page in terms of 
pagination is not legible or clear and have those so that you can have 
those pages replaced with copies that will make it clear what the page 
number is.  I mean some of them it might be that the number of the 
page should be written a little higher up where there is a space.  
20 
Others they just need to complete replacement.  So one struggles to 
see what the number of the page is in regard to some of these.  So 
somebody could work on that while you are busy and then during the 
break that can be fixed.  It seems that you want this new affidavit to be 
– to come after page 140 is that right?  Did you hear me?  You did not? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 5 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I did not because I was being given an 
instruction I am afraid – I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have put it after page 140 I think that is 
where you wanted it to be. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it is where we want it.  Thank you very 
much Chair.  I will make sure that the Secretariat who has been here in 
court attends to the fact that sometimes a signature goes over a 
paginated page and it – and in other instances where it is an annexure 
I had also found it difficult to read what the page number is and we will 
make sure that that is sorted out. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair before I continue with the remainder of 
Colonel Naidoo’s evidence I said that I would do a reconciliation 
overnight to work out the percentage spent on the two credit cards.  
Chair that exercise has been done and in respect of Colonel Naidoo’s 
credit card 99.99% was spent.  In respect of Colonel Barnard’s credit 
card 83.49% was spent.  So the assessment that well over 80% was 
spent was correct and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Chair yesterday we were 
20 
dealing with the family members who were appointed as agents into 
Crime Intelligence – into the agent program at Crime Intelligence and 
before the adjournment we were dealing with the family members of 
Colonel Barnard.  It is at page 19 of the statement paragraph 73.  
Colonel Naidoo… 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 6 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on one second.  The parts of – you 
remember that when you started with Colonel Naidoo’s evidence you 
did not start at the beginning. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You covered what comes much later in his statement 
namely the circumstances under which he was put on the witness 
protection program. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what page to what page does that go?  Where 
do we find that part? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is from page 62 Chair through to – 
essentially to the end Chair except for pages 68 and 69 which were not 
dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Now yesterday we went up to what page 
of his statement? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 19. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that leaves us with about 30 pages to cover. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Plus the annexures. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a reason why we should take longer than an 
hour to finish ten pages with annexures?  What do you think? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I think that that is… 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 7 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us aim for that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And see if – if it goes a little over or under that is fine 
but let us aim for that because – but as long as we finish today. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is important. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We will make every effort to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair certain aspects you will see will go 
quicker than others. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quicker yes yes.  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Before I start Chair if perhaps I can get 
Colonel Naidoo just to confirm that the affidavit that has been placed 
into evidence as Exhibit K1.2 is his affidavit and that he has signed 
that affidavit before a commissioner this morning? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why – you remember we said whatever will be in 
this file will be – will be – will form part of Exhibit KK1.1.  We said we 
are doing away with 1.2. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So therefore that affidavit should not be a separate 
20 
exhibit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  1.1 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should just be part of what is in Exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 1.1. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 8 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do not refer to it as Exhibit K1.2. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just one of the supplementary affidavit or 
documents in this exhibit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo the affidavit that appears at 
page 141 and ends at page 154 with your signature page 153 is that 
your affidavit and your signature? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is I confirm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you confirm… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think both of you… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Spoke very softly please raise your voices. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair that would be to 
page 142 that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The new – new supplementary – the supplementary 
20 
affidavit it is page where your name is – where it says “I the 
undersigned” is page 141 and it goes up to page 153 and there is a 
letter which I think is an annexure page 154.  That is the supplementary 
affidavit that she is talking about. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 9 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is your affidavit? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair my 
signature appears on page 152. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  And Chair amendments have made to 
the affidavit so that it makes grammatical sense and correct certain 
errors.  Colonel Naidoo are you satisfied that the amendments made 
are correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am satisified. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Now Colonel Naidoo we are going 
10 
to proceed dealing with the family members of Colonel Barnard on page 
19 of your affidavit paragraph 73. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you could just indicate to the Chair who 
those family members were? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair Colonel Barnard 
was the Head of the Procurement Section of CI. His family members 
two of his family members were appointed within this promotion process 
of the 250 posts.  One of his relatives was appointed as a Sergeant or 
a Warrant Officer and another of his relatives was appointed as a clerk 
20 
at the Technical Support Unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then with regard to Major Els – Major-
General Els was the National Head of Crime Intelligence Gathering at 
that stage Chair.  Two of his family members were appointed to 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 10 of 170 
 
positions within CI.  One or both of those names I do not know but I 
know that one was appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel without any prior 
appointment in SAPS and another was appointed as a Captain without 
any prior appointment in the SAPS.  And I think as far as I know that 
particular individual left the police or resigned from the police. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then Colonel Naidoo with regard to former 
Lieutenant General Lala? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage General 
Lala was the Divisional Commissioner of CI.  Chair sorry no he was not 
the – he was not the Divisional Commissioner he had subsequently left.  
10 
I think he was going to Detective Services and I think he is now at 
SARS.  A family member FM37 Chair was appointed within this 
promotion process.  A Lieutenant General Stander who was stationed at 
I think at that stage she was Deputy National Commissioner one of her 
relatives was appointed at CI Head Office.  He was appointed and 
placed within the IT section of CI.  Brigadier Driena Bellingham was 
head of the Human Resources at CI.  Her relative was appointed to the 
position from a lower rank to a higher rank of Colonel. This information 
was relayed to me by FM09 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The appointment of 
persons to CI within criminal – with – sorry – pardon me Chair.  The 
appointment of persons to CI with criminal convictions and addition to 
those that were appointed and promoted within this process there were 
numerous individuals that had criminal convictions Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 11 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Brigadier Billingham 
would have been the person that would have dealt with these – with 
these issues with regards to – insofar as regards to the condonations 
regarding these specific individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair then I go to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aha. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you then deal with the appointment of 
FM41 into the agent program. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will.  Chair FM41 was a 
Colonel in CI.  This individual was found guilty Chair of – of vehicle – it 
was a vehicle related fraud – I am not sure exactly the details of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But what I can say that 
FM41 was never disciplined.  Instead he was placed within the agent 
program as an agent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair from what I 
understand he remained within the agent program until he retired.  I 
20 
believe this was done purely to – to hide him so to speak in an agent 
program as a favour.  I will testify to later the relationship between 
FM41 at that stage General or Assistant Commissioner Lala, Assistant 
Commissioner Mphego and General Lazarus.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 12 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo can you deal with that 
relationship? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Naidoo one of the difficulties I understand 
that Ms Wentzel has is or both of you have is that because you cannot 
see each other sometimes you are expecting her to lead and she is 
expecting you to continue and both of you do not know and that is why 
sometimes there is silence.  But let us try our best. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair I also believe 
that is what is happening.  So I will also try my best. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you are never sure whether to continue 
sometimes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you deal with that 
relationship which you deal with in paragraph 81 of your statement? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I refer to two 
incidents.  This was around 2006.  I was – I was – FM41 was my 
commander at that stage.  Like I testified to earlier I was a dedicated 
20 
person to go to Head Office to – to tend to operatives’ administrative 
needs in terms of their claims etcetera. I recall one such incident where 
I was given a claim Chair or rather an advance for R40 000.00 this was 
for a recruitment of an agent.  I got an instruction from FM41. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like R40 000.00 is quite a popular amount 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 13 of 170 
 
Colonel Naidoo in CI. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It seems so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I remember getting 
instruction from FM41 to secure the funds of R40 000.00. The 
instruction that I got was that of the R40 000.00 R20 000,00 I should 
bring back to him and the other R20 000.00 should go to Assistant 
Commissioner Lala at that stage.  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that amount for?  What was the R40 000.00 
for? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was for a recruitment 
of an informer Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was for? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  A recruitment of an 
informer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was recruitment 
fees Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Recruitment – recruitment fees? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Of an informer yes that is 
20 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so when an informer is being recruited there is an 
advance amount that is paid? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Correct Chair but it 
depends on the level of information that particular informer might – 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 14 of 170 
 
might have tentatively. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what the amount would be? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is not a set amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright yes continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But this particular 
instance it was R40 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the R40 000.00 was to be split into two? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was not all going to go to the informer? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was – were the records going to reflect that it 
was going – it was all going to the informer? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R20 000.00 was going to General Lala? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Commissioner Lala Chair 
yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was it going to him for his personal use? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or do you not know? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  What it was for but in 
terms of the – the procedure the R40 000.00 should go to one particular 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 15 of 170 
 
person in this case it would be the informer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the records reflected that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The moment part of it was not going to the informer 
then that meant there was something irregular? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I refer to also remember 
the advance holder at that stage I cannot remember her name but I 
think – I believe she is deceased.  She enquired from me why is this 
10 
happening.  This is – to her this was quite irregular because if you put 
in a claim or an advance for a particular informer that specific amount 
should go to that person.  So why is the amount is being split. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was asking this question? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The advance holder – the 
advance holder at that stage.  Pardon me Chair.  The advance holder at 
the cash office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Explain the job of an advance holder in this setup? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is essentially 
like I explained there were advance – advance officers where you would 
20 
go with your – and I explained using the petrol claim or the advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that the person who processes all requests for 
advance payments? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Does that person also make the decision or 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 16 of 170 
 
whether to approve the request for advance payment or not or does he 
or she simply check that the documentation is right and then sends it to 
somebody else who makes the decision? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the job description 
of the advance holder is purely administrative.  It is purely to – to 
receive claims – advances and capture it on the system.  Because this 
would have already been approved by a particular commander or the 
individual’s commander. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so the decision would have been made and he or 
she is simply there to make sure that there are proper records? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Just to process that particular claim or advance.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so the particular advance holder asked or queried 
this particular claim? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  It 
was an advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would the records not that – would not the 
paperwork that she had simply – would it not have simply reflected that 
the money would go to the informer.  How would she or he have known 
that part of it would not go to the informer? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair because the staff 
officer at – at Commissioner Lala’s office at that stage met me at the 
advance office.  I cannot remember her name it is a white female.  She 
met me at the advance office and I gave her R20 000.00 in the 
presence of the advance holder.  So that is where the query came 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 17 of 170 
 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I – I handed over he 
R20 000.00 to this particular female whose name I cannot remember 
and the other R20 000.00 I took back to my own office and handed it 
over to FM41. Chair this was…– I handed over he R20 000.00 to this 
particular female whose name I cannot remember and the other 
R20 000.00 I took back to my own office and handed it over to FM41. 
Chair this was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was one incident.  
This was regarding Assistant Commissioner Mphego – sorry Lala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The other incident it 
involves Commission Mphego.  At that stage Commissioner Mphego was 
the second in charge to Commissioner Lala at CI.  I recall an incidence 
where – incident where FM41 told me that Commissioner Mphego is – 
he has traded his – one of his vehicles in.  I think it was an Isuzu 
bakkie and there was a shortfall on the trade-in.  I think the amount 
was R125 000.00 and he – he requested FM41 to make arrangements to 
20 
hand the money to him.  That is the second incident Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So General Mphego requested FM41? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give him the money that he would use to pay for 
the shortfall? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 18 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was a shortfall on 
his vehicle that he was trading in Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And – and why was he asking FM41 for that 
money? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was FM41 – FM41 was – was not in charge of the 
account of the Secret Service Account because it was General Lazarus 
who was in charge of that is it not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  This – FM41 
was a commander of one of the operational teams where I will testify to 
10 
later where informer false informer reward were processed via this 
office Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so FM41 was in charge of an office which was – 
which used to process some of the claims? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair not process the 
claims.  They would – they would put in false informer rewards.  In this 
process they would generate cash.  This was done via this office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that.  What would they do to 
generate cash? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  They would put in false 
20 
informer rewards Chair.  In other words false intelligence or bogus 
intelligence reports would be generated to generate funds via that 
process.  This was done via FM41’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He was the commander 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 19 of 170 
 
of this operational team at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so they would put in effectively fake intelligence 
reports? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – on the basis of those reports they or certain 
people would be thought to be entitled to certain payments. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of rewards. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is what General Mphego was asking for? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you.  Continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there was – I 
remember another incidence where FM41 had a meeting at head office 
and he came back and he was quite upset and he did not mention which 
one of – either it was General Lala or General Mphego had asked him 
for more funds.  It was during the month and he said to me they are 
getting R100 000.00 is that not enough?  And he said something to the 
effect “voetsak man” so he was quite upset. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was that now? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM41. 
CHAIRPERSON:  FM41? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and who had asked for more money there?  Was 
it General Mphego again? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 20 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was one of them Chair 
he did not mention their names he just said they are getting… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  One of them asked him 
for more money and he was upset. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But this stage remember 
they were getting paid monthly.  I am not sure in my statement I say 
R50 to R100 000.00.  I am not sure it was R50 000.00 each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Or – or R100 000.00 
each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am – I cannot be 
certain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now I see that in your statements quite a 
number of these matters you deal with are not reflected in terms of 
when they happened.  Do you have no recollection as to when these 
events and incidents took place? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I worked under 
20 
FM41 he is my – he was my commander from 2004 to 2006 so it would 
have been probably between that time period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Yes continue.  Or Ms Wentzel do you 
want to take it from there? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Colonel Naidoo what do you believe is 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 21 of 170 
 
the significance of this relationship between FM41 and General Lala 
and General Mphego? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I mentioned 
earlier FM41 was found guilty on a vehicle related charge.  He was 
never 
disciplined. 
 
I 
remember 
having 
a 
discussion 
with 
General Lazarus and he - and he said that he wants to help the old 
man. 
He had a discussion with - with Commissioner Mphego and 
there was - they decided that they were going to place into the agent 
program 
and 
this 
is 
what 
General Lazarus 
relayed 
to 
me.  
10 
Commissioner Mphego told him that I should be his handler. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed.  You say that he was not 
disciplined? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know enough about the facts to be able to say 
whether this was a matter where he should have been disciplined?  Do 
you know whether the fraud related incident to which you - you talk in 
your statement related to work or was it something that happened 
outside of work? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I do not know the 
20 
facts relating to this incident but I do know that he was convicted of a 
vehicle related crime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If it was something that did not - that was not 
work related.  For example if he - but you - you also do not know what 
actually he is alleged to have done? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 22 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not the actual facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is said to be fraud related? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course if he was convicted of fraud one would 
expect that he would not be allowed to continue in - in the police - in 
the police force. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whether or not he was convicted of fraud is that 
something you know for sure or is that something that you heard from 
somebody saying he was convicted of fraud but you do not know for 
10 
sure?  What is the position? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot say for 
sure what - whether it was work related or not but I - I know for fact 
that he was convicted on a vehicle related charge.  I say this because 
on numerous occasions FM41 gave me money.  There was a fine I think 
that he had to pay at the court. 
I think it was the Pretoria Court and I - I did this on numerous 
occasions.  I think at least on three occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you know that he - he was convicted of a car 
related offence? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and do you know that - do you know whether 
that car related offence was fraud? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if - if I can recall it 
was - at that stage he was a Colonel.  At that stage rather a Senior 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 23 of 170 
 
Superintendent.  They had a package where they had to buy a vehicle 
or the option of buying a vehicle on that level.  This was part of the 
package. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but my question is whether you know whether 
the car related offence - whether you know whether the car related 
offence of which he was convicted was fraud. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot say for sure 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Wentzel I think some of these things should 
have been investigated by … 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the legal team … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Legal team, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the investigators. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I can - I can see this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I appreciate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know if people have been involved in wrongdoing 
by all means people who have got personal knowledge of that must give 
evidence and - and say that is so when they know - they - they know 
20 
the facts you know but this is a forum where you know the public is 
listening. 
The proceedings go on television and radio and people’s 
names are mentioned.  It is important that before names are mentioned 
things be checked … 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 24 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Properly because … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody - we - we should never do anything to 
anybody that we would not like to be done to us.  If people have got 
information, they know the facts.  By all means - but we you know the 
legal team and the investigators must just be careful that before a 
witness takes the stand you know. 
Somebody has checked properly and advised the - the 
witness about certain things you know.  You need to be careful about 
10 
that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I appreciate it Chair.  I think that it is - it is 
absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  During the course of the evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Things that were - were taken as fact have 
been found to be not fact … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that is a very serious difficulty and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I have - have spoken to Colonel Naidoo 
about confirming … 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 25 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Only things that he actually knows about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Not matters that he does not know about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if he knows that that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There is no difficulty with testifying as to that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But if he does not know that to be true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then he should not testify to that. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja. 
 
Okay. 
 
You 
understand 
my 
concern 
Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so where - where we are not sure let us 
stay away from making statements that could unfairly tarnish people’s 
names when we do not have the facts or we are not sure.  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will do so sure.  I will - 
20 
I will stick to the points where I had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Personal 
- 
personal 
interactions and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 26 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I know of it personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and your statement has got quite a lot of 
information where you have personal knowledge.  You already have 
testified over - I mean yesterday and on Friday there are lots of events 
where you have personal knowledge and that is - that is appreciated.  It 
is just that unfortunately there have been other areas where that has 
not been the case. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  I 
will - I will go through as - as we speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will go through the 
incidents where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is not very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Where it is hearsay and I 
will stick to - to the incidents where I had personal knowledge of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Of information or on the 
facts. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No thank you.  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Colonel Naidoo 
could you then deal with the appointment of FM42 and FM44 as 
informants? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair FM42 was - is a 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 27 of 170 
 
relative of General Lazarus.  He was a policeman stationed at Tongaat 
until he was found guilty of corruption and dismissed from the SAPS.  
He was recruited as an informer by CI Chair and paid R50 000,00 a 
month.  This was told to me by FM09. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that - and that - that conviction is something you 
know about? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  Continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM44 was also - also a 
relative of General Lazarus.  Was taken up as an informer.  This was 
10 
not told to me directly Chair but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But the conversation that 
I had with FM34 I - I picked up that this particular person was recruited 
as an informer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo if we can now deal with what 
activities the - I am going to loosely refer to as the Mdluli agents were 
involved in.  You will see in paragraph 87 … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You set out again who these agents were and 
just as a recap if you could just testify as to who they were? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Ms Wentzel are you skipping 
paragraph 86?  That seems important or has it been covered? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 28 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It - it will be covered and Chair I 
appreciate it.  I can see that is important … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I would like him to deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you please deal first 
with what your involvement was with the handling of agents? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as I previously - 
previously testified to that I would have been the appointed agent to 
handle these or rather the handler to - to handle these particular 
10 
agents.  I refer to the - to the incident that happened at 
General Lazarus’ office between himself and General Mdluli. 
I was eventually tasked with handling claims for the - for the 
seven of the so called Mdluli family - seven agents although two I 
cannot confirm that they were - they were family but we included them 
as within the Mdluli family - seven in total. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
I 
was 
tasked 
with 
handling the claims for salaries, their vehicles etcetera.  Also medical 
claims.  If I can just for the record Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Point out that it was FM - 
these are the seven individuals:  FM24, FM29, FM26, FM28, FM27, 
FM25 and FM30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 29 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is it correct that FM25 and FM30 are also 
included who you are not sure if they are actually family members.  Is 
that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can you now deal with what is stated in 
paragraph 88 with regard to FM24, FM29, FM25 and FM30? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
these 
four 
individuals were appointed within the Cyber Crime Unit of Crime 
Intelligence.  At that stage they were supposed to operate or rather 
they reported to Colonel Beaunard Grobler.  He was in charge of the 
10 
Cyber Crime Unit at that stage. 
Chair like I mentioned the - I handed the - the administration 
- the - the admin of these agents.  Operationally I did not know what 
they - what they did in terms of their job description.  All I know is that 
they were appointed within this unit.  So as far as I know operationally 
I did not - I did not know what - what their duties entailed or what they 
actually did but I did keep a - a file for each one of them in terms of 
their administration. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you tell the Chair what happened 
with regard to the internet café? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
these 
four 
individuals - individuals like I mentioned in point 88 they were 
supposed to run a covert internet café.  I was responsible for setting up 
this particular front company so to speak.  Chair if I recall correct - 
correctly the - the amount to set up the - the internet café was about 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 30 of 170 
 
R75 000,00 but I can confirm if the documents are shown to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was their level of computer skills? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I do not think they 
- they had a particular level of - of - their - their knowledge of computer 
skills I think was very basic.  I say this because they - they went for a - 
for a training course regarding computers which was A Plus.  I think it 
was very basic.  This was paid for out of the SSA. 
I think it was R20 000,00 for the four of them Chair.  This 
particular unit where they were based is the Cyber Crime Unit Chair.  I 
10 
believe that they should have some sort of experience or expertise to 
work within this environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they did not have it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I do not believe they did 
Chair because this computer course that they went for was quite basic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you then deal with FM26? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair FM26 was also part 
of this seven agents that I handled - one person - one individual of the 
seven.  He was also appointed within the Cyber Crime Unit under the 
20 
command of Colonel Beaunard Grobler.  Chair like I mentioned with the 
other individuals I only handled the - the admin regarding the agents. 
I did not know what they did operationally.  This particular 
individual on numerous occasions he did not report to work Chair.  I - I 
remember receiving a call from his commander Colonel Grobler 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 31 of 170 
 
inquiring where this particular individual was.  At that stage I did not 
even know where he was myself. 
I brought this to the attention of General Lazarus and I do not 
know if this particular individual was ever disciplined for this. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you deal with his petrol claims? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes I did.  One of my 
duties was to deal with petrol claims.  On numerous occasions when 
compiling his claims I would see that a petrol or petrol slips would have 
been or rather from the petrol slips I - I would see that he travelled to 
Mpumalanga. 
10 
That is another province from where he was based Chair.  
Before he left the province he should have got the prior - prior 
permission to leave which was not done.  This happened on multiple 
occasions Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And as I testified too I 
brought all of these things to the attention of General Lazarus and I am 
not sure what happened to him and he would be away from work for 
extended periods. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Where did his family reside? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I know his family resided 
or his extended family resided in Mpumalanga. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you then deal with FM28 and FM27? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  FM28 and 
FM27 worked from a covert premises in Johannesburg.  Chair this - 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 32 of 170 
 
these two individuals were supposedly report or supposed to report to 
Colonel Barnard under the loss management.  Chair if I can just give 
you some insight. 
The loss management already had a loss - loss or rather 
Company X already had a Loss Management Section at their office.  
This was basically created another - another office - a covert office was 
created to provide - to provide employment for these two individuals.  
So there was actually no need for this office because the - it is actually 
a parallel structure to what was already in place. 
So there was no need for this - so this - for this office Chair.  
10 
So in my view this office was created just to create employment for 
these two individuals - FM28 and FM27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo who was the head of Company 
X? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure but I know 
the - there - there is multiple directors.  I am not sure who they are but 
General Lazarus as the CFO of the Secret Service Account would have 
been one of those directors. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Barnard? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Colonel Barnard was the 
head of - of the Procurement Section where company or rather the 
Procurement Section where Company X was situated.  So I would 
assume that he would also be one of the directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that Company X which was 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 33 of 170 
 
providing a lot of services to Crime Intelligence had … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had as its directors had some of the people at Crime 
Intelligence as its directors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you name in particular General Lazarus and 
Colonel Barnard.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you - you know this for sure? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they were directors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I do not know this 
for sure.  I - I know that general - this was a set up as a normal 
company Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But it was a front 
company.  So it had to operate like a normal company would - would.  
So it was - it was a front company of Crime Intelligence.  So I am 
assuming that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No now I - now I understand. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was - it was in effect a parastatal? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  The - the 
members of Crime Intelligence or some members … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 34 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Especially 
General Lazarus being the CFO of the Secret Service Account … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  They - they … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Would be a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had to be directors? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No.  Then - then I understand.  So it was 
not a private company? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there were no directors involved in it who were 
10 
not part of Crime Intelligence?  Where there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the directors were part of Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Then I understand.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
please now deal with FM28 and FM27? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
on 
numerous 
occasions I had to deal with FM28 and FM27 regarding the payment of 
salaries reconciling their petrol claims or just to - to visit them at the 
20 
office.  On numerous occasions or most of the occasions they would not 
be in the office Chair. 
They would either be at home or they would be at the mall 
shopping.  I know this because when I would phone them they would 
tell me they are at the mall or they are at home.  It was very rarely that 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 35 of 170 
 
I found them at the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And these were - there were some of the seven 
members of the Mdluli family? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Two - two of - two of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These were - ja, these were two of the seven? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were handling? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So you say most of the time when you 
phoned them they would either be at home or they would be at malls? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  As there handler were you not supposed to 
know what work they were doing in terms of their daily activities - work 
activities. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was that the role of their commander if there was 
a commander?  I heard you refer to a commander for some of the 
people earlier. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in a normal - 
normal situation a handler would - would handle the agents in terms of 
the administration and the operational.  So you have an administration 
file and an operational file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 36 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  These are two separate 
files but it would be with the handler.  In this case Chair like I 
mentioned I did not know what they did operationally except that I 
handled their - their petrol claims and their medical and - and the 
payment of their salaries.  So the function was actually split. 
So operationally I did not know what they did except to pay 
their salaries and their - their medical and petrol claims. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ordinarily a handler should know what on a daily 
basis the agents they are handling are doing? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in that way would it be correct to say - would it be 
correct to say in that way a handler can be seen as their supervisor? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you say in this case you handled the 
administrative side of things only and that not the operational side? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not - you do not know who was handling 
the operational side? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like - like I said Chair 
the four individuals as I previously - previously testified to - reported to 
20 
Colonel Beaunard Grobler.  FM28 and FM27 they were placed with the 
Loss Management but or rather Colonel Barnard was head of 
procurement which Loss Management fell under.  So I really do not 
know what they did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 37 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I said this - this was 
a parallel structure that was created basically for - for their 
employment but they did not thing at that office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo you say in paragraph 95 page 
23 of your statement that FM24, FM25, FM29 and FM28 received 
advances on their monthly salary.  Could you just deal with that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  These four 
individuals when they placed within the (indistinct) Program.  They 
were not getting the - the salary that they were appointed on.  So 
10 
basically there was a shortfall on their salary.  So I took advances to 
cover the shortfall and once they got the - the actual salary that they 
were appointed on - the level - those advances would be paid back. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So was this just a temporary measure? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was.  I think it was 
about - for about three or four months until their - their actual 
promotions were - were captured on the system. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now having dealt with the expenditure of the 
Mdluli agents paying salaries, cellphones, hiring premises, setting up a 
front company, vehicles etcetera.  How much do you believe during the 
20 
period that you were their handler was spent on these agents? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
I 
believe 
it 
exceeded R5 million but obviously this is just an estimate.  I can 
confirm if all the documents regarding these several agents are shown 
to me. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 38 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the amount you gave? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Five million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over what period? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was - from 2010 
from the inception of their - of their being employed as agents to 
around 2011.  That is when I went to witness protection Chair.  So from 
March 2010 to around October 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that related to all the people that you have given 
evidence about who were either family members or friends of 
General Mdluli or General Lazarus and Marimuthu and I think one other 
10 
person - Colonel Barnard - or does that relate simply to those agents 
who were family members of General Mdluli and/or his friends? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this would be the 
seven - the seven members as I regard it to - I explained of the Mdluli 
family - seven members Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now from when they were appointed which was 
sometime in 2010 you said.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that towards the end of the year? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would have been the 
20 
first - the first part of the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first part of the year? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Probably in the first 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 39 of 170 
 
quarter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To when you left which was when you went into the 
witness program which was October 2011.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is about a year and a half? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that what Crime Intelligence must have 
spent on them must have been in the region of R5 million? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you include in that amount the salaries paid to 
10 
them and whatever other claims they may have made? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this - this would 
include their salaries, their medical bills, the vehicles that was 
purchased for them, the hiring of safe houses, setting up of safe 
houses ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your recollection of what they were paid in 
terms of their basic salary per month more or - average … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The seven? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot say for sure 
20 
because they were - they were employed on different levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what would be your estimate of what the – what 
Crime Intelligence spent on their gross remuneration per month more or 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 40 of 170 
 
less when they started in 2010, if you take all the seven, do you have 
some idea, I accept that it will not be the exact amount but some 
estimate, do you know whether all seven put together may have been 
earning something in the region of R300 000 per month in terms of what 
Crime Intelligence was paying to them, collectively per month in 2010? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot say for 
sure the exact or more or less the figure, but what I can say is one was 
a Colonel, one a Lieutenant Colonel, a Warrant Officer, one a Captain, 
one was a Sergeant, I cannot say for sure, I will have to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, would you be able to say bearing in mind the 
10 
different levels at which different members of the seven were appointed 
and you have just mentioned some of the levels. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And bearing in mind that some were at much lower 
levels, would you be able to indicate what the minimum must have been 
in terms of the gross remuneration that Crime Intelligence was paying 
to them, for example could it have been a minimum of – when I say 
gross I mean before tax. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could it have been less than R200 000 per month? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I think it would 
have been more than R200 000 per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been more than R200 000 a month? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes, if I am looking at 
the seven individuals and if I am just glancing at their levels, I think it 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 41 of 170 
 
would be more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   So of course if assuming R200 000 would be 
the bare minimum. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then over ten months, I mean over five months that 
would be a million and then over ten months that would be two million, 
if you are looking at about one and a half years, so you could be 
looking – your estimate of five million might not be too far from the 
amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed Chair, you also 
10 
have to add to that five million the vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The procurement of safe 
houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so five million might be conservative. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think it is a fair 
reflection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a fair reflection. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.   Colonel Naidoo in 
paragraph 98 you state that General Sibiya who was then the Head of 
the Hawks was appointed to investigate these 250 posts and 
promotions at Crime Intelligence.  Did you have a discussion with 
General Lazarus about this? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 42 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
yes 
I 
did…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well before that isn’t General – isn’t General Sibiya 
the one who is head of the Hawks now. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes you are correct it is reflected the current 
head. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes it’s correct, I misread 
CHAIRPERSON:    Aren’t we talking about much earlier, when probably 
somebody else would have been head of the Hawks, maybe Dramat, 
10 
maybe somebody else, Colonel Naidoo? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as point 98 this is 
indeed correct Chair, General Sibiya who is current head of the Hawks 
but at that state he was the Deputy National Commissioner, he wasn’t 
the head of the Hawks.  It’s correct in saying he is the current head of 
the Hawks, at that stage I’m given to understand that he was the 
Deputy National Commissioner.  He was tasked with investigating the 
250 posts. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay so when he was appointed to make these 
investigations he was not – he was in another position? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  If I can recall he was the 
Deputy National Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Deputy National Commissioner okay, thank you. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 43 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He subsequently left the 
police chair and then he came – he was reinstated and this is the 
position that he holds at the present moment, he is current head of the 
Hawks, Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes I think it would be important to make reference 
to the position he held at the time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay, yes Colonel Naidoo I think you wanted to 
say something? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair I remember 
10 
having a conversation with General Lazarus where he informed me that 
himself and General Mdluli had a discussion and they were considering 
placing General Sibiya’s wife’s name on the list and I’m talking about, 
when I mention the list, I’m speaking of the 250 posts, the covert posts. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I believe or rather 
the discussion I had with General Lazarus stating that they were 
considering this, I assumed that this was to – either to strong arm 
General Sibiya during the investigation or to use a stronger word, 
maybe to blackmail him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    What were they considering to do and who were 
they? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus, he told 
me that he had a discussion with General Mdluli, they were considering 
Chair, placing General Sibiya’s wife’s name on the list for promotion 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 44 of 170 
 
within the 250 posts. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was General Sibiya’s – General Sibiya’s wife 
employed within of Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not that I’m aware of 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Or were they – you understood the discussion where 
they contemplated recruiting her or simply placing false information 
about 
her 
within 
Crime 
Intelligence, 
as 
you 
understood 
their 
conversation what were they talking about doing? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not false information 
10 
Chair, they were deliberately going to place her name on the list 
without General Sibiya knowing about it, so that they could possibly 
use this against him in strong arming him during the investigation 
regarding the 250 post. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Placing her name on the list meant what? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  For employment Chair 
within the 250 posts for promotion within Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But I understood you to say she was not employed 
within Crime Intelligence, were they contemplating recruiting her, were 
they contemplating just falsely putting her name as if she had been 
20 
appointed to one of those 250 posts? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The latter is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay, I thought you denied that when I raised it 
earlier on. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 45 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair, sorry my 
apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That they were trying to falsely create the impression 
that she was appointed, so that is what you understood the 
conversation to be about? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair, basically what 
happened was, they were going to place her name within the list 
without General Sibiya’s knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But it – I would have thought that it would be easy 
for General Sibiya to know that, that was just false information because 
10 
he would know if his wife was appointed or was employed by Crime 
Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I can confirm that I 
had the conversation with General Lazarus – that he had with General 
Mdluli regarding the placement of General Sibiya’s wife’s name on the 
list, whether this actually transpired Chair, I can’t be sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, just seems a weak kind of excuse to try and 
blackmail him, yes okay continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo you’ve 
said that the submission of false informer rewards was a mechanism 
20 
used to generate large amounts of cash within Crime Intelligence. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And if you could explain this in a little bit 
more detail now to the Chair and also provide the example you 
indicated earlier, you would deal with as to what happened in Colonel 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 46 of 170 
 
FM41’s office relating to this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I won’t go into the 
detail of the contact person, the informer, I think I set that out 
previously but I’ll go to an incident, Chair where I was personally 
involved, like you mentioned earlier I should stay away from the 
incidents where I’m going to make assumptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is where I was 
personally involved.  I accompanied FM41 for a meeting with the so-
called informer, in my presence Chair, I think this meeting was held at 
10 
a restaurant in Pretoria where he got this particular individual to sign 
receipts, blank receipts, six receipts Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
in 
this 
manner…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry Colonel Naidoo and Miss Wentzel are we 
now under H at page 24? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, I’m sorry. Can I just go back to paragraph 96 
– 98 rather, you mentioned there, Colonel Naidoo that General Sibiya 
20 
was appointed to investigate various – to appoint these 250 
appointments and promotions around the time that the promotions and 
appointments were made but you don’t take it further to tell me, what 
was the outcome of that process? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I don’t know what 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 47 of 170 
 
was the outcome of that process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did it happen just before you went onto the witness 
protection programme? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the appointments 
took place around 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, by the time you went into the witness protection 
programme you didn’t know – there was no outcome as far as you 
knew? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if there was an outcome were you likely to be one 
10 
of the people who would have known? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I think that would 
have been information restricted to – sat with General Mdluli I think he 
– because he was the Divisional of CI at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So the report would 
probably have gone back to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but if there was an outcome already by the time 
you were put on the witness protection programme that outcome had 
not at that stage been implemented in any way if it’s implementation 
20 
would have meant the cancellation of appointments and promotions that 
had happened, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So by the time you went into the witness protection 
programme, the people who had been appointed and promoted to those 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 48 of 170 
 
positions were still continuing? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, yes then I’m sorry I interrupted you, you 
had been asked a question that falls under H and you can continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes Chair it’s quarter past eleven I don’t 
know if you want to take the tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe we can take the adjournment. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    We will start that subject afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you can start with that question when we come 
back.  We’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at half past eleven, 
10 
we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All Rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry we are starting 7 minutes late.  You know there 
is urgent commission matters that need to be attended sometimes 
cause us some delays.  Yes let us continue.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo before the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Before the tea adjournment you were dealing 
with what is set out by you on – in paragraph 107 page 25 of your 
statement and you make the assertion that:  
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 49 of 170 
 
“I do not think that the informers under whose names 
the claims were submitted were even aware that the 
claims were being made.”   
Can you explain why you say that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Wentzel there was a question that you had 
asked that Colonel Naidoo was in the middle of answering when I 
interrupted him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think he had given his full answer. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had he? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He had not given his full answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this the same question? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  I thought it was more – I thought it 
related to somewhere around paragraphs 100 101 but you probably 
know better which paragraphs it related to. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo if I am wrong you can – if you 
20 
could – you welcome to clarify. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Would you like to proceed with what you were 
saying? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 50 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair I was on the 
point of the informer rewards.  I believe the system was abused Chair.  
I say so because on one occasion I was in the company of FM41 where 
we attended a meeting with a so called – when I say so called I will get 
to that – informer.  This particular individual FM41 got him to sign six 
receipts.  Chair in essence these six receipts are six blank cheques in 
terms of the system for Crime Intelligence.  Because basically in this 
way operational expenses and informer rewards can be put in for that 
particular – or so called informer for a period of three months.  And any 
amount that would be at the discretion of the commander being in this 
10 
case being FM41.  He could put in any amount on those – on those 
receipts being already being signed – six at one go by the informer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say receipts you mean a document that 
would on the face of it reflect that the informer has received a certain 
amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  If I 
may just ex… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to claims – signing claims? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  If I 
may just explain?  When an informer is handed cash by his – by a 
20 
handler Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He needs to acknowledge 
receipt of that cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 51 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So he needs to write in 
the amount in words, the actual amount be it R10.00 or R20.00 and 
sign for it in the presence of a handler. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In this case six receipts 
were signed at one go without any amount being written on the 
receipts.  So in essence like I said this was six blank cheques in terms 
of the process for Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the informer would also know that he was – 
he was representing that he had received money that was yet to be 
10 
filled in? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry Chair I did not get 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The informer would also have known that he was 
representing that he had received something that was yet to be filled in 
on the paper in terms of the amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair but in a  
normal circumstance Chair if an informer gets operational expense it 
would be one receipt stating that he had received that particular 
amount on that particular day for operational expenses. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And if it was informer 
rewards it would be another receipt stating that – acknowledging that 
he had received X amount.  Like I said in this case six receipts were 
signed at one go. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 52 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not reflecting any amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was blank Chair just 
his signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was it just the informer’s signature without any 
writing to the effect that something like “I acknowledge that I have 
received – amount from so and so”.  It was not anything like that – they 
just signed, put their signatures on a blank paper that did not say what 
it was – what the signature was for? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The latter is correct 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay but you – you understood that signing those 
blank documents was meant to be an acknowledgment by the informer 
of receipt of money that was yet to be determined or to be put on the 
paper? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo do you recall when and where 
this incident took place? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was in Pretoria.  
I think it was the – we met outside the Blue Crane Restaurant in 
20 
Pretoria Chair.  It was myself, FM41 and the actual – well I say actual it 
was the person who – the so called informer who signed the six blank 
receipts. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why do you use the term so called 
informer? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 53 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I believe I am 
saying this is not fact I believe how the system was abused insofar as 
the informer rewards go.  The instance where six receipts were signed 
at one go that is not proper procedure.  It should be one at a time for a 
specific amount.  In this – In this manner false intelligence reports can 
be generated against this informer’s name and informer rewards – false 
informer rewards generated via this process.  I also want to mention 
Chair FM – just to give you some insight as to how the process 
unfolded or took place.  FM45 who at that stage was second in charge 
to FM41.  He told me that FM41 had a – had a contract at Organised 
10 
Crime Chair in Pretoria.  They devised a scheme where they would use 
organised crime – the SAPS case numbers and the exhibit numbers of 
organised crime and use it against intelligence that – or false 
intelligence that was generated in this manner.  False informer rewards 
could be gene – or false informer rewards or money from false informer 
rewards could be generated in this manner Chair.  As I explained of the 
six blank receipts this would be used in this process as well.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but in the case of the six receipts that you have 
told me about was the informer as far as you knew a legitimate informer 
or was the informer not a legitimate informer?  I am going back to the 
20 
question as to why you were saying so called informer. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair he could – he 
could – he could be legitimate informer or not.  I cannot say that for 
sure.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 54 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But the process that 
transpired was – was not legitimate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo if you can just 
explain to you – explain a little bit more detail what you indicated a few 
minutes ago and – and if we can just go back so you can explain it so 
that we can properly understand.  Which office did Colonel FM41 work 
in? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was – it was an 
operational team based within the environment of Crime Intelligence.  
10 
Crime Intelligence Gathering more especially dealing or addressing 
drug and vehicle related syndicates.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what position did FM45 hold in that team? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM45 was the second in 
charge to FM41. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And now explain you said he informed you 
that Colonel 41 had a contact in Organised Crime and he devised the 
scheme using SAPS case numbers? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you just explain that in a little bit more 
20 
detail and in particular with regard to how the system for informer 
rewards worked? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in essence what 
this means is that they would – the contact I do not know who this 
contact is but the contact was at Organised Crime.  They would use 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 55 of 170 
 
Organised Crime CAS numbers and Exhibit numbers basically use that 
on the Intelligence Reports to generate informer rewards.  I also 
referred to a – to a conversation that I had with one of the members at 
that stage.  It was a Warrant Officer Phil Vermeulen.  He told me there 
was – there was a – there was a success on metal and platinum but the 
value was – was – it was only R500.00 Chair.  However the actual or 
the false success for this – for this particular recovery of the platinum 
was actually in the – in the vicinity of R5 million. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So are you saying that instead of being paid – 
was a success reward paid as a percentage? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would have been paid 
as a percentage but basically what it means the value was actually 
R500.00 but the informer reward was put in as a – as the success being 
R5 million as opposed to R500.00.  So there is a big gap in terms of 
what the informer would get.  In terms of the financial – the 
remuneration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that what the informer was 
supposed to get was R500 000.00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair the actual 
success was R500.00 where the metal was – precious metal or so 
20 
called precious metal was recovered but the actual value was R500.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R500.00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And… 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 56 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So R500.00 being the value of the metal? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that this was inflated – the value? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The success for the 
recovery of this metal was reflected as R5 million and the informer 
reward would have generated – been generated on a success of R5 
million and not R500.00.  This is what was told to me by this particular 
individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was it represented that the value of the metal that 
was recovered was R5 million? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And based on that the reward – the informer reward – 
the informer reward was then calculated on the basis that the value of 
the metal was R5 – that had been recovered was R5 million. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the amount of the informer reward that 
was decided upon? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was not told to me 
Chair I am not aware of the actual informer reward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now this incident you talking about did that 
occur in Colonel FM41’s office? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct.  This – 
this particular individual who relayed this information to me was one of 
the members from that office at that time. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 57 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay now if we go back to the system with the 
scheme using the SAPS case numbers.  Are you saying that as a result 
of a criminal prosecution under these case numbers there would have 
been a successful recovery which could be then used for informer 
rewards.  If you can just explain how it works in a little bit more detail 
please? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is exactly how you 
explained it Ms Wentzel.  These case numbers used from case numbers 
and the SAP numbers would be used on Crime Intelligence Progress 
Reports of Success Reports and as a result informer rewards will be – 
10 
can be generated through this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would they – would – would they go to for example 
Pretoria Magistrates Court I am just making an example and establish 
the case numbers relating to certain criminal cases and choose which 
criminal cases they would use and take the case numbers and then use 
information that can be established that anyone who wants to 
investigate would find in the docket and then attribute a role to an 
informer in regard to that investigation for that case in circumstances 
where the informer had not played any role in that case or would the 
case be that the informer would have played some role but his or her 
20 
role would be exaggerated in terms of the value of what was 
recovered? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am – I do not 
think the informer would have had any role in this.  Like I explained 
earlier the informer – one informer signed six blank receipts. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 58 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I do not think the 
informer would have had any knowledge of what the actual – actual 
success was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But – so is the position therefore that they 
would go to a particular court, get information relating to existing cases 
or finalised cases and if they think that those cases have got 
information or fissures that they can use for – to get informer rewards 
then they would represent in one form or another that there had been 
an informer who had played a role when in fact there no informer had 
10 
played a role or that informer had not played any role. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they would then use that to – to get informer 
rewards? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the rewards would not go to the informer but 
would go to them ultimately? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo is it correct that the report 
20 
pursuant to which informer rewards were claimed would be filled out by 
the informers’ handler not the informer himself? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would have to be filled 
out by – are you talking about – sorry Ms Wentzel you talking about the 
receipt that… 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 59 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No not the receipts. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The claims. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The claims – so what you said is that a SAPS 
case number would be used.  It would reflect that there had been a 
successful outcome. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then a report is submitted alleging that 
they – the informer is worked on a successful investigation and 
10 
therefore is claiming informer rewards. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Who would fill that report out? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would be the handler. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you also indicate in your statement that 
Crime Intelligence would retain a personnel file on each informer and 
progress reports were maintained monthly in order to track the 
productivity of the informer. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was that to determine if that informer was 
20 
entitled to informer rewards. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct.  That file 
would in essence track the productivity of that particular informer for 
that month but I believe that false intelligence reports were generated 
to facilitate this. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 60 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And as you understood the scheme where a 
report was submitted by a handler alleging that they had worked on a 
successful – the informer had worked on a successful investigation.  As 
you understood the scheme would the informer ever had worked on this 
investigation under this case number? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Explaining how the 
system worked and how the funds were generated I do not think that 
particular person had worked on any of the – of the so called report 
regarding the success. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Colonel Naidoo 
10 
you say in your statement that there was an equal abuse of the systems 
in place at Crime Intelligence relating to the procurement and 
utilisation of safe houses. This is page 26 of your statement. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  From paragraph 109.  Could you please give 
the Chair some background as the basis upon which you say this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I think we will stay 
away from these aspects because it is also operational matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But I have knowledge of 
20 
safe houses that were abused.  If I can go to those ones? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Because that is where I 
have personal knowledge of… 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 61 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Of the safe houses so we 
will skip 109 to 112.3 and go to 113. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now this is… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Is that okay Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Okay.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo this is safe house at Gordons 
Bay rented from General Mdluli.  Could you just detail what you know 
about that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like Ms Wentzel 
said this – this particular flat or apartment belonged to General Mdluli 
in the Western Cape. I was informed by General Lazarus that General 
Mdluli wants to – wants us – when I say us CI to rent his flat as a safe 
house.  I was instructed by General Lazarus to fly to Cape Town.  Chair 
I must also add Mr John Appalsamy of Daez Trading also a friend of 
20 
General Lazarus.  I was instructed that this particular individual should 
accompany me to Cape Town.  This was purely to – so that he can have 
knowledge of where the premises is because the – this particular flat 
would have to be rented or leased rather through his company Daez 
Trading.  Chair Mr Appalsamy flew with me to Cape Town.  Like I said 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 62 of 170 
 
this was an instruction of General Lazarus.  I also got instruction from 
General Lazarus that I should draw an advance for the ticket for Mr 
Appalsamy so basically his ticket was paid out of the Secret Service 
Account.  These were all instructions that I got from General Lazarus.  
Chair when I tried to reconcile this particular advance General Lazarus 
instructed me to erase the name of Mr Appalsamy which I did. This was 
purely not to expose who the real person was that travelled via the 
Secret Service Account which was actually Mr John Appalsamy of Daez 
Trading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair when we arrived at 
Cape Town. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you can just – Colonel Naidoo just to clarify 
erase his name from where? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  From the ticket that I had 
purchased for him that – on the ticket that we – I purchased for him to 
travel to Cape Town with me. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And how did you do this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I just used a black 
market – khoki pen.  I cannot remember.  But it was blacked out. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Blacking it out on the ticket. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The ticket would be required when he was travelling 
is it not? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 63 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair this – maybe I 
must just explain.  Sorry I was not too clear.  This was on our return 
from Cape Town I requested the ticket from Mr Appalsamy because I 
had to reconcile my advance that I had taken initially to pay for his 
ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But where was the blacking out or erasing of his 
name done?  On some register?  On – where was this done? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in order for – if I 
can just give some insight Chair if I may?  In order to reconcile this – 
this particular advance I had to put in a receipt or in this case being 
10 
the air ticket because the price would have been on the air ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So in order to – to – for 
that particular claim to be reconciled I requested the air ticket from Mr 
Appalsamy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And on instruction of 
General Lazarus the name – his actual name on the ticket was blacked 
out so it was not visible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So as to not to expose 
who the real person travelled on that particular ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this was after you had returned and you…. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the ticket was going to be kept as – as part of 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 64 of 170 
 
the record? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was done purely to 
hide the identity of Mr Appalsamy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now he was outside of Crime Intelligence was he? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  He 
was a friend of General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there would have been no reason for Crime 
Intelligence to pay for his travelling? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if he was going to – I think you said 
something about him and the – and General Mdluli’s flat in Gordons 
Bay that he was going to lease it or what? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He was Chair.  He had 
numerous other – basically Mr Appalsamy’s company Daez Trading was 
a broker which Crime Intelligence leased numerous safe houses 
through his company Daez Trading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So – so his company was used by Crime 
Intelligence for purposes of Crime Intelligence leasing various 
20 
properties as safe houses? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  In 
this instance instead of the safe house being leased directly from the 
actual owner Mr Appalsamy was sort of a broker.  So he would – so the 
lease would say that it is Daez Trading as if Daez Trading is the owner 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 65 of 170 
 
of that particular property but in fact it was not.  So he is basically a 
middle man. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you please have a look 
at the document that appears on page 104.   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes I am there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now is this the lease agreement in respect of 
Mr – General Mdluli’s Gordons Bay property that you are referring to 
now? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if you have a look at page 109 is that 
your signature as a witness on this lease? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have a look at the first page 104 
this is a lease agreement between Daez Trading CC as the lessor. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then Telford Welveller and it looks like 
Rolebise. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Rolebile. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Rolebile. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you please tell the Chair who that was? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair Colonel Rolebile 
was the Head of Facility Management of Crime Intelligence.  So 
basically Colonel Rolebile was signing this lease although in his 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 66 of 170 
 
personal capacity but it was on behalf of Crime Intelligence.  So 
basically this lease was between Daez Trading and Mr Rolebile but an 
extension to Crime Intelligence.  Because he acted on as in that 
capacity as Head of Facility Management of Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is it correct that Mr Mdluli was the 
registered owner of that property?  It was not Daez Trading. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No.  Daez Trading did 
not own that property. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now do you have an idea what the period of 
10 
the lease was and for what amount?  It appears in the lease itself. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The lease says three 
months starting on 31 January - oh sorry.  Did I say three months? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon me.  It is three 
years. 
 
Starting 
on 
1 February 2010 
and 
terminating 
on 
31 January 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the rent - the amount for rent? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The rent would be 8 500 
plus VAT with a 10 percent annual increase Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it a two bedroom flat - three bedroom flat?  
What was it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was in a security 
estate or complex.  Two bedroom apartment Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 67 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
With 
an 
open 
plan 
kitchen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And living area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now you have said that the lease was signed 
on behalf of Crime Intelligence.  Who was paid the rent for this 
property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I can just explain 
how this worked.  Daez Trading would invoice Company X for the 
10 
amount of 8 500.  I - I am not sure if the amenities were included in 
that - in his invoice.  It probably would but in essence what happened 
at the end of each month I would get a call from Mr Appalsamy. 
He would give me cash.  This was generated from - from the - 
the rent of this particular safe house and I would then hand over that 
cash of R7 000,00 to General Mdluli.  This was on a monthly basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if the rent was 8 500 and you got 7 000 
what was - what happened to the difference? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was - I am 
20 
assuming that was what Mr Appalsamy of Daez Trading invoiced 
Company X as a commission for his brokerage or broker fee.  This was 
- this would also include VAT if I am not mistaken.  So he would take - 
take out that portion that he would receive from Company X and give 
me the balance of R7 000,00 which I would then hand over to - to 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 68 of 170 
 
General Mdluli. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  So ultimately the bulk of the 
rental was received by General Mdluli? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct.  An 
amount of 7 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you personally handled these transactions? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Mr Appalsamy would meet me on a monthly basis.  If - if his bank 
records or subpoenaed Chair you will see the pattern of every month 
plus/minus five days to the month end an amount of R13 000,00 would 
10 
be - in cash would be drawn from his account. 
I will testify to - when I say 13 000 one would ask the 
question why is it only seven here.  There was another - another flat in 
Cape Town that belonged to General Lala.  He would receive 
R6 000,00.  So the amount of 13 000 every month that I would receive 
from Mr Appalsamy of Daez Trading. 
The 7 000 would go to General Mdluli and 6 000 to 
General Lala.  This was on a monthly basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think for a period of a 
20 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The year would have been from 2010 at some - at 
some stage to 2011.  Are you able to indicate with more certainty?  Now 
we know the lease is here and therefore it should indicate when it was 
signed and that should help you to say it was from what month to what 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 69 of 170 
 
month. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
it 
was 
1 February 2010 to 31 January 2013 but this - this did not go on for the 
full period Chair.  I think it was only for the period of probably around - 
probably about a year because in 20 - in 2011 around about March - 
February/March if I can recall correctly General Mdluli was arrested at 
that stage - 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that …? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So this lease ceased.  It 
did not go on Chair.  Although in paper it says three years but it was 
10 
only for a period about a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright and that arrest of General Mdluli 
was it among other things connected with this issue or not really? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was not related 
to this issue at all.  If I can recall - recollect or recall correctly it was 
some other matters regarding a murder and kidnapping.  If I can recall 
correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So it was not connected 
to this at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo did you purchase furniture for 
the safe houses rented from General Lala and General Mdluli? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes I did.  Ms Wentzel if 
I can just explain before I get to that Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 70 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
What 
was 
Mr Appalsamy’s reason to fly with me and this is what I believe.  Chair 
if - if there was an inspection to be done on these premises that was 
going to be rented out by CI I could have done that myself Chair.  At 
this stage if I remember correctly I was working at the Facility 
Management under Colonel (indistinct). 
So there was no need for Mr Appalsamy to accompany me on 
the version that if there was an inspection to be done to see if this is 
feasible for Crime Intelligence to indeed rent this particular property.  I 
10 
believe that Mr Appalsamy flew with me so that he has at least 
knowledge of where this particular property is so if there was any query 
because remember he signed as - as owning this property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So if there was a query 
at least he had some knowledge of where it was.  This is what I believe 
Chair.  This is why Mr Appalsamy accompanied me on this trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo do you remember where you 
were when you witnessed the signing of this lease in respect of 
20 
General Mdluli’s property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Just one second.  I am 
not sure Ms Wentzel.  Those details are not on - on the lease 
agreement and I cannot recall where I was at that stage. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I will tell you why I am - no there appears 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 71 of 170 
 
to be a confusion.  I - I will deal with this over the lunch adjournment.  I 
think that there has been a - an incorrect lease added after the end of 
that which is confusing.  Could you now deal with the furniture that was 
purchased for these properties? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Upon its 
arrival in Cape Town and inspecting the property basic … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the - Ms Wentzel the question should have been 
whether he knows who bought furniture for these houses. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I - I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it should not … 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lead. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo was furniture purchased for 
this properties and if so who purchased this furniture? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I personally ordered 
the furniture on instructions of General Lazarus for the premises of 
20 
both General Lala and General Mdluli.  It was a service provider or 
supplier to Crime Intelligence.  Masons Furniture in Benoni.  I think 
they are situated in Benoni Chair. 
I - I cannot recall exactly what was purchased - what assets 
were purchased but in terms of General Mdluli’s flat it was a two 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 72 of 170 
 
bedroom flat.  So I would take it that would be two beds.  The - for the 
living areas TVs, lounge set and your small appliances for the kitchen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And do you know how much Crime Intelligence 
spent on these two properties in respect of furniture? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it would probably 
be in the region of 50 to R60 000,00 but if the - these - these expenses 
would be posted against this particular SR Number if the documents are 
showed - shown to me I can confirm that it is indeed for that premises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  the 50 or R60 000,00 would that be in regard to each 
10 
of the two properties or would it be for both? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I cannot recall 
exactly but I - I think it would be for both.  For - for General Mdluli’s 
premises and General Lala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you now deal with the 
lease of residential property situated at Clearwater Estate in Boksburg. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  This was also 
a property leased by Crime Intelligence via Daez Trading through 
Mr John Appalsamy’s company.  This was for the sole use of 
20 
General Mdluli although myself and General Lazarus had had access to 
this particular property. 
It was situated within a security estate.  When I say had 
access to it.  I never used it myself and I am not aware of 
General Lazarus using it but when I say we had access is when from 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 73 of 170 
 
time to time I picked up General Lazarus to go to this particular 
premises for General Lazarus to have meetings with General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this property also supposed to be a safe house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - are you saying that it was not used as a 
safe house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was - it was used 
only by General Mdluli as far as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he was the only one using it - it could not be a 
safe house or it could be a safe house still? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I do not know 
what - what - how General Mdluli made use of this premises or who 
went to this premises if he had meetings there etcetera.  I am not 
aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So on the records of Crime Intelligence it was 
reflected as a safe house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what you do know is that only General Mdluli 
used it out of the Crime Intelligence personnel? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do not know how he used it.  Whether he 
used it for any legitimate Crime Intelligence work or not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I cannot say for sure 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would - would somebody at his level as far as 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 74 of 170 
 
you know be involved in using a safe house for any legitimate Crime 
Intelligence work? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it is possible.  I am 
not sure.  I do not know.  I am not very clear with regards to the policy 
but it is possible yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo could you please have a look 
at the document on page 111 and then more particular at page 114. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Let me just say but this house it 
was not the property of General Mdluli that was used by Crime 
10 
Intelligence as a safe house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  The - the one 
that I referred to or testified to previously that - that property belonged 
to General Mdluli.  That was in Gordon’s Bay in the Western Cape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This one we are referring 
to is in Clearwater Estate in Gauteng Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo if you have regard to the 
lease agreement appearing at page 111 … 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then if you have regard to page 114 is it 
correct that you also witnesses this lease agreement? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And dated 10 November 2009? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 75 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now it is also a lease conclude with Daez 
Trading and it you look at page 112 it is for a period of one year from 
1 December 2009 to 30 November 2010 for 17 500 per month plus VAT. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now who was responsible for the furnishing of 
this safe house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I remember 
10 
correctly I also was responsible for - this was quite a - a big house.  It 
was in an upmarket security estate.  I also ordered furniture and 
general appliances for this particular premises.  Also again from 
Masons Furniture - supplier to Crime Intelligence.  A big screen TV 
surround system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are we now on page 30? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that General Lala’s flat? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one are we talking about now? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We are now dealing with page 29 paragraph 
127. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that still relates to that property at Clearwater 
Estate? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 76 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So we are dealing with paragraph 127 at the 
bottom of page 29 to the top of page 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo can you just detail what 
furniture you recall purchasing for this house … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the value? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Yes 
Chair. 
 
As 
I 
mentioned I - I - the home was furnished as a residence Chair.  As any 
10 
normal residence would be.  I was responsible for - for purchasing or 
acquiring this - the furniture.  This was done through Masons Chair.  
Our service provider that Crime Intelligence used. 
They were situated in Benoni.  As far as I know a TV, a 
surround sound DSTV, fridge, washing machine and Chair general small 
appliances crockery.  Chair it - it was furnished as a - as a normal 
house would be furnished.  Basically from scratch.  Everything was 
purchased for - for this particular house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you have any idea how much was spent? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  An estimate again about 
R100 000,00 but like I said previously if the documents are shown to 
me I can confirm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Naidoo who was responsible for 
the upkeep and maintenance of this house? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 77 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I was responsible 
Chair for - for the upkeep of this particular house.  I was also required 
to ensure that when General Mdluli was there that the house was 
stocked with groceries.  Also paid out - as I previously testified - also 
paid out from funds - from funds from the Secret Service Account. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you recall who you would see at the house 
- residing at the house during the time that you conducted this 
maintenance and dropped off groceries? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at some stage I - I 
am just going to check the FM numbers.  I remember this clearly Chair.  
10 
This was an incident where I had drop General Mdluli off at - I - I 
picked him up from - from his office.  That is the Crime Intelligence 
Office in Pretoria and I dropped him off at this particular safe house 
being Clearwater Estate. 
When I got there Chair I noticed two individuals whom I 
mention as FM24 and FM29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I also recall seeing two 
children at this premises Chair.  This was family of General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Another instance Chair 
this particular individual had come for a training course to Pretoria and 
I had to - it was - I think it was over two days.  I had to fetch her from 
this premises and take her for her course and drop her off in the 
afternoon at the same premises.  Those were the two incidents I was 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 78 of 170 
 
personally involved with or have recollection of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Could you now 
deal with General Lala’s flat in Rondebosch Cape Town? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Chair I 
mentioned earlier that I flew to Cape Town to inspect the property of 
General Mdluli.  On this same trip Chair also an instruction from 
General Lazarus I went to General Lala’s flat situated in Rondebosch 
Cape Town. 
This particular premises was also rented as a safe house 
10 
through Crime Intelligence also through Daez Trading.  Chair as I 
mentioned earlier the same scenario.  It was through Daez Trading.  
The same procedure.  I would get - at the end of each month I would 
collect the rent from Mr Appalsamy and hand over the cash to - to 
General Lala.  This was R6 000,00 per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you know whether there was a - a policy 
applicable at Crime Intelligence saying whether or not people employed 
within Crime Intelligence could provide safe houses to Crime 
Intelligence - could have a lease with Crime Intelligence - could have 
leases with Crime Intelligence? 
20 
Do you - do you know whether there was any policy or any 
prescript that was applicable which prohibited this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I am not too 
sure regarding the policy with regard to these premises.  So I cannot 
say Chair.  I am not too sure. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 79 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  What the policy exactly 
was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but are you able to say whether or not the 
manner in which these leases were handled were a safe house 
belonged to somebody within Crime Intelligence.  Are you able to say 
that the manner in which they were handled was not transpired even 
within the context of Crime Intelligence where a lot is not supposed to 
be transparent? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair because the 
10 
actual owners of the properties were not revealed.  It was done through 
Daez Trading.  So this in itself was not transparent because it did not 
reveal who the real owners were Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair in terms of the 
transparency it was not Chair because it was actually the - the owners - 
the real owners of the actual properties were concealed.  As I 
previously testified to Mr John Appalsamy his company Daez Trading 
signed as the owners of or - or rather being the owner of these 
properties. 
20 
So it was in - in essence not transparent because he did not 
reveal who the real owners were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now were there other safe houses which Crime 
Intelligence leased which were dealt with differently from the way that 
leases of safe house owned by personnel from within Crime Intelligence 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 80 of 170 
 
were dealt with? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure Chair.  I 
am not certain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me put the question differently.  Was the 
role played by Daez Trading confined as which as you say purported to 
be the owner of the premises.  Was it limited to those safe houses 
which 
belonged 
to 
General Lala 
and 
General Mdluli 
and 
General Lazarus and you must just tell me if I am putting somebody’s 
name into this that was not involved? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as far as recall - I 
10 
can recall it is not - it is not just to these premises Chair.  There was 
another premises that was - that was leased in this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you - you said that the role played by Daez 
Trading ensure that the true owners of the safe houses of 
General Mdluli and General Lala and General Lazarus was concealed.  
Their - their identity - their identities were concealed … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By virtue of the fact that Daez Trading was reflected 
as the owner or lessor in regard to these lease houses. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That suggested to me that you were saying that there 
would be other houses of safe houses where the true owner would be 
known. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something you know as a matter of fact? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 81 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I would assume so 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you cannot know it as a matter of fact if you 
assume. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something you know as a - as a matter of fact 
that there were other safe houses which were leased by Crime 
Intelligence where the owner of the safe house would be known.  The 
identity of the owner of the safe house would be known because there 
would be - because Daez Trading would not be - have any role or there 
10 
would be no other company playing a similar role in that lease. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon me Chair.  I am 
not.  I do not understand the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Maybe … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry.  I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I am confusing you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja.  I am - I am a bit 
confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me try and - and put this more clearly.  What - are 
you suggesting that there was something wrong with General Mdluli and 
General Lala and General Lazarus having their houses leased to Crime 
Intelligence use - using Daez Trading? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
it 
was 
not 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 82 of 170 
 
General Lazarus’ house Chair.  It was just General Mdluli and 
General Lala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am - I am grateful for that because I was not 
sure and I did not say earlier do please do tell me if I am putting 
somebody’s name into something where he might not have been 
involved. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you suggesting that there was anything wrong 
with the leasing of their properties in the manner in which it was done 
to Crime Intelligence as safe houses? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I mentioned 
earlier I am not sure what the policy is but in terms of the transparency 
yes.  I said there is something wrong because the true owners of this 
property were not - were not revealed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But obviously in terms of 
the policy I do not what the policy says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you see and of course you know this much 
better than I do, we are dealing with Crime Intelligence where one 
understands if there isn’t much transparency about many things, you 
20 
understand that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now why is it not possible that the involvement of 
Daez Trading might be legitimate insofar as it would ensure that maybe 
anybody from outside Crime Intelligence who looks at the, who 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 83 of 170 
 
becomes aware of the lease should not know that this was a safe house 
or something like that?  Or let me put it differently do you know of any 
safe house that was leased by Crime Intelligence without the 
involvement of any company or Daez Trading? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether – do you know whether the 
position is not that all safe houses that were leased by Crime 
Intelligence involved Daez Trading? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair it was limited, 
Daez Trading the leases done through Daez Trading were limited to a 
10 
few safe houses including the two that I mentioned now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Or rather the three, 
sorry, it was the three, the one of General Mdluli, one of the General 
Lalla and the one I just spoke of now is Clearwater Estate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but did you know any safe houses at all that 
were leased by Crime Intelligence other than these ones?  I will ask the 
question again, do you know of any safe houses that were leased by 
Crime Intelligence other than the ones you have just mentioned that 
were owned by General Mdluli, General Lalla and the one at Clear – is 
20 
it Clearwater? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as in general, 
you’re speaking as in general or particularly through Daez Trading? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let’s start with even if they involve Daez Trading 
are there any other safe houses that you knew or you know that other 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 84 of 170 
 
than these ones that you have mentioned? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair there were 
many, there were many premises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were many others? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they all involve Daez Trading? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were some which did not involve Daez Trading? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not some, most this was 
– Daez Trading was involved in a very small percentage of the bigger 
10 
picture, it was probably four or five premises in total. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, are you able to give me a rough estimate of the 
total number of safe houses that you might have been aware of at the 
time you joined the witness protection programme, just roughly are we 
talking about 20 are we talking about 15 more or less? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair that’s a tough 
question but I’ll try. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It doesn’t have to be exact I just want to have an 
idea. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would say, Chair, 
20 
looking at nine provinces, when I say nine provinces, head office is 
also regarded as a province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would say at least 
between seven and eight because each operational team would have to 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 85 of 170 
 
operate out of a safe house.  I would say at least ten per province 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ten per province. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would say a very rough 
estimate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that takes us to something in the region of 100 
safe houses, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And out of these safe houses about how many would 
you say had Daez Trading as – reflected as the owner of the safe 
10 
houses? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would say four or five 
over a period of time, I think five Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright now the other ones did you know 
whether there was some other company that played the same role in 
regard to them as Daez Trading had played in regard to the four or five 
or did you know that there was no such company which played a similar 
role? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I can’t say there was no 
such company Chair, because I’m not aware of it so I can’t say there 
20 
was no such other company that played a similar role to Daez Trading 
in terms of the safe houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay so there may have been, there might not 
have been? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Correct Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 86 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I’m trying to establish what features one would 
look for, for a lease of a safe house by Crime Intelligence where this 
was legitimate there was nothing irregular.  Whether the mere presence 
of a company would indicate that it’s irregular or you could have a list 
with a company playing the role that Daez Trading was playing but still 
that list being regular. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:    It is possible Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so if we then come back to these houses that 
10 
you have talked about that belonged to General Mdluli and General 
Lalla, what makes you say, in this particular case in regard to these 
particular safe houses, this was irregular? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I say that Chair on the 
background of what I’ve testified to earlier, in terms of the cash being 
given to me on a monthly basis to buy Mr John Appelsami, this has 
subsequently handed over to General Mdluli of R7 000 and General 
Lalla of R6 000 respectively.  So it is my belief that had – this was 
purely done as to not to reveal who the actual owners were in terms of 
paying them cash as opposed to the monies being EFT or transferred to 
20 
their accounts directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, so it’s the manner in which payments were made 
– payments of the rent were made that makes you conclude that these 
leases were irregular? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 87 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in regard to leases of safe houses that would 
have been regular, do you know what the process would have been, 
they – would payments have been done through EFT or is there 
something you know? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Payments can be done 
either via – it will definitely not be done by EFT Chair, it would be 
either by cash or cheque from company X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say by cash so the mere fact that the rent 
is paid in cash wouldn’t, on it’s own suggest anything irregular? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It’s – like I said that 
10 
process is in place Chair where cash can be paid but it’s just my belief 
that it was done in this process so these individuals are not exposed as 
the true owners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the records of Crime Intelligence, if one were to – 
let’s assume that one would have to have access to the records, are 
you saying that the records will not reveal that in regard to this specific 
safe houses General Mdluli was the owner of, is it one or two flats – 
properties and General Lalla was the owner in regard to another? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair nowhere in the 
records would you find General Mdluli’s name or General Lalla’s name 
20 
or any way having any links to them at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you say in regard to other lease houses 
when everything is regular, one should be able to find records of the 
true owner? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair, you would be 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 88 of 170 
 
able to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
please now deal with the Morgan Ridge property in Boksburg referred 
to on page 31 paragraph 137 and 138 of your witness statement? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair this was a 
property leased from C L Dicks, Chair C L Dicks is the daughter of Joe 
Marx, as I testified earlier Mr Joe Marx is the owner of New World 
Motors, New World Motors is a supplier or service provider to company 
X.  Chair, I myself negotiated an agreement with Mr Marx this was done 
10 
on instruction of General Lazarus for the actual lease to be inflated by 
R2 000 per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so ultimately the rent was supposed be how 
much and it got inflated by R2 000 to be how much? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I’m not sure the 
exact amount of the rent, but whatever the rent was, my instruction that 
it be inflated by R2 000.  If I’m shown the documents, I can confirm that 
it for this particular premises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
So 
basically 
what 
20 
happened here, the funds were accumulated over a period of every 
month, that R2 000 would accumulate and over a period of a year you – 
if the calculations are done it’s R24 000 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This money I collected 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 89 of 170 
 
on instruction again from General Lazarus at the end of the year which 
was R24 000 and this we divided between ourselves.  When I say 
ourselves it’s between myself and General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes is that the R2 000? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That’s the R2 000 per 
month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Over a period of the 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay so it was split between the two of you? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1000/1000? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I must also make mention 
Chair at the end of the year we would collect the money but in this 
instance I think this particular year I took an advance from Mr Marx, 
this also and instruction from General Lazarus Chair because he was 
going on an overseas trip, he was accompanying Mr Marimuthu on a 
trip overseas and he instructed me to get an advance from Mr Joe Marx 
to the amount of R10 000, so this would be settled obviously it would 
20 
be R10 000 less end of the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay it would be settled by making use of the rent 
or separately? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The surplus on the rent 
Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 90 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
So 
instead 
of 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The R2 000? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That’s correct Chair and 
if it accumulated over the twelve month period it would be R24 000 but 
in this case it would be R10 000 less because during the year I had 
collected an amount of R10 000 from Mr Marx which I subsequently 
handed to General Lazarus, this was on General Lazarus’ instruction as 
he was accompanying Mr Marimuthu on an overseas trip, so he needed 
10 
some cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So in essence at the end 
of the year instead of getting R24 000 it was only R14 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    So Colonel Naidoo if I’m understanding you 
correctly are you saying that in essence, this extra amount of R2 000 a 
month was held by Mr Joe Marx, then to be collected by General 
Lazarus at the end of the year?  So that R24 000 would accumulate and 
if he hadn’t taken an advance he could then go and say, okay now I’m 
20 
coming to fetch my R24 000? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  All you have said Miss 
Wentzel is correct except it wasn’t General Lazarus who collected the 
money it was myself. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 91 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  On his behalf? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:    Yes the money would 
then be split between ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the split on a 50/50 basis or? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Now could you deal with what is called the 
property at X Business Park? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is the same 
manner Chair as I’ve mentioned to you previously, this was – but in this 
10 
case this was not – Mr Joe Marx’s daughter was a private individual, 
this company – this premises was rented through Daez Trading, Mr 
Appelsami again.  General Lazarus instructed me to negotiate, or rather 
not to negotiate, to inform Mr Appelsami that in the same process as I 
mentioned earlier in the previous – with regard to the previous safe 
house, the rent was inflated Chair and as previously mentioned it would 
accumulate, that amount would be kept by Mr Appelsami for the use of 
General Lazarus, I can’t recall if I also collected money from this 
particular transaction.  However, on one occasion Chair, General 
Lazarus instructed me to collect R6 000 from Mr Appelsami which I 
20 
subsequently handed of to General Lazarus, this also Chair, was also a 
trip – he wanted General Lazarus wanted cash because he was also 
going on another trip with Mr Marimuthu.  Chair if I recall this was 
around 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, Miss Wentzel? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 92 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Colonel Naidoo, can you now deal 
with Mr Marimuthu’s premises? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sure Chair as I testified 
to previously General Lazarus had struck up a relationship with Mr 
Marimuthu, basically to get a ear to – or get a ear from Mr Bheki Cele 
at that stage, this was when the relationship between General Lazarus 
and Mr Marimuthu is already established, various properties were also 
rented from Mr Marimuthu Chair the amount totally in the vicinity of 
R200 000 to R250 000 Chair, all of this information Chair was relayed 
to me by FM08.  At that stage FM08 was the person that was in charge 
10 
of these premises that were being rented by or rather from Mr 
Marimuthu by Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes did you know whether they were being rented as 
safe houses or they were being rented for other purposes? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   With – I assumed that it 
would be for safe – for the use of safe, as a safe house Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and do you know how many properties were 
being rented by Mr Marimuthu? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I’m not certain 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You’re not certain? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I’m not certain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know where they were located or at least 
some of them? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I can say for a fact 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 93 of 170 
 
that at least two of them were in KZN because I personally went – I’m 
not sure the rest of them where they were situated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But two of these were in 
KZN because I personally visited these properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair just for the record 
as well the properties that I visited, these were not ready, or not 
suitable for occupation at that stage.  I brought this to the attention of 
General Lazarus Chair, I’m not certain what measures he took after me 
10 
informing him about the unsuitability regarding these two premises that 
I inspected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you visited these two premises in KZN and you 
found that they were not suitable for use at that stage, do you know 
whether Mr Marimuthu was already being paid rent for them or not 
really, or whether that was before any leases cold be signed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:    Chair I can’t say for 
certain that these were already on Crime Intelligence books, however, if 
the documents are shown to me and I can cross-reference it to the 
flights that I took to KZN I can be more certain or I can be more 
20 
precise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and do you remember more or less when it must 
have been when you took – undertook this visit to those houses? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it would have been 
probably – probably late 2010 or early 2011 I can’t be certain. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 94 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay was it one visit when you – one trip when you 
visited both or was it different trips? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was on one trip Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One trip okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And Colonel Naidoo do you remember where 
in KZN these properties were situated? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:    Both these properties 
were in Umhlanga Rocks, not far from Mr Marimuthu’s home. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And do you remember why you felt they were 
unsuitable for occupation? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the one property, I 
did not go inside the property, the yard itself was unkempt there was 
the big tree hanging partially over the roof, it was generally unkempt, in 
my view it was not safe for anyone to inhabit that property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The other one Chair 
which was not far off from the one that I’m speaking of now, that was in 
better condition Chair, though it wasn’t occupation ready, when I say 
that, the toilets were not working, there were other items or I can 
remember 
correctly 
I’m 
just 
trying 
to 
re-call, 
pardon 
me 
20 
Char…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said there was something that was not working, 
what was that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The toilets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Okay. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 95 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Just generally, I can’t 
give you specifics Chair but just generally the property was not 
occupation ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, yes continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Colonel Naidoo could you then tell the Chair 
about a property that was rented by Crime Intelligence for FM18 and if 
you could explain who she was? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair, this was later 
in 2011 I say this because this was closer to the time that I was – I 
think it was a few months before I was admitted into the witness 
10 
protection programme.  Chair on the instruction of General Lazarus 
again through Deaz Trading an apartment in Boksburg was procured for 
the exclusive use of Mr Marimuthu’s girlfriend, FM18 was appointed as 
a clerk in CI and she was appointed within the 250 posts Chair, if I can 
call it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:    All of these things were 
done on instruction of General Lazarus Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair what I’m going to 
20 
explain next is also an assumption on my side but I will explain what 
happened.  I’m assuming that by that stage this was General Lazarus 
and Mr Marimuthu’s relationship was quite well established by then, I 
think it was over a year or a year and a half that they had first met 
each other and began their relationship.  It is my view that Mr 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 96 of 170 
 
Marimuthu knew too much of the workings of Crime Intelligence and 
more so General Lazarus’ activities himself within Crime Intelligence 
and I say this, it’s my view that this particular premises was procured 
for FM18 Chair on an instruction of General Lazarus, he asked me to – 
sorry Chair I’m just trying to gather my thoughts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When this property was 
procured via Daez Trading Chair or rented via Daez Trading, he asked 
me to get hold of FM11 and FM03 to arrange for cameras to be installed 
in this particular premises covertly Chair, I may add. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I say this …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say he wanted you to do this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I assumed that 
General Lazarus wanted to have some recording of Mr Marimuthu’s 
engagements with his girlfriend, who I’ve mentioned earlier FM18 so 
that probably he could have some evidence against Mr Marimuthu 
should he – should the need arise and I say this is just my view Chair 
but this is exactly what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it’s one o’ clock we should take the lunch 
20 
adjournment, we’ll adjourn and we will resume at two o’ clock, we 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

Page 97 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Naidoo. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Just before the lunch 
adjournment we were dealing with Mr Murimuthu’s premises. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If we could now deal with the Island Rock 
covert facility.  Could you please tell the Chair about this facility? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair before we go there 
if I can just complete the previous testimony regarding point 143 and 
10 
144. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I did mention that I made 
an assumption on this but I just want to clarify Chair.  The assumption 
was not on the premises whether the premises was rented or not.  That 
was not the assumption.  I definitely know of the premises I was there 
personally, physically saw the premises.  I can also point it out.  The 
assumption was why those cameras were installed and that was the 
assumption that I believed that General Lazarus wanted these cameras 
to be installed so that he could have some evidence against Mr 
20 
Murimuthu if the need arises or rose in future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I – I think that when you know some – that 
something was done such as the installation of the cameras but you do 
not know the reason for it to – the motive behind it you should leave it 
just at that.  To say you do not know why it was done.  You may have 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 98 of 170 
 
your assumptions and speculations but you actually do not know but it 
was done. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair will do so.  
Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
now please just deal with the Island Rock facility? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Chair this is 
a facility belonging to the state.  Like Ms Wentzel mentioned it is called 
Island Rock.  It is situated in Northern Kwazulu Natal Chair.  It is 
10 
totally secluded. The only way to get to this particular premise is 
through – by means of a 4x4 vehicle otherwise it is not accessible at 
all.  Chair General Lazarus and myself and numerous other officials or 
confidantes within his inner circle visited this particular premises.  We 
would go there for holidays particularly over long weekends, school 
holidays, over Christmas.  Like I mentioned Chair it is not possible to 
access this particular facility with a normal vehicle.  You need a 4x4.  
Hence state vehicles were used on these trips Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please describe the facility was – was it – how 
many apartments – how many rooms and so on?  Tell me more about 
20 
the fissures of the facility? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it is basically 
wooden structures.  There was one – one big open area which housed 
the kitchen and your living areas.  One small section of the main house 
also accommodated the camp manager.  If I remember correctly he is 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 99 of 170 
 
Captain Pete Nel.  Chair also is very important because this particular 
individual that I mentioned can confirm all of these visits because he 
was a camp manager for many years there including the time that I am 
going to testify to.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was – if I 
remember correctly Chair there were four other rooms or houses if you 
want to call it.  Each one had two rooms in each – in each house.  
Cabins Chair not houses sorry it was cabins. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes made of wood? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Wood yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So your estimate of how many – maybe I should 
ask you about how many people or houses or families could it 
accommodate? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I think it would 
easily accommodate 20 people at a time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At an official level what was it for?  What was it 
supposed to be used for? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I really do not 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you use it on a number of occasions? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair myself yes I went 
there on a few occasions with General Lazarus and at least on two 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 100 of 170 
 
occasions with my family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Together with General 
Lazarus and other members of his inner circle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say you had a manager? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You called him – I say him it can be her.  Camp 
manager: 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And was that somebody who was there 
10 
permanently? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That would the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a full time basis? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And were there other employees employed in the 
facility? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There were three other 
individuals that were employed there that lived on the premises Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And when it was not being used what would they 
be doing? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I cannot say for certain 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know.  And they were being paid by Crime 
Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 101 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the only time – the only times when you have 
seen it being used it was being used by personnel from Crime 
Intelligence for basically holidays? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Mostly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or weekends away. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Mostly holidays – mostly 
holidays Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But there were two 
incidents or occasions where I can remember where actual work was 
10 
done.  It was a getaway for the group of Crime Intelligence members I 
think it was from the Finance section this was from General Lazarus’ 
office.  Where they had I think it was over two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and this property was not leased but it belonged 
to Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this belongs to the 
state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It belonged to the state? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was being used by Crime Intelligence? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo am I correct that 
this property is on a beach? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 102 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did any of the suppliers to Crime 
Intelligence have access to this property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  I personally 
know of Mr Joe Marks because on one occasion he attended or went to 
this premises.  It was Mr Joe Marks and his son and including General 
Lazarus, myself and a few other members whom I cannot recall at this 
stage. That was one supplier.  The other supplier was Mr Jan Venter of 
Atlantis Motors.  I did not see him there physically but Mr Venter 
informed me on one occasion that he was going there on a weekend 
which was arranged by Colonel Barnard. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in your statement you – or affidavit you 
refer to Captain Pete Nel as camp commander rather than camp 
manager, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Camp commander, camp 
manager I am sure it -  I am not sure if it the same thing Chair probably 
would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could it be that it is not the same person?  Is it not a 
question of terminology? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would think so Chair 
but – but the question is there but the person itself was definitely 
20 
Captain Pete Nel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you just – you are just not sure whether his 
position was referred to as Camp Commander or Camp Manager? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 103 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
then please deal with the Thompson Bay property in Ballito?   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair before I go there I 
just want to confirm that all of these visits to this Island Rock facility 
would have been posted as operational expenses and would have been 
paid out of the Secret Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you say that out of those that you attended 
only two were used for some work? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how many times did you go to this facility if you 
10 
are able to remember? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair over a period of a 
few years I – it would have probably been about seven or eight times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In total. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In total yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In total and of that total 
two was with my family 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The other times you were with other members 
from other personnel from Crime Intelligence but without your family? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say out of those seven or eight times that on 
which you went to – you used the facility only two – you are aware of 
only two occasions when people in the group – some people in the 
group used the visit for work purposes? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 104 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Official purposes yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you say each time these visits to this facility 
happened on records they were reflected as official duties for 
operations? 
 COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – I am sorry.  Who would have – who would have 
been responsible for having these visits recorded as official? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair whichever person 
10 
went for that particular – I am talking about [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So each person had to fill in forms or whatever to say 
he or she was going on an official duty? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair in 
terms of the vehicles used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And all expenses that 
was for that particular period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And where they – where a person took 
his or her family with them would they have recorded the presence of 
their family members with them or friends? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would not have recorded that? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 105 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Then Colonel Naidoo the 
Ballito Bay property who owned that property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was a private 
property.  It was rented by Crime Intelligence but more especially for 
the use of General Lazarus and most of the members within his inner 
circle that included myself.  I went there on two occasions or rather on 
a few occasions.  I stayed there at this property.  Pardon which – on a 
few occasions I visited this property together with my family.  It was an 
10 
upmarket property Chair within the precinct of Ballito.   
CHAIRPERSON:  How big was it?  A four – four bedrooms? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was four bedrooms 
Chair.  It was very upmarket on the beach front. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How many times did you have occasion to use 
it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot remember 
exactly but I have been there a few times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few times. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say it was privately owned so was it leased? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was it leased as a safe house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As far as I know yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 106 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Apart from yourself do you know who else used it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was FM09, 
FM46,  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It would be General 
Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On a few occasions when 
I went there I – I think on two occasions Chair there were various other 
members from General Lazarus’ extended family that were there.  This 
10 
was over a Christmas period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  His immediate family and 
his extended family.  FM11 also I would include in that list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
deal with the property we have now called X Estates in Greenstone 
Johannesburg? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Chair this – 
as I testified to previously in 2006 General Lazarus was busy with 
20 
extensions or rather not extensions renovations to his house in 
Edenvale.  I think it was about two or three months into the renovations 
Chair there was a hijacking outside of his house.  It was a state vehicle 
that he was driving at that stage.  I think it was – it was FM07 shot one 
of the hijackers and the vehicle was also damaged because the suspect 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 107 of 170 
 
shot at this vehicle as well – the state vehicle.  Chair like I also 
testified to previously General Lazarus would travel to me – with me to 
his office.  So I would pick him up in the morning.  The morning of the – 
this happened in the weekend.  I cannot remember exactly which 
weekend on a Saturday.  When I fetched him from his house on that 
Monday on our way to work we were just discussing.  It was general 
conversation regarding the hijacking of the previous weekend or the 
weekend that passed.  And he said to me we can piggy back on this 
thing if you know what I mean.  And he would talk to General Lala about 
it.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I can continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I assume that he did get 
the approval from General Lala as General Lazarus instructed me to 
make enquiries or rather Chair sorry if I can just go back?  After he told 
me we can piggy back on this think if you know what I mean and he 
asked me to make enquiries regarding a safe premises and that he 
would speak to General Lala about it.  I presume that he did get the 
necessary approval because he instructed me to secure our safe house 
20 
for him.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you understand him to be talking about 
when he said we can piggy back on this thing? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I mentioned he 
was renovating his house at that stage.  It was quite extensive.  The 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 108 of 170 
 
house was virtually gutted in terms of the roof being taken down.  He 
was living at the back of the house or rather within the house in the 
back – two rooms.  So it was quite messy Chair.  So what I understood 
from this is that while the renovations using the hijacking – piggy 
backing on the hijacking that he will speak to General Lala so that he 
can move into a safe premises using the hijacking as a threat.  But 
actually it was because of the renovations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How would he use the hijacking as an excuse?  Would 
it be that he was scared of staying in his house because of the 
hijacking or what? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That would probably be 
the reason Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Or that is how you understood it. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I eventually found 
or managed to find a premises which I will refer to as X Estate in 
Greenstone in Johannesburg which is not far from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you will refer to them as? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  X Estates. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes okay in Greenstone? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was situated 
approximately about five or seven kilometres away from General 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 109 of 170 
 
Lazarus’ house.  This particular premises that I speak of.  General 
Lazarus together with his family they lived in this premises for I think it 
was just a period under a year Chair.  The rent for this particular 
premises was R6 000.00 per month.  I was responsible to take care of 
insofar as the payments, the rent, the amenities, the DSTV etcetera.  I 
also had to make arrangements Chair to have this particular premises 
furnished.  This was paid from funds out of the Secret Service Account.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  After the – General Lazarus’ alterations were 
10 
completed did he continue to remain in this house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  If I am given 
the documents I can confirm but I think it was – this lease was taken 
for a period of one year.  There was still outstanding two months that 
was left over on this particular lease when General Lazarus moved 
back into his own house.  This was done when the renovations were 
completed.  He moved out of this safe house. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what happened to the furniture that had 
been purchased for the house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the furniture a 3 
20 
seater lounge set was given to Colonel Miranda Venter.  I received a 
dishwasher and a television stand.  Some other items were taken to 
General Lazarus to his own property.  The rest of the items I believe 
were [indistinct] off or auctioned off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This terminology that furniture was ”bordered” what is 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 110 of 170 
 
that supposed to mean? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry Chair I did not hear 
that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  You say in paragraph 154 
that the furniture from the house was bordered.  You put that in quotes? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair is simply a term 
when an asset has reached its shelf life if you want to call it then it is 
auctioned off or bordered. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes.  But you say this was done to this furniture 
despite the fact that it was in excellent condition? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And when – what do you normally do or what 
did Crime Intelligence normally do with furniture that had legitimately 
reached a point where it should be “bordered”? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I speak under 
correction I do not know the exact process but it would probably go on 
auction through a tender process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And subsequently be 
taken off the system. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And be sold off and taken 
off the system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 111 of 170 
 
please tell the Chair about the property owned by Colonel FM10? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair FM10 is a Colonel 
within Crime Intelligence and he is also a businessman. He owns 
numerous properties some of which were leased by CI as safe houses.  
I know at least one property in Bedfordview – Bedfordview which was 
rented from CI. Chair this I do not have direct knowledge of but this 
information was relayed to me by FM 08. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I have not been to this 
property.  I have not seen it physically. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But this information was 
relayed to me by FM08. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So strictly speaking it is not correct to say you know 
– at least of one property because all you know is what FM08 told you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We could or could not – which may or may not be 
true? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you 
please now deal with the Sheffield beach property and explain who 
owned that property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am also going to 
not delve on this aspect because most of it is hearsay.   
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 112 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I am going to skip 
that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And we go to Karin 
Hanekom Attorneys if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you then deal with the payments to 
Karin Hanekom Attorneys? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair Karin Hanekom 
10 
Attorneys were the conveyancing attorneys they were basically dealing 
with the transfer that was purchase by General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before you – you proceed Colonel Naidoo.  
Ms Wentzel the parts which he is skipping because he says he does not 
have personal knowledge of.  Those can be investigated further. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To establish if his understanding is correct and if 
need be he can come back or somebody else who has personal 
knowledge can come in or who may have grounds to believe certain 
things about them.  
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will make sure that that is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Colonel Naidoo you can assist in that process.  
So in other words you might have information and you are not sure 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 113 of 170 
 
because you do not have personal knowledge but nevertheless what 
you have been told by other people might help in investigating those 
issues which might lead to establishing that what you knew or what you 
had been told is true.  You understand that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So where you can assist with regard to that I am 
sure you will assist? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  It just helps that by the time it is aired in 
public. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The necessary groundwork has been done to make 
sure that if it is aired in public there are reasonable grounds to believe 
it is true. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair we before we proceed there in respect 
of this property Colonel Naidoo do you have personal knowledge of the 
furniture purchased for this property? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which property are you talking about? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The Sheffield Beach property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one he said he does not have personal 
knowledge.  That he said you wanted to skip or have you come across 
something that makes you think he might want to revisit that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think that this – there is an aspect that he 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 114 of 170 
 
does perhaps have personal knowledge and if he can just clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay he may – he can clarify it.  Do you want to 
repeat your question? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Colonel Naidoo were you involved at all 
in the purchase of property – of furniture for this property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not for the purchase but 
I was present when the purchases were made. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what do you mean by that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is a private 
property and I will not delve into the details but it is a private property. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When this property was 
being constructed or rather in its completion FM09 – FM09 -0 sorry 
Chair.  FM07. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus and 
myself made arrangements to purchase furniture for this particular 
private property using funds from the Secret Service Account.  The 
items were purchased from New World. Chair this is not now New World 
Motors if I can clarify. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is another service 
provider to Company X but it is called New World. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is just… 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 115 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were present when furniture was purchased 
for this property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but that is about all that you have personal 
knowledge of? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But you – you do have suspicions that it might 
be property that was used as a safe house illegally or something to that 
effect? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was not – this 
10 
was developed as a private property.  It was not a safe house.  It was 
in the process of being built. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL 
DHANAJAYA 
GANGULU 
NAIDOO: 
 And 
nearing 
its 
completion it was furnished by using funds from the Secret Service 
Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I think that is as far 
as I can take you there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So what you can say is that the furniture that 
20 
was used – that was purchased to put into this property as it was 
nearing completion was furniture purchased with money from the Secret 
Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think that is important. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 116 of 170 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I will now go to 
Karin Hanekom Attorneys 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Point 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As I mentioned this was 
attorneys that were appointed as a conveyancing attorney dealing with 
the transfer of a property purchased by General Mdluli and Chair I can - 
10 
if I can just explain how I got involved in this.  I remember having a 
conversation with General Lazarus. 
He informed me that General Mdluli gave him a cheque.  That 
was to be deposited into this account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys.  It 
was 
for 
this 
property 
that 
he 
was 
purchasing 
at 
the 
time.  
General Mdluli was travelling somewhere Chair.  He was out of the 
country. 
I cannot recall what General Lazarus exactly said but he was 
not available.  He instructed me to - to deposit this cheque of 
R40 000,00 into … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So again R40 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It seems to be a common 
thread Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you people at Crime Intelligence like R40 000,00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It seems to be a common 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 117 of 170 
 
number, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Lazarus 
further instructed me to take an advance from the advance office of 
R30 000,00.  So the total amount of R70 000,00 would be deposited 
into this account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys.  This was all instruction 
that I received from General Lazarus Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he tell you why you had to deposit that amount in 
the account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot remember 
10 
or recall the exact - the exact conversation but the instruction that he 
gave me was to deposit this money into - into this account.  The cheque 
was from General Mdluli.  It was his name pre-printed on the bottom of 
the cheque.  It was a blank cheque. 
General Lazarus himself filled in - I - I assumed this cheque 
would have been given to him by General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus filled in 
the amount because it was a blank cheque Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Together 
with 
this 
cheque and the advance that I obtained of R30 000,00 from the cash 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I proceeded to - I think it 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 118 of 170 
 
is an Absa Bank Chair and I made the deposit.  I think the deposit slip 
is - is annexed to my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the deposit that you made was - you deposited a 
cheque signed by General Mdluli? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Where 
the 
amount 
had 
been 
filled 
in 
by 
General Lazarus? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you deposited that cheque into the account of 
Karin Hanekom Attorneys? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was - that cheque was for R30 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  R40 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R40 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I can just make a 
correction quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When I said the amount 
20 
of 40 000 the amount was already written in by General Mdluli … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But where you had to 
write 
physically 
the 
amount 
in 
words 
that 
was 
written 
by 
General Lazarus. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 119 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Mdluli had written the - the amount in - in 
figures? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then he had not written the amount in words? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The words were written 
in by General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So did you understand that this 
money was in relation to a property that General Mdluli was buying … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is what I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is what I can recall 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but why - why did General Lazarus have to be 
the one to fill in the amount in words?  Do you know? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  If General Mdluli had already written the amount in 
figures. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was blank Chair 
at that stage.  There was nothing written in - in the cheque when he 
was - when he handed it over to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  When General Mdluli handed it over to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  General Mdluli 
handed the cheque over to General Lazarus and General Lazarus 
subsequently gave me the instruction to - to make the deposit.  The 
actual 
writing 
of 
the 
- 
the 
amount 
in 
words 
was 
done 
by 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 120 of 170 
 
General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I thought that you said that General Mdluli had 
written the amount in words - in figures … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In figures Chair.  That is 
what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had not written the amount in words? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Lazarus was the one who wrote it in words? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Which one is - which his which? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Okay.  The amount was - 
was already written in Chair by General Mdluli.  The figures I am 
talking about.  The amount of R40 000,00 in words was written out by 
General Lazarus in my presence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now were you present when General Mdluli wrote the 
amount in words …? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In - in figures? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and were you present when General Lazarus wrote 
20 
the amount in words? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - so then when you spoke about the cheque being 
blank what were you talking about? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When I said it was blank 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 121 of 170 
 
Chair I meant that - I was referring to the words.  The words were not 
written in but the amount was written in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was no - the - the 
space where you have to write out the amount that was blank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Is - is your recollection on this matter quite 
clear? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Very clear Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am asking that because I seem to think that 
you have gone from one version of saying the cheque was blank and 
10 
that General Lazarus wrote both the - both the amount in figures and 
the amount in words to a version that says General Mdluli wrote the 
amount in figure - in figures but General Lazarus wrote the amount in 
words. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to think you have said that a few times.  Am 
wrong? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  If I may Chair let me 
clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I misunderstand something? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure.  Maybe I - 
I was not very clear Chair.  If I may.  The amount in - the actual figure 
was 
written 
by 
General Mdluli 
and the cheque 
was 
given 
to 
General Lazarus.  When I met him at his office the space where you 
had to write out the amount in words was blank.  That was written out 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 122 of 170 
 
by General Lazarus in my presence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How - how do you know that the amount in figures 
was written by General Mdluli when you were not there when he - 
whoever wrote the amount wrote it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Okay Chair.  That - that 
would not be very clear because that was his cheque with his 
pre-printed name at the bottom.  So I am assuming that figure was 
written in by General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you see now you are saying you are 
assuming. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  That - that 
part may not be very clear.  That is - that is an assumption yes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But what - what I can 
confirm is that that was a cheque by General Mdluli because his name 
was pre-printed on the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you remember a while ago I said please if 
you are not sure if you assume do not tell me.  Just tell me what you 
know and you will remember I - I asked you is your memory quite clear 
on this matter and you said yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
my 
apologies 
Chair.  What I am - what I am sure about is that General Lazarus wrote 
in the figure or the words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The figure.  I will - I will 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 123 of 170 
 
stay away from that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you are not sure … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As to who wrote the amount in figures? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I will stay away from that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  My apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  In whose name was the 
10 
advance for the additional amount of 30 000 taken? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this advance was 
taken on my name Chair.  This was an instruction of General Lazarus. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who approved that advance? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was General Lazarus. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why was the advance taken in your 
name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
this 
was 
an 
instruction like I said from General Lazarus.  This was the cash amount 
of 30 000.  When he further instructed me to take the cheque together 
20 
with the cash of R30 000,00 that he had just approved and deposit into 
this account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have regard to page 116. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is that the deposit slip that you are referring 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 124 of 170 
 
to? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is it?  1-1-6? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  116. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you fill in that deposit slip? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair that is my writing.  
That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And after this were arrangements made to 
repay this advance of 30 000 that had been taken in your name to 
10 
Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed.  Chair as I 
testified 
to 
previously. 
 A 
safe 
house 
was 
being 
rented 
or 
General Mdluli’s safe house was being rented by Crime Intelligence.  
When I met General Mdluli a week or two after taking this advance I 
suggested to him that I pay off this outstanding advance of R30 000,00 
on my name if I could with his permission use the money from - from 
the premises which was R7 000,00 to pay off this outstanding advance 
on my name. 
He agreed Chair.  I also relayed this message or rather 
20 
relayed 
this 
conversation 
that 
I 
had 
with 
General Mdluli 
to 
General Lazarus and they were both fine with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to come back to - and ask you to repeat 
this discussion that you had with General Mdluli but I just want to go 
back to the deposit slip at page 1-1-6. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 125 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know the paragraph which deals with this is 
paragraph 1-6-3.  The deposit into the account of Karin Hanekom 
Attorneys and that paragraph has got two - at least two amounts.  The 
amount of R40 000,00 and the amount of R30 000,00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I understood you earlier on and you must just 
tell me if I misunderstood you to say that the amount that you deposit 
into the account of the attorneys - Karin Hanekom Attorneys - was 
R40 000,00. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this cheque here there is a reference to 
R30 000,00 two times and then there is R40 000,00.  What can you say 
to me to try and clarify? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is simply - the 
R30 000,00 was a cash advance that I have taken from the Secret 
Service Account. The other R40 000,00 was the cheque.  I think the 
cheque - the cheque number is also on - on the deposit slip.  Where - 
where the other R30 000,00 is reflected Chair is merely a sub total 
because there is no other amounts there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the - the amount that you actually deposited into 
the account of Karin Attorneys was R70 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not R40 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 126 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you recall that when I asked you said it was 
R40 000,00 or did I misunderstand you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if - if I did it - it 
was a mistake on my part but the actual amount was R70 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Maybe I was referring to 
the cheque … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And not the cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But in total it was 70 000 
that was deposited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So the R70 000,00 was made up of two 
amounts.  There was R30 000,00 which was an advance for - that you 
took in your name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was cash? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there was R40 000,00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In the form of a cheque, 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the form of a cheque … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
that 
cheque 
being 
the 
cheque 
from 
General Mdluli? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 127 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So - so you deposited in the end an amount of 
R70 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  You can proceed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair Colonel Naidoo was dealing with how 
the arrangement that he sought to make to pay back the R30 000,00 
that advance had been taken in his name at page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I would like him to repeat that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Naidoo you said that about two weeks after 
you had taken out this advance payment you had a discussion with 
General Mdluli about it.  Please just repeat that discussion. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  It - it was 
probably a few weeks after this deposit was made and after the 
advance that I had taken on my name which was outstanding.  I - I 
suggested to General Mdluli that I could use the money that was - that 
he was collecting as rent from the property that CI was renting from him 
to pay off this advance. 
Chair I did this over - over a period of a few months where I 
20 
would take the R7 000,00 and instead of giving it or - or handing it over 
to General Mdluli I would pay off the advance.  Although it would be a 
part payment of 7 000.  This I did over four months and I think the last 
payment was R2 000,00 Chair.  That is how this - that is how this 
advance was settled or reconciled. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 128 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So money was - money was taken from where and put 
where? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if - if I can just 
refresh.  I testified earlier that General Mdluli’s flat in Gordon’s Bay 
was being rented by CI … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And on a monthly basis I 
would collect the cash from Mr John Appalsamy from Daez Trading … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And hand over the cash 
10 
to General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was on a monthly 
basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  When I took this advance 
Chair to pay the attorneys this was outstanding.  I could not reconcile 
this advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I then suggested to 
20 
General Mdluli if I could with his permission the money that I collected 
from Mr - Mr John Appalsamy for his property with regards to the rent 
the R7 000,00 if I could pay it off each month against this outstanding 
R30 000,00.  He agreed Chair.  This was done over a few - a few 
months until this advance was paid off. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 129 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So - so - and the effect of that was that in 
the end the money that had been paid the R30 000,00 that you had 
taken as an advance payment for - for his benefit was repaid? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Over a period of five months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright and this was - the deposit was 
made on 25 May 2010? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo you then 
deal with upgrades to the properties of various Crime Intelligence 
members.  Could you first please deal with a property owned by 
General Lazarus’ sister? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, K - regarding 
Upgrading of CI Members Properties.  I am going to skip this section as 
well because all of this was conversations or general conversations 
that I had with various members of Crime Intelligence and I picked up 
these things.  So I am going to skip this Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As - as I said in regard to - in the context of the other 
part which you skipped they can still be investigated further … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To establish whether it is indeed what happened and 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 130 of 170 
 
if it is then either you or somebody else can come and give evidence 
about those aspects. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Chair if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There is just one aspect 
where I have personal knowledge … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I refer to - still under 
the heading of K:  Upgrading of CI Members Properties and I refer to 
10 
point 167.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was my own 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was a period when 
General Lazarus was busy renovating his home Chair.  There was a 
period I think of two or three weeks where there was down time for the 
renovations at his property.  He said to me that - I think he gave me a 
cheque.  No he did give me a cheque.  I remember clearly Chair. 
20 
It was a cheque for R20 000,00.  He said that I should 
upgrade the property to my own house.  Well not the whole property.  It 
was a boundary wall and to replace the - the driveway gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And this was an amount 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 131 of 170 
 
of R20 000,00 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this money that he was just like giving to you to 
spend for this purpose with nothing for him - in it for him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was a cheque 
that he had given.  It was cash but he did mention to me that he would 
sort it out with Deena.  Dina referring to Major-General Deena Moodley 
who was a Crime Intelligence Head KwaZulu-Natal at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would he sort it out with him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair again this would be 
hearsay if I go into - if I delve into that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go into that, yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But I can provide more 
details further to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh, after some investigation. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At a later stage, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  I mean we - in a Commission 
one - we allow hearsay but there has got to be some limit and where 
things can be investigated first they should be investigated first as far 
as possible.  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So he gave you this amount and said use it to 
upgrade your own property by building a boundary wall.  Is that right - 
and driveway? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair and 
replacing the driveway gate. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 132 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had not asked for this.  He just came up with 
the idea? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - but what was your understanding of whose 
money you were going to use for - for this purpose - purpose?  Was 
your understanding that he was giving you or maybe let me ask first 
you said it was a cheque?  Was it his cheque? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was his own cheque 
Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you have an understanding of what he 
10 
meant when he said he would sort it out with Deena? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your own understanding of what he meant? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair my understanding 
of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are you not sure? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Would be indeed Crime 
Intelligence money but like I said I cannot delve into that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Further. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is as far as I can take 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - you are not able to think of any reason why 
without you having asked him he would give you R20 000,00 from his 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 133 of 170 
 
own pocket to improve your property? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
No 
Chair. 
 
It was 
R20 000,00 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R20 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
I 
must 
also 
mention if I may that amount was never paid back to General Lazarus 
by myself. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and he never asked for it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you and - and we do not have a 
copy of that cheque here.  Do we? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Naidoo … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am not aware of 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In - in the bundle? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Of that annexure.  I am 
20 
not sure if it is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is not in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 134 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Do you have a recollection of 
roundabout when this was when he gave you this cheque? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair, 
he 
- 
he 
- 
General Lazarus was renovating his own property around 2006/2007.  
So it would have been probably in the same - in the same timeframe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Yes continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo you then deal 
with the acquisition of State vehicles.  As far as you are aware were 
the Generals in Crime Intelligence entitled to acquire State vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I am going to skip 
10 
that as well.  It is also hearsay.  This was through general conversation 
that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Who was responsible for acquiring …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let - let me first understanding from - from where he 
skips to where.  So you would be skipping from page - paragraph 1-6-8 
… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to where? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Up to 170. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to 170? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you and from 171 you are ready to deal 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 135 of 170 
 
with that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  From … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or from 1-7-2? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  It would go to 
- from 168 to 172.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct).  Those are the paragraphs you are 
skipping? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  So it means we go to … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 40. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We go to the next heading.  Is that right? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 40 Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SR Vehicles.  Okay.  Take it from there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo who was 
responsible for the acquisition of State vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is in reference 
to the Mdluli family one point - 173 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I was in charge of these 
seven agents.  So I would ultimately take care of their petrol claims 
20 
regarding these vehicles Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was seven vehicles in 
total.  If I just may name then Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 136 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  One was a BMW 330 
diesel - a sedan.  The second one was - and if I can just give the 
amount Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
The 
amount 
of 
R487 313,00 this was utilised by FM24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The second vehicle Chair 
a Nissan Micra.  The amount for this particular vehicle was

documents are shown to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo this section of your statement 
is prefaced by a statement at paragraph 173 that you were shown 
documentation by Colonel Roelofse regarding State vehicles that were 
delivered to General Mdluli’s family members. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 137 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But you say you comment on them as follows.  
Is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now on whose instructions were these 
vehicles delivered to the Mdluli family members? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair these are the 
instructions that I received from General Lazarus.  He also informed me 
that I would be responsible for these vehicles insofar as the claims in 
respect of each one of these vehicles.  Chair on a monthly basis I 
10 
would receive petrol slips from these members and I would complete 
the necessary compilation of the claims. 
Chair being them as they were agents their daily trips were 
not logged.  Rather it was just an opening mileage for the month and a 
closing mileage at the end of the month.  So I had no idea where the 
vehicles were being utilised and for what purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who delivered these vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair these vehicles 
were delivered to, I am not sure if I can, I won’t mention he area w here 
20 
they were delivered to, but they were delivered to ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the persons that are mentioned in – to the persons 
mentioned who are part of the list of seven? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As in 173 Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Mdluli family that you were handling? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 138 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, so you delivered the vehicles to each one 
of them, their one. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever the place was where you were asked to 
deliver it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you make them sign any documents? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  They had to sign on 
receipt of the vehicle Chair that they did receive that particular vehicle.  
I think there is a signature thereof in the agent files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you told them what was expected of them in 
terms of their use of the vehicles under Crime Intelligence. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo if you could 
please then deal with General Mdluli’s vehicles, the vehicles he used 
himself, not delivered to family members? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, yes Chair General 
Mdluli made use of seven vehicles, Chair this was not at any one 
particular given time, it was over a period of time, from the time he was 
appointed, that was in July 2009 until I went into witness protection, 
that was in October 2011, so this was a period of over the time period 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 139 of 170 
 
that I have just mentioned, the one vehicle Chair this was an Audi Q7, 
this vehicle was utilised by General Mdluli Chair, as his official vehicle, 
this was from the Open Account, this was not procured from the Secret 
Service Account Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Mdluli at that 
stage was a Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence so in terms 
of his rank I think he was – he had the authority to use this vehicle with 
an official driver.  Chair he also had a bodyguard but I am not sure if 
that is within the prescripts but he did have a bodyguard. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And then I referred to a 
Mercedes Benz in 177.2, Chair this was a Mercedes Benz E350 CDI 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry let us go back to the first one, the Audi 27 
are you able to indicate during which period he used that vehicle? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is a vehicle he 
would have received when he was appointed, that was in July 2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Until the period of 2011, 
20 
March thereabout where he was arrested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was his official 
vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he – you did say that he didn’t use all of these 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 140 of 170 
 
seven vehicles at the same time. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say whether at any one time he would 
have had a minimum of X number of vehicles that he used, or is that 
something you are not able to say. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am not sure 
exactly of the time frames but I would say at least three of those 
vehicles were used for his use at any given time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright.   Continue you were onto 177.2. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this vehicle was 
10 
purchased through funds from the Secret Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s the Mercedes Benz E350 CTI? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This is – sorry Chair can 
I continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue, ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as opposed to the 
first vehicle when I mentioned the Audi Q7 this was procured via the 
open account, the Mercedes and the rest that I mentioned is all 
20 
procured using funds from the Secret Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The first one a Mercedes 
E350 CDI this vehicle was purchased from Mercedes Benz Lifestyle 
Centre Menlyn, the amount being R636 950. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 141 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
however 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was purchased by Company X? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Using the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Secret Service Account 
Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I just may give 
10 
you some insight regarding this particular vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Mdluli initially 
he was happy with the vehicle Chair but a few months later he 
instructed General Lazarus to trade this type or this particular vehicle 
for another one.  Chair I was there when General Mdluli came to 
General Lazarus’ office, he gave General Lazarus a list of extras that 
this particular vehicle, and I am referring to the Mercedes Benz that did 
not have.  He wanted those extras to be installed on the Mercedes 
Benz.  Chair those extras only comes from the factory, subsequently 
20 
another Mercedes Benz, Chair if you look at 177.3 Mercedes Benz E-
Class 350 CDI, Chair it is exactly the same vehicle, I am talking about 
now this is the second Mercedes Benz that was purchased for General 
Mdluli, it is exactly the same vehicle Chair, but if you look at the 
difference in the amount that was paid. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 142 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The price? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair the first one 
was R636 950, I refer to the second one, this was R826 780,01.  Chair 
the difference between these two figures that I have just given was the 
extras that was fitted onto the next or the second Mercedes as per 
General Mdluli’s instruction to General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The next vehicle Chair is 
a BMW 530 Diesel Sedan, this vehicle was purchased from Nieuhaus, 
that is in Pretoria, the amount being R706 150, purchased by Company 
10 
X.  Chair the next one a black Jeep, General Mdluli also made use of 
this vehicle Chair, however this was not purchased specifically for 
General Mdluli, this vehicle was previously utilised by Commission 
Mpego when he was the Divisional Commissioner.   When General 
Mdluli was appointed for a short period he made use of this vehicle.  
Chair however he was not very happy with this vehicle and this vehicle 
was redirected to another Province, I think it was KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair then I go to the 
next ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – I’m sorry – the BMW 530D at the top of the 
page was it bought with money from the Securities Secret Service 
...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Secret Service Account, 
that is correct Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 143 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and actually all these vehicles were purchased 
using the funds from that account, other than the first one which you 
said was the Audi Q7. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was purchased through the Open Account 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, yes, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the black Jeep like 
I mentioned that was not purchased specifically for General Mdluli, it 
was a vehicle previously utilised by the then CI Head Commissioner 
10 
Mpego.  General Mdluli made use of this vehicle for a very short period 
Chair, a few months if I can remember correctly and it was redirected to 
another Province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the next vehicle a 
Lexus, this vehicle was initially purchased by Company X for General 
Ntwe Chair.  I will testify to this a little later on and give more detail 
but this vehicle also purchased initially for the intention to be given to 
General Ntwe, she did not like this vehicle so General Mdluli made use 
of this vehicle for a few months, no not a few months it was until his 
20 
arrest in 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Who was responsible for the petrol claims in 
respect of these vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
all 
of 
these 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 144 of 170 
 
vehicles that I have referred to was my responsibility Chair, this was an 
instruction that was given to me by General Lazarus that I would be 
personally responsible.  Chair these claims were not done, as opposed 
to normal vehicles these claims were not done on a monthly basis.  
Whenever I would get receipts from General Mdluli I would complete 
the logbooks or the petrol claim Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did the availability of all these vehicles to him 
mean that he could leave his official car and use any one of those 
vehicles that were available to him as he saw fit? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And did anyone else have use of these 
vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not that I am aware of 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the chances that there could be somebody 
else or other people use them and you would not have been aware of 
it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
there 
is 
a 
possibility but it is going to b speculation so I would not speculate 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so it could be that they were or some of them 
were used by one or more other people but you might not know? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And Colonel Naidoo did you ever process 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 145 of 170 
 
petrol claims for any other person at Crime Intelligence in respect of 
these vehicles?  Did you hear me? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry Ms Wentzel, please 
repeat? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Did you ever process petrol claims by 
anybody else at Crime Intelligence in respect of these vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   No, not – no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If anyone else used them and in the process of doing 
so had to put in petrol and one – oh and had to put in petrol ... 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair pardon me, I did 
10 
not hear that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If anybody used any one or more of the vehicles at 
any stage other than General Mdluli and did put in petrol would you 
have been the only person to whom they would have had to submit 
petrol slips or could they submit them to somebody else? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair that would also be 
speculation, if somebody else within Crime Intelligence had indeed 
access to these vehicles there is a possibility that they could have 
20 
used the vehicles, put in petrol and done the claim separately to what I 
was received from General Mdluli in terms of the receipts, so there is a 
possibility yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 146 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Are you okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m trying. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    I can see Chair.  If you indicate to us you 
are not feeling fine you will let us know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us try and see how far we can go. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Colonel Naidoo at paragraph ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I might – maybe we should take a short 
10 
adjournment, I could arrange for some prescription, further prescription 
from the doctor before they leave.    
 
Let’s take ten minutes, we will resume at twenty past three.  
We will adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  I beg your pardon.  Colonel 
Naidoo could you please tell the Chair about the vehicle purchased for 
20 
the use by Minister Mthethwa? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair this was a 
Mercedes Benz ML350.  This vehicle was purchased at Mercedes Benz 
Umhlanga Rocks or Umhlanga Chair.  The amount – this particular 
vehicle was R373 850.00 Chair.  Chair I have personal knowledge of 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 147 of 170 
 
this vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year was that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was in – would 
probably be in 2009 or 2010 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes the price was R373 850.00.  
R373 850.00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This vehicle was 
specifically purchased for use by the then Minister of Police Minister 
10 
Nathi Mthethwa.  Chair it was myself and Colonel FM11 who delivered 
this vehicle to Minister Mthethwa’s residence in Pretoria.  This 
particular vehicle Chair that I refer to was registered in the name of 
FM11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  FM? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the Minister 
utilised this vehicle for a few months.  I remember this because 
General Mdluli when I met him at his office on one occasion he 
20 
instructed me to pick up the vehicle from the Minister’s house as the 
Minister informed him that he no longer wanted to make use of this 
vehicle as journalists were following him.  I remember Chair I spoke to 
FM11 to make arrangements for the vehicle to be fetched from Minister 
Mthethwa’s house. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 148 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was this a vehicle that was purchased with 
money or funds from the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Purchased through Company X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Were all purchases of goods or were all 
payments made by Company X from the Secret Service Account or were 
there some payments that were made by Company X from the open 
account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair all of these 
vehicles that I mentioned except the Audi Q7 were purchased with 
10 
funds from the Secret Service Account ultimately being Company X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And in regard to this one you are sure about that 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So arrangements – General Mdluli gave 
instructions that arrangements should be made to – for the vehicle to 
be fetched from Minister Mthethwa’s residence in Pretoria? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  He 
instructed me to retrieve the vehicle from the Minister’s house as the 
Minister no longer wanted to make use of that particular vehicle as he 
mentioned to General Mdluli that journalists were following him.  I 
20 
thereafter made arrangements with Colonel FM11 Chair to pick up the 
vehicle from the Minister’s house.  FM11 knew where the Minister’s 
house was because he had previously went there with me deliver the 
vehicle initially Chair.  This vehicle was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When the vehicle was delivered for the first time were 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 149 of 170 
 
you part of that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair I arranged with 
FM11 to drive the vehicle because he had not known at that stage 
where Minister Mthethwa stayed.  I did Chair because on previous – on 
a previous few occasions I had taken or driven General Mdluli there for 
a meeting that he was having with the Minister.  So I knew where the 
residence was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. Yes okay.  So when it was to be fetched you also 
went to the Minister’s residence together with MF11? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair I made 
10 
arrangements with FM11 to fetch the vehicle from the Minister’s house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this time he knew the way to get there/ 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair having been there 
the first time with me to deliver the vehicle yes he did know where the 
premises was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair after FM11 
collecting the vehicle from Minister Mthethwa the vehicle was parked at 
our vehicle store – when I say our it is CI vehicle store.  It was 
occasionally used by General Lazarus.  On at least one occasion we 
20 
used this particular or he used this particular vehicle to Island Rock.  
Chair this vehicle was thereafter driven to Cape Town.  It was utilised 
by General Mdluli.  If I am given to understand correctly I think this is 
the same vehicle that was – this was the vehicle that was registered in 
the name of FM24. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 150 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Initially it was – you said it was registered in the 
name of FM11 is it not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that registration changed afterwards? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Registered in the name of FM24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say for how long the vehicle was with 
Minister Mthethwa? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it would have been 
probably a few months Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Not more than a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Now vehicles that are bought by National 
Crime Intelligence do they – does Crime Intelligence ever buy vehicles 
for Ministers – for Minister of Police? I take it that he was Minister of 
Police at the time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair he 
was the Minister of Police.  In terms of him using a vehicle from Crime 
Intelligence I cannot be certain Chair.  I am not sure what the policy is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes.  And in terms of you have no 
recollection also in terms of kilometres that it would have travelled 
during the time that it was with him when it was returned? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot say 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 151 of 170 
 
exactly but it would not have been used extensively because it was just 
a few months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So it would have been 
fairly – still fairly new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you have any understanding of the context 
for the statement that according to General Mdluli the Minister did not 
want to continue using the car because journalists were following him?  
Do you have – did you have any understand what that was about?  Why 
would journalists have been following him? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair from what I am – I 
am given to understand from this instruction that – or conversation that 
I had with General Mdluli regarding the vehicle and journalists following 
the Minister. I believe Chair that this was not a – or above board 
transaction being afraid that journalists were following him he was 
reluctant thereafter to use this vehicle and instructed me to retrieve the 
said vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Could you then deal with 
the vehicle purchased for General Nchwe? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair this was a – 
Chair as I said initially when I referred to the vehicle that was being 
utilised by General Mdluli the Lexus Chair this particular vehicle was 
initially purchased for the use of General Nchwe.  Chair when this – 
when this vehicle was purchased he did not like this vehicle.  That is 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 152 of 170 
 
how General Mdluli came about making use of this particular vehicle.  
With regards to General Nchwe’s vehicle a vehicle was purchased for 
her.  It was an Audi Q4 Chair 3 litre TDI.  I do not have the documents 
in front of me so I cannot say what the value of this particular vehicle 
was.  Chair but I have insight as to how this vehicle was or why this 
vehicle was procured for this particular individual.  Chair it was in 
around 2010 this was when the promotion – I am speaking now of the 
250 posts which is commonly known at the 250 post.  It was around that 
time 2010.  It was probably in the first – first half of 2010.  General 
Mdluli called me he was at his office – Crime Intelligence Head Office.  
10 
He asked me to fetch him.  Thereafter proceeded – he informed me that 
he is having a meeting with General Nchwe and that I should drive him 
there which I did.  Chair I waited for him.  When he came back he 
mentioned and he smiled or laughed a bit.  He said hey Solly must buy 
this aunty a car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was saying that and saying to whom or in 
relation to whom? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Mdluli said to 
me Solly you must buy this aunty a car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is Solly now? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Solly if I just – if I – 
sorry Chair.  If I can explain?  Solly being the reference to General 
Lazarus and aunty being the reference to General Nchwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh was Solly General Lazarus’ name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 153 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or nickname? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  His name Solomon 
Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Solomon.  Okay alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage there 
was the relationship between – okay Chair sorry I am going to – I am 
going to not speak on that because it is speculation.  I am going to 
speak of what I know.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  What I can say is that at 
that stage General Nchwe was not employed at CI.  I think she was the 
Divisional Commissioner of Head of Human Resources at the SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  She had no dealings with 
Crime Intelligence or rather she did have dealings with Crime 
Intelligence but she was not stationed at Crime Intelligence.  Chair 
what I can say further is that this particular vehicle was purchased for 
General Nchwe.  I together with FM02 who is actually a relative of 
20 
General Lazarus.  FM02 Chair was at that stage living with General 
Lazarus at his house.  I got a call from General Lazarus.  He asked me 
to come to his home.  He further instructed me I – when I got there I 
saw this particular vehicle that I speak of Chair.  It was a – a white 
Audi Q5.  It was parked in his driveway.  He instructed me together with 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 154 of 170 
 
FM02 to take the vehicle and deliver it to General Nchwe.  This was at 
her residence in Bedfordview Chair.  I think it was Essex World. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM02 drove the vehicle 
and I followed him to General Nchwe’s house.  Chair I met General 
Nchwe in her driveway and she personally took possession of this 
vehicle.  I handed over the keys.  At that stage the vehicle had – had 
been – it was not registered Chair.  It had those temporary plates.  I 
also remember very clearly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was brand new? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was brand new Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I also remember on that 
particular date when I delivered this vehicle it was parked on a 
driveway not on the roadside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair and she said to me 
– are you just going to – before I left after handing the keys over to 
her.  She said to me – are you going to park the – you just going to 
park this vehicle on the roadside?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I was not really sure 
what she meant by that because the vehicle was parked inside her 
property on the driveway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the driveway.  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 155 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I really do not know 
what she meant by that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Nevertheless I did not 
pay much attention to that Chair.  The vehicle like I mentioned had 
temporary plates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You left the vehicle where it was parked? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In her driveway at her 
premises Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair although I did not 
register this particular vehicle myself but I did facilitate in the vehicle 
being registered on General Nchwe’s name.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On whose name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On General Nchwe’s 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it was registered in her personal – as her 
personal car? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In order for me to – to 
facilitate this process I required certain documents Chair from her 
namely her ID and a utility bill.  If I remember correctly I had a 
conversation with General Mdluli and I think he facilitated this for me to 
receive those documents in order for me have the vehicle registered in 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 156 of 170 
 
General Nchwe’s name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Can I take you back to paragraph 182?  There 
you say that General Lazarus informed you that General Mdluli had 
suggested that you purchase or I guess CI purchase a vehicle for 
General Nchwe? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As there was bad blood between her and General 
Lazarus.  Why would bad blood between General Nchwe and General 
Lazarus be the reason for her to be bought a car by Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I – still on 182 as 
10 
you referred.  If I can just correct?  This is incorrect Chair.  If I can just 
rectify that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was not General 
Lazarus who informed me that General Mdluli buy a vehicle for General 
Nchwe.  I informed General Lazarus of this – of this arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you informed General Lazarus that General Mdluli 
had suggested that you purchase a vehicle for General Nchwe? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  After – after – 
as I have testified already.  After dropping General Mdluli off from this 
20 
meeting that he had with General Nchwe and after having that 
discussion with me regarding the purchase of this vehicle for General 
Nchwe I – I informed General Lazarus about what the contents of the 
discussion I had with Mr Mdluli.  But I informed him also that General 
Mdluli will speak to him further when he sees him. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 157 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say anything along the lines to – that is now 
to General Lazarus that there was bad blood between General Mdluli 
and General Nchwe? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair not General Mdluli 
between General Lazarus and General Nchwe.  But also I am going to 
stray away from that Chair because that is an assumption.  Because 
this was a time when the post – the 250 posts were – were in the 
process of being concluded.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to stay away from it in relation to – in 
relation to what this related to or even whether this was said you are 
10 
not sure about – about it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair what I am going to 
– what I am sure of is that the conversation that I had with General 
Mdluli regarding the purchase of the said vehicle for General Nchwe but 
I will stay away from the assumption that there was bad blood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reason.  You will stay away from the reason or 
motive for buying the car? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But apart from what you may have been told by 
General Mdluli are you able to enlighten me on why General Mdluli or 
20 
Crime Intelligence had to buy General Nchwe a motor vehicle when she 
was not part of Crime Intelligence?  Or is that something you know 
nothing about? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That – that would delve 
directly on – on what I said … 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 158 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what you are not sure about? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That I need to stray away 
from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I cannot go further 
than that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In terms of the reasoning 
behind the purchase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo in the CI’s asset register in 
whose name was this vehicle registered? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this vehicle was 
registered as an asset against my name Chair.  But it was not actually 
registered as an Audi Q4 Chair it was registered as an Audi A4.  This 
was intentionally done as to not attract any attention to the relevant 
people who would be auditing CI books.  This instruction or this 
arrangement was told to me By Colonel Barnard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am trying to look at your affidavit to see 
where you – oh this is 184 where you say the vehicle was – said 
20 
General Lazarus then arranged for the purchasing of a white Audi Q5 
3.0 TDI.  Is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the vehicle that was purchased? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed the 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 159 of 170 
 
vehicle that I delivered to General Nchwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but you say in the asset register of Crime 
Intelligence the position was misrepresented? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The true identity of that 
vehicle was misrepresented Chair.  It was not an Audi Q4 but it was 
captured as an Audi A4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what was the reason for that?  You say not to 
attract attention? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct.  This was 
deliberate not to attract any attention to myself. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Because Chair at that 
stage this was quite an extravagant vehicle for me to drive as a 
Lieutenant Colonel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not have been entitled to a car of that 
value? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And whose idea was it that the true – the nature 
of the car be misrepresented? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was done by Colonel 
20 
Barnard Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes with your approval – with your knowledge? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Colonel Barnard Chair at 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 160 of 170 
 
that stage was the Head of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Procurement. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The Procurement Section 
at CI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he Head of Procurement? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And he also knew where the vehicle was?  Who 
would be using the vehicle? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure about that? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure if he knew 
who that vehicle went to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  And did he know that there was 
misrepresentation or he truly believed that the vehicle the one that was 
written on the asset register? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair he would – he 
definitely would have known because the suggestion came from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  So – so the – you – you talked 
earlier on about General Nchwe giving you her ID and utility bill.  Was 
that because at the Department of Transport the vehicle was to be 
20 
registered in her name? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the asset register at Crime Intelligence it 
would be reflected differently? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is indeed correct 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 161 of 170 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What was going to happen in terms of this 
arrangement to petrol slips and so on?  Because if a car is under the – 
under Crime Intelligence and is used – being used for the operations of 
Crime Intelligence one would expect that there would be petrol slips 
that would be brought in from time to time.  Did this happen in regard 
to this car even though it was being used by General Nchwe? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  What I can 
say with regards to what you just mentioned.  Although the said vehicle 
was allocated on my name on the CI Register. Chair from the time that 
10 
this vehicle was purchased and subsequently handed over to General 
Nchwe up until the time that I was admitted into the witness protection 
program I had not received a single receipt in terms of petrol slips or 
any other receipts regarding this vehicle Chair.  So basically there was 
– there would be no claims posted against this vehicle in the timeframe 
that I mentioned because I had never received any – any receipts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course if they came would anything written in 
them betray the lie that was to be found in the asset register?  In other 
words would the petrol slip reflect that it is a different car – a much … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The petrol slip – the 
20 
petrol… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or would they not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The petrol slip no Chair 
because that would just be a normal petrol slip that you would fill in 
any other vehicle. 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 162 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But in terms of this 
vehicle being registered on the system it would have been allocated a 
SR number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So if one had to punch in 
that asset or rather sorry SR number it would come up as an Audi A4 
and not an Audi Q5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so all the places where information needed to be 
changed in order to accord with the misrepresentations had been 
10 
changed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair when the initial – 
when the initial change was made as to disguise the true identity of this 
vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Once it was captured on 
the system as an A4… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will remain like that Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Wherever you go in any – 
sorry Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It remained like that throughout? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  So – but if there were no petrol 
slips anybody investigating would have found it strange that there were 
no petrol slips for a long period of time in regard to a vehicle that was 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 163 of 170 
 
supposed to be used? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there would have 
been queries and I had a few – at a later stage or a few months later I 
did this – I did bring this to the attention of General Lazarus and 
informed him that – that I was – there was nothing forthcoming from 
General Nchwe with regards to any expenses with respect to this 
vehicle.  Chair General Lazarus instructed me to contact General 
Nchwe to enquire from her as to what the position was in terms of the 
cost – in terms of petrol etcetera.  Chair I never got around to meeting 
General Nchwe I was subsequently admitted into the witness protection 
10 
program.  So I do not know what became of this vehicle in terms of – or 
physically where it is now or any expenses related to this vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And also I take it that if it was a vehicle under 
National – under Crime Intelligence one would expect that whenever it 
had to be serviced the relevant documentation would have had to be 
put into the records of Crime Intelligence, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in this case there would be – there certainly 
would be no records of any such documents at Crime Intelligence for 
the period that you were there? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I had not received 
any documents from General Nchwe regarding this particular vehicle so 
yes I would say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  From my knowledge I do 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 164 of 170 
 
not have any documents regarding this vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Except that it was 
registered on her name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and normally you would be the person who would 
know if there were documents suggesting that it was taken for a service 
under Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo after you 
10 
delivered this vehicle to General Nchwe did you ever have contact with 
her again? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair yes I did.  I 
remember on one occasion I accompanied FM11 Chair to deliver an i-
pad to General Nchwe at this residence that I speak of.  Essex World 
Bedfordview.  Chair at that stage she had already received her vehicle.  
And General Nchwe did not give me any documents regarding this 
specific vehicle.  Be it like you mentioned if it was serviced or any 
petrol receipts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you have cause to go to her premises 
again besides delivering the vehicle? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair yes I did.  There 
were security upgrades that were carried at General Nchwe’s house.  
So I did go there at least one other occasion apart from - from 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 165 of 170 
 
delivering the vehicle and accompany FM11 to deliver the iPad.  At 
least one other time apart from these two occasions. 
Chair I will testify to that later with regards to the upgrades.  
It is further in my statement - further down in my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why did you deliver an iPad to her? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure where that 
instruction came from.  It would have probably come from either 
General Mdluli or General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I can confirm that I 
accompanied FM11 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  To General Nchwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was delivering an iPad to General Nchwe? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We did not do this earlier Ms Wentzel but we should - 
you should do it to assist the transcribers.  Otherwise when we read the 
transcript you do not know what they are talking about if you look at 
what they have written when they rely on what - on the pronunciation of 
20 
Nchwe.  Nchwe is N-C-H-W-E.  Yes, continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  If we can just go back just 
so we have a time line.  On page 45 in paragraph 187 it said: 
“Although you cannot recall the exact date on which 
we delivered the vehicle to General Nchwe the date 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 166 of 170 
 
of 2 August 2010 as indicated on the purchase 
order suggest that I would have delivered the 
vehicle around the same time.” 
Did you have cause to peruse this purchase order? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not certain if I did.  
I am not sure if this particular purchase order was shown to me by 
Colonel Roelofse. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Mr Naidoo if you have also regard to 189 
you say in the last sentence of paragraph 189 on page 45. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  “I have perused an eNaTIS printout 
indicating that the vehicle was registered in 
General Nchwe’s name on 13 August 2010.” 
When would you have perused that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
this 
- 
these 
documents would have been shown to me by Colonel Roelofse during 
his investigations into Crime Intelligence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then finally you sometimes refer to the 
vehicle delivered as a Q4 and sometimes a Q5.  Do you recall what 
type of vehicle it was - an Audi Q4 or an Audi Q5? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Physically an Audi Q5.  
On paper in terms of Crime Intelligence System A - Audi A4. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at 4 o’ clock now but we can still continue.  Is 
that fine with you Colonel Naidoo? 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 167 of 170 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is fine Chair we can 
continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us - let us continue and see how far we are 
at half past four. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We - we might have to go to five but let us see. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could 
you please now deal with the vehicle that was received by 
Mr Timmy Marimuthu. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is page 47 of … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 47. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I will - I will not 
deal with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As it is also hearsay.  It 
was told to me by FM08.  So I will not deal with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It requires further investigation? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the one about General Lazarus at page 
1-9-4? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Lazarus 
kept a pool of SR vehicles at our store - CI store.  Namely a Mercedes 
Viano, VW Caravelle, Nissan Pathfinder and a Nissan King Cab which 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 168 of 170 
 
was used exclusively by General Lazarus and those close to him 
including myself Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Most of these vehicles 
were used to Island Rock.  Like I mentioned earlier Chair Island Rock 
was not accessible with an ordinary vehicle.  It needed a 4 X 4 to get 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So these vehicles would 
10 
often be used for these trips and any other trip that General Lazarus 
undertook.  So basically these vehicles were parked - when it was - 
was parked in the store when it was not been utilised by either 
General Lazarus or those close to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Naidoo did you say that you also 
had use of the four wheel drive vehicles? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes.  I did.  Chair is it - 
is it possible if I can just take a five minute break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Let us - well earlier on I said I 
20 
think 10 minutes.  I ended up taking more.  Let us rather come back at 
quarter four.  Is that alright? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is fine Chair.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to give more time.  So that whatever needs to be 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 169 of 170 
 
done can be done.  Okay.  We - we will adjourn and … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And return at quarter past four.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you back Colonel Naidoo. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes I am Chair, Chair if I 
10 
may just a humble request Chair, I asked for a break earlier just to 
stretch my legs and walk around, I am getting cramps in my legs Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so maybe we should not continue for too long. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I can request if 
we can continue tomorrow Chair, I am just battling to sit with my legs 
cramping and it is also quite warm in here where I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I have a hearing that is supposed to start 
at nine tomorrow in regard to some application and I wanted to finish 
this first before I get to that, but if you are no longer comfortable we 
cannot continue.  It is okay, what we will do is I will deal with the 
20 
application tomorrow at nine and then when we are done with that then 
we will need to continue with Colonel Naidoo and finish. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever else was planned for tomorrow will have to 
wait until we have finished with Colonel Naidoo after that application, 
01 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 174 
 
Page 170 of 170 
 
so nine o’clock would be that application, as soon as we have finished 
with that application it will be Colonel Naidoo which I will go up to when 
we’re finished then we will follow whatever else was planned for 
tomorrow, so I think you will need to – I think share information with the 
evidence leader who was going to lead whichever witness was going to 
be for tomorrow, but I am sure they will talk to me as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes Chair.   Chair if I can have just an 
indication just from the point of view of witness protection as to what 
time you would like the witness to be here tomorrow so that they can 
make arrangements? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that it would be better that – I think he should 
be here about quarter to ten. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will stop at this stage then to take into 
account Colonel Naidoo’s situation and then we will continue tomorrow 
after the application that I will hear at nine o’clock. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Thank you Chair for 
accommodating my request.
