PROCEEDINGS ON 20 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry we could not start at eight o’clock but we 
will try and cover up.  Okay are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair the bundle before you is 
marked DD6.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the statement of Mr 
Arson Malola-Phiri will be marked Exhibit DD6. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  That is certainly 
the file to be used for the evidence today.  This particular witness Chair 
is currently an employee of South African Express.  He is currently on a 
fixed term one year contract and before this he was previously 
employed during the years of 2007 to 2012. Chair just to orientate the 
location of this evidence it deals particularly with the focus area as 
explained at the very outset of the stream to deal with the transactions 
that occurred in the North West in particular the North West Department 
20 
of Transport and South African Express in respect of the Pilanesberg 
and the Mafikeng airports.  Chair you will recall that Mr Ngwenya of 
yesterday 
gave 
a 
background 
in 
relation 
to 
these 
particular 
transactions.  This witness however deals with more of a comparative 
analysis between suites of agreements such being that which has been 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 3 of 87 
 
concluded between South African Express and Dube Trade Port and to 
compare that with the transactions that were concluded in the North 
West.  In so doing Chair it raises really the question to this commission 
and that is were the North West contracts reasonable in its terms or did 
it actually perhaps form a basis for fraudulent or corrupt activities and 
that is a question that this commission then would need to consider 
against the background of the information and evidence to be presented 
today.  Chair there is one preliminary issue and due to the nature of it 
it is important that we place certain things on record with your leave of 
course. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It relates – it relates particularly to 
confidentialities of the documents to be used by this witness during his 
witness today.  Chair in that regard I would like to place on record that 
all of the documents that this particular witness attaches to his affidavit 
in this bundle DD6 has in fact been provided to South African Express.  
They took issue with 13… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have been provided to or by South African Express? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No the commission provided a copy 
of all of the annexures… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To South African Express? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To his statement but not necessarily 
his statement his affidavit itself just the annexures. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 4 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It was done in a series of witnesses 
Mr Phiri being one of them.  South African Express took issue in 
particular with 13 of the 16 annexures.  Of the 13 I am informed by our 
investigators that 4 annexures are already in the public domain.  7 of 
the annexures constitute agreements that have been concluded with 
third parties and through the assistance of the secretariat the counter 
contracting parties to those agreements were contacted yesterday and 
Dube Trade Port in particular took no issue who raises no objection to 
those – to the use of the documents and so does Menzies and an 
10 
agreement was reached with South African Airways and their attorneys 
in particular on redactions which have since been effected.  There were 
two particular annexures Chair that does not constitute agreements 
itself but it is more cost data and it is cost data that is relevant to 
South African Express.  Whilst South African Express despite several 
invitations to bring an application to protect any confidentialities that 
they may wish to have protected.  We are informed that South African 
Express has no intention to bring such application however it is the 
considered view of the legal team to not in this particular case deal 
with the data that is contained and particularly the cost data that is 
20 
contained in those two annexures.  It is specific to this matter and it is 
specific to the circumstances of this matter.  And accordingly 
redactions have then also been affected.  In alignment with those 
redactions certain costings that is contained in the affidavit itself have 
similarly been redacted.  Chair in that regard with your leave unless 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 5 of 87 
 
there is any questions can the oath then be administered to the 
witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  My name is Arson Malola-Phiri. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I have got no objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so 
please raise your right hand and say so help me God. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair just for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Just for the record 
20 
we have created a small correspondence bundle in relation to the 
confidentiality issues.  With your permission should you so wish we 
could hand that up? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not look like I need to have a look at it.  You 
… 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 6 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have said that relevant parties are aware and 
they are not bringing any application to protect any confidentiality and 
in regard to certain documents that you felt may have issues of 
confidentiality you have taken measures to take care of that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Phiri if I then may take you to 
page 1 of the bundle before you.  Do you recognise this document? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Ma’am. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is it? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It is my affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I ask you to turn to 
page 21 please?  Whose signature appears above the word deponent? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It is my signature Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So this affidavit was accordingly 
signed with all annexures on the 5 June 2019 before a commissioner of 
oaths, is that correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay thank you.  If I can then ask 
20 
you to please provide details of your academic qualifications to the 
Chair? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Thank you Chair.  I must also state that 
my hearing is a bit impaired because I had my two eardrums burst five 
years ago. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 7 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And every time I flew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It seems to impair the hearing even more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  So I would like to ask Chair if he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that would… 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  A bit louder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  To [indistinct] my hearing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Just feel free to tell us if you do not 
hear. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Alright… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Maybe before we start with 
your academic qualifications can I quickly take you to page 17, 17?   
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Page 17.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in particular paragraph 62.  Is 
it… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  62? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  Is it correct that the year of 
2005 ought to have been 2015? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I would like to make a correction there 
Chair that the April 2005 should be replaced by April 2015 to March 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 8 of 87 
 
2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could then also quickly take you 
to page 67. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  67? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  Sorry, sorry, sorry page 18.  
Humble apologies it is the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 67 is at page 18. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  Sorry I said page – paragraph 
67.  Is it also correct that there was – there is a correct that instead of 
at that sentence to ‘for both airports’ it ought to read ‘for Mafikeng”? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly can I just take to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Mafikeng airport? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it – both should not be there and instead of both 
there should be Mafikeng and it should be airport not airports. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  With capital letter A, is that correct?  Can you hear 
me? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I can hear you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:   Ja. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 9 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 67 should the last two words be replaced 
by Mafikeng Airport? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair.  It is Mafikeng 
Airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mafiking. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Because that is the way it has been 
defined in the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It is Mafiking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mafiking.  Okay it has been defined okay. 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Mafiking Airport as opposed to Mafikeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly if I can quickly take 
you to page 16, 16 and there is the table that appears on that page. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  16 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is there any corrections that you 
wish to make to this table? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  The correction Chair in the table you 
have third parties 1, 2, 3 and 4 service providers. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And the – there are – the last four 
columns that deals with the airport management, passenger handling, 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 10 of 87 
 
ramp handling or aircraft handling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And route development marketing.  Now 
there are ticks on each of those columns and the – I omitted to tick 1 
and 2 specifically for route development and marketing so the last 
column for 1 and 2 they also have to be ticks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The four – so the further ticking should be in regard 
to 2 and it should be the last column and then the next ticking should 
be where? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair what I [indistinct] for number 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  All the columns have to ticked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And for number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Also all the columns need to be ticked.

MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Or the rows not columns, rows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Thank you.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so apart from those changes you 
stand by the remaining aspects of your affidavit? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that case then can I ask you 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 11 of 87 
 
please just provide detail of your academic qualifications?

CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Majors in accounting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  From paragraph 3 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 12 of 87 
 
you talk about your employment at SA Express in particular.  Can I ask 
you though to just give detail of your employment history to the extent 
that it extends beyond your employment in SA Express to get a better 
feel and understanding of how long you have worked within the aviation 
industry? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Thank you Chair.  My career started in 
1994 to 1995 with Nedbank the then Nedcor and I joined SAA in 1995 to 
1997 as a finance manager.  And from 1997 to 2000 still with SAA I was 
promoted to a sales marketing and business development role.  I left 
SAA in 2001 and joined Standard Bank then it was called Standard 
10 
Bank Corporate and Merchant Bank SCMB from 2001 to 2003.  I left to 
join Barclays Bank between 2003 and 2006 as the Director for 
Corporate and Investment banking.  I left in 2006 and in 2007 to 2012 I 
was working for SA Express … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can just… 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But in two different roles.  So from 2007 
to 2010 I was General Manager responsible for commercial and 
between 2010 and 2012 I was the General Manager Regional Expansion 
basically responsible for the implementation of the expansion and 
strategy into the rest of the region.  I then left I joined… 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before you leave – before you leave 
Mr Phiri – is it correct that as a consequence of the roles that you had 
in SA Express at that time you were also a member of the Executive 
Committee? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 13 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Please proceed? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  In 2012 end of August I left SA Express to 
join SAA Technical SOC Limited.  SAA Technical is 100% subsidiary of 
SAA group independent and with its own board and the executive 
management.  I was also part of the executive management at the SAA 
Technical.  I left them in … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before you leave SAA Technical can 
we just talk a little bit about the roles that you had at SAA Technical?  
What was the role that you held when you joined SAA Technical in Sep 
– 2012 – you said September 2012 if I heard correctly? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair I took the role of General Manager 
Commercial at the SAA Technical and that was between 2012 and the 
2015 and the subsequent to that I was promoted to an acting role as 
CEO of SAA Technical and I was also a member of Group ExCo the SAA 
Group ExCo. So over and above being an ExCo member for SAA 
Technical I was also a member of the Group ExCo for SAA.  That was 
between 2015 and the late 2016 and the – I resigned took or most what 
I [indistinct] early retirement.  I just wanted to take a break. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But before you take that break Mr 
Phiri who was the chairperson at SAA at that time? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It was Dudu Meyene. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and now you talk about your 
resignation.  What actually happened during May of 2016 during your 
stay at SAA Technical? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  In May 2016 that is when I tendered my 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 14 of 87 
 
first resignation from SAA Technical. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And why did you tender your first 
resignation as you put it? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  At the time Chair SAA as a group it was 
going through very trying times in terms of corporate governance and 
the IO say that he [indistinct] is ethics and for [indistinct] to that is the 
integrity.  Now if your ethics and integrity are being questioned then it 
tends to erode your role as a leader.  Now at that point in time it was 
actually quite clear that there was breakdown in corporate governance 
and once you have – break down corporate governance then the issues 
10 
around ethics and integrity also get questioned and if that is the 
currency of a leader then I thought to myself that it is time for me to 
leave SAA because also bearing in mind that the integrity and the 
ethics it is not something that is tangible it is either you have it or you 
do not have it.  And the only way you know that those two are being 
questioned is where the corporate governance is under threat.  That is 
the only time that you know that your integrity as a leader and your 
ethical standards are being questioned.  During that time also I mean 
just to give that in context the time when a number of executives had 
resigned.  A few of them were under investigation because at the time 
20 
when if an executives questioned some of the decisions the likelihood 
would be that either you go – you be charged and undergo disciplinary 
or you would be dismissed.  So the environment at that point in time 
was quite difficult an environment for anybody to survive.  So I took a 
few months of that and I decided that given the fact that the 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 15 of 87 
 
organisation is going through turbulent times in terms corporate 
governance it was an opportune moment for me to leave. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you talk about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This – I am sorry this was which year?  Which year 
was this? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It was in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  In May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016 in May? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  In May. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you talk about turbulent times 
within 
the organisation on corporate 
governance 
issues 
which 
organisation do you speak about?  Because at the time you were in 
South African – SAA Technical notwithstanding that the fact you also 
had a seat at Group ExCo level. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair it was basically on both sides.  The 
Group ExCo level and of course I mean ExCo will report to the board 
but also at the SAA Technical.  And it also allowed me Chair to put that 
also into context in terms of the actual structure of the two entities. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja I was about to say let us the group you know 
jaMR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja.  As I said SAA Group and SA 
Technical 100% but the SA Technical is an independent entity with its 
own board as well as its own ExCo.  But also I must mention that the 
composition of the board was from the SA Group.  So in other words the 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 16 of 87 
 
Group board members would ordinarily be also the board members for 
SA Technical.  So there was not in a sense of independence. Bearing in 
mind that the PFMA provides that a typical SAA – SOE should have at 
least 
three 
board 
members 
of 
which 
the 
majority 
should 
be 
independent.  Now by virtue of having board members who are sitting at 
the SAA Group and the same board members also sitting at the SA 
Technical it just compromises the sense of independence.  That is one 
part of it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who if I could who were those 
board – who were the board members at the time? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  At the time there four board members one 
of whom had resigned after a few months of appointment.  So we had at 
the time when I was acting CEO of SA Technical we had three board 
members.  It was Dudu Meyene, Yakhe Kwenana and Doctor John 
Thandi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those were board members for SA Technical? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Those board members were for the SAA 
Group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh for the SAA Group. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  SAA Group. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Of which two of those were board 
members for SA Technical.  So at the SA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  We had the chairlady Yakhe Kwenana and 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 17 of 87 
 
the John Thandi as a board member.  So we had two of three looking 
after SA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what the third board member at SA Technical?  
Were there three board members at SA Technical? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  There are three at SAA Group.  Dudu 
Meyene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three at a group? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  At the group level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Two of whom were board members for SA 
10 
Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so SA Technical had only two members? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Had only two perceived non-executive 
and independent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but the whole board;. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of SA Technical consisted of how many people? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Four.  The two non-executive and the 
CEO and the CFO as executive members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So SA Technical had four board members 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two being the CEO or the acting CEO during yhour 
time. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the CFO those were executive board members. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 18 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there were two non-executive board 
members but those two non-executive board members were also board 
members at Group level and that was Mr Dudu Meyene and Yakhe 
Kwenana? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yakhe Kwenana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So part of the point you make about issues of 
governance is that whereas the requirement of proper good governance 
10 
was that two or the majority of the board members at SA Technical level 
– Technical should be non-executive while it was true that they were 
non-executive at SA Technical but they were members of the board at 
group level and therefore issues of independence arose. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Char. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that part of the point you were making? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank ou. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But maybe just to amplify on your 
20 
point Chair.  You talk specifically about the turbulence of corporate 
governance within the organisation in order for us to appreciate what 
turbulence you refer to can you give us examples of corporate 
governance 
issues 
that 
caused 
you 
to 
consider 
leaving 
the 
organisatioin? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 19 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair firstly I am not [indistinct] that the 
as I said already that the – a lot of executives left during my time when 
I was the acting CEO of SA Technical and one of them was the Chief 
Procurement Officer who left. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who was that? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Sorry? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who was that at the time? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I cannot actually recall the name. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Was he or she the Chief Procurement 
10 
Officer for SA Technical? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  For SA Group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh SA Group. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  For SA Group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  At that stage.  But also bear in mind that 
the procurement officer for SA Group would also have an impact on the 
subsidiaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  In this case the SAT because SA Group 
20 
was the [indistinct] so to speak and the SAT as a subsidiary had to 
make sure that its policies were aligned to the group as to opposed to 
operating indenpendently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Which then brings to me the issue about 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 20 of 87 
 
the independence that was actually making me uncomfortable.  But 
during that time the Chief Procurement Officer had been charged and 
he – then he resigned before disciplinary… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is charged in disciplinary sense not in a 
criminal sense 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was charged with disciplinary – it was disciplinary 
charges what you are talking about? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It – it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not – not criminal charges? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Not criminal charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  These were charges relating to the 
procurement policies … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It was the disagreement there between 
the then Chair – Dudu Myeni – and himself – but what I wanted to say 
is that he – it was actually clear in my mind that the procurement 
processes were being eroded in a way. 
So there is a complete – not a complete breakdown but - you 
20 
know - a breakdown in compliance but he secondly talking to SAT 
specifically there one or two transactions where I believed that the – 
the Board could have applied its mind better and the (indistinct) of the 
processes and the awarding of that tender but because we are the only 
two independent and Executive and specific to be independent I believe 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 21 of 87 
 
that the – there was not much of application of mind in making certain 
decisions because of lack of vigorous debate but also I must also state 
that the - going back to the issue about the integrity and the ethics 
because these things cannot be legislated. 
It is something that you feel in your gut or the voice that talks 
to you between your ears.  My gut was just telling me that 
fundamentally there is something wrong.  Without having to point out 
specifically to an activity or wrongdoing but it just was not sitting well 
with me. 
My gut was telling me that there was just something wrong as 
10 
far as corporate governance is concerned and more specifically the 
procurement processes and the decision that the – were being made.  
So Chair it is quite difficult for me at this stage to make specific 
examples … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But that is how I felt … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  At that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And on that point Mr Phiri was there 
any interference in the procurement at SA Technical? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  As I said Chair I think that would possibly 
require me to be a bit more specific because otherwise I do not want to 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 22 of 87 
 
generalise … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Specific instances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  If need be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I think it would be a matter of a different 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I understand you to want to limit your – your 
evidence in regard to the issues of procurement and ethics and so on at 
10 
that time to saying certain things were happening which made you 
believe that ethics was – was being eroded and that there were 
challenges with regard to procurement - following procurement 
processes - but you want to leave it at that.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Phiri so when did you resign from 
SA Technical? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I resigned in May for the reason that I 
have just stated and the – a week later I did get a call from the 
Chairlady who was then Yakhe Kwinana to say that the – my departure 
left a vacuum and given the fact that SA Technical is a highly regulated 
institution and compliance was key. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 23 of 87 
 
So without a CEO it does question the – the licence of the 
organisation.  So she asked me to go back at least for a month or two 
in order to close the gap.  The thinking was that within that time they 
would have secured the services of a substantive CEO.  In fact at that 
stage the CEO of SAT before I got the acting role was Musa Zwane who 
was then asked to act the SA Group and basically I took over his CEO 
role at the SA Technical. 
So at the time when Yakhe was asking – the (indistinct) was 
asking me to go back for two months at that point in time the thinking 
was that they would have been able to finalise the recruitment of a 
10 
Group Exco in which case then Musa Zwane would then go back to his 
old role of CEO Technical.  So I agreed after careful consideration and 
I was there for one and a half months and I left end of August. 
During that time when I went back it is a time when 
Yakhe Kwinana resigned as a Board Member who kindly had shared 
with me why he had resigned and one of the issues that he – she had 
raised was that the – the corporate governance issues are being 
compromised. 
So she decided to leave which meant that the – there were 
only two Board Members left which is the threshold required by PFMA 
20 
but subsequent to that there was an appointment of two additional 
Board Members but the – for me I think the second departure was 
informed by the fact that even out Chairlady had to resign citing the 
very same issues that were making me uncomfortable which basically I 
confirmed like that and the voice that was talking to me. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 24 of 87 
 
So that for me was the indication that indeed what I thought 
was the – my gut feeling is actually real. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was the Chairlady who you are talking about 
now? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was the Chairlady who you are talking about?  I 
think you said the Chairlady resigned.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ms Yakhe Kwinana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she was the Chairlady? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  She was the Chairlady. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh okay alright. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  For SA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Earlier on Ms September asked you specific 
instances of challenges with procurement … 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and I understood you to – to say you wanted to 
leave it at simply saying it was your feeling or perception that they 
were issues in regard to procurement challenges and ethics.  I just 
want to say that it is not because we are not interested in instances of 
challenges and procurement and so on but it is simply because I have 
20 
read your statement. 
I know that it does not cover those issues and certainly 
subsequent to this if the legal team talks to you and it appears that you 
do have knowledge of instances relating to procurement that may be 
important for Commission then they can take a statement that covers 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 25 of 87 
 
those issues. 
I just – I do not want anybody to think we are not interested 
in issues of procurement that you might know about. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  So you left the 
organisation in or rather SA Technical in September 2016.  Is that 
correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that at that particular time you 
10 
took the decision to retire.  You then ventured out of the aviation 
industry 
but 
you 
returned 
to 
the 
aviation 
industry 
on 
21 November 2018.  Is that correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Where – can you just clarify in fact – 
sorry? 
 
Is 
it 
correct 
then 
that 
you 
joined 
SA 
Express 
on 
21 November 2018? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair.  I – as I said that I 
took a break.  I call it semi-retirement and the – roundabout 
August/September I was offered a job at SA Express as the General 
20 
Manager for Commercial.  Basically my old job at SA Express. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is that August September 2018? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  21 September 2018 … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  For a one year contract that expires on 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 26 of 87 
 
20 November this year – 2019. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Mr Phiri.  So according to 
my calculations you have experience of approximately 15 years within 
the aviation industry.  Is my calculation correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would it be fair to say that you are in 
fact well versed in contracting arrangements within the aviation 
industry based on your experience within the industry? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if you can then turn to page 2 of 
10 
your statement and paragraph 6 talks specifically to the focus of your 
evidence today which we will – we will now focus on.  You have been 
request by the Commission to do a comparative analysis between 
suites of agreements and as outlined in – on page 2 paragraph 6 please 
just describe the core point of focus for your evidence today. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Thank you Chair.  The core purpose of 
today is to look at the contract that the - or arrangement that the SA 
Express had entered with the Dube Trading Port.  The Dube TradePort 
being Schedule 3C of the PFMA.  Schedule 3 and Government entities 
basically have got dual mandates.  The one is a commercial mandate.  
20 
The other is a developmental mandate. 
In terms of the commercial mandate these entities are 
expected to be profitable and sustainable but we focus on economic 
growth as well as the sparing employment as well and the Dube Trading 
Port was such an entity.  This was enacted by the – I was just about to 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 27 of 87 
 
say North West – by the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government as part 
of the Department of Economic Development. 
The objective of – for this Dube Trading Port was specifically 
to look at the creation of one metropolis within KwaZulu-Natal Province 
and in this case it was in Durban specifically and the focus was going 
to be logistics.  Whether it is by air or by sea but over and above that 
they are also looking at the possibility of developing it into an 
investment.  So a special economic zone which would ideally attract 
investments of various nature. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  So on the one hand you 
10 
looked at contract – contractual suites of agreements relating 
transactions between SA Express and Dube TradePort.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then as compared to that you 
have also looked at another suite of agreements which has been 
provided to you by the investigators of this Commission.  We talk 
specifically to the transactions between the North West Department of 
Transport and SA Express.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The common denominator or at least 
20 
the primary common denominators of these two suites of agreements is 
that SA Express is a common contracting party.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that both these suites of 
agreements relates to the development of new routes? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 28 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In particular the Dube TradePort 
Suite of Agreements - if we could that – talks to the development of 
routes between Kinshasa – King Shaka International Airport Durban and 
Lusaka on the one hand and Harare on the other? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Whereas the North West Suite of 
Agreements talks to the development of new routes in relation to the 
Pilanesberg and the Mafikeng Airports relative to other airports? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Were you personally 
involved in the – or rather let me first ask you how did Sout African 
Express become involved in the Dube TradePort Project? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair as part of my responsibility as the 
General Manager for Regional Expansion was to look at opportunities 
within the (indistinct) region with a view not only to provide air 
transport to passengers to fly from Southern Africa destination to South 
Africa but it would also ensure that we promote trade but we do so 
responsibly and I will explain possibly as I go along in my testimony 
why I am talking about the sustainability. 
20 
Now in 2010/2011 we were approached by the Dube 
TradePort to basically request or encourage SA Express to set up a hub 
out of Durban as part of the Dube TradePort objectives in driving 
economic growth and therefore employment in the – in the province 
with a view that the SA Express would then operate into key destination 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 29 of 87 
 
in Southern Africa of which Lusaka in Zambia and Harare in Zimbabwe 
were on the top five on the list of opportunities. 
This arose from a study that was done by CBRE Consulting.  
At that point in time they were contracted to Dube Trade Point.  So they 
had done a whole analysis in terms of opportunities in Southern Africa 
and they were privatised accordingly.  Their approach was timely in the 
sense that it was at the time when SA Express was indeed desiring to 
expand into the rest – the rest of the continent. 
So the ideas definitely dovetailed.  SA Express then 
responded positively but obviously in any business when you are 
10 
starting a new route you tend to make losses in the first one or two 
years which in (indistinct) terms we call it an investment in order for 
you to operate on those routes. 
So it takes that long to get to a point where you are profitable 
on those new routes.  Now it was actually clear to us that for the routes 
that were earmarked by CBRE out of Durban it could actually take 
longer to do so.  So Dube TradePort came up with an incentive program 
to encourage airlines to operate out of the hub and the – this incentives 
came in the form of subsidies. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so if I may then following on 
20 
from your evidence another very critical common denominator between 
the agreements in the Dube TradePort Precinct and the – and the 
agreements in the North West Precinct is that both suites or 
agreements concerned some form of compensation or incentivisation 
payable to South African Express.  Is that right? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 30 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Who owns the King Shaka 
International Airport? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  ACSA owns and manages King Shaka 
Airport Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So notwithstanding that the contracts 
we are now going to interrogate was concluded with Dube TradePort 
was ACSA involved in these negotiations at all? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Not at all Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were you involved in the negotiations 
10 
with Dube TradePort? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I was actively involved in the negotiations 
culminating to the signing of the MOU and the subsequently of the MOA 
– the Memorandum of Agreement. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is – so your involvement ended 
after the Memorandum of Agreement that was concluded between Dube 
TradePort and South African Express? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Sorry.  Can you say that again? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Your involvement … 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ended after the Memorandum of 
Agreement was concluded? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Now in order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The involvement that ended would be involvement in 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 31 of 87 
 
what? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  The negotiations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And the – the signing of the Memorandum 
of Understanding – MOU … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And the – the signing of Memorandum of 
Agreement.  That was the extent of my involvement because the MOA 
was signed in 2012 in the very same year that I had left for SA 
Technical. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does it mean that after the signing of the 
Memorandum of Agreement you had no particular interactions with 
Dube TradePort? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  No not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not or you did?  You had no involvement 
whatsoever or you still had some other involvement with them? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  No any other involvement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Especially in light of the fact Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That the – the Memorandum of Agreement 
had made provision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That the – the two sets of agreements 
would provide the general framework … 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 32 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And that at any given point in time should 
a route be identified for execution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  There should be a separate addendum … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That talks to a specific route … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That has to be executed.  So I provided 
and signed for the general framework … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But the actual execution was going to be 
in accordance with the – an addendum which was to still be concluded 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  By – by both parties.  So I left at the – 
the stage where the framework was agreed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had been put in place. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And – and signed for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And I had no further involvement in terms 
of the actual execution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think that is what I was looking for.  Whether 
in regard to execution you had no involvement.  That is fine. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 33 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the reason for you then not 
being involved any longer to follow on from your evidence earlier is that 
at the time that or shortly after the MOA was in fact signed you left SA 
Express during 2012.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct.  When both the MOU and 
the MOA were signed that is when I left. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  So in order to do what I could 
possibly call an apple with apple comparative analysis let us just 
consolidate what exactly the type of agreements were that constituted 
10 
what we call the Dube TradePort Agreements as compared to the North 
West Agreements. 
Is it right that the Dube TradePort Agreements consists of a 
series of agreements?  Such being the Memorandum of Understanding, 
the Memorandum of Agreement and certain addenda. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And parking that to one side.  If one 
were to then consider the agreements concluded in the North West you 
would look at the – or rather you have considered the main agreement 
that was concluded between the North West Department of Transport 
20 
and South African Express together with four ground handling 
contracts.  Is that correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So to do the comparative analysis 
can I ask you first to turn to page 23 please? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 34 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  23. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Is 
this 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding that was part of the evidence you have just given? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
this 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding was concluded between Dube TradePort and South 
African Express Airways? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you then to turn to page 
26? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  26? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Oops – sorry, sorry – to 35.  Humble 
apologies.  Is it correct that this agreement was signed on the – during 
September 2011? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Whose signature appears on behalf 
of South African Express? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It is my signature. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and now to just look at 
some of the key provisions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are you looking at the signatures at page 
35? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 35 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Excuse me.  Is SAX – does SAX stand for South 
African Express? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 35 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does SAX stand for South African Express? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is your signature there? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Paragraph 1.1.2 on 
page 25 defines SAX to mean the SA Express.  I ought to have taken 
10 
you there Chair – sorry.  If we can then turn to page 26 and paragraph 
3 specifically talks to the duration of the agreement and 3.1.1 informs 
that: 
“The agreement would then be term…” 
Or rather 3.1.1 read together with the balance of sub paragraphs 
informs that: 
“The agreement would terminate by this agreement 
being conclude …” 
Sorry. 
“…by 
being 
replaced 
by 
more 
substantive 
20 
agreements, by mutual agreement to not proceed or 
after 12 months from signature date.” 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is therefore correct that there 
was in fact a subsequent agreement that was signed which was the 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 36 of 87 
 
Memorandum of Agreement that you were also involved in? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then ask you to turn to page 
25 paragraph 2.3 sets out the scope of this agreement and in particular 
it reads with your leave Chair that: 
“The parties have agreed to cooperate with one 
another to develop potential partnerships for their 
mutual benefit and in order to develop strategic 
partnerships for …” 
To name but three of them.  2.3.1 informs: 
10 
“Regional route development from King Shaka 
International Airport.” 
2.3.2 talks about the: 
“Formation of a joint marketing plan and the joint 
implementation of that marketing plan for areas of 
common interest.” 
If we turn the page sub paragraph 2.3.5 also talks to the: 
“Repair overall and maintenance of the SA Express 
aircraft and air fleet at King Shaka International 
Airport.” 
20 
If I can then ask you to turn to page 28 please.  At paragraph 5.2 the 
parties also agree that: 
“The Dube TradePort will provide marketing support 
for a period of one year in respect of each of the 
routes referred to in Annexure A.” 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 37 of 87 
 
And Annexure A can be found on page 36 of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 36? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     36 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Phiri the routes that are 
identified at page 36 which two routes did S A Express show a 
particular interest in? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:    S A Express Chair showed interest on 
the Zambia and the Zimbabwe so it was country number one and 
country number eight in the table. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you.  And then in line with 
your evidence of earlier which spoke about incentivisation offerings can 
I ask you to turn to page 30 please. Paragraph 11 talks particularly to 
the Preliminary Activities Fund, 11.1 speaks specifically to the fact that 
Dube Tradeport will advance an amount of 5million rand to be utilise for 
the Planning Development Marketing and Operations of the joint 
activities contemplated by the memorandum of understanding to be split 
between passenger and cargo activities.  Can you just explain it a little 
bit more detail exactly what this Preliminary Development Fund was 
and how was it contemplated at the time to operate? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair at the time the thinking was that 
due to the fact that it takes a bit of time to develop a route the 
incentive there from Dube Tradeport that they would assist us our S A 
Express in ensuring that the route was a success and in that regard 
they had formulated what they called incentives and these incentives 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 38 of 87 
 
came in a form of rebates but the rebates were defined in two ways.  
One was the market development the other was the assistance in 
operational costs.  Now in terms of the marketing costs it was clearly 
defined that these would be the costs that would be incurred by S A 
Express prior to the commencement of the route.  Ordinarily in the 
aviation industry that before your first flight you need to secure a 
opening of a flight in the system if I can put it that way, you open a 
flight in the system and allow it time to sell and that ordinarily would 
be, for regional routes would be about three months.  So you open the 
flight on the system, you go out to the market, sell it and of course 
10 
passengers would book on it with a view to fly in three months’ time 
and you continue that exercise until your first flight.  The reason of 
doing that is we always want to ensure that your first flight is a success 
otherwise if you only allow a few days then you would be heading for a 
disaster on your first flight.  So Dube Tradeport was happy to assist 
with the – those costs of marketing but also over and above that, they 
were also happy to incentivise S A Express by ensuring that they are 
giving us a rebate on the operating costs but bear in mind that those 
were only applicable for a period of one year, save for this three month 
period before we start a flight but the way it was structured was that S 
20 
A Express as an airline was to incur these costs and then claim from 
Dube Tradeport. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Before we talk about the incurring 
and 
claiming 
methodologies 
which 
is 
neatly 
captured 
in 
the 
memorandum of agreement can we perhaps then go there, just to set 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 39 of 87 
 
the context for what you’re about to inform? 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well let me just get the last point that you were 
making.  You were saying that S A Express would incur certain costs 
and claim those costs from Dube Tradeport and those costs would be 
covered under the Preliminary Activities Fund is that correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Alright. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct, so Chair the extent of 
the claim was estimated to be around 5million for both the route 
development as well as operations so it was capped at 5million. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Can I then ask you to please turn 
to page 38 of the bundle, 38.  Is that the memorandum of agreement 
concluded between Dube Tradeport and South African Express Airways 
following the memorandum of understanding? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Can I ask you to please turn to 
page 52 of the bundle. Noting from this page that this agreement was 
signed during May of 2012 whose signature appears on this page on 
behalf of South African Express? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     It’s my signature Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you.  On page 43 of the 
agreement, or sorry 43 of the bundle mention is made that this 
agreement is concluded for 12 months at paragraph 4 and in particular 
to the information that you were sharing with the Chair on the 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 40 of 87 
 
entitlement to claim and claim methodology I’d like us to look at 
paragraph – clause 5.  So clause 5 talks specifically to the regional 
route development and can I ask you to read into the record clause 5.2 
please. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Thank you Chair paragraph 5.2 on page 
43 of the bundle, I quote, 
 
“For a period of 12 months, after signature date and in respect 
 
of routes identified in Annexure A, which we have looked at 
 
DTP will contribute – DTP meaning Dube Tradeport will 
 
contribute to S A Express navigation costs for aircraft flying 
10 
 
into King Shaka International Airport on each route and also 
 
for the landing charges, parking costs and the aircraft handling 
 
charges incurred by S A Express, aircraft operating the routes 
 
specified in Annexure A again.  DTP’s contribution will take the 
 
form of financial rebates per specified aircraft flying the 
 
specified routes and will be limited to the actual costs referred 
 
to above for each aircraft landing at King Shaka International 
 
Airport calculated in accordance with the clause 5.3(b) of the 
 
agreement below”, 
 
Then it states what those would be. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And if I could then ask you to turn 
to page 44 in continuance of clause 5.3 paragraph 5.3 (b) 1, 2 and 3 
outlines very clear defined amounts that are claimable in respect of 
particular types of aircraft, is that correct?  
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 41 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Then could I ask you to read 
paragraph 5.4 into the record please. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     5.4 Chair clarifies how these claims will 
be made and for which specific items, 
 
“Dube Tradeport and S A Express will conclude addendum to 
 
this agreement to provide for each of the individual routes 
 
identified in Annexure A prior to commencement of the 
 
operation of those routes by S A Express. Each addendum will 
 
stipulate the actual rebate to be paid by Dube Tradeport and it 
 
will be calculated in accordance with the clause 5.3 (b) above.  
10 
 
The rebates set out in clause 5.3 (b) above are based on 2012 
 
regraded tariffs applied by ACSA and ATNS”, 
 
At this point in time Chair I just wanted to clarify because it 
talks about ACSA and ATNS but this costs basically relate to the 
landing and parking for ACSA and then the navigation specifically 
speaks to ATNS and these rates are regulated – gazetted rates, so the 
thinking then was that S A Express would pay these rates for landing, 
parking and the navigation in accordance with the gazetted rates and 
then on invoice they would then claim.  I just wanted to clarify that 
when they talk about ATNS and ACSA and it continues to say that, 
20 
 
“and such rebates will apply provided that in the event that 
 
these amounts are lawfully (indistinct) by ACSA and ATNS 
 
during their applicable period, the parties will provide for the 
 
permitted increases as to the regulatories in each addendum”. 
 
So it makes it very clear that in the event that there’s an 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 42 of 87 
 
increase in terms of the tariffs during the period where these rebates 
are applicable then there will be adjustment.  So in other words Dube 
Tradeport would have the opportunity to validate the amount that S A 
Express is claiming not only from the invoice but also checking it 
against the regulated tariffs.  So there was a double control from that 
point of view. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Then in summary the methodology 
of how this agreement applied to the incentivisation of the scheme 
based on the paragraphs that you read includes that S A Express is 
entitled to claim a specific amount which is calculated per aircraft, that 
10 
amount is regulated by tariffs which applies to both ACSA, for the 
record being Airports Company of South Africa and ATNS being Air 
Traffic Navigation Services. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     In addition the claim methodology 
is that S A Express pays and then claims back based on a checks and 
balances process. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you.  Now Mr Phiri while 
some of these terms are quite familiar to you can I ask that we unpack 
20 
some of these terms a bit so that – it’s going to be used further in your 
evidence as well.  Paragraph 5.2 on page 43 talks about a whole range 
of charges and costs and the like.  You mentioned also earlier about 
operating costs, can you please explain what exactly operating costs 
would include for an airline on a route? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 43 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Chair as an airline in order to 
discharge its responsibility of flying passengers from one point to 
another point and also cargo from one point to another point, you would 
need an aircraft first of all, you’d need crew both cockpit and the cabin 
crew and of course you’d need fuel, you’d need to ensure that meals 
are provided on-board and you have to ensure that the aircraft is clean, 
in other words the product that you are offering the passengers is in 
good shape.  So part of the operating costs have to do with the 
provision of the aircraft but over and above that, you’d also have to 
incur costs in terms of distribution of your inventory which is the sale of 
10 
the seats or space in terms of cargo and also the services that are 
rendered to passengers as they board the aircraft.  So in other words, 
I’m looking at having access to the airport because that – in the case of 
Dube Tradeport or Durban it’s the ACSA owned King Shaka Airport and 
they provide certain services of which they also charge for those 
services but also over and above that, we have, what we call, ground 
services.  Now ground services ordinarily would include passenger 
services, which is when you walk to the airport, for those of you who 
have flown would understand that when you walk into the airport the 
first thing that you do, you go to a check-in counter, that’s a service for 
20 
the passengers and sometimes you walk in and you’d like to change 
your flight so you go to passenger service desk where you can change 
your flights or book a new flight, whatever the case may be and of 
course after you’ve checked in, you walk through the security and you 
go inside and then you check-out but in terms of ground handling 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 44 of 87 
 
services, I think that’s when it really starts to kick in because as a 
passenger you have to get into a bus and you have to get to the aircraft 
and there are also certain services that are rendered to the aircraft for 
example the fuelling of the aircraft, the cleaning of the aircraft and 
providing the 
necessary 
equipment 
to 
allow safe 
boarding of 
passengers.  So all those services are categorised as ground handling 
services and there’s your costs attached to it.  So over and above the 
cost of the aircraft you have to add all these costs and you would 
normally classify them as operating costs but basically it’s a cost of 
operating an aircraft. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you, if I could then ask you 
to…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     I didn’t say when we would take the tea break since 
we started earlier than normal, we’ll take it at half past nine just in 
case there may be people attending who might not be aware we are not 
going to sit the whole day today, we’ll adjourn at 11 and then tomorrow 
we will not start at normal time we hope to start around 12 o’clock so 
just so that people can plan their lives appropriately, yes thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you Chair.  Pursuant to the 
memorandum of agreement it was mentioned in there that certain – 
20 
more substantive agreements need to be concluded in respect of each 
route and those were in fact concluded, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Can I ask you to turn to page 55 
please of the bundle.  55 appears to be the addendum which was 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 45 of 87 
 
concluded in respect of the King Shaka/Lusaka route, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you and just to focus then 
on the particular costings which form part of the incentivisation 
scheme, if I could ask you to turn to page 56, paragraph 4 – sorry 
clause 4, 4.1 which specifically deals with preliminary activity costs 
that were contemplated in the previous memoranda, Dube Tradeport will 
contribute to the preliminary activity costs for the launch of the route to 
a maximum of R500 000 and that is as compared to the 5million rand 
originally contemplated in the memoranda, is that right? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct but Chair I must also 
emphasise that the R500 000 is just part of the 5billion that was 
contemplated in the memorandum agreement, bearing in mind that the 
5billion was for both.  The marketing as well as the rebates on the 
operations so those two items were separated so this is specifically 
talking to the marketing part of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay, alright I suspect that at certain stages your 
voice goes down, it may be that some of the people at the back might 
not hear you when it goes down, try and maintain it at the higher level, 
okay thank you. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Chair I note that we are on one 
minute to half past, may it be a convenient time now? 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes let’s take the tea break and we’ll resume at 
quarter to ten, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNED 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 46 of 87 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Phiri we were talking about the 
addendum that starts on page 55 in relation to the King Shaka and 
Lusaka route.  Just on that score to follow up on the evidence that you 
gave earlier you were no longer at SA Express at the time that these 
addenda were then concluded, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And when you departed who did you 
hand the department – sorry – the Dube TradePort project over to? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It was handed over Chair to Mr Brian Van 
Wyk. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And which role did he take? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  At that point Brian Van Wyk was the 
general manager commercial. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  If I could then ask you to 
turn to page 58 which is the signature page of this particular addenda – 
addendum.  Whose name appears for and on behalf of South African 
Express having signed on the 22 November 2012? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair it is Mr Brian Van Wyk. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In particular it is noted GM 
Commercial below that, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is right Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then resume where we 
had left off before the short adjournment and that is on page 56.  For 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 47 of 87 
 
the record paragraph 4.2 specifically talks to the preliminary activity 
costs will be drawn from the preliminary activities fund and will be 
utilised for route launch and marketing activities in advance of the 
commencement of the operation of the route, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then paragraph – sorry I keep on 
referring to them as paragraph – clauses – clause 5 on page 57 speaks 
specifically to flight incentive costs.   
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Sorry can you repeat that Chair? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 57 clause 5 talks to the flight 
10 
incentive costs that were offered in respect of this route. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Having considered the detail and 
particularly having been looked at the comparative analysis between 
these agreements and the North West agreements it is recorded here 
that the ratings, the charges and the tariffs for the entitlements to claim 
are similar to as outlined in the memoranda but we can look at that on 
page 59 and 60 which details the charges that they were entitled to 
claim.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Your sentence is not complete.  Your question is not 
20 
complete.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You started it and then… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you changed your mind about what to say 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 48 of 87 
 
midway so… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just ask the question again it is not complete. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Humble apologies Chair.  Paragraph 
5 outlines the flight incentive costs.  That is on page 57.   
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Having considered this particular 
clause does it accord with the agreement set out in the memorandum of 
agreement in relation to flight incentive costs, the payment of it and the 
calculation of it? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes it does agree Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that regard can we then turn to 
page 59 where at annexure A it sets out the costing schedule.  Part B 
talks to the flight incentive costs and on the next page they give the 
detail of costs, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you clarify exactly what the 
amount of 14 079.11 means in the context of this particular addendum?  
That sum is the cost per trip as found on page 59 of the bundle. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Page 59 are you making reference to the 
20 
flight incentive costs? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes so page 59 part B talks to flight 
incentive costs.  There is a rebate in relation to a CRJ200 aircraft and 
the cost per trip for 14 079.11, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is right. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 49 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  And if you then turn the page 
to page 60 you will see that that cost accords with the total reflected at 
the bottom of that page? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how that amount is calculated is 
outlined in the table on page 60, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now when you look at the detail of 
these different types of costings in the centre of the page is called 
ground handling, right? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For purposes of the record can you 
just clarify exactly which costs listed in here would all form part of 
ground handling? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Okay.  Thank you.  As I had indicated 
earlier that ground handling is normally used as a generic term in its 
totality.  Meaning that it is all the services that are offered from 
passenger check-in all the way to when the aircraft is actually 
boarding.  Now ordinarily the passenger services rendered by the 
20 
airline that is operating but in some instances the airlines may opt to 
use other service providers to do the passenger handling so that is why 
again for those people who have flown sometimes you are flying on 
SAA but you see that the check-in agents have got nothing to do with 
SAA it is possibly a British Airways for example or the service provider 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 50 of 87 
 
that has been appointed by the airports company.  So that service could 
be done by either the airline or a third party.  Now if you move the 
passenger all the way to the ground where you basically are walking 
from the boarding gate the services that are offered from then onto the 
aircraft are also done by third parties. But I must also explain that I 
think which you would possibly touch on as we go through the 
testimony that the service providers for ground handling for airports or 
ACSA managed airports are licenced by ACSA and these service 
providers have to be compliant with what we call IATA which is the 
International Aviation Transport Association and they also have to be 
10 
compliant with the ICEL which is the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation.  This is the [indistinct] body.  So ACSA has a 
responsibility of identifying these service providers who then get 
licenced and as long as they are compliant with the IDA standards and 
IKEA standards.  Now airlines ordinarily would only confine the 
selection of a service provider from this suite of service providers who 
are licenced by in this case ACSA.  So you are confined to those 
service providers.  And these are the services providers that offer the 
ground handling services.  But as I said that sometimes we with ground 
handling can be confusing because the scope can be expanded and it 
20 
can be shrunk.  So the true services that are offered under ground 
handling agreement are defined in specific agreements because the 
scope can be widened and it can be shortened and as long as the 
minimum services are being offered and you have what we call the 
standard IATA ground handling agreement.  It is a template that we use 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 51 of 87 
 
but you vary it depending on the scope of the services that you are 
contracting to.  So this ground handling services although they have 
got [indistinct] they have to be defined in the actual contract.  What is 
it that you are paying for and what are the rates and then based on that 
you have your service level agreement with the service provider.  But 
as I said that these service providers have to be IATA and IKEO 
certified.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so if you look at page 60 is it 
correct then that ground handling services would include all the 
additional adhoc items listed there which should be aircraft towing, 
10 
pushback, passenger assist unit which is for the acronym PAU, 
wheelchair, first bus, second bus, air starter unit and ground power unit 
which is the – for the acronym GPU. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be correct to simply say that ground handling 
really that business – that part of the business relates to everything 
that needs to be done on the ground before and up to the time when the 
passenger and his or her luggage get onto the aircraft and after the 
passenger leaves the aircraft up to when she leaves the airport 
20 
building.  That is what all the activities connected with the travelling of 
a passenger who is flying or who has been flying.  All that happens to 
enable her or him to fly that happens on the ground up to the time when 
he or she gets onto the plan and his or her luggage gets onto the plane 
and when he or she has landed on the other and her leaving the 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 52 of 87 
 
aircraft, going to the airport building, being able to collect his or her 
luggage that is all ground handling. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair I did not understand your last bit.  I 
understood your first bit about how [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the second bit is when you leave the aircraft at 
your destination you leave the aircraft from that point and your luggage 
being taken out of the aircraft up to the time you get out of the airport 
building.  Whatever activities need to be done to enable you to leave 
the airport building that is part of aircraft – ground handling? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair it is actually a very smart way of 
10 
defining ground services.  It is well understood Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm.  Yes ja, ja.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Whilst we have 
now identified what the flight incentive costs would be it is recorded in 
clause 6 on page 57 that payment will be done in arrears.  So once 
again you have SA Express that incurs the cost and then claims back 
from Dube TradePort, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If we could then turn to page 
63 of the bundle.  And this is an addendum which was also concluded in 
20 
respect of the same route being King Shaka International Airport and 
Lusaka route and it was a follow up after the first addendum expired, is 
that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If I could ask you to once 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 53 of 87 
 
again just confirm that the payment structure in relation to this 
addendum was no different to the first addendum that was concluded? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if one looks particularly at page 
65 paragraph 4.2 – sorry paragraph – I mean sorry clause 4.  Is it 
correct that there is no mention that is made of preliminary activity 
costs in here? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  And one of them main objects 
of preliminary costs related to route marketing and development. 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then turn to page 66.  For 
SA Express do you recognise any signatures that were appended on the 
7 August 2013? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair this was signed by the then CEO of 
SA Express again [indistinct] SA Express Inati Ntshanga and as a 
witness it was signed by Brian Van Wyk and Ms Thandi Kunene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So under witnesses the first signature is that of Mr 
Van Wyk and the second one is that of Ms Thandi Kunene, is that what 
you are saying? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I could not hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I must raise my voice. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I forgot. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 54 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first witness in relation to the signature or 
signatory of SA Express. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the signature for Mr Van Wyk?  The first 
signature as a witness? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja Chair on the witness side it is 
definitely that is the signature for Mr Brian Van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the second witness’ signature you say is 
that of Ms Thandi Kunene? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the signatory the one who signed for SA 
Express you say that signature is that of Mr Ntshanga? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  And then if you 
turn to page 67 at which annexure A and the costing schedule is 
reflected page 68 once again refers to an itemised costings cost 
process or not process sorry – an itemised claim in respect of different 
types of costs, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  That then concludes the 
addenda in relation to the first route.  If we could turn then to page 60 
– apologies page 70.  It is an addendum which is dated November 2013 
and it specifically relates to the King Shaka Harare route as concluded 
between Dube TradePort and South African Express.   
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 55 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Once again if I can ask you to turn to 
page 73.  Do you recognise any of the signatures who signed on behalf 
of SA Express during November of 2013? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I recognise Brian Van Wyk’s signature 
representing SA Express. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And then just to place 
this particular document into context.  On page 71 para – clause… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that you recognise any of the 
signatures who witnessed – who signed as witnesses against Mr Van 
10 
Wyk’s signature? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Witness number 1 is Ms Thandi Kunene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But I cannot recognise witness number 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the second one okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  To put this particular 
addendum into context on page 71 clause 3.1C records that this 
particular addendum supersedes the first addendum which we do not 
have before us.  And on page 72 like with the second addendum in 
respect of the other route there appears to be a similar process on the 
20 
flight incentivisation costs and the process of claiming, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In particular at para – in clause 5.1 
once again it is outlined that the payment methodology is such that SA 
Express incurs the debt and then claims the amount back from Dube 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 56 of 87 
 
TradePort? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now these particular amounts that 
have been recorded in the annexures to the addenda would they be 
contemplated to cover all of the costs for the operation of these routes 
or only part of the costs? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair the incentives were classified as 
rebates and by the very nature they did not cover the entire flight 
costs.  It is partial recovery of those costs because if you look at the 
total flight costs or operation costs compared to the rebates they cover 
10 
in our thinking then about 5 to 10% of the operating costs of an 
[indistinct].  So it was in a true sense a rebate but also it defined how 
those rebates were going to be paid so it was not done upfront but it 
was done in arrears.  So in other words SA Express had to prove that 
those were paid and in some cases in terms of the ACSA and the ATNS 
charges those had to be compared to the tariffs so there was an 
external verification that had to be done and only when those two tests 
have been passed would Dube TradePort then pay the rebate to SA 
Express. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Then in summary of 
20 
these particular agreements the common thread between the Dube 
TradePort agreements and please correct me if I am wrong is that on 
the one hand you have a preliminary activities fund from which certain 
costings can be claimed, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 57 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Part of those claims which should be 
a claim entitlement would be flight incentive costs? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And these flight incentive costs in 
particular were cost contributions that were calculated on clear public 
tariffs? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Published tariffs sorry. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Gazetted Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Published gazetted tariffs.  The claim 
10 
process for how these claims are to take place are clearly outlined. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The payment entitlement is payment 
in arrears. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so the flight incentive costs 
essentially because of the itemised claims computes to a maximum 
amount that may be claimable in relation to a specific type of costs or 
relative to a specific type of aircraft, is that correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so in so doing the flight 
incentive costs are also based on actual flights and it is also based on 
qualifying flight costs as we have dealt with through the different 
agreements. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 58 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I can then ask you to now turn to 
page 12 of your affidavit.  Paragraph 44 talks about monies that SA 
Express in fact claimed during the year of 2014 and in particular it is 
listed that out of the total of 3 882 984,27 that total form – includes 
costs relating to landing, parking, packs handling, presumably 
passenger handling and ramp handling or aircraft handling.  Is that 
correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was the total sum that was 
claimed over a twelve month period during 2014? 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Are there any costings there that are 
excluded from operations costs that may have been claimed? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair there was an element of navigation 
costs which was claimable which is hardly less than 1 million which 
means that the figure of 3.8 should actually read 4.8.  Bearing in mind 
that if go back to the MOA it does place a limit of how much you can 
claim in a year which was 5 million.  So the claimable amount was 
close to the figure of 5 million limit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you say that this R3.8 million I am just 
rounding if off you still need to add another R1 million to it and that 
would be the costs.  So they have not taken into account another 
amount 
of 
about 
R1 
million? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 59 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair and  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That cost element is the navigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that total cost then of 4.8 would 
really constitute a contribution towards the total cost of operation on 
these particular routes, is that correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Having concluded… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry would that be a contribution or would that 
10 
be all the operational costs that would be claimable from that amount of 
R5 million? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair you must remember that the costs 
elements that were claimable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That clearly defined in the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Now this claim in line with the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Falls within the budget for that.  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And I am just drawing to your attention 
20 
that the total that has been claimed… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Is then close to the 5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That was provided for. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 60 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  In a fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  So the total claimable amount is close to 
the 5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Limit that was set. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  By both parties. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  If I could ask you 
10 
to turn to page 88 of your bundle.  There appears to be some gazetted 
publications.  Are these in fact the rates that you have provided which 
were relevant for purposes of the rebates during that particular period? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  These were just to demonstrate the tariffs 
or the gazetted tariffs that were utilised in calculating the ACSA and the 
ATNS charges.  So I am – I was just providing this to ensure that 
indeed the claims that were made against Dube TradePort were in 
accordance with the agreement but in any case Dube TradePort was 
within its rights to ensure that before they refund or before they pass 
on the rebate that the rates that were appearing in the invoices are in 
20 
line with the gazetted tariffs. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If we can now then turn to the 
North West’s suite of agreements which have already been traversed 
through the evidence of Mr Ngwenya of yesterday.  Based on that 
evidence we do not intend to go into particular detail as it has already 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 61 of 87 
 
been addressed yesterday.  Could I ask you to turn to page 107 
please?  Do you recognise this document as you have considered it? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what is it? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  This is what is referred to the main 
agreement between the North West Department of Community Safety 
and Transport Management which for the purposes of this agreement is 
reflect the department and the South African Express Airways SOC 
Limited. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And it is correct that this 
10 
agreement was the foundation or rather the contractual foundation 
which reintroduced an air transportation service from OR Tambo 
International airport, Cape Town International airport, Pilanesberg and 
Mafikeng? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in particular the agreement was 
concluded on the basis of subsidy being given by the North West 
government to South African Express? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 144 
20 
please.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  144. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In line with your signature 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 62 of 87 
 
identifications of earlier can you please identify who signed this 
agreement on behalf of SA Express? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair the – the signature that appear on 
this agreement of the then CEO of SA Express Inati Ntshanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the first signature on the page?  Is that the 
first signature on the page? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is the signature that you say belongs to 
Mr Ntshanga the first one … 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this page? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I just want to … 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  So he signed for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want you to identify … 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Oh, I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one is whose signature and which one is 
whose signature. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Okay, thank you – thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  The first signature in the first row where 
it the file is signed for on behalf of SA Express is that of Inati Ntshanga 
who is the – who was the CEO at the time of SA Express and then as a 
witness it was signed by Brian van Wyk but it seems to me that both 
signatures are not dated. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 63 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Noting that Brian van … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Both signatures are not …? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Dated.  There is no date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Based 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
Mr Brian van Wyk had witnessed this agreement and has also in one or 
other capacity been involved in the conclusion of the addenda between 
Dube TradePort and South African Express. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would it be fair to understand that 
10 
Mr Brian van Wyk was familiar with the agreements or rather the 
addenda under the Dude TradePort Project and this particular 
agreement? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair.  I must also state 
Chair that he – I mean – these signatures for the three addenda for the 
Dube TradePort/(indistinct) and the – on this main agreement North 
West and SA Express Brian van Wyk signed them as a General Manager 
for Commercial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who was the owner according to your 
20 
knowledge of the Pilanesberg and Mafikeng Airports? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI: 
 
Chair 
the 
North 
West 
Provincial 
Government owns the two airports. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If we can then look at page 14 
of the bundle and just to confirm evidence that was – rather 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 64 of 87 
 
submissions and evidence that was presented yesterday in relation to 
the agreement Chair. 
This contract was indeed for a period of five years which was 
from the effective date and the effective date is reckoned on page 1-1-0 
of the bundle to mean 27 March 2015 in respect of certain routes and 
1 May 2015 in respect of the other and SA Express in particular agreed 
to operate the two airports using the CRJ200 Aircraft and in doing so to 
provide crew distribution sales and airline operational infrastructure. 
Mr Phiri when we look at then paragraph - sorry – page 1-1-5 
to focus in on this contribution of costings in order for us to compare 
10 
the apples with apples scenario between Dube TradePort and the North 
West Suites of Agreements.  So page 1-1-5 paragraph – Clause 4.3 
talks to: 
“That as a contribution towards the cost of SA 
Express 
in 
providing 
the 
airline 
service 
the 
department shall grant to SA Express the subsidy 
as more fully described in Clause 6.” 
And Clause 6 in particular is reflected on the next page on 
page 1-1-6.  Clause 6.1 records that: 
“The department shall pay to SA Express the 
20 
subsidy 
and 
the 
management 
company 
the 
operational costs of both airports annually in 
advance the amount stipulated in Annexure A.” 
Which can be found at page 1-4-5 and hopefully Chair this is 
a bit of a clearer copy to the one that you had yesterday. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 65 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 1-4-5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it is much better. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just for the record then Mr Phiri you 
are at page 1-4-5? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There appears to be a series of 
subsidies.  The first relates to a concession.  The second relates to 
route marketing and the last relates to operations costs.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And these subsidies are in relation to 
the two airports.  One being Pilanesberg and the other one being 
Mafikeng. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please explain to the Chair what 
operations costs – sorry – let us start from the top.  What concession 
as an airline subsidy could be possibly mean or relate to? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair the airline subsidy would relate to 
costs that would have ordinarily be incurred by SA Express in extending 
its services to the two airports – Pilanesberg and the Mafikeng Airport 
20 
and those costs would be subsidised accordingly.  So it is being 
referred to as an airline subsidy. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and then the next category of 
costs 
is called the 
route 
marketing subsidy.  
What 
is your 
understanding of the route marketing subsidy? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 66 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  The marketing subsidy Chair would be 
making reference to the cost to the airline in developing the route.  As I 
previously said that in the case of Dube TradePort it was the – the 
three month period before the commencement of the first flight but 
obviously in this regard they are talking about the route development in 
its entirety.  That they evenly post the launch of the first flight. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So just to – to amplify on what you 
said.  Under the Dube TradePort you spoke … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just one second.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To amplify or clarify what you said.  
10 
Under the Dube TradePort it was contemplated that you are looking at 
about a three month period before the launch of the first flight that you 
would need to invest for purposes of marketing that particular new 
route.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But in this particular instance there 
is a subsidy which is granted over a five year period? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How long does it normally taken then 
to have a new route fully functional and fully operational as part of 
20 
ordinary routes? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  As I had indicated the preliminary 
marketing costs would mean that the costs that you have incurred in 
marketing a flight before its first – first flight but the assumption again 
is that in a period of a year or two that you may be making losses on 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 67 of 87 
 
the route before you start making money. 
So route development could actually extend to a year within 
which you turn around a route to be profitable but certainly it cannot be 
for a period of five years.  Generally in the aviation industry one year 
would be enough to ensure that the route is profitable. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then if one were to look at the 
actual route marketing subsidy that was allocated to Pilanesberg and to 
Mafikeng respectively in year one.  It was an approximate amount of 
14. – 14.6 to 14.8 million.  In year two it was 4.8 million.  In year three 
it was 4.5 million. 
10 
In year four it was 4.5 million and in year five it was also 4.5 
million.  Do you have any comments to the costings or rather to the 
subsidies that have been granted over this five year period in relation 
to route marketing in particular? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Save for the comments that I have 
already made Chair that ordinarily in the aviation industry one year 
should be enough to develop a route to a profitable situation.  I do 
believe that firstly extending it for five years is I would call an outlier.  
It is not common in the industry but secondly the quantum in year one 
just looks a bit excessive to develop a route in - in year one. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If you could … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did say earlier on in your evidence that when an 
airline starts a new route or starts on a route that it has not been – or 
starts a new route I think you said.  That the first two years it would not 
make profit.  You did not say that? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 68 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  There is documental evidence Chair and 
also there will be documental evidence stating in the industry for 
additional carrier how much has it spent to develop a route but of 
course I mean that is subject to confidentiality because that information 
cannot just be shared with the public.  I think our competitors would be 
quite excited to – to get that information.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no I - I do not necessarily want that 
information.  I just want to check whether I had – I might have 
misunderstand your evidence.  I thought earlier on – much earlier – 
thought you had said that if an airline starts a new route … 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first two or so years it should not expect profits.  
So I am just checking whether that is not what you said earlier. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair I was talking that generally if you 
are starting a new route it should take you a year or two to turn it 
around into a profitable situation but for a typical regional carrier we 
aim for a year … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But I am just talking about in generality.  
It can take you one to two years to turn it around … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But in the case of regional carriers we 
basically plan for a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The last category of costs is termed 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 69 of 87 
 
operations costs and for each of the two routes an amount is allocated 
to each of those routes at 11 million for each of years one to five.  Is 
that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now how does operations costs 
compare to the concessions that is referred to above in this table? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair I think this is where I was a bit 
confused because the – Annexure A the way it is broken down the – 
what they call a subsidy and the – and the concession.  It does not 
particular tie to the way the agreement was actually structured.  That is 
10 
one but the secondly it seems to me that there is a duplication because 
if you look at the – the (indistinct) where it says concession and a 
subsidy my impression was that it will have covered what they call 
operations costs. 
So it seems to me that there was some sort of indulgence and 
repetition which is worrying just looking at the agreement in the context 
of this Annexure A and the way they are broken down the – the 
subsidies.  One, it looks excessive but two, it seems as if there is a 
duplication of what they define as a subsidy or a rebate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In your experience how would these 
costs compare to the average cost of operating a CRJ200 Aircraft 50 
seater? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair whilst I cannot comment on a 
specific aircraft type because as I say that it is almost like it is 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 70 of 87 
 
privileged information but I can talk in general terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  General ja. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  If you – if an airline is operating a 
regional jet – an appropriate regional jet for Johannesburg to Mafikeng 
or to Pilanesberg.  It should cost in the region of 50 to 60 000 per trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many – how many thousands? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  50 000 to 60 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, per trip? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Per trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Now if we – we extend that to three 
flights a week for the entire year it comes to close to between 12 and 
14 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Total costs, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  If you have to cut it for three frequencies 
a week … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  And operating either to Pilanesberg or to 
Mmabatho … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  From Johannesburg. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 71 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It tends to double. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  If you are looking at Cape Town … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  To – to Pilanesberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  It would typically possibly be between 22 
million or 25 million per annum.  That is the total cost of operating … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  The aircraft type for Pilanesberg and 
Mafikeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just to excuse my ignorance what 
exactly is a frequency? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he said three times a week. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Frequency is the return leg.  So what I 
have done is the cost of operating a trip and a trip is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A return trip? 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja, it is a return trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A return trip, three times a week you said or not?  A 
return trip three times a week or …? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja, it is a return trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 72 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Three times a week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That would cost you about 11 to 14 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  But that also I mean the 14 would 
basically talk to four frequencies.  So 11 million you are talking about 
three frequencies.  14 million you would be talking to about four 
frequencies.  So that would be basically the range … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That the – approximately that he would 
10 
be incurring … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  As an airline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those costs that you are talking about in general 
you are talking about what it would cost today as opposed to that time? 
What are you having in mind?  Are you having in mind some time back 
or at the moment? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  We are talking about the – at time – at 
the time when the operation  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Was active. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  So it is not at today’s … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Rates Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 73 of 87 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so the numbers that you are 
given are really operations costs.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Ja.  The operations costs which includes 
the list of your expenses that I have spoken about which is the cost of 
the aircraft which if you are own it then it is depreciation.  If you lease 
it – it is the lease costs.  The cost of the crew with pilots and the cabin 
crew.  The cost of fuelling the aircraft. 
The cost of providing meals to the passengers and all other 
10 
costs which (indistinct) and the handling charges which also includes 
accidental charges as add in.  So it is the cost of operating to and from 
the relevant airports. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the costings that you have given 
then would that include ground handling costs? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now if you were to look at this table 
again it is subdivided into two levels.  The first relates to the airline.  
The second relates to the management company.  Effectively on the 
average costing that you have given which ranges between 12 to 
20 
possibly even early 20 million per annum the management company 
subsidy is aggregated to 11 million over the – over the five year period 
whilst the concession applying to the airline which is SA Express in this 
instance ranges between 11 million to 30 – to 34 million over the – over 
the full period.  Is that right? 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 74 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So effectively the subsidy that has 
been provided here would you say that it would be a partial rebate to 
the incurring of costs or could it amount to more? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair as I said that the – the amounts 
seem to be quite excessive from my experience and from my knowledge 
in the industry.  In this case I can categorically state that these 
amounts were basically overstated. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 16 
- 1-6 - of the bundle and having considered then the four ground 
10 
handling agreements the first being commonly referred to as the 
PAMCO Agreement concluded with Pilanesberg Airport Management 
Company. 
The second being with MAMCO being the Mafikeng Airport 
Management Company.  The third being Valoteck Facilities Management 
CC and the Koreneka Event Manager or rather the agreement 
concluded with Koreneka Event Manager trading as Koreneka Trading 
and Projects.  You have considered all of these four ground handling 
agreements.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair just for the record these 
agreements appear from Annexures 8.1 to 8.4 of the bundle.  This table 
represents your consolidated analysis of the services that were 
contracted from each of the service providers.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 75 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in particular the services that 
you have identified which were contracted by each of them following 
the correction that you have made was airport management … 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Passenger 
handling, 
ramp 
handling/aircraft handling and route development or marketing.  Is that 
right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thanks to the – thanks to your 
assistance to the Commission you have also provided a – an agreement 
10 
between SAA and SA Express in relation to passenger handling at the 
King Shaka International Airport.  Is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
that 
particular 
agreement 
appears at Tab 9 from page 2-6-3.  Whilst certain agreements between 
ourselves and SAA have resulted in redactions to annexures to this 
agreement based on your personal knowledge is it correct that the 
rates that are charged in particular to passenger handling at the 
different airports are charged at rates per different types of aircraft? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so there is a clear table although 
that particular detail is not placed before the Commission due to 
redactions but there is a clear table that is incorporated in respect of 
each airport under the annexures to this agreement which clearly 
identifies set costs as opposed to a globular amount. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 76 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thanks to your assistance as well if I 
could ask you to turn to page 17 – 1-7 – you have also provided us with 
– rather you have provided the Commission with the Standard Ground 
Handling Agreement concluded between SA Express and Menzies 
Aviation? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That particular agreement appears 
from page 3-0-7 of the bundle.  If I could ask you quickly to turn to 
page 3-1-2 – sorry.  Sorry – it is 3-0-9.  I am getting my numbers 
10 
confused.  You have provided this particular agreement to look at the 
basis of rates payable specific – specific to ramp handling.  Is that 
correct? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so as appears on page 3-0-9 
once again you have ramp handling costs which are rated according to 
particular types of aircraft. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it therefore correct that in terms of 
the two agreements – additional agreements that you have provided the 
20 
one being the ground handling concluded between SAA and SA 
Express.  The other one being between SA Express and Menzies that 
the very basis for claiming is a rate that is clearly defined specific to a 
type of aircraft? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 77 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How does – how does this pricing 
formula compare to the ground handling agreements as you have dealt 
with in the table which appears on page 16 such being the MAMCO, 
PAMCO, Koreneka and Valoteck? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Chair before I respond to that question if 
you could just indulge me for a second because I just want to explain 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Context of the SAA Contract versus 
Menzies. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  I would like to go back to the issue about 
services … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:  Just to allay the confusion.  Passenger 
handling 
at 
the 
King 
Shaka 
International 
Airport 
had 
been 
subcontracted to SAA.  So we do not do our own handling in - in 
Durban at that point in time but secondly we had to also contract with 
Menzies on what we call the airside or on ramp – sorry – on ramp 
services but what I must emphasise just in terms of the rates is that the 
20 
ACSA identifies licence to service providers from which an airline can 
opt to contract with and in the case of SA Express like another SOC 
you go through an open tender process. 
So although you are confined to the licencing service 
providers but you are obliged as per a process to go out on a confined 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 78 of 87 
 
tender and of course you evaluate the bids or the proposals on the 
basis of certain criteria.  One of which is basically the rates.  So when 
we look at awarding such services it is basically done on a competitive 
basis although it is confined to those that have been licenced by – by 
ACSA. 
So my point is that the rates that you are seeing here are fair rates 
based on a process that we had to follow.  So in response to the 
question that (indistinct) has posed in terms of these rates compared to 
the North West.  It is actually quite difficult to compare from the point 
of view that I don’t think any process had been followed, the service 
10 
provider was just appointed possibly without following a RFP process.  
So we would never know whether they were fair or not fair but again if 
– I just look at the rates in the context of the subsidies, they seem to 
be quite odd and excessive. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you, if I can now ask you to 
please turn to page 19 of the bundle, because in as much as you 
compare the Dube Tradeport’s suite of agreements with the North 
West’s suite of agreements you’ve amplified certain aspects to the 
claim and payment methodologies specific to passenger handling on the 
S A Express handling agreement, ramp handling agreement in relation 
20 
to the S A Express and the Menzi’s agreement and then what you also 
then do, is that you now deal with marketing spend of S A Express 
generally.  If you could keep your finger on this particular page and 
open to page 145 which is the annexure to the main agreement, that 
details the different subsidies.  So at page 19 – so keep page 19 open 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 79 of 87 
 
but also keep page 145 open, so at page 19 you detail then the 
marketing spend of S A Express as it’s recorded in the management 
accounts which, just for the record, is attached as Annexure 11 Chair 
that appears from page 349.  Can I ask you to just place on record the 
annual marketing spend for the financial years of 2014/2015. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:    The marketing spend Chair for 
2014/2015 and the financial year basically ran from the 1 s t of April to 
end of March.  S A Express had spent 1.9million, in the following year 
2015/2016 it had spent 1.03million and in 2016/2017 it had spent 
7.4million and in 2017/2018 7.9million or 7.8million. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Is it correct that the financials for 
S A Express has in fact been audited, signed off but not yet released? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     For…(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     For the financial years of 
2018/2019. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     For the financial year 2018/2019 yes 
they have been signed off by the auditor but they are not in public 
domain yet, they have to go through the process, through our 
shareholder and then the cabinet.  So I won’t think that for the purpose 
of the testimony those should be set aside from the point of view that 
20 
these 2018/2019 financials are not in the public domain Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why is there such a big difference between 2015 and 
2016 on the one hand and 2017 and 2018 on the other hand?    
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Chair I’ve missed you there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?   
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 80 of 87 
 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     I couldn’t hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay why is there such a big difference on 2015 
– what was spent in 2015 and 2016 on the one hand on what was spent 
in 2017 and 2018? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Chair I’m not sure what actually 
happened…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     But can you see what I see? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     There is actually a difference – a spike 
for the two years, there is definitely a spike but I’m not sure Chair what 
happened that there is an additional 6million in each of those years. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     I mean 2015 and 2016 are one comma something 
and – well 2015 is almost two million because 1.9million, 2016 is 
1.03million but then 2017 is 7.4million and 2018 is 7.9million it’s 
difficult to think it could be inflation related. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     No – because I mean Chair the 
increase is, I think quite a huge spike so there’s no way it could be 
inflation. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, yes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     But falling short of having to give that 
level of detail I’m just surmising that it’s (indistinct) North West that it 
20 
happened so it could have been but I’m just supposing but I would need 
to check whether that’s even correct, there’s an additional 6milliion in 
each of them, it’s almost like a spike that is unique to the two years, so 
I’m just suspecting that there could have been an activity that 
happened in those two years and I’m just assuming that it could have 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 81 of 87 
 
been something to do with the North West, I’m not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja well – and then 2018/2019 there is that 534 
there that’s because it’s incomplete it doesn’t reach a million rand yet 
because that’s an incomplete year or what? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:     2018/2019 you have got R534 000, is that right? 
MR 
ARSON 
MALOLA-PHIRI: 
 
 
 
 
That’s 
correct 
and 
that’s 
the…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     And that’s because that’s not final, that’s not the 
final figure. 
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay, no that’s fine thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you Chair.  This market 
spend, does it relate to existing routes or does it include new routes as 
well? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Chair if I take you back to paragraph 
70.1, financial year 2014/2015 where an amount of near 2million was 
spent in marketing.  During that year S A Express had introduced three 
additional 
routes 
namely, 
Johannesburg/Pietermaritzburg, 
Johannesburg/Kruger 
National 
Park, 
Mpumalanga 
and 
Cape 
20 
Town/Kimberley.  So that 1.9 or near 2million does include route 
development of these three routes and the reason why I’m mentioning 
is specifically is I’m trying to put a context to the reasonableness of 
route development of the two North West Airports or routes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes thank you.  
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 82 of 87 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     And on your reasonableness point 
can we then turn to page 145, while keeping your finger still at page 
19, the spend for the financial year 2014/2015 was 1.9million and that 
included existing and three additional routes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     As compared to the route 
marketing subsidy for the two new routes which for, in year one, 
totalled approximately 28million, year two 9million, year three, four and 
five also 9million.  One last point then and that is in relation to the new 
route that you – that S A Express launched during December of 2018 
10 
can you please provide the Chair with an overview as to the – without 
necessarily having to mention any detail because the price sensitivities 
have been redacted and doesn’t form part of this Commission, but can 
you just give a brief overview to the Chair in relation to the market 
spend on the new route launched during December 2018 as compared 
to the costings of these subsidies as well. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     In December Chair we had introduced 
the Johannesburg/Mthatha route in the Eastern Cape Province and we 
spent in the region of R100 000 in terms of marketing and the 
development of that route and that route is actually performing quite 
20 
well just in six months and it’s one of the routes that believe that we 
will be able to turn it around or get it to a profitable level within the 12 
months that I was making reference to, we spent R100 000 in marketing 
in developing the route and again, I think that should have been done 
in the context of the excessiveness or the reasonableness of the 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 83 of 87 
 
amount of money that are being spent on the route as far as Pilansberg 
and the Mafikeng Airports are concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Chair before I close in all fairness 
to this witness, he wasn’t provided with a copy of Annexure 1 to the 
Koreneka agreement which has been presented as part of Mr 
Ngwenya’s evidence yesterday but he has just briefly looked at it this 
morning.  On that particular Annexure, having looked at it quite briefly 
this morning, does it change your position in relation to the costings on 
the ground handling agreements?  
10 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     No Chair actually it doesn’t I think it 
just puts duress to the testimony that was delivered yesterday that the 
main agreement stipulated exactly the issues that need to qualify for 
rebates or what they call concessions and the subsequent agreement 
does have that Annexure which I did not have a copy of until this 
morning that basically looks at the service and the rates, which don’t 
talk to the subsidies that are captured in the main agreement because 
those amounts are quite insignificant compared to the millions that are 
being defined as rebates in the main agreement.  So my position still 
remains that the rebates and the concessions or subsidies are quite 
20 
excessive with the North West Province project. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Then just to summarise some of 
the observations that you’ve given through your evidence on the North 
West agreements, as compared to the clear parameters of claim 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 84 of 87 
 
entitlements and payment processes reconciled in, under the Dube 
Tradeport suite of agreements, is it correct that the North West suite of 
agreements which comprises of your main agreements and then the 
four ground handling agreements which were effective at some or other 
stage, dealt with advancing a subsidy to S A Express, is that right? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     And that particular subsidy related 
to a subsidy provided to S A Express and also to management company 
whichever it may have been at any particular point in time. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     And the management company’s 
subsidy was split between route marketing and operating costs. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:    That’s correct.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     And in particular as compared to 
the arrear payment methodology under the Dube Tradeport agreement 
this particular subsidy was paid in advance before any work would have 
taken place, likely, within that particular financial year. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     What are your concluding 
observations when looking at the Dube Tradeport contract, structure 
20 
and management as compared to the North West Contract – the North 
West suite of agreements, contracts, structure and management? 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     Chair I can look at the two projects 
from three eyes, the first eye, the way the contracts have been 
structured, 
Chair 
sometimes 
some 
of 
us 
have 
the 
third 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 85 of 87 
 
eye…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     No I’m laughing about three eyes. 
MR ARSON MALOLA-PHIRI:     So the first eye it’s the way the 
contracting was done, if I may go back to the relationship between S A 
Express and the Dube Tradeport were there too many contractors vis a 
vis ACSA and the third party service providers, the relationship there is 
actually quite clearly defined as an airline because we make use of an 
airport we would have no choice but to contract with the ACSA to 
provide the infrastructure but secondly we’re also saying that the ACSA 
as the airport manager has the obligation to ensure that the service 
10 
providers that provide these ground handling are selected in 
accordance with the IATA and the ICAO standards. So they go through 
a very rigorous process to ensure that those that have been selected 
and licensed are compliant to IATA and ICAO standards and as an 
airline the way we select our preferred service provider is through an 
open tender process which we did and (indistinct) we had to contract 
with the SAA and the contract with (indistinct) for the purpose of the 
King Shaka Airport.  So the contract that we are sitting with, with this 
particular project was between S A Express and Dube Tradeport and of 
course the service provider would have to be contracted in accordance 
20 
with the – on PFMA processes.  Now in terms of North West I’m looking 
at it through the first eye is that there was a contract between North 
West and S A Express but on the back of it S A Express then had to 
contract with these ground handling service providers and my 
understanding – my knowledge is that no procurement process was 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 86 of 87 
 
actually followed one, but also secondly there is no sense that these 
ground handling companies are IATA or ICAO compliant, that test was 
actually not done, so that’s the first eye.  The second eye talks to the 
incentives, the agreement between S A Express and the Dube Tradeport 
was typically an arms length negotiation with the clear objectives 
having been stated by Dube Tradeport and also the clear objective was 
stated by SACS and in that regard the terms of reference for the 
relationship were also clearly defined and one of which was the use of 
incentives to encourage S A Express to operate out of Durban but those 
incentives were clearly defined as rebates and again, there was a full 
10 
definition of what those rebates mean and how they should be paid.  So 
it was very clear in the agreement that what you are paying for.  The 
third eye I believe is actually quite important is now the mechanism of 
claiming those incentives, the Dube Tradeport agreement it was very 
clear that it would be done in arrears and the Dube Tradeport would 
have to  verify whether the costs are legitimate and the quantum is 
reasonable, through the invoices and then checking against the – either 
the gazetted tariffs or the contract that we have had with the SAA and 
the Menzies as the ground handlers and that bid was basically lacking 
in the North West in the sense that not only was the reasonableness in 
20 
terms of  quantum done but also it is stated that S A Express was going 
to be paid in advance and there was no accountability for the funds that 
were paid to S A Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Thank you Chair, there’s no further 
20 JUNE 2019 – DAY 116 
 
Page 87 of 87 
 
questions from our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, yes, thank you.  Thank you very much Mr 
Phiri, if you are required to come back we’ll ask you and if anybody 
applies for leave to cross-examine you and that application is granted 
we will ask you to come back but – unless you have a question that you 
didn’t think about earlier, I’m about to release him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    There’s no further questions from 
our side.   
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you very much Mr Phiri you are excused, 
thank you very much. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Chair with your leave I’ve been 
requested to ask that you please warn Ms Phatudi who was summoned 
to be here today for appearance tomorrow.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja where is Mr Phatudi – oh Ms Phatudi.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Ms Phatudi.    
CHAIRPERSON:     Please be back here tomorrow we are going to aim 
to start at 12 tomorrow there might be a little bit of some delay because 
some things will be beyond our control, but be here by 12 o’clock.  We 
are going to adjourn then for today and tomorrow we’ll aim to start at 
12, there might be some delay and if need be we may go on until early 
20 
evening if we have to in order to make up for the hours that we won’t 
be able to use tomorrow morning.  We adjourn.
