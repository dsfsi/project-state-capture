PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 06 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Hofmeyr, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Good morning Ms Myeni. 
MS MYENI:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we start I am just going to repeat 
something that I said yesterday Ms Myeni namely that the 
10 
commission gives you an opportunity to deal with all 
evidence that or allegations that may have been made 
against you or your board in the commission so as to 
ensure that I have before me when I prepare the reports 
your version as well not just what they have to say against 
you but also your version and your perspectives. 
 
The commission also gives you the platform in 
responding to questions that are being asked to – to inform 
the public of your side of the story in relation to whatever 
may have been said to – against you – about you by 
20 
witnesses who have come to the commission. 
 
But the commission recognises that you have a 
privilege not to incriminate yourself and where you invoke 
that privilege and there are reasonable grounds for its 
invocation the commission will not compel you to answer 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 4 of 265 
 
the questions.  
 
But also it is going to be important that when a 
question has been asked you make up your mind whether 
you are going to invoke the privilege not to answer the 
question and on the basis that answering the question 
might lead to you incriminating yourself or whether you are 
going to answer the question. 
 
You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot give 
some answer and then later say no I am invoking the 
privilege. 
10 
 
So where you are going to answer you answer but 
where you invoke the privilege you invoke it and that is it.  
If at some stage I might seek to enquire whether there are 
reasonable grounds to invoke it and as I said two days ago 
there may be cases where I compel you to answer but I will 
not do so unless I think that the – there are no proper 
grounds to invoke the privilege.   
 
So I just wanted to remind you again naturally 
because as things presently stand this is the last day when 
you are appearing to say it is an opportunity you have to 
20 
respond to questions and deal with whatever different 
witnesses may have said about you or your board but 
where you choose to not to answer on the basis of invoking 
the privilege then that will be respected if there are 
reasonable grounds for invoking it. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 5 of 265 
 
 
But it is an opportunity that you decide whether to 
use or not. But as I said also yesterday when I prepare the 
report and I have to make findings it is not as if just 
because you – you invoked the privilege I cannot make 
findings.  All it would mean is simply that the evidence I 
have on which I can make findings would be of those 
witnesses who have given evidence and some of them may 
have given evidence against you and if I do not have your 
version I make findings based only on the versions I have. 
 
So I thought that I must just explain that once again 
10 
but 
where 
you 
invoke 
your 
privilege 
and 
there 
are 
reasonable grounds or we have no – we have no grounds 
to think there are no grounds to do so that will be 
respected. 
MS MYENI:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – the oath you took two days ago 
will continue to apply Ms Myeni.  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I am just worried.  Ms Myeni I have – you 
20 
seemed to speak there and we could not hear you.  Could 
you say something again just so we can check that you are 
audible? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say Chairperson. 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 6 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ah excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay it is alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Myeni I would like to 
begin this morning by focussing on BOSASA.  We looked 
yesterday in the concluding part of the day at Mhlatuze and 
the allegations that have been made against you there in 
relation to Mr X’s evidence. And now I would like to spend 
some time focussing on the evidence related to BOSASA. 
10 
 
Ms Myeni how well did you know Mr Watson? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Ms Myeni how well did you know Mr 
Agrizzi? 
MS MYENI:  May I Chair – may I please Chairperson not 
respond to the question so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Had you ever met with him? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
20 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Agrizzi gave evidence about a very 
particular meeting that he alleges he had with you at the 
Sheraton Hotel on the 23 September 2015.  Can you 
confirm whether you were at that meeting? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 7 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And there is another meeting that you are 
alleged to have held with him at the Intercontinental Hotel 
at the airport about two months later in 2015.  Did you 
attend that meeting? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni Mr Agrizzi testified before this 
commission about your involvement in serious acts of 
10 
corruption on his version and you in fact responded to his 
evidence in an affidavit that you prepared in March of 
2019.  It is the affidavit that we looked at briefly yesterday.  
So what I would like to do in the course of this morning is 
take you to aspects of that affidavit and give you an 
opportunity if you need to clarify or correct anything in that 
affidavit as we go through the various allegations that Mr 
Agrizzi and others have made against you in connection 
with BOSASA. 
 
So I would like to just summarise the nub of Mr 
20 
Agrizzi’s allegations if I may and then what I will do is I will 
unpack each of them with you. 
 
Ms 
Myeni 
Mr 
Agrizzi 
testified 
before 
this 
commission that BOSASA had paid you money and other 
benefits as a bribe and one of those other benefits was an 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 8 of 265 
 
elaborate security installation done at your home.  So I am 
going to call that the sort of general bribe allegation.   
 
The second allegation was that BOSASA gave you 
money in order for you to hand it over to former President 
Zuma.  I am going to call that the conduit allegation. 
 
There was also evidence from Mr Agrizzi that you 
had facilitated meetings with the former President for 
BOSASA in order to advance their interests.  And I am 
going to call that the facilitation allegation. 
 
Ms Myeni I must just pause there.  There has also 
10 
been another allegation not connected per se with BOSASA 
but in relation to Eskom evidence that you facilitated 
another meeting at which the suspension of the Eskom 
executives was dealt with. 
 
Now 
that 
aspect 
of 
the 
evidence 
before 
the 
commission is going to be dealt with by my learned friend 
Mr Pule Seleka in questioning you because that is an area 
of the commission’s investigations in respect of which he 
leads the investigation.  So I will not be touching on that 
one today.  I am going to touch on the allegations that 
20 
come from Mr Agrizzi’s evidence which have to do with 
Karoo fracking and BOSASA’s sites in that area. 
 
And then the fourth main allegation Ms Myeni is that 
you obtained confidential police documents concerning the 
investigation into BOSASA and that you provided those 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 9 of 265 
 
documents to Mr Watson and Mr Agrizzi in September 2015 
at that meeting which I asked you about moments ago on 
the 23 September 2015 according to Mr Agrizzi. 
 
So what I will do now is I will explore each of those 
with you.  I want to pick up on the meetings first.   
 
Now Mr Agrizzi alleged that you used to assist 
BOSASA generally with coordinating meetings with former 
President Zuma and that there was a particular matter that 
BOSASA was interested in and it related to fracking. 
 
Now I would like to take you to your affidavit that 
10 
you deposed to on the 4 March 2019 so that we can look 
there at your response to that allegation. 
 
Ms Myeni you will find it in your evidence Bundle 
DD34[b] and we should pick it up at page 1081.  For your 
convenience that is under Tab 9.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit starts at 1080 is it not? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I did not actually take us there 
yesterday.  I made reference to it so this is actually the 
20 
first time that we are going to it 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I – it may be convenient to enter it 
into the record.  If I may suggest to following the indexing 
as DD34[b].9. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 10 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:  Yes I have it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I will admit it after she has 
confirmed her signature and the contents Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Ms Myeni if you 
will go to page 1083 you will see a signature there can you 
confirm that that is your signature? 
MS MYENI:  Yes that is my signature. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And can you confirm that this is your 
affidavit and that the contents of it are true and correct? 
MS MYENI:  Sorry – sorry I did not – I did not get that one. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I was just asking you to confirm that the 
contents of that affidavit that bears your signature are true 
and correct? 
MS MYENI:  Chair the – the – Chairperson let me read this 
because the allegations I do not have a list of allegations 
with me of Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Well Ms Hofmeyr was just 
seeking 
your 
confirmation 
that 
the 
contents 
of 
your 
affidavit are to the best of your knowledge and belief true 
and correct without asking about Agrizzi just to confirm. 
20 
MS MYENI:  The contents of the - the contents of this 
statement as I was legally advised is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  The affidavit by Ms 
Duduzile Cynthia Myeni starting at page 1080 is admitted 
as Exhibit DD34[b].9.  Okay. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 11 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Myeni and if we could 
then go to page 1081 at which you will find paragraph 8 of 
your affidavit.  Do you have that? 
MS MYENI:  Yes I do – thanks Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What you say at paragraph 8 is: 
“This is just ingenuous for Mr Agrizzi to 
allege that I had an influence over former 
President Jacob Zuma to affect certain 
amendments 
to 
regulations 
which 
are 
required to facilitate the Karoo fracking.  I 
10 
vehemently deny these allegations.  The 
meeting did in fact take place in Nkandla.  
There was no alleged bag of cash that was 
handed over to the President and that 
statement is denied.” 
 
Ms Myeni as I understand this paragraph you are 
confirming here that at least one meeting did take place at 
Nkandla involving Mr Agrizzi, is that correct? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then Ms Myeni if you go over the 
page to page 1082 you deal with other meetings.  You see 
at the top of that page at paragraph 9 you say: 
“I 
deny 
that 
I 
coordinated 
a 
meeting 
between 
former 
President 
Zuma, 
Mr 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 12 of 265 
 
Watson, Mr O’Quigley and Ms Oberholzer.” 
 
Do you confirm that you did not set up a meeting 
between those four people in relation to Karoo fracking? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni Ms Oberholzer has provided an 
affidavit to this commission in which she says that you did 
set up that very meeting that Mr Agrizzi testified about.  Is 
she giving false evidence before this commission when she 
says that? 
10 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like to take you her affidavit and 
you will find that at page 1444 of the same bundle 
DD34[b].  Sorry let me give you the starting page.  It 
commences at page 1433.   
MS MYENI:  I have it Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chairperson this is the first 
time that we are dealing with Ms Oberholzer ’s affidavit.  
Chair if I may suggest that we enter it into the exhibit 
20 
again in accordance with the index as Exhibit DD34[b].15 - 
.15 and this is an affidavit that Ms Oberholzer deposed to 
you will find at page 1447 on the 22 October 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  You said DD34[b].15? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 13 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay. 
 
The 
affidavit 
of 
Ms 
Lizel 
Oberholzer starting at page 1423 will be admitted as 
Exhibit DD34[b].15. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Now Ms Myeni what Ms 
Oberholzer says in this detailed affidavit amongst other 
things is that you did coordinate a meeting between herself 
and the former President and Mr Watson and Mr O’Quigley 
and she said that that took place and that you set that 
meeting up.   Do you recall doing that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond so that I do not 
10 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She was very specific about the date of 
that meeting.  She said that it took place on the 27 July 
2014. Do you recall that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because your affidavit evidence before 
this commission is that you deny having set up this very 
meeting and so in a sense what the commission has before 
it is your denial on the one hand and Mr Agrizzi and Ms 
20 
Oberholzer ’s evidence before this commission that says 
you did set it up.  That is why it is quite important in due 
course 
for 
this 
commission 
to 
be 
able 
to 
make 
a 
determination between those two versions.  Do you accept 
that if one side of that debate had some documentary proof 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 14 of 265 
 
that the meeting was coordinated by you it might tilt the 
balance in favour of their version? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see what Ms Oberholzer says about 
this meeting appears at page 1444 of DD34[b].15.  So I 
would like to take you there.  Page 1444 at paragraph 38. 
MS MYENI:  I have it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni you will see on that page there 
is a heading in bold Nkandla 27 July 2014, do you see 
10 
that? 
MS MYENI:  Yes I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And at paragraph 38 this is what Ms 
Oberholzer says.  She says: 
“On this date a second meeting was held 
with 
President 
Zuma 
at 
his 
home 
in 
Nkandla.” 
 
Can I just pause there to contextualise where she is 
in the affidavit.  She dealt prior to this point in the affidavit 
with the first meeting which I understand from your 
20 
paragraph 8 of your affidavit you do not dispute having 
taken place.  So on that aspect you and she are in 
agreement.  But on this meeting because this is the one at 
which Mr O’Quigley, yourself, former President Zuma, Mr 
Watson were present.  You say on your affidavit before this 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 15 of 265 
 
commission it did not take place.  So I just wanted to give 
you that context for where we are. 
 
Okay paragraph 38 she says the following: 
“On this date a second was held with 
President Zuma at his home in Nkandla  
Present at the meeting with me were Mr 
O’Quigley, Ms Myeni, Mr Watson – sorry Mr 
Gavin Watson and President Zuma.  I 
understand that Ms Myeni had arranged the 
meeting 
with 
the 
President. 
 
The 
10 
arrangements were made by email between 
Mr O’Quigley and Mr Gavin Watson in which 
I was copied.  The suggestion that I attend 
this meeting came from Mr O’Quigley via a 
telephone call.  I attach marked Annexure 
LO1 an email chain which was forwarded to 
me.  The email chain starting on 20 July 
2014.  The email from Ms Myeni to Mr Gavin 
Watson is dated 20 July 2014 at 11:58 in 
the morning and 52 seconds.  It will be 
20 
noted that Ms Myeni advises that I am 
trying to set up a meeting for the 27 t h.  It is 
for this reason that I have assumed that Ms 
Myeni arranged the meeting.” 
 
I would like to take us to that email if we may go 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 16 of 265 
 
there?  And you will find that at page 1448.  Do you have 
that? 
MS MYENI:  I see the email yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you need to start as one often does 
with emails… 
MS MYENI:  Yes Chairperson I have – sorry I have the 
email. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So you have to start with 
email at the bottom of the page as you often have to do 
with email chains.  And what you will see in the second 
10 
half of the email is in bold the start of an email that says 
‘from; 
dudum 
with 
an 
email 
address 
there 
dudumyeni@telkokmsa.net.  Can you confirm that that was 
an email address you were using in July of 2014? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The date of the email is 20 July 2014 and 
the subject is Forward address by President Jacob Zuma at 
the 
launch 
of 
operation 
Phakisa 
big 
fast 
results 
implementation methodology.  And then I would like to read 
20 
into the record what appears then in the body of the email.  
It reads: 
“For my Mkhokheli” 
 
Could you translate what Mkhokheli means?  Ms 
Myeni can you hear us? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 17 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:  Sorry – sorry I can hear.  Sorry I was – I was 
checking where Mkhokheli is. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry so it is in the body of the email. 
MS MYENI:  I can see on the email. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  What does Mkhokheli mean? 
MS MYENI:  That was the word that was used by Mr 
Watson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because you are addressing him here so 
could you translate it for us into English?  What meaning 
does it have for you in English? 
10 
MS MYENI:  I am not sure it appears to be a Xhosa word. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay but you were using it in this email 
so what did you mean by it? 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
Can 
I 
not 
respond 
to 
this 
question 
Chairperson I do not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And the email reads as follows: 
”For my Mkhokheli I hope you are well.  By 
God’s grace we are all well.  I have to get 
this speech of the launch of yesterday’s 
event because I felt you have to know what 
20 
the event or launch was about.  Please be 
assured all is under control.  I am trying to 
set up a meeting for the 27 t h.” 
 
You see it is that last – oh and then it says: 
“Regards.” 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 18 of 265 
 
 
It is that last sentence of that email where you say I 
am trying to set up a meeting for the 27 t h that forms the 
basis for Ms Oberholzer ’s evidence before this commission 
that you did set up this meeting.  You have denied that on 
affidavit.  
 
But I want to put to you that this is pretty clear in 
its terms that you are setting up a meeting.  Do you have a 
response to that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let us just continue with the email 
because then you will see how it gets to Ms Oberholzer.  
You have to now go up from the bottom.  So above your 
email is the email that Mr Gavin Watson appears to have 
forwarded a bit later on that same day the 20 t h July 2014 at 
16:11 in the afternoon. And what this records is Gavin 
Watson using a particular Gmail address wrote and I am 
quoting: 
“Please see the email I received and who 
attended the meeting.  We can discuss this 
20 
further when we meet again.  Regards 
Gavin Watson.” 
 
And if you go above that you see how the email 
reached Ms Oberholzer.  Because it is Mr – there is then at 
the top of the page. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 19 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:  Yes I see. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  An email from Mr O’Quigley dated the 
20 t h July 2014 that much later in the day at six minutes 
past eight in the evening and he sends to Mr Watson, Mr 
Agrizzi, Ross Watson and Lizel Oberholzer who is Ms 
Oberholzer to send that email chain to all of them and his 
email reads: 
“So hopefully we are set up for the meeting 
to take place on the 27 t h.  I am booked on a 
flight to LHR on the 24 t h but will change as 
10 
soon as you confirm the meeting is going 
ahead.  Kind Regards.  Phillip.” 
 
Ms Myeni in the face of that documentary indication 
that you did in fact set up this meeting do you want to 
reconsider your evidence under oath on affidavit before 
this commission that you did not do so? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like there – there may be some 
technical problem. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you hear me Ms Myeni. 
20 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS MYENI:  I can hear you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 20 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni I understand you to have 
declined to answer that question on that basis that it may 
tend to incriminate you.  Is that correct? 
MS MYENI:  Well it is pointless that may I please invoke 
the 
privilege 
of 
answering 
the 
question 
in 
case 
I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would now like to move to 
the allegation of cash having been provided to you from 
time to time by BOSASA.  Mr Agrizzi’s evidence was that Mr 
Watson had told him that he was giving you R 300 000,00 a 
10 
month for the President and that it was being paid to the 
Jacob Zuma Foundation. 
 
Chair, that for record purposes.  Mr Agrizzi dealt with 
that 
in 
the 
transcript 
of 
the 
evidence 
on 
the 
28t h of January 2019, page 52, lines 4 to 8. 
 
Ms Myeni, are you aware of that allegation? 
MS MYENI:   What page?  Page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Ms Myeni.  Sorry.   
MS MYENI:   [Indistinct] [distortion present – speaker 
unclear] 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is only...  That is just a reference to 
the transcript.  It is not in your documents.  It is the 
transcripts of his evidence on the day and I am just 
recording that for record purposes.  We do not need to go to 
it.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 21 of 265 
 
 
You are, no doubt, aware of Mr Agrizzi’s evidence 
because you provided an affidavit to the Commission 
responding to it.   
 
What I would like to just confirm is that you were aware 
of this specific allegation that Mr Watson told Mr Agrizzi that 
Mr Watson was giving you R 300 000,00 a month of the 
President and that it was being paid to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation.   
 
Are you aware that that allegation was made against 
you? 
10 
MS MYENI:   Chair, may I not answer that question so that I 
do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now that allegation was another one of 
the allegations that you took up in your affidavit.  I would 
like to go back to your affidavit if we may?  You will find the 
relevant paragraph at page 1081 of the bundle we are in at 
the moment which is DD34-B.   
MS MYENI:   Sorry, it is page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   1081. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ten-eighty-one. 
20 
MS MYENI:   Yes, I have it Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now there is one paragraph...  Well, two 
paragraphs here where you deal with this R 300 000,00 that 
was alleged to have been given to you.  At paragraph 4 you 
say: 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 22 of 265 
 
“I further deny that I received R 300 000,00 per 
month from the BOSASA Group.” 
 
And then if you jump down to paragraph 6 you also say 
there: 
“I do not possess a Louis Viton handbag which was 
allegedly 
filled 
with 
cash 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
R 300 000,00.  No such amount of money was ever 
given to me as alleged.” 
 
Ms Myeni, when I read those two paragraphs together, I 
understand you to be conveying that you did not receive 
10 
money from the BOSASA Group which found its way into the 
foundation in due course. 
 
I mean, your denial is even broader.  You say no cash.  
But I want to focus particularly on the allegation of 
Mr Agrizzi that Mr Watson told him that he was giving it to 
you and then that is finding its way into the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation. 
 
Do you deny that you received money from BOSASA and 
put it into the Jacob Zuma Foundation? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this question 
20 
because I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now what we did manage to traverse a 
little bit in your evidence yesterday was that there were on 
occasion cash deposits made to the Jacob Zuma Foundation.  
Do you recall giving that evidence yesterday? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 23 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   I confirm that I said that yesterday.  Indeed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
MS MYENI:   There was context. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what I was seeking to probe with you 
yesterday was.  It is not easy to identify on cash deposit 
slips.  Indeed, sometimes, I would suggest, it is impossible 
to identify how the depositor is on a cash deposit slip.  Do 
you accept that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because I put it to you that if it is not 
possible to identify who the depositor is if all you got is cash 
deposit slip.  Then it is possible that BOSASA was 
depositing cash into the account of the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation, provided there is evidence of cash deposit slips.  
Do you accept that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you yourself Ms Myeni ever take cash 
and deposited in the foundation’s bank account? 
20 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember amounts as great as 
R 50 000,00 and R 100 000,00 and depositing those amounts 
as cash in the Jacob Zuma Foundation bank account? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 24 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, because the Commission has 
managed to find numerous deposit slips of amounts in those 
large quantities which appear from signatures on those cash 
slips to have been deposited by you.   
 
So I would like to take you to those cash slips if I may.  I 
would like to start with the one that appears in the same 
bundle that you are in at the moment, DD34-B.  And I would 
like to look at the one appearing at page 1476.  One 
10 
thousand four hundred-and-seventy six. 
MS MYENI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have that page? 
MS MYENI:   I have it Chairperson.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, you had helpfully assisted us 
on two occasions before this Commission in confirming that 
a signature that appears on a particular page is your 
signature.   
 
You did it yesterday when you confirmed that the letter 
you sent in response to the complaints from your co-board 
20 
members in 2014 was your signature. 
 
And you did it moments ago when you confirmed your 
signature 
on 
the 
affidavit 
that 
you 
presented 
to 
the 
Commission in March of 2019.   
 
So I am hoping you will be able to assist us with the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 25 of 265 
 
signatures that appear on these deposit slips.  You will see a 
signature on this deposit slip on page 1476.   
 
Can you confirm that that is your signature?  Actually, it 
appears twice at the bottom of the page.  Do you see that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I invoke the privilege of not 
responding to this question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then if we go ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   The reason is that each question follows 
another question.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if we go over to page 1478, there is 
10 
another signature on that page on a deposit slip.  Can you 
confirm whether that is your signature? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Before I go to other that we have with 
your signature.  It is probably appropriate to just have 
recorded what the amounts of each of these deposit slips 
was.  Let us go back to the deposit slip at page 1476.   
 
Ms Myeni, it is sometimes difficult to see the numbering 
on the deposit slip.  It took me, I must be honest, some time 
20 
to work out how these deposit slips record the amounts but 
let me try and help you.   
 
If you go to the top of the deposit slip, you will see there 
is emblem, ABSA on the left-hand side and then an emblem 
for Barclays.  And then below that you have a date, 8 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 26 of 265 
 
December 2014 and there is a time.  It looks like one o’clock 
in the afternoon and two seconds.   
 
Then it says CC.  And then you will see there, fifty 
comma zero, zero, zero point zero, zero.  So that is an 
indication that this is a deposit of R 50 000,00. 
 
And what is then interesting.  If you go just a bit further 
down, there is Jacob Zuma Foundation, MPC.  There is 
reference number:  Donation dash..  I cannot quite make that 
out.  SAS, maybe?   
 
And then there is...  Do you see a one hundred there?  
10 
And then you will see Rands and then zero, zero, zero 
comma zero comma fifty comma zero, zero, zero point zero, 
zero.   
 
So that, as I understand it, is indicating that the 
R 50 000,00 came in hundred rand notes.  If you had been 
depositing this, could you confirm for us that you took 
R 50 000,00’s worth of a hundred Rand notes and deposited 
it 
in 
the 
foundation’s 
bank 
account 
on 
the 
8 t h of December 2014? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this 
20 
question?  I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then if we go to the one that also 
bears a signature with quite a striking resembles to the 
signatures that you have confirmed before the Commission in 
your evidence.  That is at page 1478.  You will see there that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 27 of 265 
 
that deposit slip is dated the 3r d of November 2016.  That is 
under the emblem of ABSA at the top of the deposit slip.  Do 
you see that? 
MS MYENI:   Chair, I see the deposit slip Ma’am. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and then what that tells us is, 
that on this occasion R 100 000,00 was deposited.  And if 
you go further down and follow the logic of the previous 
deposit slip.  It was R 20 000,00 in two hundred Rand notes 
and R 80 000,00 in one hundred Rand notes.   
 
Do you recall taking R 20 000,00 in two hundred Rand 
10 
notes and R 80 000,00 in one hundred Rand notes and 
depositing them in the Jacob Zuma Foundation on the 3r d of 
November 2016? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, in the section of your bundle 
there a number of deposit slips.  Not all of them.  There what 
appears to be your signature.  Some of them bears 
signatures the Commission has not been able to identify.   
 
Some of them give a description like the one I 
20 
referenced a moment ago, Donation SAS.  Others bear no 
description at all.   
 
I will give you a...  Well, other than donation.  But I will 
give you an example of one of those.  If we go to page 1482.  
Do you have that? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 28 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see that one ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   I have it Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you look at that one, it just says after 
the date which it looks like it is 16 September 2017.  
Chairperson, can I just pause there?  We did try to do the 
best copying we could but these are old deposit slips. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I mean, they are the originals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So...  But this was the best that we could 
do for the purposes of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That were deposit slips that I understand 
it, are in the possession of the Commission.  But let us just 
look at this one.  You see, this one has a date.  It looks like 
maybe 14 or 16 September 2017.  And there is just says, 
Jacob Zuma Foundation, NPC, reference number:  Donation.  
So on the first one we got Donation SAS.  Here we get 
nothing.   
20 
 
Unlike electronic transfers, you just do not know who is 
making these deposits unless you can identify the signature.  
Ms Myeni, there is just one other of the deposit slips bearing 
your signature that I would like to take you to and that is at 
1488.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 29 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chairperson I have it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I take you to this one because it is 
amongst some of the clearest of the signatures that appear 
on that page.  Can you confirm that that is your signature at 
page 1488? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You will see Ms Myeni that this is a 
deposit that was made on the 6t h of February 2016.  And it is 
in the amount of R 100 000,00 and it appears on this 
10 
occasion the R 100 000,00 was made up of two hundred 
Rand notes.   
 
Ms Myeni, if you did indeed deposit these large cash 
amounts.  Can you assist the Commission as to where you 
got these large cash amounts from to deposit them into the 
Jacob Zuma Foundation bank account? 
MS MYENI:   ...it is myself. [distortion present – speaker 
unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  We did not hear the whole 
sentence Ms Myeni. 
20 
MS MYENI:   Thanks, Chairperson.  May I not respond to the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I must put it to you that the 
discovery of these cash deposit slips, bearing what on the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 30 of 265 
 
face looks like your signature, lends credence to Mr Agrizzi’s 
version, potentially, that you were depositing cash which you 
received from BOSASA into the Jacob Zuma Foundation bank 
account.  What is your response to that? 
MS MYENI:   May I invoke the privilege Chairperson that I do 
not respond to the question so that I do not incriminate 
myself? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, in fairness to you.  I must 
record that the Commission has not found regular deposit 
slips amounting to R 300 000,00 cash bearing your signature 
10 
each month.   
 
But what it has found are these deposit slips which 
appear in your evidence bundle.  I have not taken you to all 
of them but they are large amounts of cash deposited by you 
and without explanation, given the approach that you are 
taking to your evidence today.   
 
Are you sure that you do not want to give this 
Commission an explanation for those deposits of large cash 
amounts? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, with respect, may I not respond to 
20 
the question so that I do not incriminate myself? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I would like now to move off 
cash and go to travel benefit. 
[distortion present] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know you said Ms Hofmeyr, you did not 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 31 of 265 
 
take her to all of them.  I see there is one at page 1490 that 
has a signature that seems to be her signature. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  We could maybe ask Ms Myeni 
again if she could confirm that signature.  That would be 
useful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, if you could go to page 1490.  
MS MYENI:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have that? 
MS MYENI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That appears to be a deposit, also on the 
6t h of February 2016.  We looked at another one with this 
date a moment ago.  This time in the amount of R 50 000,00 
made up of hundred Rand notes.  And there is a signature at 
the bottom of that page.  Can you confirm whether that is 
your signature? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Chair, with your leave, I will 
then move to the travel benefits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 32 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the evidence of Mr Agrizzi and others 
has not been confined to cash benefits that BOSASA was 
alleged to have given to you with some expectation that it 
would find its way to the foundation.   
 
But there are also travel benefits that you are alleged to 
have benefited from.  So I would like to deal with those.  The 
allegations are those that come from the entity called Blakes 
Travel. 
 
And the allegation is that you received a number of 
travel and accommodation benefits through Blakes Travel 
10 
that were paid for by BOSASA.   
 
Can you confirm that you received those benefits? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now Mr Agrizzi’s evidence before the 
Commission on this aspect.  Chair, can be found both in his 
affidavit, which I am not suggesting we need to go to.  This 
is again just for record purposes.   
 
Ms Myeni is well-aware of these allegations.  She has 
responded to them on affidavit but just for record purposes.  
20 
It is Mr Agrizzi’s affidavit, Exhibit AA at page 65, paragraph 
30.1.   
 
And he also then addressed it in the transcript of 
evidence on the 22n d of January 2015, page 156, lines 5 to 
10.  So what Mr Agrizzi says in his affidavit and in testimony 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 33 of 265 
 
before this Commission is, that BOSASA used Blakes Travel 
to facilitate arrangements for various government officials 
and other persons that they regarded to have influence. 
 
And 
that 
evidence 
was 
then 
corroborated 
by 
Mr Brian Blake who is an employee of Blakes Travel.  He 
also testified before this Commission and his evidence is to 
be found in Exhibit T.  That is T for tomato.  T-18. 
 
Ms Myeni, that should be amongst the bundles that you 
have with you.  We have until this point, I think, only been 
dealing with your bundle.  But I am now going to want to take 
10 
you to T-18.   
 
So can you look for Bundle T-18 amongst the mountain 
of files that you have?  And Chair, yours will be provided to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   T-18, I take it will be written on the spine 
of the file ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It will indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for the benefit of Ms Myeni.  So look at 
the spine of your files and look for one that is written T-18. 
MS MYENI:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, if you will just alert us to when 
you have the file?  And we will start with it at page 70.  
Seven, zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Her picture if off the screen but she may 
be hearing us. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 34 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think that is right.  I think she has gone 
off video so that she can move around and find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if we can just give Ms Myeni a moment.  
Thank you, Chair. 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson...  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   All my files are Exhibit DD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no T-18? 
MS MYENI:   There is no T-18.  All of them, they are DD and 
10 
then they have A, B, C or Exhibit DD11. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   DD9, DD8, DD14, 13, 12 and so on.  There is 
no TT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be that her attorney might have 
it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is possible.  These...  You see, the DD 
series Chair, the 55 files that are assembled behind me, are 
the Aviation files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The other ones – and they are usually 
kept together – the other ones where I have to go to other 
work streams ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Work streams, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this is a T file.  Now this...  Ms Myeni, 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 35 of 265 
 
these two files, I am going to take you to T-18 and later on I 
am going to take you to T-21.  It did not come with the first 
shipment of files.  They came later on your first day of 
evidence, as I understand the arrangements.  So it might be 
that your attorney put them somewhere else? 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
 
Can 
I 
turn? 
 
Because 
my 
attorney 
representative is here who brought the first shipment.  So let 
me just quickly hear if we have them or not.  Or we can 
maybe continue without the files.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Look, the purpose of the file is to 
take you to certain ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, with your... 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Maybe 
we 
should 
take 
an 
adjournment. 
MS MYENI:   Ja, please. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we take an adjournment to enable 
Ms Myeni to talk to her attorney or the representative of her 
attorney to establish whether they have got the file.   
20 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Let us make the tea-break. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is eleven. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Quarter to ten. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 36 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  It is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   We started early but it is very convenient 
to take. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be a break without tea.  [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MYENI:   How many minutes Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall we make it ten?  I think make it 15.  
I am just not sure...  Let us say, we will make it 15 but if the 
file is found earlier before the end of 15 minutes, I must be 
10 
informed and then we will resume.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you so much. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chair.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see the challenges in finding the file 
took a lot of our time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  Unfortunately, Chair, it seems 
20 
what was not even a tea break became more like a lunch 
break and we do apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What I have discussed with my learned 
friends is that we are going to make arrangements.  It was 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 37 of 265 
 
sent electronically to Ms Myeni’s lawyers but there is an 
issue with it being downloaded at the moment given its 
size. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So we are facilitating a hard copy 
getting to her.  I am going to move off topic that require 
those two files to be addressed and the hope is that by 
lunch or after lunch she will have those hard copies and we 
can return to those matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, we are indebted.  So I 
was going to be dealing with travel benefits.  I am now 
pending that and I am moving to that alleged, Ms Myeni, on 
the 23 September 2015.  That is the meeting that Mr 
Agrizzi said had taken place with you and it is the meeting 
at the Sheraton where Mr Agrizzi said you handed to him 
and Mr Watson confidential police docket information 
regarding an investigation into BOSASA.  Can you confirm 
that you had that meeting? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
20 
question, I would not like to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, you did previously respond to 
this allegation though and you did so in your affidavit that 
we were looking at earlier, so I would like to take you to it, 
it is at page 1082 at paragraph 13 that I am interested in 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 38 of 265 
 
and you will find it in your bundle DD34B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   10..? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   82, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MYENI:   I have it, Chairperson, before me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Mr Agrizzi did not testify about only 
one meeting at the Sheraton but there was this particular 
meeting on the 23 September 2015 where this very specific 
exchange of the confidential police information, according 
10 
to Mr Agrizzi, took place and as I read your affidavit, Ms 
Myeni, 
of 
March 
2019 
that 
you 
presented 
to 
the 
Commission, you only deal with Sheraton meetings with Mr 
Agrizzi at paragraph 13 and I would invite you to direct me 
anywhere else in the affidavit if you have a different 
understanding of it but what happens at paragraph 13 is 
you say: 
“Mr Agrizzi and I had only met in Sheraton for the 
first time as stated on the allegations of his 
affidavit.  However, I was meeting Mr Watson to 
20 
request 
a 
donation 
for 
the 
former 
President’s 
birthday event.” 
Do you see that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I have the document, page 1082 
in front of me. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 39 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and then I was just reading 
paragraph 13 where it seems to me you deal with Sheraton 
meetings and you say there: 
“Mr Agrizzi and I had only met in Sheraton for the 
first time as stated on the allegations of his 
affidavit.  However, I was meeting Mr Watson to 
request a donation for former President’s birthday 
event.” 
I asked whether you – do you have that in front of you?  Do 
you see paragraph 13, Ms Myeni? 
10 
MS MYENI:   I have page 1082 with all the paragraphs, 
indeed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, super.  So I want to just convey to 
you, when I read that paragraph, it says to me that you are 
denying the meeting that occurred on the 23 September 
2015.  Is that correct?  Do you deny meeting him on that 
day? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I invoke the privilege of not 
responding to the question so I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you also do deal with this exchange 
20 
of documents in your affidavit but not specifically the 
meeting at paragraph 11.  You say at paragraph 11: 
“I deny that...” 
I think it is meant to say: 
“...I had met anyone from the NPA nor am I aware of 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 40 of 265 
 
the document referred to.  I intend to raise this 
matter in the cross-examination.  I was not in 
possession of any document from the NPA.  I deny 
that I shared such a document with Mr Agrizzi or Mr 
Watson, it is indeed a lie.  Mr Agrizzi must explain 
about this document in the cross-examination.  I 
had no reason to get involved in their business.” 
Do you stand by that denial that you handed over this 
confidential police information to Mr Agrizzi and Mr Watson 
on the 27 September 2015? 
10 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question, I do not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, can you tell us when the 
former President’s birthday is? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question, I would not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, from publicly available 
information  it appears that the former President’s birthday 
falls on the 12 April each year and if that is so, it seems to 
me, at least, and I would like your comment on this, to be 
20 
unlikely that you would have a meeting in September of 
2015 at which you were requesting a donation for the 
President’s birthday event because his birthday would have 
passed a few months earlier or it would have been many 
months in the future.  Do you agree with me it is unlikely 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 41 of 265 
 
that you would be asking for a donation for the former 
President’s birthday event in September of a year? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question, so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, as I understand your affidavit 
before this Commission you are accepting a different 
meeting may have taken place at the Sheraton with Mr 
Agrizzi but you are denying that this specific meeting took 
place and if that is indeed your denial I would like to probe 
the denial a bit further because there is a series of 
10 
independent evidence that this Commission has received 
which I am going to put to you tends to indicate that you 
were present at the Sheraton on the 23 September 2015.  
So I want to take you to each element of that independent 
evidence.   
 
The first is that your – let me start, who is Mr Nick 
Linnell, Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question that is being asked in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the Commission has received 
20 
evidence from Mr Linnell in which he says that he was an 
adviser, generally speaking, to you and that he was quite 
involved in the SAA matters, certainly in 2015 and 2016.  
Can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 42 of 265 
 
question, so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think in his evidence my learned friend 
Mr Seleka put it to him that he has been described as Mr 
Fix-it.  Are you aware of that description of Mr Linnell? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question, so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, Mr Linnell, was invoicing SAA 
between 2015 and part of 2016 for a number of services he 
was providing to SAA, so what we were able to find – and I 
am going to come to the topic of Mr Linnell in due, but we 
10 
were able to find among those invoices was an invoice that 
he settled at the Sheraton Hotel which puts him there on 
the 22 and the 23 September 2015.  Can you confirm that 
Mr Linnell, who would regularly provide advice to SAA, was 
also at the Sheraton Hotel on those dates?  
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question, so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would like to just show you his invoice 
from the Sheraton so that there can be no debate on the 
matter.  I would like to take you, Ms Myeni, for that 
20 
purpose to your bundle that you have in front of you, 
DD34B at page 1631 and you will find it under tab 27. 
MS MYENI:   I have it, Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this is an invoice that Mr Linnell 
submitted to South African Airways for reimbursement and 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 43 of 265 
 
you will see at the top right hand corner there is the 
emblem of the Sheraton.  You will see there interestingly 
that he was staying in room 619.  I am going to take you to 
the evidence that has already been presented to the 
Commission that you were staying in room 616 on these 
dates.  Well, you stayed actually an extra date to the one 
that Mr Linnell stayed.  So you will see in the columns on 
the right hand side says room number 619 and it says 
arrival 22.09.15 and departure 23.09.15.  Can you confirm 
that Mr Linnell was staying at the Sheraton over the same 
10 
dates that you were staying at the Sheraton, Ms Myeni, in 
September of 2015? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you tell us what you and Mr Linnell 
were doing at the Sheraton on the 22 and 23 September 
2015? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now the Commission went to some 
20 
extensive lengths to interrogate the photographs that Mr 
Agrizzi testified he had taken on that date of the 23 
September 2015 when, on his version, you handed over the 
confidential police information to him.  Do you recall his 
evidence about the photograph and then the efforts that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 44 of 265 
 
were taken by the Commission to verify the carpet that 
appears on the photograph?  Are you aware of that 
evidence? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, not only were efforts made to 
go and check what the carpet looked like on the 6 t h floor of 
the Sheraton Hotel where this alleged exchange took 
place, according to Mr Agrizzi’s evidence between you and 
him and Mr Watson.  The Commission also went to the 
10 
lengths of analysing the photograph itself which they were 
able to take from Mr Agrizzi’s device and evidence was 
presented by Mr Frank Dutton, one of the investigators of 
the Commission, confirming that the analyses that had 
been done show that that particular photograph evidencing 
the police information and in the background the carpet 
that he confirmed from his own inspection in loco had the 
same pattern as the one in the picture, confirmed that the 
date the picture was taken was the 23 September 2015, 
that the time it was taken was 10.37 in the morning and 
20 
they could assess the location of the photographs as 
having been at the Sheraton Hotel. 
 
Now in the fact of that independent evidence, Ms 
Myeni, do you persist in your denial that you were involved 
in giving that document to Mr Agrizzi on the 23 September 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 45 of 265 
 
2015? 
MS MYENI:   I would like to invoke the privilege, 
Chairperson, of remaining silent and not responding to the 
question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you deny that you were staying in 
room 616 on the 6 t h floor between the dates of the 22 and 
24 September 2015 at the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question, 
Chairperson, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you deny that your adviser Mr Linnell 
10 
was staying three doors down at room 619 on the 6 t h floor 
of the Sheraton on the 23 September 2015? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, to the 
question  in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The Sheraton Hotel’s record which Mr 
Frank Dutton also addressed in his evidence confirmed that 
you stayed at the hotel between the 22 n d and the 24 
September 2015 and I want to therefore put it to you, Ms 
Myeni, that the independent evidence available to this 
Commission indicates on a strong probability that you were 
20 
there, that you were staying on the 6 t h floor, that the 6 t h 
floor had limited access, that was another part of Mr 
Agrizzi’s evidence, that Mr Agrizzi on the 6 t h floor of the 
Sheraton on the 23 September 2015 took photographs of 
confidential police information reflecting in its background 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 46 of 265 
 
the carpet in the floor of the Sheraton on the 6 t h floor that 
our investigator went and confirmed in 2019 remained the 
same patterned carpet. 
 
Against all of that evidence will you deny that you 
were present on that day? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the challenge, Ms Myeni, is 
that as the weight of independent evidence mounts a bald 
denial on your part or as is happening today, a refusal to 
10 
engage in any of this, I put to you is going to leave the 
Commission in a difficult position but to conclude that 
there is a probability that you were there and that is Mr 
Agrizzi is to be believed in his evidence, that you handed 
over that confidential police information.  Do you want to 
respond to that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I do not want to incriminate 
myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I would then like to move to 
another of the benefits that you are alleged to have 
20 
received from BOSASA and that relates to a security 
installation.  Did you have a security installation done at 
your home in Richard’s Bay in May of 2014? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question, 
Chairperson, in case I incriminate myself. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 47 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did BOSASA pay for that installation? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Richard le Roux gave evidence 
before this Commission because he is the person who 
testified before the Commission that he actually undertook 
that security installation.  Are you aware that he gave that 
evidence? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were sent a Rule 3.3 notice in 
relation to Mr le Roux’s evidence on the 3 July 2020.  Do 
you recall receiving that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now in Mr le Roux’s testimony he 
indicated that this installation at your home had taken 
place, as I say, in May of 2014.  He estimated that it took 
over 21 days in total to install it because it was a very 
detailed installation and he approximated the total value of 
20 
it when he included labour as well as the actual purchasing 
of the equipment at R486 514.63.  Are you aware that that 
installation costs just under half a million rand? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question  in case I incriminate myself. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 48 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you agree that receiving something 
to the value of just less than half a million rand is a 
substantial benefit? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that if you did not 
reimburse BOSASA for those costs it would have been a 
gift to you? 
MS MYENI:   Chair, may I not respond to the question in 
case I incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In March 2014, Ms Myeni, you were the 
Chairperson of both the SAA board and the uMhlathuze 
Water Board, can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond so that do not  
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The conflict of interest policy is that 
both of those entities require gifts to be declared.  Are you 
aware of that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, in Ms Myeni’s bundle there are 
affidavits that we have obtained both from uMhlathuze 
Water Board as well as from SAA.  I do not think it is 
necessary to go there now.  With your leave and if Ms 
Myeni is comfortable with it I will simply summarise what 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 49 of 265 
 
they say about their records on gift disclosures, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that would be fine.  Do you 
have any problem with that, Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   I do not, Chairperson, although I am part of 
the people that would actually develop some policies 
relating to conflict of interest and ensure and enforce such 
policies at every board and every institution that I have 
presided over, but I am happy that Ms Hofmeyr reads the 
policy if the Chairperson allows her.  It can educate many 
other people. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, well let us start with the conflict of 
interest policy that operated at SAA at the time because 
that conflict of interest  policy, and I quote: 
“Required non-executive board members of SAA to 
declare all gifts received by non-executive directors 
in their capacity of officially serving SAA and of a 
monetary value estimated to be more than R1 000 
shall be declared by the relevant non-executive 
director.” 
Were you aware of that requirement in the conflict of 
20 
interest policy in May of 2014? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now we asked SAA to go through its 
records of gift declarations and the affidavit that has been 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 50 of 265 
 
provided by SAA has indicated that there is no declaration 
by you, Ms Myeni, of having received a gift in the order of 
R486 514.63 from BOSASA at that time.  Do you dispute 
the records of SAA? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The uMhlathuze Water Board had a 
similar provision, it required declarations to be made of 
gifts received by board members and in that case there 
was actually a declaration by you having received a gift.  It 
10 
is a declaration you made later though in 2016.  Do you 
recall making that declaration in 2016? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, just for record purposes I will 
indicate where that entry is on the uMhlathuze gift register.  
I do not suggest it necessary for us to go there unless Ms 
Myeni wants us to.  The entry of Ms Myeni for this 
disclosure in 2016 appears at DD34B at page 1471.  Ms 
Myeni, it was a declaration that you had received – well, 
20 
maybe let us go there momentarily.  Will you call up 1471 
in EXHIBIT DD34B? 
MS MYENI:   I have it, Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, this is the register of the 
declaration of gifts received by any board member of 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 51 of 265 
 
uMhlathuze Water Board and the page I have asked you to 
look at – oh and it spans from 2012.  I think it goes up to 
2017, this one.  No, sorry, it is much more recent, it goes 
as far as this year.  And what it says on the page we are 
looking at, we searched the whole register from 2012 to 
2020 for any declarations that you had made and it 
appears at page 1471.  If you look at the fifth line in that 
table that there was a gift received on the 20 January 
2016.  The first column indicated was received from an 
entity, I assume, called ZDM, the recipient is indicated as 
10 
Ms D Myeni.  The description of the gift received is 
notebook and pen and the value is declared at R200.  Do 
you remember making that declaration? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond in case I  
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I put it to you that this entry 
in this gifts declaration indicates a few things.  It is 
indicates that you were aware of your obligation to declare 
gifts received.  Do you accept that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
20 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It indicates that you took the receipt of a 
notebook and pen to the value of R200 to be sufficiently 
important to declare in this gifts register.  Do you accept 
that? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 52 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, I would not 
want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I also put to you that it indicates 
that a failure in May 2014 to declare a gift of R486 515.63 
would have been in breach of this policy.  Do you accept 
that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now, Ms Myeni, you will recall when I 
dealt with the SAA policy on conflict of interest, they way 
10 
that that policy works is that it requires the declaration to 
be made.  If it is a gift received – and I am quoting now: 
“In the capacity of officially serving SAA” 
Were you aware that that was the way in which the 
obligation was framed in the SAA conflict of interest 
policy? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, in fairness to you, Ms Myeni, it 
may well be that had you come before this Commission 
20 
today 
to 
answer 
the 
questions 
and 
not 
invoke 
that 
privilege, you might have said well, this installation was 
not in any way related to my official capacity at SAA.  Do 
you think if you were minded to have given your version 
you might have raised that point of contention? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 53 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I – with your permission, may I 
not be fed words to say or to have said to maybe if I was 
somewhere else I would have said something.  I would 
prefer to say here is my response and I stand with the 
response I am making that says may I please, with your 
permission, invoke my right of not responding to the 
question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni Mr Agrizzi testified before this 
Commission that a few months, I think it was two months 
after the September 2015 meeting there was another 
10 
meeting that took place where BOSASA was meeting with 
the SAA CEO at the time, because it was interested in 
pursuing security and catering contracts with SAA.  Do you 
remember that evidence of Mr Agrizzi? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We got in contact with the then SAA 
CEO Mr Nico Bezuidenhout to find out from him whether he 
could recall any such meeting having taken place and 
provided – I am going to say a statement, I will explain why 
20 
in a moment, to the Commission.  I would like to take us to 
it if we may go there, it is in the same bundle we have 
been dealing with, BB34B and it commences at page 1558 
of that bundle.  
MS MYENI:   I have it chairperson, an affidavit. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 54 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair this is an affidavit that 
we have not come to yet and so I would like to request that 
we enter it as an exhibit, this will be in accordance with 
the index Exhibit DD34B.25, but Chair if I could just 
request before we enter it into the record that I can give 
the explanation of why I am calling it a statement and not 
an affidavit, despite the fact that it says affidavit on the 
first page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I see that.  I think you are going to 
tell me what I just picked up. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That the Commissioner of Oaths did not 
sign. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well it is not quite that, the situation is 
such that this was prepared by Mr Bezuidenhout and 
signed on the 29 t h of October 2020, you see that date on 
the last page where the Commissioner should have signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
But 
– 
and 
we 
have 
these 
communications on this with the Commission, he was at 
20 
that point in isolation for reasons similar to Ms Myeni and 
so what he did was he provided this signed, he had – it 
was prepared as an affidavit because he had every 
intention of deposing to it, and the arrangement we 
reached with him is that as soon as he is in a position to 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 55 of 265 
 
go before a Commissioner of Oaths he will properly depose 
to it so that that will come before the Commission but we 
needed to have this version to put Ms Myeni today so we 
made that arrangement in the circumstances, with your 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if we could enter it as EXHIBIT 
DD34B.25. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that DD34B.? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   .25. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   25, the statement/affidavit by Mr Nico 
Bezuidenhout starting at page 1558 is admitted as Exhibit 
DD34B.25.   I take it you will seek to have to have it 
replaced with ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
With 
one 
which 
has 
got 
the 
Commissioner ’s stamp as well. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So for now I just want to enable Ms 
20 
Myeni 
to 
respond 
should 
you 
wish 
to, 
to 
what 
Mr 
Bezuidenhout confirms here.   If we start at page 1559 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we – I guess we start by saying 
who he is. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 56 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was acting CEO of SAA from 10 
November 2014 to 10 July 2015. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what he says ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you may proceed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I realise that I have made an error 
in dates, and I need to just correct that, you will see here 
at paragraph 4 on page 1559 Mr Bezuidenhout says there 
10 
first: 
“I do not carry any awareness of any meeting Ms 
Myeni had at BOSASA’s offices and was never 
informed of such.” 
He was asked generally to indicate to the Commission what 
knowledge he had of any such meetings, so he indicates 
firstly he had no awareness of any meeting that Ms Myeni, 
you may have had at BOSASA’s offices, but then what he 
goes on to say is that you did shortly after he assumed his 
acting CEO role at SAA in November of 2015 and at a time 
20 
when Air Chefs was experiencing operational difficulties 
suggest that Air Chefs should consider engaging with and 
getting advice from BOSASA and he said that you had said 
that BOSASA was experienced in providing meals at large 
scale on a daily basis and he goes on says that they, 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 57 of 265 
 
according to you, Ms Myeni, had proven this capability in 
the Prison Service, and he said I am under correction I 
seem to recall she also mentioned hospitals.   
 
Do you remember having that conversation with Mr 
Bezuidenhout? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond I would not 
want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It goes on and says that you advised 
that the CEO of BOSASA was travelling in Johannesburg, 
he said it was on a Saturday morning as I recall and that 
10 
Ms Myeni was in Johannesburg on the day and you asked 
him if he could join for an introductory meeting at the 
Intercontinental 
Hotel. 
 
Do 
you 
recall 
having 
that 
conversation with Mr Bezuidenhout? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question, so that I don’t incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I indicated that I had made a date 
error, I want to just explain why I think I made a date error 
but I suspect that it might not be my error and that it may 
be necessary to go back to Mr Bezuidenhout.  You see 
20 
what I noticed that as I was going through the affidavit that 
Mr Bezuidenhout says at paragraph 1 that he was the 
Acting Chief Executive Officer for SAA from 10 November 
2014 to approximately 10 July 2015 and then  he goes on 
to talk about these interactions and he talks about them 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 58 of 265 
 
having taken place in November of 2015 and he says that 
that was shortly after assuming his acting role at SAA, 
Chair that date doesn’t make sense in the contents of 
paragraph 1, so we are going to need to get clarity from Mr 
Bezuidenhout.  It may be that there is an error in the year 
that he put in 2015 when he means 2014, because that 
would accord with his first paragraph where he says he 
took up the position from approximately 10 November 
2014.  It is then consistent to say shortly thereafter there 
was this interaction. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And certainly my knowledge is that he 
was there at that time, it is November 2014 to mid 2015, he 
is not in that role at the end of 2015, because that’s when 
a lot is happening with Ms Mpshe who was filling the role 
and the Mr Zwane who replaced her so that created the 
concern 
in 
my 
mind 
about 
today, 
but 
subject 
to 
a 
clarification from Mr Bezuidenhout that if there is an error 
in his paragraph 4 it should be November 2014 and not 
November 2015.  I then want to go onto telling Ms Myeni 
20 
what he said about the meeting and for present purposes I 
would like us to assume that it took place in November of 
2014, given what I have just said. 
 
So if we go to paragraph 5 on page 1559 that is 
where he indicated that you said that the CEO of BOSASA 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 59 of 265 
 
wanted to have this meeting and you asked him whether he 
could join it at the Intercontinental Hotel and then at 
paragraph 6 he says: 
“When I arrived at the hotel Ms Myeni introduced 
me to Mr Gavin Watson as BOSASA’s CEO and Mr 
Angelo Agrizzi as COO.  I cannot specifically recall 
but there may have been a third unknown person 
but I am not sure.” 
He says: 
“After introductions Mr Watson proceeded to do a 
10 
prayer and then discussions went into general 
topics and took a religious tone.” 
Ms Myeni did you know Mr Watson as a religious person? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you ever intend other meetings 
where Mr Watson would open the meeting with a prayer? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He goes on at paragraph 7 on page 1559 
20 
to say: 
”Without the discussion having any objective as far 
as I know other than being an introduction one of 
the parties, I do not recall which one, referenced 
SAA Security Tender that was in progress at the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 60 of 265 
 
time and as I recall appeared to question whether 
the tender was being fairly handled.” 
He says: 
“I stated that whilst I am not directly involved with 
the tender SAA’s tender processes entail various 
checks and balances and that no information has 
been brought to me [that is him] to indicate that the 
process as far as the security tender was not being 
fairly handled.” 
He then goes on at paragraph 8 and he says: 
10 
“One of the parties [again he doesn’t recall which 
one] turn to BOSASA’s experience in running large 
scale canteens and that there may have been 
assistance in this regard at Air Chefs.  He said I 
advised that the management at Air Chefs will 
review all possible suppliers and interventions as 
the need to improve Air Chefs delivery was topical 
amongst S A Group Management.” 
Do you recall those discussions having taken place at this 
meeting in November of 2014? 
20 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He says at paragraph 9 that the meeting 
then concluded, as he recalls it, with Mr Watson asking 
whether: 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 61 of 265 
 
“I had any personal security concerns, and me 
advising that no I had not and that SAA Security 
Division as is customary for CEO’s or Acting CEO’s 
had performed security risk assessment at my 
property.” 
And he goes on and says: 
“The meeting then concluded.” 
Do you remember that discussion having taken place at 
that meeting?  
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
10 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He says at paragraph 10: 
“Following the meeting I obtained confirmation from 
SAA’s head of security that the then current tender 
process for SAA Security Services were being 
conducted fully compliant to SAA’s procurement 
procedures.” 
And he goes on finally to say at paragraph 11: 
“I further notified the Air Chefs Acting CEO of 
BOSASA’s 
claimed 
capability 
for 
consideration 
20 
amongst the other possible service providers for 
interventions the Air Chefs team were considering 
at the time.” 
And then he says he had no subsequent interactions with 
BOSASA.  Did those, Myeni again just for your version do 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 62 of 265 
 
you confirm that any of those accounts of the meeting took 
place? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni the evidence about the 
security installation at your home was first received by the 
Commission through Mr Agrizzi and as I indicated to you 
earlier Mr Le Roux then gave evidence to confirm that he 
had done the installation at your home in Richards Bay, he 
gave the approximate value of it, he indicated how many 
10 
days it has taken and then the Commission has identified 
that in October of last year a search and seizure warrant 
was obtained by the  Hawks in relation to the evidence that 
had been given at the Commission, are you aware of that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The search and seizure – well for 
reasons that will become apparent I don’t actually think I 
should refer to it as a search and seizure, an operation 
took place in October of last year pursuant to that warrant 
20 
at your residence in Richards Bay, can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question, so I don’t incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Le Roux was involved in that 
operation, as was Captain Nevin of the Hawks and both of 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 63 of 265 
 
them had deposed to affidavits which appear in your 
bundle Ms Myeni, I would like to go to first Mr Nevin’s 
affidavit, you will find that at DD34B at page1936.  No 
sorry, I think that page ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   I have it Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think it starts at 1941.  Oh sorry, I got 
confused ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   I have it Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let’s start – apologies chair, I would like 
to start at 1936 but that is not Captain Nevin’s affidavit, 
10 
that is Richard Le Roux’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So do you have 1936 in front of you Ms 
Myeni? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got page 1936 in front of you? 
MS MYENI:   Yes I do Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair this is the first time we are coming 
to this affidavit of Mr Le Roux, now this is actually the 4 t h 
affidavit that Mr Le Roux has provided to the Commission.  
20 
May I request that we enter it as Exhibit DD34B.37 in 
accordance with the index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Richard Le Roux 
starting at page 1936 is admitted as Exhibit DD34B.37. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair and Ms Myeni what Mr Le Roux 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 64 of 265 
 
begins by doing is really just for locating the read he talks 
a bit about the previous evidence he has given, he 
confirms again that he did the installation, that there were 
invoices identified which reflected the equipment that he 
purchased between the 21 s t of May and the 26 t h of May 
2014.  He again confirms that it took approximately 21 
days, he confirms who he was with when he did the 
installation, he confirms where they stayed, etcetera, and 
he concludes, at page 1937 to say at paragraph 13: 
“All 
the 
expenses 
relating 
to 
the 
security 
10 
equipment, 
the 
costs, 
the 
labour, 
the 
accommodation and the travel were all paid for by 
BOSASA or African Global Operations.” 
In paragraph 14 he says: 
“I in my duty as head of special projects have no 
personal knowledge of what if any arrangements 
had been made by BOSASA and Ms Myeni in regard 
to the costs made by BOSASA or African Global 
Operations.” 
Ms Myeni I think I  asked you earlier but in case I didn’t 
20 
can I just confirm did you ever reimburse BOSASA for the 
R486 514,63 that was installation costs?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you hear that Ms Myeni, can you still 
hear us?   It looks like she can’t hear us. 
MS MYENI:   There was a – there was no – ja, I can hear 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 65 of 265 
 
you now Chairperson, there was no connection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Ms Hofmeyr will repeat her 
question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I was just asking Ms Myeni for 
confirmation whether you ever reimbursed BOSASA for the 
R486 514,63 that this installation cost at your home? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson, so I avoid 
incriminating myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess Ms Hofmeyr when you say 
installation costs, it sounds like it is just labour costs. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean including material? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
So 
that 
is 
an 
estimate 
of 
the 
approximate cost, this is dealt with at paragraph 12, of the 
equipment and labour as he previously set out, thank you 
for that clarification Chair.  Chair just before I continue 
with the questions I have just been sent a note by the 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
Commission 
that 
they 
are 
having 
20 
difficulty making contact with ms Myeni’s lawyers to 
arrange for the drop off of the hard copy file in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I have been asked if I could just ask 
my learned friend if they can please make arrangements so 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 66 of 265 
 
that that contact can be made so that we can facilitate the 
drop off as soon as you are able to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and somebody will tell them who to 
contact within the Commission to make that possible? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well as I understand it the Commission 
has the contact number and is endeavouring to contact the 
legal representative. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He hasn’t answered those calls but the 
person is waiting to make the delivery, so just so that you 
know we are ready and waiting at any point that contact 
can be made, we can facilitate the delivery, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   Because that delivery is urgent 
let me find out whether you think you could be of 
assistance in this regard? 
ADV BUTHELIZI:   Sorry Chair, unless we take five 
minutes and see what we can do, because now we have got 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   Okay let us take a five 
minute adjournment so that – because I was thinking that if 
we take a short adjournment it may well be that Ms Myeni 
who hears what Ms Hofmeyr has just said might on her side 
also contact her attorney to say please make yourself 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 67 of 265 
 
available, the Commission is trying to contact you to 
deliver a bundle, so let’s take shall we say ten minutes, it 
is twenty five past eleven, let us resume at twenty five to 
twelve. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I hope that it has been sorted out? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair contact has been made and 
arrangements are now being made for the handover.  So we 
really are very indebted to you.  Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you.  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair before we took the adjournment and 
Ms Myeni we were looking at Mr Richard Le Roux’s fourth 
affidavit before the commission and we were at page 1937 
and I would like us now to turn up page 1938 which 
commences with paragraph 15.   
Chair and Ms Myeni it is quite – it is not a very long 
20 
affidavit and it is quite an important piece of evidence before 
the commission and so I am going to propose just to read 
parts of it into the record also for your benefit Ms Myeni.  It 
has formed part of your bundle but you may not have had an 
opportunity to look at it in detail.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 68 of 265 
 
What Mr Le Roux starts to recount from paragraph 15 
is an operation that he was involved in in October of last 
year and just to – Ms Myeni are you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second are you – are you settled 
Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:  I am Chairperson thank you.  I have – I have the 
page in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Mr Le Roux was involved in this 
operation in October of 2019 and I just want to locate us in 
10 
time before – as I did before the break.   
 
Mr Agrizzi gives evidence in early 2019.  Mr Le Roux 
himself gives evidence in mid-2019 and then this is what 
follows.   
 
There is an operation conducted by the Hawks at Ms 
Myeni’s home in Richards Bay and what Mr Le Roux is now 
going to tell us about in his affidavit. 
 
So he says at paragraph 15: 
“In or about October 2019 I was taken to 
Durban by vehicle with Captain Nevin of the 
20 
South African Police Services the Hawks 
together with other members of the South 
African Police Services the Hawks.  Captain 
Nevin requested me to assist him in pointing 
out both the premises and the equipment 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 69 of 265 
 
myself and my team installed at Ms Myeni’s 
house on the instructions of BOSASA and 
Gavin Watson.  I remember there was also a 
police photographer that came down with the 
group of people.  Captain Nevin will be able 
to give more details as to the names and 
ranks of the people that came down with us.” 
 
And I just pause there to indicate we have obtained 
Chair an affidavit of Captain Nevin.  Mr Le Roux goes on to 
say: 
10 
“To the best of my recollection we went down 
to Durban on a Wednesday in October 2019 
where we slept over at a hotel in Durban we 
left Thursday morning for Richards Bay by 
road.  We travelled down in two vehicles.  
Captain Nevin asked me if I was in a position 
to point out the premises to him as he did not 
want to give me the address and when we 
arrived in Richards Bay I took them to the 
premises and pointed it out.  When we 
20 
arrived at the premises Ms Myeni was not 
there and we were not able to gain access to 
the premises.  We spent many hours sitting 
outside the premises and the South African 
Police Services were busy in telephonic 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 70 of 265 
 
discussions with both the State Advocate and 
what I understood were Ms Myeni’s lawyers.  
We did not gain access to the house and 
then we left to return to the hotel in Durban.  
We travelled at approximately six am the 
next morning back to Richards Bay and after 
various phone calls between the lawyers 
when we arrived there we were given access 
to only certain parts of the premises.  I 
personally waited outside until I was told by 
10 
Captain Nevin to come onto the premises.  
We only gained access on the Friday.” 
 
Ms Myeni I am now over at page 1939 and I am 
reading from paragraph 25.  What Mr Nevin then – sorry Mr 
Le Roux then says is: 
“When I went onto the premises I was able to 
point out various of the equipment that I had 
installed but this was only on the outside of 
the premises and I pointed out certain items 
inside the premises.  The Hawks were unable 
20 
to get access to other parts of the house as 
these were closed off with Trellidor and no-
one had keys in order to open same.  The 
main equipment that I together with my 
technicians had installed was contained in 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 71 of 265 
 
the main office inside the house to which no 
access was provided on the day of the 
search warrant execution.  This consisted of 
the switches and the mains system that 
operated the security equipment.  The Hawks 
were also unable to get access to the 
passage where I and my technicians had 
installed 
the 
alarm 
panel 
which 
had 
controlled the passives and the beams for 
the alarm system.  The Hawks were also 
10 
unable to get access to the garage where I 
had 
installed 
the 
energiser 
which 
had 
controlled 
the 
electric 
fence 
which 
surrounded the premises.  I recall that while I 
was 
doing 
the 
installation 
there 
was 
a 
standalone safe inside the room that was 
used as an office.  Towards the garage there 
was also a large walk-in safe door and this 
safe did not appear to be in use.  I myself 
have no personal knowledge as to why the 
20 
Hawks did not gain further access into the 
premises and I very, verily believe that 
Captain Nevin can give facts relating to why 
no further access was obtained in terms of 
the search warrant.  From the security 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 72 of 265 
 
equipment that access was obtained we 
managed to obtain serial numbers which 
were taken down by the Hawks and recorded.  
Members of the Hawks took photographs and 
kept notes of what I had pointed out to 
them.” 
 
And now from page 1940. 
“After the Hawks had completed the search 
of the premises I can confirm no security 
equipment were taken away from the – were 
10 
taken from the premises.  We then left to 
return to Jo'burg.  I further recall that while 
we were travelling back to Johannesburg I 
was in the motor vehicle when Captain Nevin 
received a phone call from one of his fellow 
officers.  The context of the conversation 
that I picked up was that Ms Myeni was 
extremely upset about the way in which the 
search 
warrant 
had 
been 
executed 
and 
conducted and she had phoned a very senior 
20 
person in Durban who had contacted Captain 
Nevin’s 
offices 
in 
order to register her 
complaint.” 
 
Ms Myeni before I ask for your comment on those 
events that took place in October last year I would like us 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 73 of 265 
 
just to look at what the search and seizure warrant entitled 
The South African Police Service to do at your premises. 
 
And you will find the search and seizure warrant 
attached to Captain Nevin’s affidavit which is the next 
document in the bundle. It commences at page 1941.  Do 
you have that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair if we could enter this affidavit of Mr 
Charles Nevin into the record as Exhibit DD34[b].38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the affidavit of Mr Charles Nevin 
10 
starting at page 1941 is admitted as Exhibit DD34[b].38. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Chair I will return if necessary in a 
moment to the actual affidavit itself but what Captain Nevin 
does is he gives his account which in substantial measure 
accords with the account that I have just given of Mr Le 
Roux and then he attaches to his affidavit both the warrant 
itself which you will see commencing at page 1946 as well as 
the application that was made for the search and seizure 
warrant 
which 
commences at 
page 
1950 
and 
that is 
accompanied by the affidavit supporting the search and 
20 
seizure warrant being issued and that commences at page 
1591. 
 
Now 
what 
Captain 
Nevin 
confirms he 
was the 
deponent both to the affidavit supporting the application for 
the search warrant as well as the affidavit that he has 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 74 of 265 
 
provided to the commission to explain what happened on the 
days of the execution of the warrant? 
 
You see what he says in essence to the Magistrate 
before he came in order to obtain the search warrant is that 
– and Chair I am going to paraphrase a bit and read 
pertinent parts where it is appropriate to do so.  And also for 
you benefit Ms Myeni.   
 
Captain Nevin confirms in his affidavit pursuant to 
which the search and warrant was given that he had been 
assigned to investigate the commission of the offence that is 
10 
dealt with further below in the SAPS criminal investigation 
team.  And at page 15 – 1952 paragraph 4.2 he says: 
“The offence being investigated at this point 
in this time in the above investigation which 
is relevant to this application and which is 
submitted is at least reasonably capable of 
being believe or suspected to have been 
committed 
or 
are 
being 
committed 
as 
[00:10:12] more detail below is as follows”. 
 
And then it is offences in relation to corrupt activities 
20 
relating to public a officer that is then set out.  Those are 
provisions from PRECCA as I understand the legislation. Oh 
Chair it seems that we might have lost connection to Ms 
Myeni.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 75 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We looking into it I can see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us wait hopefully the technicians 
will sort it out quickly.   
MS MYENI:  I am back Chairperson. There was – there was 
a connection problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but I have been following what – 
I have been hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have been hearing. 
MS MYENI:   What evidence leader was saying.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So what the affidavit does is it identifies 
that there is an investigation and reasonable grounds for 
suspecting that offences related to corrupt activities may 
have taken place.  And the evidence is then set out and that 
is the evidence of Mr Le Roux that was provided to this 
commission.   
 
Chair you will see that and Ms Myeni at page 1953 
from paragraph 5.2.  So what Captain Nevin is effectively 
doing here is going before a Magistrate to get a search and 
20 
seizure warrant of Ms Myeni’s premises based on the 
evidence that Mr Richard Le Rous presented to this 
commission and that is set out clearly in paragraph 5.2 
because he makes reference to the statement of Mr Le Roux 
before the commission. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 76 of 265 
 
 
And then he says that that evidence is enough to 
warrant the search and seizure – to warrant the issue of the 
search 
and 
seizure 
warrants 
and 
he 
concludes 
with 
something that I do believe it is necessary to read verbatim 
into the record.  And that appears at page 1956 from 
paragraph 9 on that page.  
 
You see paragraph 9 is headed The need for the 
search and seizure of the articles referred above.  And what 
Captain Nevin says in this affidavit pursuant to which a 
warrant was issued is the following; 
10 
“It is submitted that there is a need to secure 
the articles concerned by way of a search for 
and seizure of the articles at the premises 
concerned and in terms of a warrant that has 
been applied for and issued.” 
9.2 
“The reasons are: 
The above articles will form part of the 
evidence to strengthen the truthfulness of 
the allegations made against the suspect 
20 
thus strengthening the state case.  The said 
Ms Dudu Myeni is the alleged perpetrator of 
the offence concerned.  Any other manner of 
attempting to secure the articles concerned 
will forewarn the said Ms Myeni.  In this 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 77 of 265 
 
circumstance the said Ms Myeni is likely to 
take all reasonable steps she can to hide, 
destroy or otherwise prevent the articles 
being 
secured 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
investigation.” 
 
And then he seeks a warrant in the terms that were 
attached to his affidavit and that was a warrant entitling the 
Hawks to go to Ms Myeni’s premises to obtain access, to 
search for the various articles of security equipment that Mr 
Le Roux had testified about before this commission and to 
10 
seize those articles because and I emphasise again their 
view was that there would otherwise be a risk that that 
equipment 
could 
be 
hidden, 
destroyed 
or 
otherwise 
prevented from being secured for the purposes of an 
investigation.  And they made it clear that that would be 
evidence necessary in any subsequent case in involving Ms 
Myeni. 
 
So Ms Myeni I have indicated to you the basis upon 
which the warrant was sought and obtained and I have 
indicated to you what Ms Le Roux has said about how that 
20 
search warrant was executed.  Can you confirm whether 
there events did take place as Mr Le Roux describes them in 
October of last year? 
MS MYENI:  May I invoke the privilege Chairperson of not 
responding to the question so that I do not incriminate 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 78 of 265 
 
myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni I would like to put it to you that it 
is quite remarkable that the police service our country could 
obtain a search and seizure warrant to secure evidence that 
may be relevant in a criminal trial to arrive at your premises 
to seek to execute that warrant and to be kept outside the 
premises for a full day only to return the second day.  Were 
you involved in barring their entry for the first day to your 
premises? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
10 
that is being asked so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  When the police arrived on the second day 
they were then permitted access but they were not permitted 
to access the whole of the premises.  Were you involved in 
giving an instruction that they could only access parts of the 
premises? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not answer the question so 
that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You gave evidence yesterday that no-one 
accesses your premises without your permission.  So I put it 
20 
to you that it is likely that you were responsible for the 
instructions that denied access to certain parts of the 
premises. Can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 79 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The police were there with Mr Le Roux 
whose evidence before this commission is that he made 
these installations himself and he told them that in the parts 
of the house and the garage that they were not permitted to 
access he had installed the very equipment that the search 
and seizure warrant entitled the police to look for and seize.  
Did you give a specific instruction that they would not be 
permitted to do that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
in case I incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni if you did give this instruction do 
you have any idea of why the instruction was abided? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni maybe you can assist the 
commission with indicating to us how it can happen that a 
search and seizure warrant is authorised by a Magistrate. 
The police travel down to your home in Richards Bay.  That 
they are delayed for the first day.  They return on the second 
day in circumstances where the very reason that they got 
20 
this warrant is because they said that there reasonable 
grounds for suspecting the equipment may be hidden or 
destroyed or otherwise prevented from being accessed.  And 
then when they finally are given access they only are given 
access to parts of the house.  How does that happen Ms 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 80 of 265 
 
Myeni? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The final point I want to pick up on is you  
gave evidence yesterday that you do not have a safe either 
in your office, in your house or in your garage.  Mr Le Roux 
says you do.  Is he lying? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni I put it to you that you are – 
10 
well you have been and you are - remain a powerful 
person.  You are a person who can delay the police 
executing a search and seizure warrant as recently as 
October of last year.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MYENI:  I cannot comment Chairperson on somebody’s 
view unless I am asked a question about Ms Hofmeyr ’s 
view Chairperson.  He has made a view, it is his opinion.  I 
am – I cannot comment on somebody’s opinion. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni your way of engagements with 
institutions of the state is something on which this 
20 
commission has also received other evidence and that was 
evidence in relation to the activities of the state security 
agency at SAA while you were chairperson of the board 
and that is the topic I would like to move to next. 
 
And just with the [00:20:04] Chair I – I ordinarily 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 81 of 265 
 
would have concluded the BOSASA evidence but we will 
come back to the travel benefits once Ms Myeni has the 
bundle. But we are now going to move to the State Security 
Agency. 
 
Ms Myeni you had protection services provided to 
you from the State Security Agency, correct? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You received those protection services 
according to the evidence of Mr Y before this commission 
10 
from a special operations unit within the State Security 
Agency.  Can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson to avoid 
incriminating myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair when Mr Y gave evidence one of 
the things that was attached to his affidavit was the high 
level review panels review into the activities of the State 
Security Agency.  That panel had found that this special 
operations unit of the State Security Agency was quote “a 
law unto itself” and it was found to have “directly served 
20 
the interests of the executives”. 
 
Chair and Ms Myeni I do not suggest we go there 
but just for the record that reference is in Exhibit DD23 at 
page 237. 
 
What that report also confirms is that those who 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 82 of 265 
 
received protection services from the special operations 
unit were not entitled to it.   
 
Ms Myeni before you received the services did you 
ever make enquiries as to whether you would be lawfully 
securing them? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
to avoid incriminating myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Y’s evidence was that no security 
assessment seems to have been done on you before these 
protection services were provided according to the records 
10 
of the State Security Agency. Can you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  For the record Chair that aspect of Mr 
Y’s evidence can be found in the record at Exhibit DD23 
page 12 paragraph 5.3. 
 
The evidence of Mr Y, Mr Moonsamy whose affidavit 
was presented when Mr Y gave evidence is that those 
State Security personnel who were providing you with 
protection services were also on occasion involved in 
20 
confiscating items from members of the board of SAA while 
you were its chairperson.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Evidence has been previously been 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 83 of 265 
 
received by this commission that you on occasion would 
insist that members of the board and management of SAA 
leave all recording devices – well devices capable of 
recording so cell phones, laptops etcetera outside of 
meeting rooms and you further would require any notes 
from meetings to be torn up before people left the meeting.  
Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to that 
question so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni do you know why you were 
10 
provided with these services despite the fact that they 
were not lawfully procured? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni why did you arrange for the 
State 
Security Agency 
to 
conduct 
a 
security 
vetting 
operation on the managers and support staff at SAA/ 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson the question that is being asked 
is fact – is a factual question.  Why did I arrange or 
somebody has alleged or it is a fact.  Just clarity Chair 
20 
there – I am requesting respectfully for clarity. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes I will certainly assist Ms Myeni.  
What we did in the evidence last year is we had Ms Dlamini 
who I understand conducted the operation – the security 
vetting operation at SAA give evidence.  Do you know Ms 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 84 of 265 
 
Dlamini? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It was Ms Dlamini whose evidence was 
that it was pursuant to engagements between yourself and 
then Minister Mahlobo that the security operation was 
undertaken.  Can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  When Ms Dlamini gave evidence we were 
10 
taken to the exchange of letters between Minister Mahlobo 
and Minister Nene at the time in terms of which the 
security vetting operation had been authorised.  And what 
was given in that correspondence as the basis for the 
operation was that there was quote “sensitive information” 
that was being received on an on-going basis by the 
management and support staff of SAA.  Do you recall being 
concerned about the receipt of sensitive information by 
managers and support staff at SAA? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
20 
so that I – I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair again for the record that letter from 
Minister Mahlobo to Minister Nene in which this basis for 
the operation is set out can be found in Exhibit DD24 page 
17.  And also just for the record the evidence of Ms 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 85 of 265 
 
Dlamini occurred on the 19 February 2020.   
 
Now Ms Myeni in the course of Ms Dlamini’s 
evidence we established with her that the entire vetting 
operation was not in accordance with the governing 
legislation.  Are you aware of that evidence having been 
given? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see what we have probed with Ms 
Dlamini is that in terms of the governing legislation these 
10 
types of operations can only be conducted where classified 
information is being accessed by those who will be security 
vetted.  And that classified information is something 
different from sensitive information.  Before this operation 
was conducted at SAA did you ever take time to consider 
that 
distinction 
between 
classified 
information 
and 
sensitive information? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson with your permission can Ms 
Hofmeyr read the letter that she is talking about? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  With pleasure. 
20 
MS MYENI:  Or show me the letter that she is talking 
about? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  With pleasure let us go to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She will do so.  She will do so Ms Myeni. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now for this Ms Myeni it is a DD Bundle. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 86 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:  DD. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I am cautiously optimistic that you 
have it with you.  It is DD24 at page 17.  So if you will just 
find that bundle and then we can look at the letter.   
MS MYENI:  I have the letter Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So this letter Chair and Ms Myeni 
appears as an annexure – oh apologies Chair you do not 
have it.  Let me just pause for a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not yet. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni was quicker than you or I 
10 
taking the bundle so…  It will be page 17.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it now.  I have got it Ms 
Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Myeni I was just 
also locating you.  So this is the first annexure to Ms 
Dlamini’s affidavit which precedes it in this at BB24.  And 
what you will see there, it is a letter.  If you go over the page 
to 18, it is the letter that the then Minister of State Security, 
Mr David Mahlobo, writes to the then Minister of Finance, Mr 
Nene.  And this is a letter that was copied to you, the 
20 
Chairperson of the Board of SAA.  Do you remember 
receiving this letter around October of 2015? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson?  The reason 
why I ask it Chair was, for the record, the letter be read, as I 
requested to you Chairperson.  Because it appears from 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 87 of 265 
 
what is being said and asked.  I am the one who asked of the 
security of all South African state-owned enterprises.   
 
And I do not think there is any Chairperson who sits in 
any cabinet to take such decisions.  That is why Chairperson 
I am asking, for the record, that these letters be read 
because there is an insinuation that I would use state organs 
and the views that have been expressed here, which are 
unreserved views Chair.   
 
I am here as an innocent person.  And the way in which 
the evidence leader is trying to meet questions, is trying to 
10 
put my security issues back in my house that any person can 
just access somebody’s house without have been present in 
the premises.   
 
And I can see that I have no right as a black woman 
because no white woman who has a house without her being 
in the premises can allow any – just about any person to 
walk into the house.   
 
Here now, I am the one who has given the cabinet a 
decision to vet all state-owned enterprises.  It cannot be so.  
I am here because my guilt is the association with Jacob 
20 
Zuma.  So it cannot be.   
 
Chairperson, I want – I would like with your permission 
to get the protection.  I am an ordinary human being that 
makes mistakes.  Where I make a mistake, I admit to make a 
mistake but I cannot continue... continuously be associated 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 88 of 265 
 
with certain decisions in state organs that are unfair.  This is 
misleading.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   That is why I am asking for the record.  That 
the evidence leader read this letter.  Because now it appears 
as though I am the one who went and asked Minister 
Mahlobo and Minister Nene to investigate or to vet only 
South African Airways stuff.  I cannot be.  I protected the 
stuff of South African Airways through and through when I 
was chairperson there.  Thanks, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr will read that letter or 
she might ask you to read it so that it is read into the record.  
I just want to say about other matters that you have raised.   
 
That when there is only one side of the story, it could 
give rise to certain perspectives.  So where you are able to 
put your side of the story or your perspectives, it helps to 
give a balanced view. 
 
But when I say that, I am not saying that you must not 
invoke your privilege if you consider it appropriate.  I am just 
mentioning that there is an disadvantage or the disadvantage 
20 
is when there is only one side of the story as compared to 
where there are both sides. 
 
So when there is one side, that could easily give rise to 
misunderstandings or give rise to certain perspectives which 
might not be there if there are all sides placed before the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 89 of 265 
 
Commission.   
 
Ms Hofmeyr, are you going to read it or are you going to 
ask her to read it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I will read it with pleasure.  I do 
just want to indicate one point of clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because I do want Ms Myeni to 
understand that – and the record will show this – at no point 
did I in my questioning state that Ms Myeni had been 
responsible for the arranging of the vetting of all SOE’s.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is not something that I said.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What I said is that there had been 
evidence before this Commission that she was involved in 
arranging the vetting of SAA management and their support 
staff.  It is a very different statement and it is that statement 
that I am exploring with Ms Myeni in the evidence right now. 
 
And when she asked for clarification as to where that 
came from, I made it clear that it came from the evidence of 
20 
Ms Dlamini who had conducted the operation at SAA. 
 
And she was asked in particular about the background to 
these letters.  So it is not my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is Ms Dlamini’s statement giving 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 90 of 265 
 
evidence before this Commission.  But let me read the letter 
into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   As Ms Myeni has requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is a letter from Mr David Mahlobo, 
Minister of State Security, dated 18 October 2015, addressed 
to Mr N M Nene, Minister of Finance at the time.  Yes, 
continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  And just to note.  It is 
copied to Ms Myeni as Chairperson of the Board of SAA.  It 
10 
says:  Dear Colleagues.  So this is Minister Mahlobo 
speaking to Minister Nene. 
“Security vetting of the South African Airways 
Executive Management and Support Staff. 
1. The above matter refers. 
2. 
It has come to the attention of the State 
Security Agency that there is an urgent need for 
vetting and re-vetting of the state-owned enterprises 
given sensitive information received on an ongoing 
basis.” 
20 
 
I would just like to pause there.  It is precisely how it 
came to the attention of the State Security Agency that we 
traversed with Ms Dlamini her knowledge of what was 
happening around this. 
 
This letter was probed with her and her evidence was 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 91 of 265 
 
that there had, she assumed – I do not recall her having 
personal knowledge of it – but she assumed that there had 
been engagements between Minister Mahlobo and Ms Myeni 
about this. 
 
And certainly, the later letter is a letter from Ms Myeni 
providing the list of the people who are required to be 
vetted.   
 
Paragraph 3 goes on. 
“3. 
SOC, as the government entities have a huge 
impact on the economy of the country and therefore 
10 
extremely important for the SSA to conduct security 
vetting as per Section 1 of the National Strategic 
Intelligence Act.  That is Act 39 of 1994 as amended 
by Act 67 of 2002.   
It states that:  
“The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) has the 
mandate to vet all other national, provincial and 
local government departments, parastatals and their 
service providers.”” 
 
Chair, I should interject there as well just to give the 
20 
benefit of Ms Dlamini’s evidence.  We looked in her evidence 
for that alleged section from the act.  You may recall this 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I recall. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that section does not exist in the act. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 92 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it appears in this letter as though it is 
quoting from a section of the act.  It does not – it cannot be 
found in the act.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Paragraph 4 over the page reads: 
“4. 
This 
should 
be 
understood 
from 
the 
background of challenges affecting most of the 
state-owned companies. 
6. 
The chairperson of SAA will be required to 
10 
provide a list of all executive management and 
support staff. 
7. 
And update will be provided on completion. 
8. 
Your Sincerely.” 
 
And then it is signed by Minister Mahlobo.  Ms Myeni, so 
that is the letter that you have requested that we read into 
the record.  I had asked you before your last answer, 
whether prior to this exercise being conducted, you had ever 
had the occasion to consider the distinction between 
classified information and sensitive information.  What is 
20 
your response to that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond in case I 
incriminate myself?  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now this was a vetting operation that was 
conducted at SAA in late 2015.  Ms Dlamini’s evidence was 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 93 of 265 
 
also that there were no other state-owned entities that were 
vetted at that time.  The only other ones that have been 
vetted are with Transnet two years later in December of 2017 
and Eskom in April of 2019. 
 
So during the period of 2015 and 2016 there was no 
other vetting going on of SOE’s.  That reference you will find 
Chair and Ms Myeni in Ms Dlamini’s affidavit, which is earlier 
in the bundle, DD24 at page 15. 
 
Now Ms Myeni, one question that we probed with 
Ms Dlamini 
is 
the 
following. 
 
If 
the 
concern 
which 
10 
underscored the need to vet people at SAA, was there 
access to sensitive information.   
 
We asked her for her view.  Would it not then have made 
sense that not only management and support staff but also 
the board members of SAA be vetted?   
 
Did you ever consider before this operation whether you 
and your colleagues on the board should be vetted? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the question 
in case I incriminate myself?  But Chairperson, yesterday the 
Chair said, once I have responded to the question, I can say 
20 
something after I have responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you...  If it is a question in respect 
of which you do not invoke your privilege and you say 
something like yes to a question but you want to explain 
something.  Yes, that you can do.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 94 of 265 
 
 
So, in other words, or if you say:  No, but I want to 
explain something, that is fine.  But what I said this morning 
which I did not say yesterday was that if you invoke the 
privilege, then you invoke the privilege.   
 
You cannot give some answer and then afterwards you 
are saying you are invoking the privilege to that question.  
So you have to make up your mind on each question.  Am I 
invoking my privilege?  If you do, that is what you do.   
 
But if you elect to answer, then I am not... we are not... 
you are not forced to say yes or no necessarily if you would 
10 
like to explain something.   
 
Obviously, it helps if you are able to say yes or no or – 
in terms of questions so that we make progress.  But if there 
is a need to qualify your explain, I will allow you to do that.  
You understand? 
MS MYENI:   Yes, thank you very much Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   I understand and it is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MYENI:   What I would like to say.  It is a comment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MYENI:   To you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MYENI:   It is unrelated to whether... to the question that 
was asked. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 95 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MYENI:   Under normal circumstances Chairperson, in 
state-owned enterprises, board members before they get 
appointed they would be vetted.  I am saying under normal 
circumstances.  This is a comment for you Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, Ms Dlamini indicated that no 
board members were vetted during this operation in late 
10 
2015.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   She indicated that in her view – and I 
would like your comment on whether you disagree with this 
view – if the management and support staff were being 
vetted because of access to sensitive information, and the 
board also had access to sensitive information, then the 
board members should also be vetted on the basis of 
Minister Mahlobo’s letter.  Do you agree with that view? 
20 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the view of 
Ms Dlamini in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know why this operation was 
conducted without board members who would have had as 
much access to sensitive information as anyone else in SAA, 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 96 of 265 
 
were not vetted? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson?  I invoked the 
privilege so I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you think it might have been because 
the board members did not want to be confronted with the 
very intimate questions that management were subjected to 
when they had to undergo the polygraph tests? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Would you agree that being asked a 
10 
question like:  Have you ever had an affair?  Is a sensitive 
and intimate matter? 
MS MYENI:   I was not there.  Chairperson, may I not 
respond to this question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   [No audible reply]  
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to this question because I do 
not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
We 
have 
received 
evidence 
from 
Ms Phumeza Nhantsi 
before 
this 
Commission 
that 
you 
conveyed to her that you wanted to use the outcome of the 
20 
vetting to remove one of the people in the Finance 
Department of SAA, Ms Lindsay Olitzki.  Do you dispute her 
evidence on that count? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself?   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 97 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   For the record again.  And Ms Myeni, if 
you would like to go there, we can.  Ms Nhantsi’s affidavit on 
the score can be found in Exhibit DD2, page 22, paragraph 
70.  Her version before this Commission is that you told her 
to get rid of Ms Nhantsi because she failed...  Sorry, to get 
rid of Ms Olitzki because she failed the vetting on account of 
her dual citizenship.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Nhantsi’s evidence was further to the 
10 
effect that when...  Well, she had a conversation, I think it 
was with Mr Zwane.  She felt a bit uncomfortable about this.  
They were worried that there would be labour issues if this 
was taken forward and so she did not take it forward.  And 
she said when she relayed that to you, you said that you 
were not happy about it.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   What did you say?  Who told... who sent 
information to SAA that the person is that...  Well, did not 
pass the vetting?  Sorry, did you say that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, sorry.  So let me go back a step.  The 
20 
outcome 
of 
Ms 
Olitzki’s 
security 
vetting 
was 
that 
...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   Where is it?  On the...  On the file, is it here? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Olitzki’s outcome? 
MS MYENI:   Yes. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 98 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it is not because State Security 
Agency did not provide us with those documents.  But we do 
have an affidavit of Ms Olitzki confirming that what was 
communicated to her was that she...   
 
Well, that her dual citizenship was flagged as an issue 
for her security vetting and she was asked for her attitude in 
relation to her dual citizenship.  So that is the background 
Ms Myeni.   
 
But what I was putting to you was that Ms Nhantsi gave 
evidence in this Commission that you, Ms Myeni, said to 
10 
Ms Nhantsi that you wanted to remove Ms Olitzki on the 
grounds or following from the fact that she had failed the 
vetting on account of her dual citizenship.  Do you dispute 
having said that to Ms Nhantsi? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this 
question?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that on the grounds that it may tend to 
incriminate you? 
MS MYENI:   Sorry, Chairperson I missed that.  There was a 
bit of delay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, she is asking whether that is on the 
grounds that you do not want to incriminate yourself. 
MS MYENI:   Yes, I completed the sentence Chairperson.  I 
did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, apologies. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 99 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we did not hear this side. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, because you have raised the 
issue.  I actually do think it is fair to you to read exactly 
what Ms Nhantsi said on this score.  And if... would you like 
to take up the bundle?  It is DD2.  So you can have it in front 
of you. 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I thought there was a letter that 
Ms Hofmeyr was referring to that came from the State 
Security that made or communicated the outcomes of vetting.  
That was the main question that I was asking because I 
10 
heard Ms Hofmeyr saying it was communicated to her.  I 
thought she is referring to me communicating to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She is going to ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   Not to Ms Nhantsi.  Not to Ms Nhantsi.  To 
Olitzki. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay she is going to clarify that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, let me just be clear.  Sorry.  And you 
know, there might have been a bit of a break in the 
transmission. 
MS MYENI:   There was.  There was. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what happened is.  Ms Nhantsi gives 
evidence before this Commission about a conversation that 
she had with you, according to her evidence.  And I just think 
it is appropriate, given that this is a matter that requires 
clarity. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 100 of 265 
 
 
And in fairness to you Ms Myeni, I completely accept 
that we should be absolutely clear about it.  If we go to 
Bundle 
DD2 
at 
page 
21 
at 
paragraph 
70. 
 This 
is 
Ms Nhantsi’s affidavit. 
 
Ms Myeni, you may want to get it in front of you.  I see 
you gone to do that.   
MS MYENI:   Yes, I am doing that.  Thank you, Chair.  I have 
got DD2.  Phumeza Nhantsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MYENI:   Sorry, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr.  I believe I got it too. 
MS MYENI:   I have DD2 and I have Phumeza Nhantsi’s 
statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 21 Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Page 21.  Chair, yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 21.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now at paragraph 70 at the bottom of that 
page just before there is a heading, Vetting Result of 
Ms Lindsay Olitzki that were performed by State Security 
Agency.  And I am reading from paragraph 70 there of 
20 
Ms Nhantsi’s affidavit.  She says: 
“Ms Myeni told me that the SSA people are still in 
progress with vetting for top security clearance 
certificate but they are done with some people. 
She added that one of my staff members failed the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 101 of 265 
 
vetting due to dual citizenship.  She did not show 
me the results, only told me who it was. 
She stressed that the Finance Department is a very 
sensitive area.  Therefore, I cannot afford to have 
someone who has failed the security clearance. 
She suggested the following day I should have an 
off-site meeting with Ms Lindsay and first update her 
about the vetting results and secondly give her two 
options. 
Either to dismiss her or she could choose an 
10 
alternative department to work within SAA Group. 
I discussed this matter with the acting CEO the 
following day, raising my concerns about Ms Myeni’s 
instructions as it may lead to SAA facing labour 
disputes especially when the employees are able to 
prove that the SSA process was never part of their 
employment contract when they were appointed by 
SAA. 
We then agreed that we will discuss this item at the 
next Exco meeting and the company needs to 
20 
compile or derive a policy that will address this and 
the policy. 
I 
did 
not 
arrange 
any 
meeting 
with 
Lindsay.  
Ms Myeni called me the same day and asked how 
the meeting went between Lindsay and I. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 102 of 265 
 
I gave her the update and she...” 
 
That is the reference to you, as I understand it in the 
context. 
“...was not happy with it.” 
 
Do you dispute Ms Nhantsi’s evidence on this issue? 
MS MYENI:   I will not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I would like to move from the 
involvement of the State Security Agency, both in providing 
protection services to you and in conducting security vetting 
10 
at 
SAA 
to 
evidence 
that 
has 
been 
received 
in 
this 
Commission by former Minister Nene and Minister Gordhan.  
So that... those are the topics we are going to move to now. 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chairperson.  I am ready.  Sorry, I was 
just moving this file.  I am ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now Ms Myeni, Minister Nene gave 
evidence before this Commission about a meeting that he 
was called to in November 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am giving away this file. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you can do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And DD24, can I give it away? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you can.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 103 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We completed our work within there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so we just remain with 34? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now Ms Myeni, when former Minister Nene 
testified before this Commission, he gave evidence about a 
meeting that was called in November 2014 with the former 
President and yourself.  Are you aware of that evidence? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
10 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now his evidence was that that meeting 
was called after he had shared concerns about your 
leadership at SAA with colleagues at an ANC Study Group 
Meeting.  Were you present at that meeting? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now what Minister Nene said is, after he 
had communicated those concerns at the ANC Study Group 
Meeting.  He surmises that somebody told you.   
20 
 
He does not have actual knowledge of that but he 
surmises because the next thing that happens is, he is called 
to a meeting with you and former President Zuma. 
 
I would like to ask you some questions about that 
meeting.  Can you confirm whether meeting took place? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 104 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   I do not have...  Sorry.  I do not have a 
response Chairperson.  May invoke the privilege of not 
responding to the question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Minister Nene said that during the course 
of the meeting, you complaint to the former President Zuma 
about him. Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
because in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Minister Nene said that during that 
meeting, he said to former President Zuma that you were 
10 
obstructive and that you played the media.  Do you dispute 
that he said that to President Zuma? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question?  May I invoke the privilege so I do not incriminate 
myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   He also said that at that meeting, he told 
former President Zuma that the board under your leadership 
had been acting recklessly.  Do you dispute that he told that 
to former President Zuma? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson?  I would not 
20 
want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He also said that he communicated to 
former President Zuma at that meeting that you should be 
removed as chairperson of the board  Do you dispute that he 
said that? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 105 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   He said of that meeting that he also 
conveyed to former President Zuma that as a result of the 
crisis situation that was then present in SAA – remember we 
are in November 2015 – there was a serious threat that the 
airline 
would 
default 
on 
its 
government 
guaranteed 
obligations and that that would have a ripple effect to the 
fiscus and the economy as a whole.  Do you dispute that he 
said that to former President Zuma? 
10 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond in case I 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Minister Nene was quite clear in his 
evidence before this Commission that he was concerned 
about your Board.  But he has also given evidence in which 
he has indicated that any recommendation for a new board 
of SAA at that time, that did not include you, would not 
pass through cabinet because former President Zuma 
would not support it.  Do you dispute his version on that 
score? 
20 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you and former President Zuma ever 
discuss the view that Minister Nene conveyed to former 
President Zuma at that November 2015 meeting? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 106 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you and former President Zuma ever 
discuss what Minister Nene had communicated at that 
November 2015 meeting? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question, 
Chairperson?  May I invoke my privilege that I was given 
by you not to incriminate myself.  But, Chair, please allow 
me to say something which will not invoke the private 
privilege or maybe respond to the message? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
10 
MS MYENI:   It is something, Chair, I would like to just 
state before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS MYENI:   I said something yesterday, Chair, I would 
like to say it.  I am guilty, Chairperson, by association of 
President Zuma and it appears here there has been very 
glaring lines to everyone who chooses to make glaring – 
sorry, who chooses not to distinguish properly between the 
relationship, 
the 
professional 
relationship 
and 
the 
relationship where a person presides over the Jacob Zuma 
20 
Foundation.  I have been guilty since I assumed office as 
the Chairperson of the Jacob Zuma Foundation.  I am 
stating 
this, 
Chairperson, 
because 
a 
professional 
relationship and an ordinary relationship, those are two 
separate relationships.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 107 of 265 
 
Therefore, I am just saying this, Chair, because it 
does bother me and the Chairperson did say if something I 
feel strongly about, I must put it before the Chairperson.  I 
am still doing the same, Chair, because there has been a 
narrative that I cannot kill that suggest that being or 
working for a foundation meant that I would willy nilly and 
anyhow discuss issues that are not relevant to the 
foundation anywhere or anytime and it is a lie that 
somebody can just use proximity to do certain things that 
are untoward and that are not professional.  That also 
10 
compromises the formal relationship that is written down 
that talks to issues of working and operational matters of 
either the Foundation of South African Airways.   
And Chair, lastly, may I put it on record that South 
African Airways was assigned to President Ramaphosa as 
a Deputy President at the time who was responsible for 
government business.  SOEs that were seen by cabinet to 
be problematic were all assigned under President Cyril 
Ramaphosa.   
But, as you have seen, Chairperson, that all the 
20 
time whenever there is SAA matter and former Chairperson 
matter on SAA, I would be seen walking with the President 
who visited South African Airways in the media and 
paraded as President Jacob Zuma is the only one who 
visited SAA.  President Ramaphosa, as Deputy President, 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 108 of 265 
 
responsible for government business, visited South African 
Airways but you will never see a picture of Dudu Myeni 
with President Ramaphosa on any media yet I welcomed 
him and I walked him out, as I did with President Zuma.  
And President Cyril Ramaphosa was happy when we met at 
SAA and he really sang praises about the work we had 
done. 
 
That, 
I 
believe, 
that 
was 
the 
statement 
of 
confidence because I never worked for his foundation nor 
did I have proximity because of the foundation-related 
work.   
10 
I am just putting it across to you, Chair, as 
something that is inside my spirit to share with you.  Thank 
you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But I must just point out the 
questions that Ms Hofmeyr was putting to you related to 
evidence that was placed before the Commission by Mr 
Nene in regard to a meeting that he said he had with you 
and former President Zuma.  That is where the questions 
emanated from.  Okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Just before your last 
20 
interchange with the Chair, Ms Myeni, I had asked you 
whether you had discussed 
what Minister Nene had 
communicated at that meeting with former President Zuma 
afterwards.  I understand you to have invoked your 
privilege to decline to answer, so I would like to ask the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 109 of 265 
 
next question. 
 
Ms 
Myeni, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
that 
having 
been 
communicated to former President Zuma at the meeting 
with 
the 
then 
finance 
minister, 
can 
you 
assist 
the 
Commission in understanding how, if you did, you managed 
to persuade former President Zuma to retain you on the 
board despite what Minister Nene was reckless leadership 
that risked SAA defaulting on loans? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, do you have the – does the 
Commission have the minutes of the meeting referred to? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not believe that there were minutes 
taken, this was not a minuted meeting.  What is your 
answer to the question whether – on what basis you 
managed, if you did, to persuade former President Zuma to 
retain your on the board despite the Minister of Finance 
having said to him that he was worried that your reckless 
leadership would risk SAA defaulting on loans? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to this question, 
Chairperson, so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, former Minister Nene also 
20 
linked his removal a month later in December 2015 
amongst other things to the views he had expressed at that 
meeting about you to former President Zuma.  Do you have 
any insight as to the reasons why former Nene was 
removed in December 2015.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 110 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, are you aware of what 
happened to the market the morning after former Minister 
Nene was removed in December of 2015? 
MS MYENI:   Which market, Ma’am? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, it was the impact really on the 
bond yields and the depreciation of the South African 
currency the next morning.  Are you aware of those 
impacts? 
10 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I need to understand not the – 
run the rigged markets-related issues, I must get a bit of 
clarity because there was too much of the rigging of the 
rand during that time and there was also a lot of other 
economic-related issues that happened in many other 
places.  So I need to know what is specific about this 
particular question that when Mr Nene was removed the 
market performed badly or the rigging?  Was it the rigging 
of the rand?  Sorry, was this the rigging of the rand or was 
it the poor performance of general markets?  I need to 
20 
understand because I am not a finance person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr will respond. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is – in fairness to you, Ms Myeni, 
an issue that the Commission itself has grappled with and 
the Commission in fact requested National Treasury to do a 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 111 of 265 
 
submission for it about this very thing.  It has colloquially 
been 
called 
the 
impact 
of 
Nenegate 
and 
what 
the 
Commission received was an affidavit from the then 
Director General of National Treasury and this is what is 
said in that affidavit, that: 
“The morning after the announcement of Minister 
Nene’s removal there was an increase in bond 
yields 
and 
a 
depreciation 
of 
the 
currency 
as 
investors re-priced risks associated with investing 
in South Africa. “ 
10 
Were you aware that Minister Nene’s removal had that 
impact? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, to this 
question so that I do not incriminate myself.  The clarity 
was well-received, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can just mention, Ms 
Hofmeyr, the name of the former Director General who 
deposed to that affidavit. 
MS MYENI:   Yes, that was Director General Madondo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the other point that is made in that 
submission before the Commission is that the change in 
ministers – so the removal of Minister Nene and his 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 112 of 265 
 
replacement with Minister van Rooyen was – increased the 
perceptions of risk that the South African Government’s 
commitment to fiscal sustainability was weakening.  Were 
you aware of that impact of the removal of then Minister 
Nene? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni – Chair, I see that we are just 
before one o’clock and I am about move on so it may be 
appropriate to take the break now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, let us take the lunch break, 
we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay are we ready? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Myeni before the break 
we were dealing with the evidence that former Minister 
Nene had presented before the Commission, about that 
20 
meeting that he had with you and former President Zuma in 
November of 2015.  I would now like to turn to the 
evidence 
that 
Minister 
Gordhan 
gave 
before 
the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just before you do that Ms Hofmeyr 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 113 of 265 
 
I want to indicate that I cannot think of what possible crime 
Ms Myeni could expose herself to by answering questions 
relating to that meeting.  As I understand from Mr Nene’s 
evidence that meeting was a meeting which where Mr Zuma 
was seeking to try and help the two of them to resolve 
some tensions between the two of them.  I cannot possibly 
think what crime she could expose herself to be prosecuted 
about in relation to the content of that meeting. 
 
So unless her Counsel intends advancing any 
argument I am inclined to ask her to respond to those 
10 
questions.  Mr Buthelezi? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Thank you Chair.   The question that 
the Chair says he sees no potential exposure to, I think it 
is inherent in the subsequent questions that followed, one 
being it was alleged that as a result of that meeting Ms 
Myeni’s advice or impressed upon President Zuma to 
dismiss Minister Nene that is number 1, number 2, that 
dismissal subsequently led to at the time the markets.  
Now it is the questions that follow that are open to – 
because if she then concedes that she participated in a 
20 
meeting with Minister Nene and President Zuma and 
shortly thereafter Minister Nene was dismissed.   
It then ventures into the potential that an allegation 
could be made that it could have been as an allegation 
currently exists to say it is on the back of her influence on 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 114 of 265 
 
the President that a Minister was dismissed.   
So I think Chair it is the aversion to subsequent 
questions that a question often is preceded by a plain and 
a factual question but if you then allow yourself into the 
terrain of answering that question you then bound yourself 
to answer all questions that follow because you say yes I 
confirm I participated in this meeting, yes I was in this 
meeting.  Therefore, things that flow and the allegations 
that flow from admitting to being present in that meeting 
you are very stranded in terms of now not being able to 
10 
deny your participation there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see I think we are all agreed 
that she needs to deal with each question on its own 
merits. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it maybe that she might not have 
reasonable grounds to refuse to answer a particular 
question but she might have reasonable grounds to answer 
the next one.           
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is a follow up so I think a lot 
depends simply on whether in regard to each question if 
one can say they are reasonable grounds.  
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But even with that, with what you have 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 115 of 265 
 
said in mind I would still have the concern that what crime 
she could expose herself to being charged for is not clear 
even if she could be said to have had an influence on Mr 
Zuma.  Even if she said you must fire Mr Nene now I 
cannot know what crime she could possibly be…[intervene] 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   It is the greatest irony Chair because 
the very purpose of this Commission is to answer that very 
same question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is what I want you to address 
to say well this could lead her to that particular crime that 
10 
is what I want because there can be a number of things 
that maybe are improper but are not crimes, you see.  
Some are improper but are also crimes but there may be 
others that are not proper, that are improper but not 
crimes.  So that is my concern and it arises from seeking 
to strike a balance between one respecting her privilege to 
not to incriminate herself but at the same time making sure 
that we allow that only when it falls within the reasonable 
grounds that case law talks about and that where the risk 
of being prosecuted criminally is quite remote that that 
20 
falls outside the privilege.  So it is a question of trying to 
see where we should strike that balance. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Well Chair maybe you may provide 
guidance but the difficulty is here.  Incrimination may not 
extend to a criminal prosecution but incrimination may 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 116 of 265 
 
extend to a point where somebody concedes to participates 
in an improper conduct which enables you from where you 
sit to make an adverse finding and that adverse finding 
against the person made down the line constitutes part of 
conduct used in evidence in a criminal prosecution even in 
an unrelated crime but can be used to corroborate certain 
facts or can be used to draw certain conjecture or 
circumstantial evidence that may then stand as a bulk of 
evidence against an individual.   
So it is a general aversion to saying to what extent 
10 
can I expose myself given the unknown and what the 
potential consequences may be and I cannot participate in 
my own persecution and that is the difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, do you have something to 
say about this? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I do Chair I have listened carefully 
to my learned friend.  The one thing I have not heard him 
do is identify a crime that answering these questions could 
possibly lead to.  I have heard about adverse findings 
being 
made, 
I 
have 
heard 
about 
adverse 
findings 
20 
potentially indicating improper conduct but I have not yet 
heard the identification of a crime and I think that that is 
something that would weigh will you as you decide whether 
to exercise your discretion to require an answer.  
The second point and it is the final one I wish to 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 117 of 265 
 
make is on this line between the first seemingly innocuous 
question to a question where you might get into the realm 
of an exposure to a criminal charge there is a protection 
living in the regulations of this Commission.  So if you are 
deciding between you know a series of questions the fourth 
of which could expose to a criminal charge and you at the 
third and you happen to cross over to the fourth if an 
answer is given Regulation 82 of the regulations of this 
Commission said and I quote: 
“A self-incriminating answer or a statement given by 
10 
a witness before the Commission shall not be 
admissible as evidence against that person in any 
criminal proceedings brought against that person 
instituted in any court except and I am paraphrasing 
now for the crime of perjury.” 
So 
Chair 
against 
that 
back 
drop 
it 
would 
be 
the 
submissions of the legal team that asking Ms Myeni or 
directing Ms Myeni to answer about that meeting does not 
on a reasonable basis tend to implicate her in the 
commission of a crime.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Buthelezi.  
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Chair the position as it existed at 
the formulation of the Commission under Rule 82 I would 
agree with Ms Hofmeyr that that was the initial position but 
the subsequent amendment that have come through that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 118 of 265 
 
enabled 
the 
Commission 
to 
collaborate 
with 
law 
enforcement agencies in our view invalidates 82 or are at 
odds with 82 and 82 now as it exists in our view is no 
longer in effect.  We are no longer enjoying what we 
thought 
we 
initially 
enjoyed 
under 
82 
because 
the 
subsequent 
amendments 
that 
have 
come 
through 
as 
promulgated following I would not give you the exact date 
but it was quite recently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   January.           
ADV BUTHELEZI:   January, at the start of this year. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think January or later.          
ADV HOFMEYR:   These ones were July.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh July.  
ADV BUTHELEZI:   It was July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were January ones and then July 
ones. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   But the recent ones gave the 
Commission bigger teeth and the size teeth that the 
Commission now has in our view no longer give us the 
protection that we enjoyed previously under 82.  So that 
20 
has not been tested outside this Commission but to ere on 
the side of safety we are assuming the worst in terms of 
what those regulations and amendments are to think that if 
we were to go and rely on a defence of that we were 
protected by 82 that defence can be invalidated by these 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 119 of 265 
 
amendments Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think somebody might just have to read 
the provision relating to the sharing of information.        
ADV HOFMEYR:   I can do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my understanding is that there is 
nothing in the provisions that relate to the sharing of 
information between the Commission and the NPA or law 
enforcement agencies that says evidence given by a 
witness in the Commission will be admissible against that 
witness in subsequent criminal proceedings.   
10 
So one has got to read different provisions of the 
regulations as far as possible in a manner that would make 
all of them work and if one adopts that approach as I recall 
that provision simply talks about sharing of information but 
does not say what the law enforcement agencies may do 
with the information once they have got it.  Obviously they 
must not do anything that is not permitted by law now one 
of the things that Regulation 82 says is: 
“Any evidence that a witness has given in the 
Commission will not be admissible against that 
20 
witness in any criminal proceedings.”     
That might not mean that the evidence of that witness 
cannot be used cannot be used against somebody else no 
if there were two or three people who were involved in a 
crime and one gives evidence before the Commission the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 120 of 265 
 
one who gives evidence that evidence it may well be 
argued maybe used against the other one, the other 
person.   
But in terms of Regulation 82 it cannot be used 
against the one who gave evidence and the idea has to be 
obviously that the drafters of the regulation sort to 
encourage persons to come forward and give evidence.  So 
the one interpretation to which I am inclined is the one that 
would say the sharing of information, the provision relating 
to the sharing of information does not say, does not nullify 
10 
what Regulation 82 says.   
The 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
who 
obtained 
information from the Commission cannot subsequently 
present that evidence in court in a criminal case against 
the person who gave it.  They may well use it and present 
it against somebody else.  So if that interpretation is 
correct then the immunity would still be in tact what it 
would mean is simply that where you have given evidence 
you are protected from the NPA or the Police using that 
evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings against you.  
20 
They might use it against somebody else but not against 
you.  That is one possible interpretation there may be other 
possible interpretations.  
ADV 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
 
May 
I 
go 
to 
another 
possible 
interpretation Chair? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 121 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.     
ADV BUTHELEZI:   It is the one of what we have now 
observed in recent months where persons testifying at this 
Commission are arrested days after testifying here and 
whether correctly or incorrectly so an impression is created 
that says the basis of your arrest is your evidence at the 
Commission and it now not once not twice I think it has 
happened to I think three people who have testified and 
have subsequently been arrested and what is also a 
distinguishing factor is that this was not happening pre-
10 
July regulations but post July regulations.   
We now have a sequence of events where person’s 
come testify at the Commission and then this follows.  We 
are here preceded by media reports saying you are due for 
arrest in this week.  So our aversion to whatever and we do 
not even know why what the potential charge may be but 
having observed how the law enforcement agencies have 
behaved in relation to the Commission and what is now 
playing out as an interplay between for example sorry to 
cite but I will cite the issue of Mr Vincent Smith.  His 
20 
charged based on things that relates exactly to his 
evidence at this Commission.   
So we cannot from where we sit take the risk of 
saying we have got this protection of 82 when we are now 
seeing something playing out totally different on the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 122 of 265 
 
surface and ours now to ere completely on the side of 
caution to say look we are highly exposed and we want to 
minimise the level of our exposure in the best way possible 
and going back to where Chair ’s comments initiated from 
on the point of how can this question potentially expose 
you.   
But it can potentially expose you where your 
admission corroborates the evidence of another or where 
your admission corroborates certain other things which 
ultimately two, four questions down the line puts you in a 
10 
hole.  So rather than open yourself up because if you have 
admitted to a question to say I admit that I was in this 
meeting then the Chair can now compel you to answer to 
the contents of this meeting, and once you have stepped 
into that room then we no longer can invoke and say I do 
not want to incriminate myself because you have now said 
you were there and rightly the Chair can now then compel 
you to say you have already admitted to being there but 
the safer position is if I say no I am not telling you if I was 
there or not then I have not given the Chair a basis to say 
20 
answer because you have not confirmed your presence in 
that meeting and that is the dilemma Chair.  And we sit on 
different spectrums Chair, Ms Hofmeyr sits on what she 
needs to do, I sit on what I need to guard against and you 
sit on what you need to do. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 123 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   It is this convergence now that is 
becoming a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I understand of course one does 
not know what prompts law enforcement agencies to act in 
a certain way at a certain time but one expects them to act 
in accordance with the law.  If they act or carry out arrests 
because they believe that people who have given evidence 
that they can use in court evidence that has been given by 
witnesses in the Commission against the witnesses that 
10 
might be there view but the Commission believes that 
Regulation 82 provides protection.   
Of course I must just say that it is a matter of 
concern where people who are mentioned by witnesses 
who have come before the Commission and have sort to 
assist the Commission in its work if we have been 
mentioned by witnesses who have come forward to the 
Commission to assist the Commission as having being 
involved in crime and people who have not themselves 
come forward to assist the Commission get dealt with in a 
20 
manner that may give rise to a perception that law 
enforcement agencies are punishing those who cooperate 
with the Commission that is a matter of concern because it 
could discourage other people who want to come to the 
Commission and tell the Commission about matters that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 124 of 265 
 
are being investigated by the Commission if there is a 
pattern that after you have given evidence before the 
Commission you get arrested.   
So that would be a matter of concern.  I have said 
publically that when certain arrests were made last year 
which included Mr Agrizzi and no arrest were made of 
certain other people who had been mentioned by him in his 
evidence that according to his evidence seems to be very 
involved in acts of corruption, alleged acts of corruption it 
was a matter of concern because Mr Agrizzi could easily 
10 
say well I am no longer cooperating with the Commission 
fortunately, 
he 
continued 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Commission. 
So but of course we cannot make decisions based 
on what if the law enforcement agencies misread the law or 
attach a wrong interpretation of the law one has got to look 
at the law and determine what it means and then make a 
decision based on that.  Ms Hofmeyr you wanted to 
respond?                      
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair just one submission the privilege 
20 
against self-incrimination is not a privilege not to get 
arrested it is a privilege to decline to answer a question if 
the answer tends on reasonable grounds to expose you to 
on reasonable grounds to a criminal charge.  That is the 
only question that needs to be answered with respect.      
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 125 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay I am not going to make a 
blanket ruling but if you revert to that meeting I will look at 
each question as it comes and Ms Myeni can respond if 
she invokes the privilege and you – I will then look at each 
question as it comes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Ms Myeni you were following the 
exchange? 
MS MYENI:    Yes, Chairperson I was thank you very much.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni I was going to actually be 
moving from former Minister Nene’s evidence to the 
evidence 
that 
Minister 
Gordhan 
gave 
before 
the 
Commission and in particular when he spoke about matters 
relating to SAA on the 20 t h of November 2018 before the 
Commission.  Now his evidence was also to the effect that 
your conduct at SAA risks serious negative impacts for the 
fiscus.  Are you aware of his evidence in that regard?  
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He came before the Commission and 
testified that your efforts to seek to reverse Minister 
Nene’s decision on the airbus swop transaction would 
likely have triggered debt defaults by SAA due to the 
pressure 
that 
the 
pre-delivery 
payments 
under 
your 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 126 of 265 
 
proposed transaction would have placed on SAA’s cash 
reserves.  Ms Myeni you will recall that the airbus 
transaction that was before the Ministry of Finance in 
2015.  Do you dispute that your efforts would have had this 
effect on SAA’s cash reserves had you been successful in 
reversing Minister Nene’s decision?       
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond so that I 
avoid incriminating myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Minister Gordhan testified before the 
Commission that he decided not to reverse Minister Nene’s 
10 
decision despite your application to him for that to be done 
and he decided not to reverse it for the very real impact he 
believed it would have on SAA’s cash reserves.  But then 
he received a call from former President Zuma asking if he 
would not reconsider his decision.  Did you ask former 
President Zuma to place that call to Minister Gordhan?   
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you ever discuss with former 
President Zuma your efforts to seek to reverse Minister 
20 
Nene’s decision on the airbus swop transaction?    
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni two successive Finance 
Ministers have testified before this Commission to the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 127 of 265 
 
effect that your approach to SAA and its financial stability 
during particularly the period of 2015 was reckless.  Do 
you dispute that evidence?  
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question in case I incriminate myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I would now like to go back if I 
may to the Blake’s Travel aspect of the BOSASA evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Just to summarise where we are 
because of that interaction things have not flown as 
10 
schematically as I had hoped but what we traversed in the 
evidence so far is BOSASA evidence today at least, 
BOSASA evidence about alleged payments being made and 
benefits being given because of a particular role that Ms 
Myeni is alleged to have played in facilitating matters with 
former President Zuma.    
We have then looked at in the context of some of 
that evidence related to the security installation, we have 
looked at what happened with the search and seizure 
operation at the end of last year, we have looked at the 
20 
State security agencies activities within SAA and then we 
took that to some of the previous Ministers testimony.  I am 
now going to loop back to BOSASA to complete that aspect 
and then we will move onto SAA matters I think for the 
remainder of the afternoon. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 128 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.             
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni in order to deal with the 
Blake’s Travel matters you will need that file T18 that I 
understand you now have with you; could you have that in 
front of you.   
MS MYENI:   Yes, I do Chairperson and I thank you very 
much for arranging for its delivery, much appreciated.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, Mr Agrizzi apologies Chair, Mr 
10 
Agrizzi gave evidence to the Commission that BOSASA 
used Blake’s Travel to facilitate travel arrangements for 
various government officials and people who they believed 
had influence over and amongst others former President 
Zuma and I gave the indication previously Chair of where 
you will find that in his affidavit and the transcript of the 
22 n d of January 2019.   
Now Mr Brian Blake who was an employee of 
Blake’s Travel testified before the Commission and he did 
so on the 29 t h of July 2020 and just for record purposes I 
20 
am going to pick up his testimony Chair at the transcript of 
the 29 t h of July 2020 at page 196 from line 11.  Mr Blake’s 
testimony was that BOSASA had paid for various air tickets 
and accommodation for you Ms Myeni.  Do you dispute that 
they did that?      
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 129 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson on the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni what I would now like to take 
you to are the invoices that Mr Blake provided to the 
Commission so that I can have your response on each of 
them.  You will find them in Bundle T18 and I would like to 
start at page 70, seven zero. This is an invoice according 
to the evidence of Mr Blake that evidences that BOSASA 
paid R17 759, 60 to enable you to stay at the Sheraton 
Hotel between the 4 t h of May 2014 and the 6 t h of May 2014.  
10 
Do you dispute that that is the case?      
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson to the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   They did so again two months later 
according to the evidence of Mr Blake in July of 2014 and 
you will find that at page 75. 
CHAIRPERSON:   75? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, Chair of the same Bundle T18.  On 
that occasion they pay…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I just want to say something here 
20 
just to contrast with the issue I raised about the meeting 
between involving Mr Nene and Ms Myeni and Mr Zuma.  
When it comes to this payment I accept fully that Ms Myeni 
is entitled to invoke her privilege because I can see what it 
could lead to.  So I just want to mention that there are 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 130 of 265 
 
matters where one can see immediately that this could lead 
to a criminal charge but then there are others where you 
struggle to see what possible criminal charge but I just 
wanted to mention that in passing, okay alright.          
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this next one is two months later in 
July 2014 it is at page 75.  Mr Blake’s evidence was that 
BOSASA paid for this stay between the 3 r d of July 2014 
and the 4 t h of July 2014.  Do you dispute Ms Myeni that 
BOSASA made that payment for you? 
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson so that I do 
10 
not incriminate myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not want to go to every invoice but I 
want to summarise and then offer you an opportunity Ms 
Myeni to respond.  We have looked at the invoice in May, 
we have looked at the invoice two months later in July.  
Next there are three invoices during the course of August 
2014, there are two invoices in September of 2014 and 
there is one invoice in November of 2014.  Do you dispute 
that on all of those occasions BOSASA made payment for 
your accommodation at the Sheraton Hotel?     
20 
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want Ms Hofmeyr to go to the 
specific invoices or are you happy that she does not go to 
the specific invoices? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 131 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:    Yes, I am happy that she does not go to the 
specific invoices Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   On my count that aggregates to eight 
accommodations over seven months at the Sheraton Hotel 
in Pretoria being paid for by BOSASA according to Mr 
Blake’s evidence.  Do you dispute that they paid for those 
stays for you? 
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself.    
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Blake’s evidence was that the 
accommodation was not confined to your stays at the 
Sheraton in Pretoria they included the Southern Sun 
Beverley Hills in July of 2014 and just for the record Chair 
unless Ms Myeni wants us to go there that can be found in 
T18 at page 79 and they also paid for you to stay at The 
Radisson Blu in Newlands Cape Town in February 2015 and 
that for the record is to be found at T18 page 90.  Do you 
dispute that BOSASA paid those additional invoices on 
your behalf? 
20 
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson so that I do 
not incriminate myself.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   The benefits according to Mr Blake’s 
evidence that BOSASA gave to you were not confined to 
covering your accommodation expenses over the period of 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 132 of 265 
 
2014 and 2015 but also plane tickets for you.  These are 
tickets throughout 2014, I will take you to one or two but I 
am going to summarise first they were plane tickets from 
Johannesburg to Nelspruit, from Durban to Cape Town, 
from 
Durban 
to 
Johannesburg, 
from 
Cape 
Town 
to 
Johannesburg, 
from 
Cape 
Town 
to 
Durban, 
from 
Johannesburg to Durban and from Johannesburg to East 
London and Durban to Johannesburg.  And let us just go to 
one of them so that we can have your response on it.  You 
can find that in Bundle T18 at page 73.  
10 
MS MYENI:    I have it Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this reflects an item of South African 
Airways there is particular ticket number, the passenger 
indicated on the invoice is Dudu Myeni, the route is 
Johannesburg, Nelspruit, Johannesburg.  The date is the 
29 t h of May 2014.  Do you dispute Mr Blake’s evidence that 
BOSASA paid for this plane ticket for you?     
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson so that I do 
not incriminate myself.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you dispute any of the remaining 
20 
invoices 
as 
having 
being 
paid 
by 
BOSASA 
for 
you 
according to Mr Blake’s evidence?  
MS MYENI:    May I not respond Chairperson so that I do 
not incriminate myself.    
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Hofmeyr just for the record tell me 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 133 of 265 
 
where the others are to be found?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly let me give the full record so 
the one we looked at was Exhibit T18 page 73, the next 
one is T18 page 76, the third is T18…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hang on.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh apologies Chair I am going too fast.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay right continue.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   The next one is at page 80, eight zero of 
T18. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The next one is at page 82 of T18.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   The next is at page 83 of T18.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then we jump a bit to page 88 of T18.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Just one second, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then over the page at T18 page 89.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Those are just air tickets? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Those are just air tickets so I tried to 
group them schematically all be it that they are in some 
20 
sense muddled up in there ordering.  We did first 
accommodation at the Sheraton in Pretoria.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then we did accommodation at two other 
locations Southern Sun and Radisson Blu.  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 134 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then we moved to airplane tickets.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay at some stage will there be 
an attempt to say how much they totalled? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then Ms Myeni I would like to ask 
you why it is that BOSASA was paying for you to stay at 
these hotels and fly around the country? 
MS MYENI:    Chairperson may I not respond so that I do 
10 
not incriminate myself.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni in the absence of any 
evidence from you that could explain a relationship that 
entitled you to receive those benefits from BOSASA I want 
to put it to you that the fact that these payments were 
made is supportive of Mr Agrizzi’s evidence before this 
Commission that these benefits were given to you because 
of the influence that you were understood to be able to 
exert.  Do you dispute that?    
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like there is a disconnection 
20 
again.  
MS MYENI:    So that I do not incriminate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry we had lost you now we hear 
you, did you hear everything?  Did you hear the question 
Ms Myeni?  She cannot hear.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 135 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We seem to have a bit of an interruption.   
MS MYENI:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear me now Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:    I heard the question Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
MS MYENI:    Yes, I heard the question Chair and I 
responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the answer?  
MS MYENI:    I did respond to the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh just repeat the response because I 
10 
did not hear it?  
MS MYENI:    The answer was may I not  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, she gets cut off again. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I have been informed that the 
issue is a bandwidth issue it happens intermittently it is on 
Ms Myeni’s side so there is nothing we can do sitting here 
but it has been restored previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So maybe we wait a few more seconds 
and if not we could take an adjournment.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine I am sure she is going to 
come back.  If you are back if you can hear us Ms Myeni 
just tell us?  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 136 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair what we are going to now try and 
do is just restart the session, the zoom session because 
that sometimes stops.  So if we could request just a short 
adjournment to facilitate that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, we adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand we are able to continue now. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni can you hear us? 
MS MYENI:  Yes very well thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Myeni before we lost 
connection with you I had put it to you that in the absence of 
any explanation from you that would give this commission 
insight into why BOSASA was making these payments for 
you routinely between the period of 2014 and 2016.  There is 
credence added to Mr Agrizzi’s version that these payments 
were made because of the influence that BOSASA believed 
you had in respect of former President Zuma.  Do you 
20 
dispute that? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni the total value of these various 
payments that Mr Blake from Blake’s Travel has testified 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 137 of 265 
 
before this commission were paid on your behalf by BOSASA 
is amount of R101 576.67.  Do you dispute that you received 
a benefit of that amount from BOSASA in the period 2014 to 
2015? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to provide any legitimate 
reason why BOSASA would have spent these amounts on 
your behalf? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond to you Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order not to incriminate yourself. 
MS MYENI:  Just for – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order not to incriminate yourself. 
MS MYENI:  Sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying are you… 
MS MYENI:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Just for the record of that 
20 
R101 576.67 R21 660.00 of it was spent on the travel, the 
flights, the air tickets and R69 916.00 on accommodation.  
Ms Myeni Mr Blake also testified that in 2014 the Hawks had 
started to investigate the BOSASA travel benefits with 
respect to various government officials.  And part of that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 138 of 265 
 
investigation involved cloning Blake’s Travels hard drive with 
all of it customer information on it.  Are you aware that Mr 
Blake gave that evidence before the commission? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Blake also testified and Chair just for 
the record you will find these parts of his testimony in the 
transcript of the 29 July 2020 from page 198.   
He also testified that he had deposed to an affidavit 
for the Hawks and was prepared to testify about what he 
10 
knew regarding these benefits that you had received but that 
the Hawks had then suddenly informed him that the case had 
“disappeared”.   
Can you assist the commission in relation to those 
facts?  Do you have any basis for disputing them? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond to the question Chair to avoid 
self-incrimination. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then finally Mr Blake testified that in 
2019 after Mr Agrizzi had testified Mr Blake followed up with 
the Hawks about his cloned hard drive and was informed that 
20 
the hard drive had been stolen or had disappeared from 
Hawks custody.  Again Ms Myeni do you have any insight 
that you could provide to the commission or any evidence 
that you can make available to us to dispute that? 
MS MYENI:  Clarity – the disappearance or – of the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 139 of 265 
 
information from the Hawks and my involvement and what I 
need to dispute what is it that I have got to dispute/ 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What I am asking is if you have… 
MS MYENI:  When somebody says the information  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think there is a little bit of disconnection.  
Can you hear me Ms Myeni. 
MS MYENI:  Yes.  There was a disconnection Chair.  I am 
back now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think just – just… 
MS MYENI:  Yes very well Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just start your response afresh because 
we heard some parts but I think we did not hear some parts 
of your response. 
MS MYENI:  In other words Chair I was asking for clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These technical challenges are really 
problematic.  We cannot hear you from this side Ms Myeni.  
Maybe you do hear us.   
MS MYENI:  To say when they have – what is it also I cannot 
hear you.  Chair I can hear you very well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you can hear us?  We cannot hear you.  
20 
Now I can hear you but as you give your response you get 
cut off.  So I do not know before lunch you know the – 
everything seemed to be smooth.  I do not know whether 
there is something that should – should not be used for too 
long or what.  We – we – I think we will try again.  Let us try 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 140 of 265 
 
again Ms Myeni.  Each time you start giving your response a 
disconnection – a disconnection  happens. So just try again 
to give your response again.  I think she … 
MS MYENI:  I need to assist the commission about 
disappearance of what is it that I can assist with when the 
Hawks say the – their information disappeared and I do not 
know Blake said that Hawks said that – so what is it that I 
have got to respond to?  That is what I am trying to ask 
Chair.  I need clarity in other words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Myeni I completely 
understand your request for clarity.  It is simply and if you 
say I have no knowledge of those allegations at all that 
would certainly be an answer you could give.  What I am 
seeking to do is give you an opportunity that if you happen 
to have some information that you thought was relevant to 
indicate that what Mr Blake had said was false we would 
certainly want that to come before the commission.  So it is 
just an opportunity to say to you can you – do you have any 
evidence that indicates that what he has said is not correct? 
20 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond to this question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MYENI:  To avoid self-incrimination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I would then – that completes the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 141 of 265 
 
Blake’s Travel evidence.  And so now I would like to go if we 
may to – back to South African Airways actually and matters 
arising there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before you do that.  So this has 
completed the BOSASA related evidence questions? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right.  Okay Ms Myeni with regard 
to BOSASA I just want to say this and you can – you can say 
that you do not have any comments or you do not want to 
say anything that is fine.   
10 
I just want to say that the – the fact that you have not 
responded to most if not all the questions relating to 
BOSASA and to Mr Agrizzi’s evidence that was put to you. Mr 
Le Roux’s evidence about the security installations and the – 
Mr Agrizzi’s evidence relating to the meeting at the Sheraton 
may well make anyone who has been following the evidence 
to ask the question what relationship was there between 
BOSASA or Mr Watson or Mr Agrizzi and Ms Myeni and or Mr 
Zuma that made BOSASA spend the amounts that Mr Agrizzi 
spoke about because a lot of that evidence has not been 
20 
denied in your oral evidence.   
What is it that made BOSASA spend the kind of 
monies that according to Mr Richard Le Roux they spent I 
think close to half a million at your residence in Richards 
Bay in terms of security – security installations.  That made 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 142 of 265 
 
them spend the kind of money they spent on you in regard to 
travelling and accommodation.   
So in other words it would make somebody ask that 
question to say why would a company spend so much money 
on somebody who does not work for it and who does not 
seem to have been conducting any business with it and so 
on?  And of course when I evaluate the evidence that is 
before me and I need to mention this to you as part of being 
fair to you.   
When I evaluate the evidence before me to try and 
10 
establish what happened I will be having this evidence of 
these 
payments 
without 
any 
denial 
from 
you 
or 
any 
explanation to say no but these payments there was nothing 
wrong with they were legitimate.  This is what they were 
about – about the payments for air tickets and payments for 
accommodation.   
I will be evaluating evidence in circumstances where 
I will not have your evidence to say no there was nothing 
wrong with these – with BOSASA paying for these air tickets 
and paying for accommodation because of a, b, c, d.  And if 
20 
there is no evidence that gives an explanation on these 
things it might be difficult not to accept the reason being 
advanced by Mr Agrizzi just to mark because Mr Agrizzi says 
BOSASA spent the monies they spent on you for a particular 
reason that he has given.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 143 of 265 
 
So I am just mentioning that so that you understand 
the impact of there being no answers from  you on – or 
evidence from you that either denies or explains some of 
these things.  You understand? 
MS MYENI:  I do understand Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MYENI:  Is the Chairperson wanting me to make – to 
comment or the respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just wanted you to be alert what the 
implications are.  That is what I wanted.  Did you want to say 
10 
something?  You do not have to comment but if you want to 
comment I can listen. 
MS MYENI:  With respect Chairperson thank you for your – 
the clarity you have made in relation to the BOSASA matters 
and all what the Chairperson has alluded to.   
 
Chairperson I think also I need to clarify that.  When 
I say I would not like to comment or to respond to a question 
that is put before me Chairperson it does not mean 
admission of guilt nor admission of wrong doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MYENI:  So that if I say I do not want to incriminate 
myself people or any other listener or it is placed on record 
that when I do not say anything about what is put before me 
I am and I have in another – during another time I have 
responded.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 144 of 265 
 
Like for instance there is an affidavit – an affidavit I 
sent – I submitted to the commission but Chairperson at a – 
at the right forum if I am charged I will be able to give proper 
responses that are not muddied by – by any other narrative 
that is – is – has been happening in the country.   
Chair with respect as well in my submission that I 
made before you – before coming into the – to this 
commission I referenced your comments regarding BOSASA 
and I am sure the Chairperson has been able to read the 
comments I made. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have… 
MS MYENI:  When somebody is – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have read yes. 
MS MYENI:  That Chairperson somebody would be testifying 
not mentioning my name but my name will be drawn in into 
that particular person’s evidence that he is putting to say oh 
[African language] you know like [African language] when a 
person has not mentioned my name and then the person gets 
led into mentioning my name.   
The classical example is Vincent Smith.  So I am 
20 
saying Chair let me remain with my silence as the privilege 
been given to me by your good self-Chair so that I do not 
incriminate myself.   
And then I get into a place where – or a forum where 
I will be able to clear my name on things that have been said 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 145 of 265 
 
at this commission or even by the media.   
So Chairperson maybe I should just say thank you 
very much but I think I will continue with the preference that 
I have made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MYENI:  To say I would rather 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MYENI:  Not respond to some of the things that have 
been put before the commission.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no thank you Ms Myeni.  I appreciate 
10 
that and what I said was not meant to say change your view.  
It was simply to – to make sure that you are understand the 
implications.  Because sitting here if I like I can sit here and 
just keep quiet even if there is something that I am thinking 
and keep quiet.   
But the other approach which I prefer is to articulate 
what is going on in my mind because then it gives you an 
opportunity to know what is going on in my mind and put 
your side of the story and influence me in regard to a certain 
issue so that I can listen to everybody.   
20 
Otherwise if I like I can just keep quiet and you might 
then think I am not thinking anything but I prefer to put 
matters in front of you to say there is this issue what do you 
say about it?  You get a chance to address it.  It does not 
mean I have made up my mind.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 146 of 265 
 
It just means I want to hear what you have to say 
about it so that if I make a finding about it you have had a 
chance to have your say on it.  You understand? 
MS MYENI:  Thank you very much Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MYENI:  And it is greatly appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr you may 
proceed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Myeni I would now 
like to take us back to SAA if I might?  You recall that on 
10 
Wednesday we left SAA matters really at the end of 2014 
after quite I would say tumultuous year at SAA given the 
factions that had developed in the board.  We saw the report 
that the DPE had done about that.  We traversed the 
complaints that six board members had made against you 
and your responses to them.  And we culminated with the 
decision of then Minister Brown to retain you and Ms 
Kwinana on the board in October and the rest of the other 
board members left and you were joined on the board as I 
understand it by Dr Tambi and Mr Dickson.   
20 
But I want to focus in a little bit further in 2014 
because at the time where there was that conflict amongst 
the board members as we saw evidence in the letters that we 
looked at we have evidence before the commission that you 
engaged the services of Werksmans Attorneys to provide 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 147 of 265 
 
advice on the issues that you were having with the board.  Is 
that correct? 
MS MYENI:  May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now what Werksmans did is Chair we have 
received an affidavit from Mr Manaka at Werksmans which 
we can go to and just enter into the exhibit if we may – enter 
into the record as an exhibit.  It is actually the last document 
that has been included in Ms Myeni’s Bundle DD34[b] and it 
is under Tab 43 and it starts at page 1977. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair if I could request that we 
enter this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us check if Ms Myeni has got it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:  I am going to it Chairperson.  I just would like to 
check if this document – 1977? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the page is 1977. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of DD34[b] 
20 
MS MYENI:  34[b] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bundle that has got your affidavit.  34 
– DD34[b]. 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson it ends on – it ends on page 1960. 
ADV HOFMEYR:    Oh I know why that is.  That is because 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 148 of 265 
 
the updates have been sent via email since Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And we are going to encounter the same 
difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I can do this part of the evidence 
without reference to Manaka’s evidence – affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So let us rather do it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh sorry.  Sorry 
MS MYENI:  Sorry – sorry Chairperson I was asking if it was 
emailed as a Rule 3.3 to us when Mr Manaka was presenting 
to the commission? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Ms Myeni it was not because Mr 
Manaka has not presented to the commission.  He prepared 
this affidavit for your evidence and that is why it was 
provided to you when we received it which was – I have lost 
track of the days – today – we got it on Wednesday the 4t h 
20 
November so it was sent through on that date to your 
attorneys.  So we only received this about two days ago and 
that is why I intended to traverse it with today.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think your counsel wishes to say 
something Ms Myeni.  Mr Buthelezi. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 149 of 265 
 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Chair. 
MS MYENI:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  We have this affidavit.  We received this 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  On our arrival. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  And this affidavit presents us with several 
challenges.  And if I would like to go to the affidavit with you 
Chair starting at paragraph 3.  It says the following under the 
10 
heading Purpose of Affidavit. 
“I have been requested by” 
Oh sorry it is the affidavit of Mr Manaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   
“I have been requested by the State Capture 
Commission legal team working on matters 
pertaining to South African Airways SOC 
Limited [SAA] to provide it with an affidavit 
detailing the circumstances which culminated 
20 
in the issue and the payment of certain 
invoices during 2014.” 
Then I skip I go to paragraph 6 and then I will go to 
paragraph 7 and 7.1.  It says: 
“On Sunday 30 March 2014 I received a 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 150 of 265 
 
telephone call from Advocate Lindi Nkosi 
Thomas SC a former member of the SAA 
board.   Advocate Nkosi Thomas advised me 
that then chairperson of SAA board Ms Myeni 
– Ms Dudu Myeni {Myeni} required an opinion 
on 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
and 
would 
be 
contacting me directly in this regard.” 
Paragraph 7. 
“On 31 March 2014 following the telephone 
call from Advocate Lindi Nkosi Thomas I 
10 
received a call from Ms Myeni during which 
she advised that” 
7.1 
“She in her capacity as chairperson of the 
SAA board required the advice relating to her 
powers and duties and responsibilities.” 
Now Chair in my understanding of the law this seeks 
to violate client attorney privilege.  How it is that the 
commission can write to an attorney and ask for information 
that this person had consulted.   
20 
Now Chair I will refer you to the leading authority 
Chair on – on – in this country here a company – A company 
and 
Others 
versus 
The 
Commission 
of 
South African 
Revenue Services in supporting case where they say the 
following: 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 151 of 265 
 
“1. The requirements to claim legal privilege 
is the following: 
The legal advisor must have been acting in a 
professional capacity at the time.” 
So Manaka says he is contacted in his capacity as a legal 
person. 
“2. The advisor must have been consulted in 
confidence. 
 3. The communication must have been made 
for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.  
10 
The legal requirements of the – of client 
attorney privilege.” 
Now I am saying to you Chair this is sacrosanct in 
the legal space and we cannot comprehend how this 
commission Chair and by extension yourself then can 
venture into the space where an attorney is now on record 
saying:  
“I have been asked to give evidence about 
the circumstances where the former SAA 
chairperson asked me about legal advice.”   
20 
We 
saying 
Chair 
this 
now 
then 
brings 
the 
proceedings into serious disrepute to have such an affidavit. 
Now two problems with this affidavit that continue Chair.  
This affidavit if you go the back of the page is deposed to on 
the 4t h day of November.  The 4t h day of November we were 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 152 of 265 
 
here testifying.   
The confusion that then arises is to say why do we 
have an affidavit while the witness is on the stand being 
deposed to while she is giving evidence?  Are we ambushed 
with this evidence?  When would we have consulted?  And it 
is not the only one Chair.   
Two 
affidavits 
referred 
to 
today 
are 
affidavits 
deposed to this week, this week.  The affidavit of Le Roux 
was deposed to on the 2 nd.  The affidavit of Mr who else?  
The other Captain Nevin his affidavit is deposed to on the 3rd 
10 
talking about incidents that happened last year when they 
said they did an inspection.   
Now sinister as well we have got a situation with respect to 
counsel she seeks to amend the affidavit of Mr Bezuidenhout 
from the Bar about a contradiction that emerges on the dates 
and she says no this must definitely be a mistake, but she 
knows legally that is not how you amend an affidavit and she 
throws this into the evidence and says:  The evidence – the 
commission must accept this as a bundle or an annexure.  
However but these are the problems that emerged.  We are 
20 
registering Chair, for purposes of this hearing, extreme 
prejudice, extreme prejudice that has been going on, even 
until now.   
 
The last bundle that Ms Myeni has to deal with was 
delivered to her now.  Now, during lunch time.  And the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 153 of 265 
 
Commission has had knowledge of her attendance for the 
longest time.   
 
And we have to continuously bend over backwards and 
accommodate inefficiencies that emanating from the other 
side.   
 
And I ask this one last question Chair.  In which forum in 
this year – country, which court would allow one litigant to 
behave the way that the evidence leaders have behaved 
here?   
 
It has never happened Chair where a witness is on the 
10 
stand and the one other party is allowed to give them 
affidavits while they give their evidence.  It has never 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me start with the – your last 
concern.  Up to know, I did not hear any concerns relating to 
the lateness of any affidavits.   
 
And the reason I am mentioning that is simply that one 
knows that between colleagues there is accommodation.  
You accommodate one another.   
 
Obviously, somewhere you are entitled – everyone is 
20 
entitled to draw a line but, you know, sometimes you 
accommodate one another.  So I have not had any issues 
about – any complaints about the lateness of affidavits.   
 
But where there are real concerns because the affidavits 
have been made available late.  You know, those concerns 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 154 of 265 
 
need to be looked into properly. 
 
With regard to attorney-client privilege.  I will hear what 
Ms Hofmeyr may have to say but I wonder whether the 
problem that arises – that may arise in invoking it, would not 
be that the privilege did not attach to Ms Myeni personally 
because the privilege related to her, in her official capacity 
as chairperson of the board at the time. 
 
So that once she is no longer chairperson of the board, 
the person who is chairperson of the board at the time when 
such an affidavit is sought, is the person who could object 
10 
rather than the person is no longer in that position.  So there 
may be that issue.   
 
But with regard to the question of the lateness, I think 
that may need to be looked at.   
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   May I just give you a few pointers?  I 
think the reason why that the lateness issue only arises now.  
We have not been – we tried our very best not to be 
obstructive. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I accept that, ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I accept that. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   But if we now look at a string of 
...[intervenes]  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 155 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   ...of incidents ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   ...it then brings us to a point to say.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   I think we have been very understanding 
in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   And I think to be now saying, client must 
now go to this affidavit that she does not have and we 
10 
ourselves only received this morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   It is the last hour of the hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  When I said I had not had any 
complaints about the lateness.  I did not mean that as 
criticism to you. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, I meant to say.  Probably it is 
because you were trying to accommodate one another as 
colleagues.  It is meant as criticism at all.  Ms Hofmeyr, do 
20 
you want to say anything? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly Chair.  Let me being with 
the privilege point because my learned friend began with it 
and pick up Chair on the point that you made.  Indeed, the 
situation is such that this memorandum was procured from 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 156 of 265 
 
Werksmans by Ms Myeni when she was chairperson in April 
of 2014.   
 
It is work that Ms Myeni – that Werksmans did and 
Ms Myeni required SAA to reimburse her full on the basis 
that the memorandum had been presented to the board and 
had been procured for the benefit of SAA. 
 
The consequence of that is that it is SAA’s privilege.  It 
is 
not 
Ms 
Myeni’s 
privilege 
and 
there 
have 
been 
engagements with SAA in respect of which they consented to 
the production of the memorandum. 
10 
 
Mr Manaka at Werksmans was very careful to confirm 
that that privilege, the holder of the privilege SAA was such 
that they were happy with him traversing the matters in the 
affidavit.  So privilege is not an issue in my submission.   
 
I then want to address the question of lateness.  I began 
on Wednesday, I think it was, to reference some of the 
history of the engagements with Ms Myeni. 
 
And the point that I would like to emphasise there is.  
The Commission has been tried for many...  Well, it is more 
than 
a 
year 
now 
to 
engage 
Ms 
Myeni 
because 
our 
20 
investigations within SAA was so critically relevant to her 
and her position and it was essential for us to obtain her 
version to our current investigations. 
 
So those engagements started in 2019.  There were 
repeated 
invitations 
for 
Ms 
Myeni 
to 
meet 
with 
the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 157 of 265 
 
Commission initially to discuss what we were investigating.  
To give her an opportunity to assist us with her version. 
 
She was asked repeatedly when those meetings were 
declined to 
give an 
affidavit to the 
Commission 
and 
numerous 
correspondences 
following 
up, 
will 
it 
be 
forthcoming.   
 
Until Chair, you issued the Section 10(6) directive to 
Ms Myeni which you did on the 9 t h of October.  Other than 
the affidavit in response to Mr Agrizzi which we have looked 
at already, there was no affidavit forthcoming from Ms Myeni. 
10 
 
So from the point of view of earlier engagement on 
issues, certainly the Commission has endeavoured from 
more than a year ago to be engaging with Ms Myeni. 
 
So let me be move to why we get to where we got to on 
the 4t h of November and the bundle.  Chair, you will have 
seen in many of the proceedings of the Commission.  We are 
running against the clock and we do not have control over 
the timelines that third parties have in coming back to us. 
 
And sometimes, we do get things late in the day but we 
have one chance and the Commission’s work is about to end 
20 
and so what we endeavour to do is, where we do get things 
late, we make them available as soon as possible. 
 
Now importantly, there 
are two different types of 
engagement with witnesses.  There are witnesses who come 
really keen to tell their story and often early on ask for the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 158 of 265 
 
bundle which will be presented and dealt with in their 
evidence so that they can prepare. 
 
At no point, prior to Wednesday of this week, was there 
a request on behalf of Ms Myeni or her lawyers to be 
provided with any of the bundle that would be presented to 
her. 
 
I must be clear.  There was a request.  I think it is a few 
weeks ago.  I can get the relevant correspondence if it 
becomes 
pertinent. 
 
Where 
Ms 
Myeni 
new 
attorneys, 
because she has moved attorneys, requested us to provide 
10 
them again with all the 3.3 notices that Ms Myeni had 
received and the underlining affidavits. 
 
We indicated to them that Ms Myeni would have those in 
her possession.  We have already provided them on one 
occasion previously.  We suggested that they engage her to 
obtain the documents. 
 
And we furthermore said, if they in doing so discover 
any that are missing, we then stand ready to send on a 
second occasion those documents but we did not ever 
receive an indication that there was something missing.  The 
20 
only thing we did receive was the response to your 10(6) 
directive.   
 
So when we have a situation where we get affidavits late 
in the day, it has happened on many occasions in this 
Commission that the affidavit is presented to the witness.  It 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 159 of 265 
 
is another version.   
 
The witness is given an opportunity if there is a need for 
an adjournment or a consideration of it, to take the time to 
do so but at most, it is another version in respect of which 
they now have the opportunity to respond to that version. 
 
So again I want to emphasise.  This is nothing peculiar 
about Ms Myeni, what has transpired this week.  It has 
happened on many previous occasions with witnesses.  It is 
a function of the fact that we do not control the timelines 
against which third parties who are presenting evidence to 
10 
the Commission can produce it for us. 
 
And when we do have the fortune of a witness before the 
Commission with little time left in which to complete the 
work, we endeavour to put whatever information we have 
received, versions we have received from others to the 
witness for their comment. 
 
So Chair that is just a background on privilege and then 
why we got to where we are today and certainly explaining 
the lateness, why it has arisen and the efforts, certainly as 
soon as we were in receipt of them, to get them to the 
20 
attorneys as quickly as possible. 
 
There is a process where they have be paginated but 
then they get across.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Buthelezi.  In terms of trying to 
find a way forward in regard to this affidavit.  Have you got 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 160 of 265 
 
any ideas? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   No, Chair.  I think in as far as the 
evidence leader insists that this affidavit be admitted and to 
may have it.  The problem we have got is the client has not 
seen it and she does not have it.   
 
So, but she said she will proceed without it and that is 
okay.  The extent of our complaints to you Chair is just to 
register our prejudice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   So that you note our prejudice in these 
10 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   And we still proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  How long is this affidavit of 
Mr Manaka, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, it is 20 pages but I do want to 
emphasise the point.  You see, we met some time ago with 
Werksmans and there has, understandable, been a delay in 
20 
production of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is why the documents actually 
reference the underline work product like the opinion which 
we received from SAA and which was in the bundle from 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 161 of 265 
 
Wednesday when Ms Myeni received the bundle. 
 
So I can deal with this evidence without the necessity of 
going to the affidavit but of similarly, we have absolutely no 
difficulty with some arrangement where we do not deal with it 
now, we admit it later but it is a 20-page affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am just concerned if she has not 
had a chance to read it, that is Ms Myeni.  Of course, if – it 
may be that if you tell her what Mr Manaka’s version is about 
the matters that are covered in the affidavit, it may be that 
she will say she prefers not to answer. 
10 
 
But preferable, one would prefer that she had the 
chance to read it first.  I think Mr Buthelezi is keen not to 
obstruct the proceedings or delay the proceedings but he 
just wants to place on record their concerns as well, at the 
same time. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So one way is to – one approach is 
to deal with other matters and when they are dealt with, 
adjourn, give her a chance to go through it.  She might need 
30-minutes and then she is ready.  I do not know what a fast 
20 
reader she is.  But if she reads fast, she might be able to. 
 
Another option is to ask her to respond to certain 
questions by way of an affidavit after reading it which she 
can send to the Commission by a certain date.  That would 
be another way. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 162 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You have no problem with that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have absolutely no difficulty with that.  
What might even be useful is, without reference to the 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...to take her to the underline documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that Ms Myeni has a sense of the 
issues arising from the documents. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then to facilitate an opportunity in due 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Or an affidavit responding to Mr Manaka 
to be produced.  That should – certainly, the legal team 
would have no difficulty with that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay.  I think what should be 
done, therefore, is to give you a chance to inform her of the 
real issues or underline documents.  If – without asking her 
20 
questions or if you ask her questions, she must feel free to 
say:  I rather prefer to deal with it after I have read the 
affidavit.  Then that can be done.  Ms Myeni, have you been 
following the discussion? 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 163 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  There are two or three possibilities.  
One possibility is that Ms Hofmeyr will not ask you about this 
affidavit now but will ask you about other matters and when 
she is done, we could adjourn for 30-minutes or so to allow 
you to read the affidavit and then we resume after that and 
she can ask you questions.  That is scenario 1. 
 
Scenario 2 is that she does not ask you questions on 
this affidavit today but she sends you, through your lawyers, 
questions that you must look at and then you prepare an 
affidavit after you have read this affidavit.  You then respond 
10 
to those questions by way of an affidavit.  That is scenario 2. 
 
Included in Scenario 2 is that, if she wishes to alert you 
to certain things connect with this affidavit now, she can 
alert you so that when you respond later, you have the 
background.  You understand the issues.  I think it is those 
two scenarios, really.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got a preference of which one 
you prefer Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   The second one is much more preferred 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the second fine? 
MS MYENI:   Because I need to read ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MYENI:   ...that particular 20-page affidavit. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 164 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MS MYENI:   And as well as other related documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MYENI:   And get a sense as the Chairperson suggested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MYENI:   Scenario 2 is much more preferable Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  So let us go with 
that route.  And then Ms Hofmeyr, if you do have things that 
you want to bring to her attention in connection with that 
affidavit for her benefit, so that when she deals with 
10 
questions later in terms by way of an affidavit, she has the 
context.  It is fine.  We can do that.  Or if you want to move 
to other matters. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I think it makes sense to move. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I appreciate the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What I want to emphasise is that it was 
not of our making at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We really are beholden to others and their 
own time constraints for things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So my suggestion is.  We simply leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 165 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We can send the set of questions through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni can consider them in the 
goodness of time.  We will give a reasonable amount of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And she can provide an answer on the 
affidavit when it is convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So that is what will happen 
Ms 
Myeni. 
 
You 
will 
get 
correspondence 
from 
the 
Commission through your lawyers and then you will respond 
10 
by your affidavit.  Okay alright.  Thank you, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Of course, let me just 
emphasise on Ms Myeni’s behalf.  If her attitude is similar to 
the one that she has taken today that she invokes her 
privilege, of course, that could be the response that she 
gives.  But we will wait to see after consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So then I would like to move 
Ms Myeni 
to 
a 
topic 
that 
I 
picked 
up 
on 
yesterday 
momentarily but now I would like to explore in a bit more 
20 
detail.  And that was the role that Mr Nick Linnell played at 
SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe Ms Hofmeyr, seeing that we are 
twenty to four, maybe we may as well discuss now what is 
possible in terms of how far we go.  I am available to 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 166 of 265 
 
continue beyond four o’clock.  What is your situation? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I certainly can continue and I would 
be very keen to make a push to complete the evidence.  I am 
not very far from the end.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so subject to the convenience of my 
learned friends and Ms Myeni, I would suggest we run on to 
completion if that is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your estimate of how much more 
time you need to get to completion? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would think.  We are not at three thirty.  
Maybe five thirty.  Something of that order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Possible six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Buthelezi, how is your situation? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Five thirty is too far Chair.  I have got 
toddlers in waiting but the best that I can accommodate is to 
say five.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is five? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   That we even started at nine Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   So I think for me about five o’clock 
would be the longest stretch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   But if I am venturing to half-past five, I 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 167 of 265 
 
have still got to negotiate traffic to try and get ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
 
It 
would 
be 
highly 
...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, having started at nine, we 
would have – we probably would have been finished by four 
if we did not have ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the technical glitches that we had.  Ja, 
10 
ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Myeni, what is your situation? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I am flexible.  My flight was this 
evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   But I am willing to travel tomorrow Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
MS MYENI:   Therefore, the five o’clock is okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay let us continue and see where 
20 
we are by five o’clock. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is alright. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 168 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Mr Linnell.  Can you assist us with 
what services he was providing at SAA?  
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to this question 
to avoiding incriminating myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Linnell testified before the Commission 
just a few weeks ago that he was brought in to coordinate 
some of the difficult investigations into senior executives like 
Mr Ngqula, the former CEO.  Can you confirm that that was 
part of the role that he played? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
10 
to avoid incriminating myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why was his services required by SAA? 
MS MYENI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you hear that Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   A delay Chair.  It was...  I do not know whether 
there was a delay.  Yes, I have heard...  I have got no 
response Chairperson.  I do not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the reason why I ask is because 
the investigation and then the post-proceedings against 
Mr Ngqula were being managed through ENS Attorneys, was 
20 
it not? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson unless I make – 
I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see.  So, already SAA had its lawyer, 
ENS, running the Ngqula Investigation and then proceedings 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 169 of 265 
 
and yet in addition to that, Mr Linnell appears to have 
provided services despite, on his own version in his 
evidence before this Commission, the fact that he was not an 
admitted attorney in South Africa.  Had never held himself 
out to such and just have a law degree from Zimbabwe. 
 
Against that backdrop Ms Myeni, what would role he 
have been playing in addition to that of SAA’s firm of 
attorneys on the matter? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson?  
I do not wish to incriminate myself?   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was he billed for his services to SAA? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, in your Bundle DD34-B, we 
have collated the various invoices that Mr Linnell submitted 
to SAA over a period of December 2014 to August 2016.  It is 
just over a year and a half and I would like to take you to 
some of those if I may?  We will start in DD34-B at page 
1590.   
MS MYENI:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 1950? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   1590, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1590.  Sorry, I heard it the other way 
around. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is possible I said it the other way.  I 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 170 of 265 
 
have to confess. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   A smidgen of five-ness but we will keep 
going. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is late in the day.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is and in the week. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in the week.  [laughing]  And you are 
working tomorrow also. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I know.  [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Well, I am working too. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You...  Indeed, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, do you have page 1590? 
MS MYENI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you see, this invoice is consistent with 
Mr Linnell’s evidence before the Commission.  He indicated 
that 
he 
had 
been 
involved 
particularly 
in 
relation 
to 
Mr Ngqula’s investigations.  And you will see on this page, 
there is a very...  Well, let us go back a page, actually, if we 
may.  To 1589.   
20 
MS MYENI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have that? 
MS MYENI:   Yes, 1589. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So this is an invoice submitted to 
SAA dated the 2n d of February 2015 from what is, I 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 171 of 265 
 
understand to be Mr Linnell’s business, the Project Office.  
Can you confirm that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson?  I am on page 
1589 but may I not confirm any – or may I not respond to 
whatever needs to be confirmed in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, as I said, 2 February 2015 invoice 
from the Project Office and you will see it covers the period 
– it is headed:  Independent Advise with regard to alleged 
irregularity at SAA, December 2014 and January 2015.  And 
it is addressed to yourself as Chairperson of South African 
10 
Airways.  Can you confirm having received this invoice? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you look in the box, in the middle of the 
page where there is a description of the work done, you will 
see under the second column, Matter.  It says: 
“To our advice to the sub-committee and the board 
regarding the 
Ngqula Investigation 
and 
related 
matters for December 2014 and January 2015.  See 
billing memorandum attached.” 
20 
 
And then you go over to that page where we started and 
you have a, what I would suggest, is a fairly detailed billing 
memorandum, dealing with the work that Mr Linnell had 
done.   
 
And there is an invoice and a total of R 192 654,26 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 172 of 265 
 
excluding 
VAT 
which 
brings 
the 
total 
with 
VAT 
to 
R 219 615,60.  Ms Myeni, do you know if that invoice was 
paid by SAA? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now we have managed to obtain all of the 
invoices 
that 
Mr 
Linnell 
submitted 
over 
that 
period, 
December 2014 to August 2016 to SAA.   
 
And what we noted, and I would be interested in your 
comment on, is that the invoices start of this sort of detail 
10 
where you get a very detailed memorandum.   
 
Over the second page of the invoice, explaining with 
some particularity what Mr Linnell was doing from time to 
time.   
 
But then as you get later in the course of 2015, his 
invoices become much more brief.  Let me take you to one, 
for example.  You will find that at DD34-B from page 1686.   
MS MYENI:   One, six...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Eight, six. 
MS MYENI:   I missed that.  What page?  One, six... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1686.   
MS MYENI:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chair.  I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 173 of 265 
 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
This 
is 
an 
invoice 
dated 
the 
19t h of April 2016.  And there under matter, it becomes much 
more brief.  It says: 
“12 fees in respect of advise provided to the board 
on various matters.” 
 
And in brackets, narration included in a separate billing 
memorandum which we were – certainly, there is no record in 
SAA of that more detailed billing memorandum.  Are you 
aware whether one was provided? 
MS MYENI:   Sorry, Chair, this invoice is provided to the 
10 
director... 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, that is a good point.  This one is 
addressed to the director, it just says South African 
Airways attention Ms Yakhe Kwinana.   
Were you aware of this invoice when you were a 
Chairperson in April of 2016? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
question, I would not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana gave evidence earlier this 
week and she was asked about Mr Linnell and his services 
20 
and the advice that he had given to the board and, as I 
have it, her evidence was effectively that he would on 
occasion attend board meetings and answer when a legal 
question cropped up. 
But her approach to Mr Linnell’s services was that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 174 of 265 
 
they were not really needed.  Do you agree with her in that 
evidence? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, to the 
question, I do not want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then, Ms Myeni, there are a series 
of invoices which continue in that pattern of the service 
being general advice to the board and within this section of 
your bundle we also have the expense authorisations from 
South African Airways related to these invoices and I would 
like to take you to one of them, for example, you will find 
10 
that at page 1684. 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chair.  I have got it, Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  You will see there as an 
expense – is this the type of expense authorisation you 
were familiar with when you were at SAA? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, to this 
question and I would want to invoke my privilege by saying 
I was a Chairperson, I was not a CEO and I was not a CFO, 
so I would leave it at that, Chair.  May I not respond to the 
question. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What caught our eye on this page is 
where you see sort of a third – in the bottom third of the 
page there is in red something that says: 
“Please confirm the following” 
And then there is a box that says one procurement process 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 175 of 265 
 
has been complied with.  Do you see that? 
MS MYENI:   I see it, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then 2: 
“Compliance with the DOA” 
I understand that to be delegation of authority.  And then 3: 
“Budget facility is available for this cost element” 
Do you see that next to 3 is written there: 
“No budget, not accrued for” 
Do you see that? 
MS MYENI:   I have seen that.  Yes, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And just in relation to 1: 
“Procurement processes then complied with” 
There does not seem to be an indication that one was.  Are 
you aware of any procurement having been followed before 
Mr Linnell’s services were procured? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I was a Chairman, I was not a 
CEO. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and happily, Ms Myeni, if you do not 
have 
any 
knowledge 
about 
whether 
his 
procurement 
processes were followed, you could certainly say so.  Were 
20 
you aware? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when he was attending those board 
meetings – when we were questioning Ms Kwinana earlier 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 176 of 265 
 
in the week, the Chairperson actually raised the question 
of why there would be a third party outsider attending 
board 
meetings 
and, 
as 
I 
understood 
Ms 
Kwinana’s 
evidence it was that he was there to be sort of generally 
available.   
I think she said he on occasion did ad hoc 
presentations.  She, I do not think, could give us clarity on 
at whose invitation he appeared.  Did he appear on your 
invitation? 
MS MYENI:   On that particular questions, Chair, can I 
10 
have a supporting document?  When you attend a board 
meeting there is an attendance register.   
There is an invitation to attend the board, there is 
an attendance register, there is also obviously somebody – 
when somebody is travelling there will be a stub, maybe a 
slip, that he flew at this time on this day to attend a board 
meeting on this.   
Can I have that record of Mr Linnell attending board 
meeting, then I will be able to help, Chairperson, by 
responding perhaps to the question or maybe, when I say I 
20 
do not want to respond to this question then I am able to 
make a proper judgment so that I do not appear not to be 
useful to the Commission but this information I am asking 
is for me to verify Mr Linnell’s attendance to board 
meetings. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 177 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   And just - maybe just one board meeting 
where he attended, the attendance register, his flight from 
wherever he came from to Gauteng to attend the board 
meeting.  Thanks, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may be that Ms Hofmeyr does have 
such documents, it may be that she does not have but I 
just want to say this.  If – I mean, the trouble that 
sometimes the Commission goes to in order to obtain 
documents arises when it knows that certain things are 
10 
being denied or disputed but it does not go to certain 
trouble if it knows that everybody admits that certain things 
happened.   
Now if, for example, you were to say I do know that 
he attended certain meetings but if you ask me about a 
particular meeting whether he attended it, I would need 
minutes to see, it is one thing.   
But also, if you say as far as I know he never 
attended any meetings, it might warrant trying to get that 
information.  So the start might well be to say on your 
20 
recollection or as far as you know, did he attend certain 
board meetings or did he not attend any board meetings 
where you were present or do you not remember and then 
– because Ms Kwinana certainly said he attended certain 
board meetings and he attended meetings of certain 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 178 of 265 
 
committees.  So maybe do you want to look at that or 
maybe let me check with Ms Hofmeyr.  Do you want to 
react to the question raised by Ms Myeni? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly, Chair.  And I must be 
clear here.  I have looked at lots of board minutes, I 
cannot have said all of them but as I stand here, I have no 
recollection of any board minutes – minutes of any board 
meetings reflecting Mr Linnell as an attendee.   
I could be wrong, there might be one or two, my 
team knows these papers better than me so I have asked 
10 
them just to address it but actually, that is why I was 
somewhat surprised by Ms Kwinana’s evidence the other 
day because she indicated the role he played with that 
board meetings.   
So actually, Ms Myeni, when I put it to you, it is 
predominantly based on the evidence that Ms Kwinana 
gave and what I was going to follow up with you is well, if 
he was at those board meetings, we have not seen him 
reflected in the minutes and you, as Chairperson, would 
certainly have had oversight at those meetings.   
20 
So could you help us just from your personal 
knowledge?  Can you confirm whether he did or he did not 
attend meetings of the board of SAA? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, the problem I have is that I am 
expected to respond to an evidence that was presented 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 179 of 265 
 
before the Commission by Kwinana which I have not – 
perhaps 
I 
still 
need 
to 
sit 
down, 
go 
through 
this 
Commission of Inquiry’s website to listen to Kwinana.  I 
have not had that opportunity to do so.  I have not heard 
Ms Kwinana’s evidence in the Commission.  So if I am 
going to rely on what she said then I am not empowered to 
respond.  But, Chair, the easiest thing for me as well to 
add on what I have requested, if I am to assist this 
Commission, because going forward I am certainly going to 
be 
able 
to 
assist 
the 
Commission 
even 
post 
your 
10 
Commission’s term maybe.  I would be able to talk to this 
information if the contracts that Mr Linnell signed would be 
attached in this file with his invoices and also the title Mr 
Fix, if it was part of his contract.  Then I will be able then 
to confirm. 
 
Also, Chair, to assist the Commission, there is a 
company secretariat at South African Airways, whether it is 
me assisting the Commission or it is South African Airways 
assisting the Commission, including Ms Kwinana, then that 
would be – we will all be able to give proper information 
20 
which will be factual information so that I do not listen to 
what Ms Kwinana said.  All I can say that if I am 
empowered with the information before me, I will be able 
then, Chairperson, to be of assistance to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the only thing, Ms Myeni, is that all 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 180 of 265 
 
that Ms Hofmeyr was asking is what you know or what you 
do not know, what your recollection is, irrespective of what 
documents might say.  It may be that there are minutes 
somewhere.  Ms Hofmeyr says she has seen a lot of 
minutes of board meetings but she does not recall seeing 
any minutes that reflected Mr Linnell as having attended 
the board meeting – any board meeting of those that she 
saw.  She does not say that there are not board meetings 
that might reflect that.  She does not know if somebody in 
her team might have seen such minutes.  But, of course, 
10 
she does say what Ms Kwinana said, namely that she said 
Mr Linnell did attend some board meetings.  So she is 
simply asking you to say on your recollection, do you 
remember Mr Linnell as having attended some meetings or 
do you have no recollection whether he attended any 
meetings or is the position that you feel that you might 
incriminate yourself and would prefer not to answer the 
question. 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, I needed to have Mr Linnell’s 
contract which would have been generated by SAA not by 
20 
Dudu.  That is one.  And the board resolution, Chair, that 
was taken to appoint Mr Linnell as an adviser to the board, 
not as a [indistinct] 13.18 with somebody but as an adviser 
to the board.  The board resolution would articulate those 
things and his contract would articulate those things.  And, 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 181 of 265 
 
Chair, 
from 
my 
understanding, 
SAA 
had 
consultants, 
different consultants, but no consultant would simply be 
part and parcel of a board meeting.   
The consultant would be required to walk inside the 
board meeting to present a certain aspect that the board 
would need in terms of update or in terms of a report to 
also understand the status of where – whatever the 
consultant is doing where the status of that particular 
advice to the board or to the company is.   
But, for me to – because this thing is put before me 
10 
as Dudu’s Mr Fix.  I would prefer that I get the attendance 
register, all the things that I have requested, the contract 
and the board resolution that appointed Nick Linnell to 
advise the board, not Dudu.  Thank you, Chair.   
So in other words then, Chairperson, in that regard, 
I leave this question as something that I can be of 
assistance to the Commission and to the Chairperson but I 
need to be empowered with the information that I have 
spoken about, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
20 
MS MYENI:   Other than that I cannot then help you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, Ms Myeni, the problem with 
that answer is that Mr Linnell’s contract is not going to tell 
you whether he attended a particular meeting of the board 
of how many meetings he attended.  So what you are being 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 182 of 265 
 
asked is something that you either know or you do not 
know or you remember or you do not remember.  That is all 
that is being asked and if you are not sure, you are not 
sure.  So the minutes of a board meeting, if they reflect 
that he attended, they might assist, but it may be that they 
do not reflect and all that you are being asked is on your 
knowledge, on your recollection, what was the position.  
Did he attend some meeting of the board, the whole 
meeting?  Did he attend only briefly on certain specific 
issues or, on your recollection, he did not attend at all? 
10 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS MYENI:   I do not want to incriminate myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MYENI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, the answer you have just 
given is consistent with the answer that you gave in your 
affidavit when you were asked by the Chairperson of this 
Commission in his Regulation 10.6 directive to tell him 
20 
everything you know and provide as much information as 
possible about the legal fees paid by SAA to Nick Linnell 
and reimbursements to yourself.  You remember answering 
that question in the Chairperson’s directive? 
MS MYENI:   Not sure. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 183 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  Well, it is at page 8 of DD34A 
which is the file that we are not often in but it is part of 
your bundle.  If you would like to turn it up at page 8 of 
DD34A? 
CHAIRPERSON:   DD34A page 8, is that right? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MYENI:   Page 8? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, page 8. 
MS MYENI:   I have got it, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You will see there you deal with the 
second topic in the Chairperson’s directive and it is 
headed: 
“Legal fees paid by SAA to Nick Linnell and 
reimbursements to myself.” 
And you say at paragraph 23 there: 
“I am advised that in view of the possibility that the 
National Prosecuting Authority may want to charge 
me in accordance with the order of Tolmay J, I do 
not have to answer this question.” 
20 
So, Ms Myeni, do you accept that you had fair warning 
before today that this was going to be a matter to be 
traversed? 
MS MYENI:   I think, Chairperson, as much as the Chair 
had said I must not have a blanket response but anything 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 184 of 265 
 
pertaining to what the order is before me by the judge, this 
is consistent with the order.  But, Chair, for what I have 
been asked now, may I invoke the privilege of not 
responding so the question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, Ms Myeni, I asked you about 
procurement processes because in our engagements with 
SAA we did not find any procurement process having been 
followed.  What we did find was that there had been an 
endeavour to motivate for Mr Linnell’s invoices to be paid 
and I would like to take you to that motivation.  You will 
10 
find it – well, let me clear, it is a motivation that comes 
before the SAA board of directors on the 29 February 2016 
and you will find it in DD34B, the old file we were in. 
MS MYENI:   What page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   At page 1695 
MS MYENI:   I do have it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What you see there – the first thing, I 
have to say to you in fairness, that I noticed when I looked 
at this memo is it is very like the memos that you usually 
see from South African Airways and that me and my team 
20 
have became far too familiar with for our good.  It usually 
has that block at the top where it says: 
“To SAA board of directors, date 29 February 2016”  
But there is actually usually a third block there that 
indicates who within SAA was the author of the document.  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 185 of 265 
 
Does it surprise you like it surprised me that there is not a 
third block there? 
MS MYENI:   What is surprising you, Ma’am, sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That there is not - you know, on the 
usual board memos – my team will maybe help me just to 
find one so I can take you to it – there is usually that block 
at the top, it shows who it is addressed to, the date of it 
and then it usually says who wrote it, from, you know, it 
has been written by the Acting CEO or it is a document 
prepared by the legal department but this one does not 
10 
have that third block.  Is that unusual? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, the only 
thing I am seeing here is the company secretary.  So may I 
not respond because I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Where 
do 
you 
see 
the 
company 
secretary because I was about to say a resolution, one 
would expect the company secretary to sign at least.  Is 
there something to suggest …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   At the top right, Chair, to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Top right?  Just below the address?  Are 
20 
we on the same page 1695?  Ms Hofmeyr, is that the page 
you said we must go to? 
MS MYENI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is where we are, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Where about at the top right?  I 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 186 of 265 
 
can see South African Airways Company Secretary – oh, 
that is what you are referring to. 
MS MYENI:   That is what I am referring to, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   Well, this is what I am seeing now, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   That talks to the letterhead of the company 
secretary and at the back here, Chairperson, I see that 
there is a resolution that was generated by the company 
secretary, so – but …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the letterhead still may be that of 
the company secretary but one would normally expect 
resolution to be signed by somebody.  My impression is 
that it is normally signed by the company secretary but it 
may be that sometimes the Chairperson signs, I am not 
sure.  But I do not see anybody having signed here and 
other than the company secretary being reflected on the 
letterhead, there seems to be nothing on the document 
itself to indicate who prepared the document. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I might just be able to assist.  
20 
If you go to DD19, you will have DD19 amongst your files 
there.  It is the bundle of Mr Mothibi’s evidence.  I have 
just picked that randomly because it is one of the 
memoranda that I would like to just show you as striking 
me as a comparison. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 187 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Ms Hofmeyr, please do not 
forgot what you want to go onto. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that on the next page, namely 
1696, there is a letter from the company secretary 
addressed to – or Dear Director and then it says: 
“SAA board of directors region resolution 2016/B04.  
Ratification of the appointment of the external 
adviser to the board.” 
And it says: 
10 
“We refer to the above matter and attached hereto 
the written resolution 2016/B04.  Kindly consider, 
sign and return to us, the written resolution by 12 
o’clock, Thursday 3 March 2016 via email.  Kind 
regards, Ruth Kibuuka, Company Secretary.” 
Now I do not know whether – oh, that might – I think that is 
a reference to this resolution because this resolution at 
page 1695 because it does refer to – it does say written 
resolution number 2016/B05. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If that is so then one can take it that the 
company 
secretary 
knows 
about 
or 
knew 
about 
the 
resolution. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 188 of 265 
 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
What 
I 
– 
really 
my 
question 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is part of what I did not understand. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that part seems to be clarified 
now. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it does indeed, Chair, and we are 
indebted for that.  I guess where my point drives at – and 
maybe I just go there immediately.  It is not clear to me 
who the author of this document was because usually it is 
10 
identified, Acting CEO is presenting this to the board for 
consideration and requires a particular resolution to be 
taken.  This document is not like that and I was just 
wondering if Ms Myeni found it unusual in the same way 
that I did.  Ms Myeni, would you like to answer that?  Is 
that unusual to you too? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us first check, did you follow what I 
was saying about the letter or email at page 1696, Ms 
Myeni?  I know …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   I did, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did follow what I was saying. 
MS MYENI:   I did, I heard everything.  It is just that I 
stood up to take the file, Chair, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  Okay, 
maybe you can repeat your question then, Ms Hofmeyr. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 189 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I was just …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   I heard what you want me to respond to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you give us your response? 
MS MYENI:   I am going to, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
MS MYENI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may respond, Ms Myeni. 
MS MYENI:   No, Chair, I am going to – I am not going to 
respond to this particular document, Chairperson, but I am 
10 
going to say that a ratification of a decision that has 
already been made might be different from a memo to the 
board which is a normal memorandum that gets submitted 
by the staff, by the executives.   
So when the executives presented or would like the 
board to approve something and the board meeting maybe 
is still forthcoming, maybe the board meeting is in a month 
or two months because the board is not a Monday to Friday 
thing, Chair, the board would meet maybe bimonthly or 
every quarter, four times a year, depending on the size of 
20 
the entity. 
So some decisions that are needed urgently would 
be sent -  a motivation would be sent electronically to all 
board 
members. 
 
Board 
members 
then 
would 
send 
individual responses to the company secretary’s office. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 190 of 265 
 
When the company secretary has all the responses 
then the company secretary at the board meeting formally 
will say we have to ratify what was electronically decided 
upon.  So the ratification I see here is based on many 
other 
ratifications 
that 
would 
occur 
under 
normal 
circumstances, under normal circumstances. 
So I am saying this could be amongst those, but I 
cannot confirm that this is – all I am saying is that if it is 
different from a board that Ms Hofmeyr refers to, one, two, 
ratification 
of 
the 
Board 
resolution 
is 
not 
a 
Board 
10 
resolution that would be an normal way of asking the Board 
to approve something at the Board meeting while the Board 
is meeting.  That is my only way to assist you Chairperson.   
Also if I touch here on page 1698 normally at the 
Board meeting the Board of Directors would sign there 
where it says name of the director in favour or against or 
abstain, so we would sign such things but sometimes they 
would send us information individually for us to take a 
decision after reading whatever that is being proposed by  
the executives or whatever that is required in terms of 
20 
urgent approvals, so this for me is a ratification. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Myeni we are indebted to 
you for that insight.  I would just like to take you to page 
1697 of this document, and it we really do – we are now  
chasing the clock so we are going to try and ...[intervenes]  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 191 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I am terribly sorry I think we 
must take just a brief adjournment, let it be ten minutes 
only and then we will resume. 
 
We adjourn. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, I am very mindful of 
10 
the limited time, so I would like to just raise one further 
aspect in relation to Mr Linnell with Ms Myeni.   Ms Myeni 
over the period that Mr Linnell was providing services to 
SAA which was between December of 2014 and August of 
2016 do you know how much SAA paid him in that period? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana’s evidence the other day 
was that his services were not really needed, do you hold 
that view as well? 
20 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that if a State Owned 
Entity paid just under R2million for services that were not 
really needed that would constitute wasteful expenditure? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 192 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   May I respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni I would then like to move to an 
allegation 
that 
has 
been 
made 
in 
this 
Commission 
previously by Ms Nansi, you will have received a Rule 33 
notice in relation to Ms Nansi, did you follow her evidence 
at all? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson I don’t watch the State Capture 
Inquiry evidence of anyone, so I ...   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well let me tell you what she did say in 
10 
her 
evidence. 
 
She 
dealt 
with 
this 
topic 
of 
false 
whistleblower reports that she indicated she had been told 
by Ms Kwinana you used to prepare in order to get rid of 
executives who you no longer wanted in the management 
of SAA, are you aware of those allegations? 
MS MYENI:   In this regard Chairperson I think I responded 
when I was asked a question, what I don’t recall properly 
with regards to Nansi, who was the Acting CFO and 
became CFO, what I don’t remember properly is whether 
my response was as a result of you know – whether my 
20 
response 
was 
as a 
result of the media enquiry or 
something but I remember responding, in particular to the 
allegations that were levelled against me by Nansi, and I 
said I would hope, that was my response then and it is 
going to be my response now, I would hope Chairperson 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 193 of 265 
 
that the Commission is not a hiding place for tainted 
employees 
who 
leave 
employment 
having 
committed 
serious offences where they come from, that was a general 
response I made when I was asked about Nansi, and 
therefore it is the same response I am making right now 
about what is being said about whistleblowers and about 
what Nansi alleges I would have done regarding the 
whistleblowers but also Chair there are too many gossips 
going around.   
 
Now when I read Nansi’s affidavit on whistleblower 
10 
she was sitting with her friend, Kwinana, gossiping, talking 
about whistleblower and I cannot then change my response 
then and my response now.   Kwinana and Nansi are 
friends and they have been business partners or they have 
worked together in some businesses, including Denel, 
therefore I do not want to glorify what is being said here 
about Nansi talking about me and whistleblower.  That is 
my 
long-winded 
response 
Chairperson 
because 
I 
am 
referring to what I responded to last time and it is the 
same response I am making right now Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni did you prepare false 
whistleblower reports in order to target members of 
management who you did not want in the organisation? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to that 
particular question being referred to, in order not to 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 194 of 265 
 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni I didn’t have an opportunity to 
ask Ms Kwinana about these allegations because her 
evidence didn’t complete on Tuesday and I was still coming 
to the question, but are you aware that she gave this 
account of false whistleblower reports to OUTA shortly 
after she left SAA in August of 2016? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question so that I don’t incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I do just want to for the record be 
10 
clear, Ms Kwinana was asked about this in her regulation 
10.6 directive, her response in her 10.6 directive is: 
“I have no way of knowing whether the false 
whistleblower reports allegedly prepared by Ms 
Myeni are false or not.” 
That is her version on affidavit, I intend to pursue that with 
her tomorrow in the evidence.  I wanted to give Ms Myeni 
an opportunity to answer that allegation against her 
though. 
 
Ms Myeni I would now like to move to the BNP 
20 
transaction, is that a transaction you are aware of? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the 
question, to avoid incriminating myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni we received evidence of Ms 
Cynthia Stimpel before this Commission, I think she 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 195 of 265 
 
testified over two days dealing with the BNP transaction 
and she explained that around February 2015 SAA was in 
dire need of cash and had reported that to Treasury and so 
it was in the process of securing funding.  Can you confirm 
that that was the position in February 2015? 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
 
May 
I 
not 
respond 
to 
the 
question 
Chairperson to avoid incriminating myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Stimpel’s evidence was that there 
was a cross-functional team established in order to secure 
this funding and that they worked quite steadily on it but 
10 
then in October 2014 remember when the old complaining 
members of the Board are not retained and a much smaller 
board of yourself, Ms Kwinana, Mr Dixon and Dr Thambi is 
then put in place.  The Board on her version started to 
involve itself in securing funding.  Can you dispute her 
evidence on that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond to the 
question so that I don’t incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Stimpel’s evidence was that that 
level of Board involvement was something that she had not 
20 
experienced before at SAA in her many years. Are aware of 
that level of Board involvement prior to transaction at 
SAA? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson may I not respond so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 196 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It got to a point where the Board actually 
involved itself both in reviewing the draft RFP for the 
funding 
that 
was 
required, 
evaluating 
proposals 
and 
appointing bidders and Ms Stimpel said that similarly was 
unprecedented in the history of SAA’s funding endeavours, 
do you dispute that?  
MS MYENI:   What is the name of the person?   Sorry, what 
is the name of the person? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Stimpel, Ms Stimpel. 
MS MYENI:   Was she an executive? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She was Group Treasurer at the time. 
MS MYENI:   Was she an executive ma’am? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No she was not ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   Was she in the Exco? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no she was running the cross-
functional 
team 
who 
was 
responsible 
for 
security 
...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   It is unprecedented for a junior executive or a 
junior 
manager 
or 
a 
manager 
to 
expect 
that 
the 
Chairperson would just know her from Cynthia.   Under 
20 
normal circumstances Chairperson if the board members 
mentioned here do not include executive directors then it is 
not a factual reporting or accurate representation.  The 
Board was constituted in accordance with the MOU of the 
organisation.  There will be a specific number which would 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 197 of 265 
 
be minimum to maximum.   Now what I am surprised about 
is the mention of the non-executive director but the 
executive directors are not mentioned Chairperson. 
 
Secondly if you were not a deputy finance person or 
a deputy CEO or maybe an HR executive, or any other 
executive it would be difficult for me to remember the other 
layer that was not at the executive level, so there is an 
assumption by Ms Hofmeyr that when she says Cynthia 
then I would automatically know who Cynthia is.  I was not 
a CEO of SAA, I was a non-executive director and the 
10 
chairperson of the Board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   So that is why I am asking who is Cynthia. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni I think it is a product of the 
delay and maybe  a break in transmission.  I would never 
in the proceedings of this Commission refer to somebody 
by only their first name.  I did refer to her as Ms Cynthia 
Stimpel, I asked you about whether you had watched her 
evidence and the question I put to you is just the evidence 
she has presented to the Commission.  Her evidence is 
20 
when they were seeking this funding in of February 2015 
and the months thereafter the Board got involved in vetting 
the RFP for the funding, evaluating the proposals for the 
funding and appointing the bidders in a way that she had 
never – sorry – appointed the bidders to whom the RFP 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 198 of 265 
 
would 
be 
circulated 
and 
she 
said 
she 
had 
never 
experienced that before, and so what I was asking you was 
do you dispute that this was the first time in a funding 
scenario that the Board was getting it itself involved. 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
 
May 
I 
not 
respond 
to 
the 
question 
Chairperson, in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What happened was the RFP went out 
according to Ms Stimpel’s evidence, bids were received, 
evaluations were done and that cross-functional sourcing 
team in which she was involved selected a combination of 
10 
three 
banks 
to 
source 
the 
funds 
Standard 
Charter, 
Nedbank and ABSA and they were ready to go but then 
there was a board meeting that was convened on the 3 r d of 
December 2015 at which it was decided that the Free State 
Development Corporate should be the funder for SAA.  Do 
you recall that decision being taken by the Board? 
MS MYENI:   May I Chairperson not respond to the 
question being posed to avoid incriminating myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni you are indicated as having 
been a member of the Board at the time and a supporter of 
20 
that decision and that was the evidence of Ms Stimpel 
insofar 
as 
the 
records 
of 
the 
decision 
making 
was 
concerned and in the light of that I would like to ask you 
how it could be that you took the view, as one of the voting 
board members that a public entity like the Free State 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 199 of 265 
 
Development Corporation could become involved in funding 
an SOE? 
MS MYENI:   What is the problem with the question you are 
asking me ma’am? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well National Treasury regulations says 
that 
it 
was 
not 
within 
the 
Free 
State 
Development 
Corporation’s legal mandate to fund an entity like South 
African Airways, its mandate was limited to development 
projects within the Free State, so I am asking you why you 
as a Board member supported the FBC funding SAA to the 
10 
tune of R15billion?  
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to that question 
Chairperson, so that I don’t incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what happened first is that there is 
this decision of the Board on the 3 r d of December 2015 to 
get FDC to be the funder, but that is scuppered because in 
early January 2016 National Treasury conveys to the team 
at SAA that the FBC would be beyond its mandate if it were 
to provide this funding, and on Ms Stimpel’s evidence what 
then happens is that the Board decided to appoint a 
20 
transaction advisor to source and facilitate this funding 
that SAA was looking for.  Do you remember making that 
decision?  
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 200 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you dispute that you were a member 
of the Board that made that decision? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Stimpel said the Board’s decision 
was to her mind concerning because all that work that her 
team had done in running the RFP process, in getting the 
bids from the banks was now going to be redone by this 
transactional advisor.  Why was the Board thinking a 
transactional advisor needed to be appointed to do work 
10 
that had already been done. 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson I don’t want to 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So a process was run according to the 
evidence of Ms Stimpel, and an entity called B & P Capital 
was awarded the contract as a transaction advisor.  We 
received the evidence of Mr Mhlangu who was a director of 
B & P Capital before this Commission and in the course of 
his evidence it was pointed out to him that there were 
numerous false statements and incomplete documents in 
20 
the bid submission.  Does it surprise you that an entity like 
B & P Capital could run through a procurement process at 
SAA while you were its chairperson, be awarded a tender 
and then having done so when it had included false 
statements 
and 
incomplete 
documents 
in 
its 
bid 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 201 of 265 
 
submission? 
MS MYENI:    Only white transaction plan advisors would 
rather be preferred, is it because he was a Mhlangu or is it 
because he had no capabilities of doing the work or he did 
not compete with other tenderers, with other service 
providers, it is a question of clarity chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:  What would make him not able to do a job for 
South African Airways, was it a reserved space for either 
banks or was it a reserved space for some of the 
10 
consultants or financial entities that would be able to 
source funding for South African Airways, I am just asking 
a question because there must be a beginning for a new 
entrant to be able to be also counted in the current 
situation in the country where any other person who is 
competent to do the work must do the work, but now I am 
asked why Mhlangu, why B & P Capital, I have never met 
him, I don’t know him, but I am being asked a question 
which is operational.   Cynthia Chairperson would have 
reported to the CFO who is an Executive Director of SAA, 
20 
therefore Chair with this background I am not invoking my 
privilege but I am not responding to the question that has 
been asked. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni that is not an answer to my 
question, my question was based on the evidence before 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 202 of 265 
 
this Commission that B & P Capital submitted a bid 
containing false statements, and incomplete documents 
and despite that were awarded a tender.   And I asked you 
whether it would concern you to learn that that is how a 
procurement process was run at SAA. 
MS MYENI:   The non-executive director – sorry if the 
Executive Director, the CFO, had come to me and told me 
that these bidders are before us with false information that 
is something else, but for me to say did it concern me or 
does it concern me or would it have concerned me.  Chair 
10 
may I not answer this question in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mhlangu testified that a Mr Masotsha 
Mugadi was – I am paraphrasing now, but really the brains 
behind B & P and that it was he who had all the meetings 
with SAA and there was an allegation that Mr Mugadi is a 
business associate of your son’s, is that correct? 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
 
May 
I 
not 
respond 
to 
the 
question 
Chairperson in case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What then happened in the passage of 
events is after B & P was appointed as a transactional 
20 
advisor there was a decision taken to get the B & P to then 
source a R15billion that had never imparted the original 
tender but the Board took a decision to now extend the 
scope of B & P, without going out on tender for the 
sourcing of the funds and to get ...[intervenes]  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 203 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   Sorry Chairperson, can I just get clarity 
there, who appointed B & P Capital? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   B & P Capital as transaction advisor was 
appointed, I think it fell within the CEO’s delegation, I 
would just have to check that. 
MS MYENI:   I think for clarity. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sure.  So now I am asking this extension 
of the scope of the transactional advisor was a decision of 
the Board, so the transactional advisor had then selected 
through 
a 
procurement 
process, 
but 
then 
the 
Board 
10 
intervened on the 21 s t of April 2016 to extend B & P’s 
scope to include the sourcing of funds.  Do you recall 
having made that decision? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the 
question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you dispute that ...[intervenes]   
MS MYENI:   ...in case I implicate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you dispute that as a member of the 
Board you took that decision to extend the scope in a 
situation where no procurement process was followed prior 
20 
to its extension? 
MS MYENI:   I request to invoke the privilege Chairperson 
of not responding to the question, in case I incriminate 
myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then a fairly odd thing happened, 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 204 of 265 
 
because the Board had taken the decision to extend the 
scope of B & P to include sourcing of funds, but – and that 
was on the 21 s t of April, but then on the 6 t h of May, a few 
weeks 
later, 
Ms 
Stimpel 
was 
asked 
to 
sign 
a 
bid 
adjudication 
committee 
submission 
motivating 
for 
the 
decision that the Board had already taken.  Is that 
something that regularly happened at SAA under your 
watch?  
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chair person, in case I 
incriminate myself.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Stimpel around the 6 t h of May was 
going away and she was concerned that this BEAC 
submission should not be signed, and she instructed her 
colleague, Mr Kline, not to sign the BEAC submission but 
she was told by him that he had received pressure to do so 
and had done so.  Were you aware of this pressure being 
applied pursuant to the Board’s resolution on the 21 s t of 
April 2016 to get the BAC submission signed? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson, may I not 
respond I don’t want to incriminate myself. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then what happened was the Board 
approved the appointment for a second time of B & P on 
the 24 t h of May 2016.  Do you dispute that you were a 
member of the Board that took that decision? 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
 
May 
I 
not 
respond 
to 
the 
question 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 205 of 265 
 
Chairperson I don’t want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now the Board took the decision on the 
24 t h of May 2016, it was communicated to B & P on the 25 t h 
of May 2016, and on the same day that B & P was 
appointed to source funds, B & P wrote back to SAA and 
said that it wanted SAA to commit itself to a cancellation 
fee for the work that it had already done on sourcing funds, 
despite the fact that it  hadn’t been appointed to do so  
Were you aware that B & P was seeking a cancellation fee 
on those terms? 
10 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chair in 
case I incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So on the very same it is appointed it 
wants SAA to commit to a cancellation fee.  I think the 
cancellation fee started off at about R300million.  Do you 
recall Ms Nansi having discussed that with you? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you dispute that that initial amount of 
R300million was brought to your attention? 
20 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was a series of correspondence 
between B & P and SAA at the time as it kept motivating 
for this cancellation fee.  It made reference to the fact that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 206 of 265 
 
they had been trying to seek funders in all sorts of foreign 
locations and had to take trips there in order to do so. We 
received however the evidence of the main funder, which 
was an entity called Grissag, do you know the entity 
Grissag? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson, may I not 
respond Chairperson because I don’t want to incriminate 
myself.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   The Commission received the evidence 
of Mr van der Merwe, who was a director of Grissag, who 
10 
told the Commission that what B & P was telling SAA about 
all the costs and work that it had done was false.  Are you 
aware of that evidence? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   All of a sudden in this interchange 
between SAA and B & P Capital that initial fee of 
R300million 
dropped 
to 
R49.9million 
and 
Ms 
Nansi’s 
evidence was that that followed a call that she was told 
you had made to Mr Zwane.  Do you dispute that you made 
20 
a call to Mr Zwane dealing with this drop of the B & P 
Capital cancellation fee amount? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Nansi’s evidence was that that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 207 of 265 
 
conversation – in that conversation as relayed to her by Mr 
Zwane was that you had enquired about the level of the 
CEO’s CAP of delegation because Ms Nansi was raising 
issues about it going to the Board and you wanted to find 
out from Mr Zwane at what level the decision to approve 
the cancellation fee would not be required to go to the 
Board.  Do you dispute that that conversation took place 
between you and Mr Zwane? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I don’t 
incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni you were I think on our 
records the only member of the Board who supported 
approving the cancellation fee, do you dispute that you 
were the only member of the Board that approved the 
cancellation fee? 
MS MYENI:   Where did the approval, the motivation come 
from Ms  Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will deal with that in a moment.   It 
came from Ms Nansi, I would like to take you first to your 
email in which you convey your approval.   You will find 
20 
that in Bundle DD1, so if you can pick that up and it is the 
second file, so it will be DD1B and we need page 559. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at five.   
MS MYENI:   I have it, I have it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you intend to ask one or two questions 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 208 of 265 
 
or what is your… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If I could just deal with this email and then 
we could think about logistics Chair.  Could I complete the 
email depending on my learned friend’s position? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mr Buthelezi is that fine?  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  You have 559 in front of you, 
do you Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:  I was going to ask for the page. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
MS MYENI:  I have the file I found so page 559? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes you will find it under Tab 59 in that file 
is that assists.   
MS MYENI:  I have it Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like to start mid-way on the page 
because that is an email from the com – Deputy Company 
Secretary it is addressed: 
“Dear SAA board member” 
And it says: 
“Attached herewith for your consideration 
and approval please find the Round Robin in 
20 
respect of the approval of the cancellation 
fee to the transaction advisor.  Please kindly 
communicate your decisions as indicated in 
the Round Robin form” 
And then above that is an email from your Jacob Zuma 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 209 of 265 
 
Foundation address dated the 7 July 2016 returning – 
responding to the Deputy Company Secretary and your email 
reads: 
“Dear Mdu does this need board approval if 
so I approve it.  Regards Ms Dudu Myeni 
Executive Chairperson.” 
Ms Myeni do you dispute having sent this email? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond so that I do not 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni is fairness to you I must put it to 
10 
that your first sentence of that email querying whether this 
decision needed board approval is consistent with the 
version that Ms Nhantsi presented to this commission related 
to your conversation with Ms Zwane about what the level 
would be in order for the matter not to come to the board for 
approval? Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair those were my questions in relation 
to that email and I am very conscious of my learned friend’s 
20 
constraints so maybe we should be thinking about taking 
matters forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You might be needing about thirty 
minutes or at least not more than an hour to finish? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh yes certainly. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 210 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Should we – should we make 
arrangements to – for Ms Myeni to give evidence during one 
of the evening sessions that we can – we can look at on one 
of the days.  From your side how does that – without 
speaking about the date how does that sound to Ms Hofmeyr 
from your side? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to the date. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Buthelezi subject to the date would 
10 
that be fine with you?  It might be from five to six – one hour 
or depending but coming in at five or at four just depending 
on the date that we – we can arrange? 
ADV BUTHELEZI: You see Chair the time now we are just 
slightly above five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV BUTHELEZI:  If I could get a firm - firm undertaking 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  If I could get a firm, firm undertaking by 
20 
latest half past five we could then wrap it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We could wrap it up. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Then in its entirety so that it does not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have to – yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Roll over. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 211 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How does – how does that sound Ms 
Hofmeyr?   It is just that you sometimes you can never be 
sure? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I really cannot I will do my absolute best 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there is … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I cannot commit in a way that – that 
means… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I guess you can commit if – if it was 
something like not more than forty-five minutes, not more 
10 
than an hour. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Not more than an hour.  I could very 
comfortably commit to it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but within the time that is left you might 
not be sure. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you do not want to mislead him. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say.. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will finish by half past five. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  No Chair, no Chair.  I object to the hour.  
I am giving thirty minutes because we are here now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am not saying let us go for an 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 212 of 265 
 
hour.  Ja I am not saying that. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  So I am saying Chair we have done the 
utmost in making sure that we wrap everything up by today 
including the fact that we agreed to come in early even after 
having run days with – we agree now second time to a 
further extension.   
So I think Chair there has got to be a level of 
fairness to say, look the commission must do its work but 
also have within reasonable parameters for the rest of us to 
say, what I do not want to happen is to leave this hanging 
10 
today and then we spend two, three, four weeks trying to 
organise the next date because of the availability issues on 
our side.   
I think it is also prejudicial to client to have this thing 
now hanging by another hour after she spent three days 
committed to the process. So what we envisaged at the start 
of the process was that come this time today this would 
behind us.  So we are making as much comprises as we can 
to say, let us put this behind us.   
And we then also implore on the commission to say, I 
20 
think allocate the time of three days for yourselves to say we 
want this witness here for three days.  The witness has been 
here for three days and we have now even on the third day 
given further – further times.  I think they also need to come 
to the party Chair. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 213 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the problem with that is even if Ms 
Hofmeyr – even if we proceed – continue then she finished 
by half past that would not necessarily mean – guarantee 
that Ms Myeni will not be asked to come back.  So that is not 
a guarantee.  But what is – what we – what I am interested 
in is to try and make sure that everyone is reasonably 
accommodated.   
 
If we – if the position is that we do not finish or we 
cannot finish today because of time constraints we look at 
another 
time 
when 
everybody 
can 
make 
themselves 
10 
available.  
 
Now when I talk about an evening session maybe 
from form five to six or whatever from my side I am looking 
as soon as possible but I accept that not everybody might be 
available so it is subject to discussion that part. 
 
When we are looking at a date that is close by like 
within two weeks that we discuss – we can discuss but when 
we looking at a date that is quite far we do not discuss that.  
We can fix the date because we are giving reasonable 
notice.  But when it is close we accept that that might not be 
20 
reasonable 
notice 
therefore 
it 
should 
be 
subject 
to 
discussion. 
 
 
So – so – but I do know – I do not know what – or Ms 
Hofmeyr actually did say there is a part that would be dealt 
with by another member of the legal team that – that is the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 214 of 265 
 
part that relates to Eskom. 
 
So when Ms Hofmeyr has finished it does not mean 
that everything has been finished.  I know that Mr Seleka 
had in mind that he would get time today to – to question Mr 
Myeni on Eskom but obviously that has not happened. 
 
So it may well be that we should not be looking at – 
we might not be looking at an hour.  But the Eskom part I 
know is a very narrow issue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a very narrow issue.  I cannot see it 
10 
taking more than an hour.  So it may be that we should look 
at maybe about two hours which could be four to six; which 
could be five to seven on… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On an evening that we can agree upon in 
the next two weeks or something like that. So basically the 
idea is we can talk about when it should be as long as 
everyone accepts the principle. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Chair.  We have just got one or two 
propositions.  Initially we had the one question that hung 
20 
over with Mr Manaka’s affidavit maybe we had accepted that 
we could receive written questions which we could respond. I 
do not know whether if it is still feasible to take the same 
approach for the balance of Ms Hofmeyr’s questions to come 
via written questions.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 215 of 265 
 
I do not think – I am not too sure what the attitude is 
with regards to Ms Seleka’s questions.  However then given 
client’s constraints and logistics I – we cannot commit at this 
point what we could do but we would endeavour if the Chair 
insists that we pursue with oral evidence then that we just do 
a similar formula even if it would open the evenings via 
video link so that it does not matter where she is that she is 
still able to then [00:10:01] of having to plan a whole 
logistics.   
I – we are Gauteng based.  It would be easier for us.  
10 
So if we can leave it to the Chair [00:10:10] arrange maybe 
dates.  I cannot speak for them but I think maybe around if 
you say Chair it should happen soon the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  She would still be allowed to then do 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no in terms of Ms Myeni giving 
evidence via video link that can still happen.  That can be 
arranged.  That is point 1. 
2.  As long as the principle is accepted to say we might have 
20 
to use an evening session then  
1. I can leave Ms Hofmeyr and yourselves and maybe Mr 
Seleka to talk about a date which I can approve.  If no 
agreement is reached then I will fix a date and give 
reasonable time. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 216 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Perhaps that will be the – that would be 
the arrangement – but preferably we would seek to – I would 
seek that we all agree on a date that is close. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair could I – could I just make the 
following submissions?  My learned friend referenced the 
fact that three days had been set aside which we absolutely 
accept.   
But what – we should not lose sight of the fact that 
we started appreciably later than we had hoped to on the 
10 
first day because we were told the day before and let me be 
clear.  I fully understand why we were told the day before 
that Ms Myeni had recently had an exposure to Covid.   
She needed to take precautions and because of that 
we – from Tuesday late afternoon had to start making 
arrangements for how to facilitate the video link evidence 
that would happen the following day.  So what I am just 
trying to get clear is there was a delayed start.   
We really had estimated being able to do it in three 
days but unfortunately had had to take those steps to 
20 
facilitate the Zoom evidence given her recent exposure.  I 
understand she could not have notified us earlier than that.  
What I am particularly worried about as I think about it now 
is these 55 files that have to get to Ms Myeni wherever she 
is going to be.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 217 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I understood her earlier to say that 
she is going to be flying somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Either tonight or tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that might mean she is in a different 
location when we reconvene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And off the back of all of that  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What I would like to suggest is whether 
there is any way that at least this evidence could complete 
itself today.  I will explain why?  If all that is left over is the 
Eskom evidence I know that there is one file for Eskom.   
So that would be a much easier logistical thing to 
manage with Ms Myeni wherever she is located and to do it 
potentially by Zoom.  But there really will be a logistical 
difficulty.   
If we cannot go on today I do understand if we cannot 
20 
but then we need to think very creatively on how we are 
going to get 55 files to wherever Ms Myeni is going to be 
after she takes her flight.  I think it was either later today or 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the question that would arise is 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 218 of 265 
 
whether given the fact that you think you are something like 
thirty minutes or forty five minutes away from finishing 
whether she would still need all those many files or whether 
there would only be a few – two or three that she might need 
which would obviously be better than 55. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is true.  Though there could be – 
there could be a culling definitely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  So I mean 
certainly if one is talking about 55 or forty something files 
logistically that could be a nightmare in terms – and if she 
10 
has got to testify via video link from – too far from – out 
away from Gauteng.  But if it is a few files as you say that 
might be fine.  Okay let us – shall we say  
1. You will talk – the lawyers will talk on both sides and 
can then be approached by yourself to approve a date.  
And then as I say if there is no agreement we will – I 
will just fix a date. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But give reasonable time.  Before we 
finalise – oh you want to say something Mr Buthelezi. 
20 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair we were going to ask that we 
adjourn for maybe just five minutes and we discuss amongst 
ourselves the extent to which  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  We can accommodate today because first 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 219 of 265 
 
prize would be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To finish. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  To finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  So in other words that [00:15:14] just can 
remain today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  It would be ideal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  And I think I also am conscious of client 
10 
not to have this pending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  It is pending [00:15:28]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  It is not depending even after so let the 
[00:15:31] bring to an end Chair.  It would be really 
appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  So we are going to try to accommodate 
but with reluctance I am not saying there is a reluctance to 
20 
accommodate us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  I am saying Ms Hofmeyr… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to explore? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:  Must also try herself to say okay fine let 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 220 of 265 
 
us – let us discuss it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine we can adjourn.  I think 
as long as you appreciate I do not know Ms Hofmeyr might 
be – might be up to date about this.  As long as you 
appreciate that there is the Eskom part which might have to 
come later or might continue depending.  I do not know if Mr 
Seleka is around or whatever but let me adjourn for five 
minutes.  Ms Myeni you understand what is being discussed 
here? 
MS MYENI:  I do Chair.  Thank you so much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  From you side you do not have any 
particular serious difficulty with whatever arrangement? 
MS MYENI:  Chairperson with respect to the commission I 
made an undertaking and I still do whatever that is 
reasonable to all of us but the first prize is to finish Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Today if possible. 
MS MYENI:  Because what I do not want is to find myself 
Chair with the exposure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MYENI:  And now the pressure that I am undergoing here 
20 
then I end up starting to have my low immune system.  So I 
am trying by all means in between here these breaks have 
been assistance because I am taking vitamins and stuff like 
that.  So I am just telling Chair I am flexible but I am also 
within a certain reasonable time I would prefer to finish. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 221 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To finish okay no that is alright.  Let us 
take an adjournment.  It is about seventeen minutes past so 
maybe we return at twenty five past.  We adjourn. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Buthelezi. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, Chair.  We said let us 
proceed Chair and Mr Seleka must also come and proceed 
10 
because he is one person with one party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   So I do not foresee why it would be 
difficult for him to latch onto that.  We are running for how 
long and however it needs to run, let Ms Hofmeyr finish her 
part and then Mr Seleka arrives and then we finish tonight 
and then we all go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I – as I said, I do not know what 
Mr Seleka’s position is.  He, as I understand it, certainly was 
going to be available if Ms Hofmeyr had finished at a certain 
20 
time but whether he was going to be available after, is 
something that I do not know anything about.  So it just 
depends on that.  That is something I do not know anything 
about.   
ADV HOFMEYR ADDRESSES THE CHAIR:   Chair, let me be 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 222 of 265 
 
clear.  I indicated to Mr Seleka that we were going to run for 
the day and so that it would not be the case that we would 
get to this evidence today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so, he would not be prepare in any 
way to do the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it would not, in my view, in any way 
be feasible to drag him through those circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So we – whatever happens, that evidence 
– if we are able to complete this evidence today, it will have 
to be done at another point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which regularly happens when we run out 
of time on the allocated days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If that is an issue for my learned friends, 
then we must move everything to that other day but I would 
be keen again to try and finish my section if we can. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay Mr Buthelezi. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Sorry, Chair.  We do not have an answer 
on 
the 
prospects 
of 
receiving 
written 
questions 
from 
Mr Seleka.   
CHAIRPERSON:   By Mr Seleka? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 223 of 265 
 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one, he is not here.  Two, I doubt 
that in regard to the Eskom part, I doubt that I would prefer 
that it be dealt with by way of written questions but, for 
example, with regard to the Manaka affidavit, I do not have a 
problem that it be dealt with...  Each issue depends on its 
own merits. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Then if we before we proceed then.  Can 
we get an undertaking from Ms Hofmeyr, how much longer 
are we here?   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   As I said previously, certainly no longer 
than an hour and maybe even shorter than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   That is fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Then let us proceed then on 
that basis. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Myeni, where we had 
stopped before we had this exchange, which unfortunately, I 
20 
am sorry it has taken longer and I know that it is going late 
into the evening - was at your email that we have looked at 
where 
you 
were 
asked 
whether 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
cancellation fee requires board approval, and you say:  It is 
so.  I approved it. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 224 of 265 
 
 
What I would like to ask you following from that 
Ms Myeni is, what motivated you to approve R 15 million to 
be 
paid 
to 
BNP 
Capital 
as 
a 
cancellation 
fees 
in 
circumstances where they asked for the fee on the very 
same day they were appointed on the basis that they had 
undertaken work already?   
 
How could that be a justifiable ground for committing to 
a, just short of R 15 million cancellation fee? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, Ms Nhantsi’s evidence before 
this Commission was that she did write that recommendation 
that you highlighted a moment ago in a question you asked 
me, to the board to approve the cancellation fee.   
 
But her testimony before this Commission was that she 
had reservations about it and she, nonetheless, wrote the 
recommendation because she feared what would happen if 
she did not do that.   
 
Because she said, you were putting pressure on her to 
get this deal done.  Just for the record before I have your 
20 
answer on this Ms Myeni.   
 
Chair, that can be found in the transcript of Ms Nhantsi’s 
evidence.  It is on the 19t h of June 2019, page 51, lines 1 to 
19.   
 
Ms Myeni, do you dispute that you were placing pressure 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 225 of 265 
 
on Ms Nhantsi to get this matter approved? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
in case I incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   She also indicated that one of the points 
that you made when you were encouraging her, or on her 
version pressurising her, to get this deal done, was that 
costs have been incurred in Paris(?).  How did you know 
that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
incriminate myself?   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because Mr Van der Merwe’s evidence 
before this Commission is that no costs had been incurred 
and that the letters prepared by the BNP Capital motivating 
for the cancellation fee on the basis that those costs had 
been incurred, was false.   
 
So it is just difficult for me to understand how you had 
come to have knowledge of those alleged fees being 
incurred.  Can you assist us with that? 
MS MYENI:   Chair, it is very difficult to sit before this 
Commission and get asked about nitty-gritty’s of operational 
20 
matters.  May I then, with respect Chair not respond to this 
question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is not so a nitty-gritty operational 
matter because you yourself, Ms Myeni, approved that SAA 
would be BNP Capital R 49.9 million if SAA pulled out of the 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 226 of 265 
 
transaction.  So the reason for my questions is because you 
yourself gave that approval.  And I am probing why you 
would give your approval in a situation ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   May ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...when a cancellation fee was sought on 
grounds that cannot be possible be justified for work that 
was done before the appointment was made.  How could that 
be a valid basis for a cancellation fee? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, what emerged in the evidence 
was that BNP Capital have had its FSP licence suspended at 
a point in time before it was approved as the source of these 
funds.  Were you aware of that? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the concern that arises from that 
fact is that someone at BNP was aware that this license had 
been 
suspended, 
was 
aware 
that 
the 
license 
was 
a 
prerequisite for their valid appointment, and they well had 
20 
been 
concerned 
that 
should 
SAA 
find 
out 
about 
the 
suspension of the license, they might pull the whole 
transaction.   
 
And so, instead of scoring a success fee which was their 
first terms of remuneration in this transaction, they then 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 227 of 265 
 
motivated for a cancellation fee.  Do you have any comment 
on that being what might have been going on in the 
background? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   There has also been evidence before this 
Commission that your son, Mr Thalente Myeni is a business 
associate of Mr Mugabi.  And I know I have already dealt 
with you about that earlier but there was a further indication 
that they had been seen at SAA together on occasion.  Can 
10 
you confirm whether that is so? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond [distortion 
present – speaker unclear]   
CHAIRPERSON:   We lost connection with Ms Myeni.  Can 
you hear me, Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   I can.  I can Chair.  Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think your answer was not 
complete.  Do you want to repeat it or your response? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   May I not respond to the question 
Chairperson in case I incriminate myself? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, were you going to benefit in 
any way if BNP Capital had secured the R 49.9 million 
cancellation fee? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond to the question Chairperson 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 228 of 265 
 
so that I avoid incriminating myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, did you lodge a criminal 
complaint against Ms Yakhe Kwinana arising from the 
AAR/JM Aviation contract on the Components Tender? 
MS MYENI:   Can you please repeat the question Ma’am 
because that would be an instruction by who?  And what is 
the motivation that you are talking about? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Sorry.  So I think you may not have 
heard me.  I have just asked, did you lodge a criminal 
complaint against Ms Kwinana arising from the AAR/JM 
10 
Aviation Contract for Components? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, it is important to get a full picture 
to say if I lodged a complaint, as who?  Because there is no 
decision when you are a board that you just decide alone on 
your own.   
 
If, for instance, you are a board of ten people.  At least 
the majority of the board must agree to doing something.  
Now I am saying, Dudu Myeni goes and open a case against 
Yakhe Kwinana or the board takes a decision, a resolution to 
go and open a case against Kwinana per...   
20 
 
Sorry, per instruction by the minister, by instruction by 
the investigators, per instruction by the CEO.  That is why I 
would like a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no. 
MS MYENI:   ...to hear. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 229 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Ms Myeni, the question is 
simple. 
 
Did 
you 
lay 
a 
criminal 
complaint 
against 
Ms Yakhe Kwinana in regard to the AAR/JM Aviation... is it B 
Tender or Component contract? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, if you want to say:  I did but I did not 
– I was not acting personally.  I was acting on the strength of 
a resolution of the board.  That is something you can clarify.  
But if you say you did not, then you say you did not. 
MS MYENI:  Chair, may I not respond then Chairperson so 
10 
that I do not incriminate myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Chair, this is an occasion where it is not 
clear to me that this privilege can be invoked.  I struggle to 
know what possible crime could arise from a question that is 
asked:  Did you lodge a criminal complaint?   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But I just note that and I am happy to 
proceed, depending on your direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I indicated, I think on Wednesday, 
that we will proceed and Ms Myeni would invoke her privilege 
20 
where she considers that is applicable but at some stage, 
yesterday or today, I might have a look at – and see where 
there are not certain questions where I would rule differently.   
 
So I have not done that except maybe in one or two – in 
regard to one or two questions over the past three days.  As 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 230 of 265 
 
we speak now, I am inclined to take the view that when we 
are done, that might be important that the legal team could 
go through the transcript and see where there are questions 
that it wishes to present submissions on whether she should 
be compelled.   
 
I would probably also would want to go through and see 
that.  It maybe that there might be none.  It may be that 
there might be some.  So I – if you want to leave it and move 
on and just place your position on record, I do not have a 
problem.  But Mr Buthelezi wants to say something. 
10 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Chair.  Just one point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV BUTHELEZI:   There may not be possible any criminal 
liability that may arise from the question on the surface but 
even 
the 
prospect 
of 
perjury 
yourself, 
renders 
you 
perceptible to criminal prosecution.   
 
So I think in part, it also goes to that point to say:  I do 
not want to incriminate myself in as far as I may perjury 
myself.   
 
So this is one of those questions where the witness, in 
20 
our view, is entitled to avoid the question because they do 
not want to run the risk of perjury themselves.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, you might want to say 
something. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 231 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might want to simply say:  No, you 
have recorded your position.  You will take it from there.  Or 
what would you like? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, the threat of committing perjury 
could never be a basis for invoking the privilege against self-
incrimination.  If that was so, every person ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...whoever comes before this Commission 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...would be able to invoke that in order – 
in a sense, to invoke a right to silence which they do not 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you cannot say:  I am...  I will lie if I 
give my answer.  So I invoke my right against – my privilege 
against self-incrimination not to give a lie.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we can make further submissions in 
due course but that could never be a basis for the 
20 
implication of the privilege. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but you have noted. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will leave it.  I have noted that that is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Chair, the record will show. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 232 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have been very careful to only raise the 
issue where it just does not appear on its face to be question 
that could ever lead to a series of questions to expose her to 
a criminal charge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I will just continue to note them when 
they arise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   My next question Ms Myeni is, did you 
10 
provide an affidavit to the police regarding the AAR/JM 
Aviation Contract for Components? 
CHAIRPERSON:   May I not respond Chairperson to avoid 
incriminating myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You certainly...  Ms Kwinana gave 
evidence on Monday or Tuesday that around the time that 
the contract was being finalised on the AAR/JM Aviation 
matter, you had asked her to give an account because there 
was commentary in the media, I think, flowing from Air 
France’s litigation on the case. 
20 
 
I think she said that the unions may have raised a 
concern.  Do you confirm that you asked for an account of 
the allegations that there was something untoward in the 
award of that contract? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson in case I 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 233 of 265 
 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was also evidence given my 
Ms Mamela who appeared before this Commission, that your 
specific concerns about the award of this contract in 
questionable circumstances, have been raised at SAAT 
Board meetings after the award was made.  Can you confirm 
whether you had those concerns and if so, what they were? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, I would then like to turn to the 
10 
30% set-aside policy that was embarked upon at SAA.  That 
policy was linked to the President’s State of the Nation 
Address in 2015, was it not? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again Chair, for the record.  It is not at all 
clear to me how – whether the 30% set-aside policy was 
linked to the former President’s State of the Nation Address 
in 2015 could expose Ms Myeni to a criminal charge.  But I 
will move on for now.   
20 
 
Ms Myeni, you received communications, both from 
National Treasury and from the DTI that the 30% set-aside 
policy was unlawful, did you not? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 234 of 265 
 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
And 
having 
received 
those 
communications from National Treasury and the BBBEE 
Commissioner, why was it that, despite that you, and 
particularly Ms Kwinana, together with your other board 
members, pushed for the imposition of this 30% set-aside 
policy? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson so that I do not 
incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, the Commission has received 
evidence that on that on Friday the 2 n d of October 2015, you 
10 
and Ms Kwinana held a lengthy meeting with Dr Dahwa who 
was then the Head of Procurement at SAA. 
 
And his version is that you placed pressure on him to 
prepare letters of award to Swissport and Engen arising from 
the 30% set-aside policy.   
 
Ms Kwinana had denied before this Commission that that 
meeting took place.  Do you confirm that the meeting took 
place or do you, like her, deny that it took place? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson?  I do not want 
to incriminate myself?   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again, Chair it is not clear to me that that 
question could – answering that question could expose 
Ms Myeni to a criminal charge.   
 
Dr Dahwa’s evidence is that at that meeting you said to 
him that you were keep to take his job away, that the EFF 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 235 of 265 
 
were going to be protesting at SAA the following Monday, 
and he would be at risk because they were going to 
protesting against those who are anti-transformation and 
Zimbabweans.   
 
Do you recall issuing that threat to Dr Dahwa? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you dispute that you threatened him in 
that way? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the 
10 
question?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Dr Dahwa...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   I do not want to incriminate myself.  And 
Chairperson, Dr Dahwa did not report to the chairman of the 
board.  I do not want to incriminate myself.  May I please not 
respond to the question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Dr Dahwa’s evidence was that he was 
extremely 
distressed 
by 
that 
meeting 
on 
the 
2n d of October 2015.  Were you aware that he was very 
distressed by it over the course of the day? 
20 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again, I – for the record Chair, it is not 
clear to me that that is a question that would – the answer to 
it would expose Ms Myeni to a criminal charge.  After that 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 236 of 265 
 
meeting, you received a letter from Ms Kwinana in which she 
called on you to take strong disciplinary action against 
Dr Dahwa for what she alleged was his insubordination, his 
efforts to sabotage SAA.  Did you share those views of 
Ms Kwinana? 
MS 
MYENI:  
 
May I 
not 
respond to this 
questions 
Chairperson?  I do not want to incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   After that letter was sent to you Ms Myeni 
on the 9t h of October 2015, Dr Dahwa was served with a 
charge sheet and he then was subjected to a disciplinary 
10 
process.  Did you support the decision to discipline him? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the...  May I 
not Chair to the question?  I would not want to incriminate 
myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again Chair, for the record.  It is not clear 
to me that the answer to that question could expose 
Ms Myeni to a criminal charge.  Dr Dahwa’s letter of 
suspension was prepared by Ms Phumeza Nhantsi, just a few 
days after she had taken up the position as acting CFO. 
 
So she was in a position where she had no personal 
20 
knowledge of the grounds for disciplining Dr Dahwa.  Did you 
assist in the compilation of that letter of suspension at all? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond Chairperson to the question?  
I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again Chair, it does not – it is not clear to 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 237 of 265 
 
me that that could be a question – the answer to which would 
expose Ms Myeni to a criminal charge.  Ms Myeni, the 
disciplinary proceedings against Dr Dahwa commenced on 
the 16 t h of March.  And do you have any knowledge of these 
proceedings? 
MS MYENI:   That is an operational matter, Ma’am. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is the answer no then? 
MS MYENI:   The answer is, it is an operational matter.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is not an answer to my question.  My 
question is.  Did you know that his disciplinary proceedings 
10 
began on the 16t h of March 2016? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, in view of my answer not 
acceptable, then may I not respond to the question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Ms Myeni, just to be clear.  It is not 
that it is not acceptable.  It is just that you – that question 
requires a yes or a no.  And so, it would be helpful if you 
could indicate.  If you do not have knowledge, that you do 
not.  Saying it is an operational matter, does not actually 
answer the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You see ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MYENI:   May I then not respond Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, Ms Myeni ...[intervenes]  
MS MYENI:   Because all these questions...  Sorry, Chair.  
Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am saying ...[intervenes]  
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 238 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am saying, the question requires you to 
say whether you know or you do not know.  And that it may 
be an operation matter, might mean that you do not know.  
But there may be operational matters that you know.  So it is 
more about what you know or what you do not know. 
MS MYENI:   Chair, may I then...  I appreciate that you are – 
you have given me clarity.  Then can I then invoke my 
privilege to say, I would not like to respond to the question in 
case I incriminate myself? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again Chair for the record.  That is not a 
question that certainly, as I consider it, would expose – the 
answer to which expose Ms Myeni to a criminal charge.   
 
There 
was 
quite 
severe 
concerns 
within 
the 
HR 
Department of South African Airways about the manner in 
which that disciplinary process was conducted.  And despite 
the Head of HR raising those concerns...   
 
Well, the Head of Employee Relations, raising those 
concerns, the process was continued with.  Did those 
concerns ever reached your level Ms Myeni? 
20 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond to the question 
so that I do not incriminate myself?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   That again Chair is not a question, the 
answer to which, in our view, would expose Ms Myeni to a 
criminal charge.  Chairperson, I appear to have done a little 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 239 of 265 
 
bit better on my estimation of time.  I would like, if I may 
then, to move to some of the conclusory aspects that I would 
like to put to Ms Myeni for her comment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine.  Matters relating to 
the suspension and ultimately departure of Ms Mpshe did 
you cover those, something that... 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I have dealt with Dr Dahwa because 
there were indications in the papers that that might have 
elevated to Ms Myeni’s …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But sorry, Chair, you do remind about an 
aspect that I must traverse.  Thank you very much for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, Ms Mphse gave evidence 
before this Commission about the Air Chefs contract.  Well, 
it was first the LSG Sky Chefs contract, the award to it to 
provide lounge catering services at various airports and 
then an attendance at parliament on the 2 September 
2015.  Do you remember attending parliament on that day? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, so that I do 
20 
not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, let me just record now, knowing 
the questions that I am anticipating asking, it is not clear 
to me that the answers to any of these questions would 
tend to expose Ms Myeni to a criminal charge, so I am 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 240 of 265 
 
going to say that now just to cover all of them so I do not 
have to keep saying it.  Ms Mpshe said that there was an 
issue taken up when you presented before the portfolio 
committee on that day and there was criticism levelled at 
South African Airways for having awarded this contract to 
LSG Sky Chefs.  Do recall that criticism having been 
made? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, I would not 
want to incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Her evidence was that when the meeting 
10 
adjourned and you were outside the room with her you 
berated her in front of colleagues and said how could we 
give this contract to a foreign company.  Do you remember 
saying that to her? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, I know for a 
fact that I would incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, do you dispute Ms Mpshe’s 
version that that is what you did after the meeting at 
parliament? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What then followed, Ms Myeni was 
…[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   So that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What then followed, Ms Myeni, was a 
number of interactions between the board and Ms Mpshe 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 241 of 265 
 
as she endeavoured to explain to the board why the 
decision had been taken to go out on tender on that matter, 
what had informed that decision, the fact that LSG Sky 
Chefs was actually a local company, not a foreign entity.  
She explained that the concerns that Ms Kwinana had 
raised around the loss of jobs had been catered for 
because the employees would be moved over.  She also 
addressed how negligible a portion of the revenue of Air 
Chefs this contract actually occupied.  She went and got 
advice from the legal department about the consequences 
10 
of SAA of cancelling that contract and despite that, the 
board of SAA on the 28 September 2015 took a decision to 
cancel the award to LSG Sky Chefs and to award it to Air 
Chefs.  Against the backdrop of what the Acting CEO was 
saying to you as the board at that time, why did you make 
that decision, Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   What, Ma’am, to cancel LSG tender? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond, Chairperson, 
to the question so that I do not incriminate myself. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You took that decision …[intervenes] 
MS 
MYENI: 
 
 
But 
also, 
Chairperson, 
sorry. 
 
But, 
Chairperson, it can also help you, Chair, to say – or help 
this Commission to say where I am sitting it would not 
make sense to take a competitor of Air Chefs and give all 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 242 of 265 
 
the work of South African Airways to another company.  In 
as far as I am concerned, Chair, in any work environment, 
Chairperson, 
there 
are 
decisions 
you 
take 
that 
are 
motivated and informed by the CEO or the CFO, that they 
motivate for you to consider applying your mind, exercise 
duty, care and skill and ensure that the decision is a 
proper decision that you would stand by.  In this case, 
Chair, Air Chefs was, if it still exists, a subsidiary of South 
African Airways.  So South African Airways Catering 
Services ought to have been provided by Air Chefs.  So, 
10 
Chairperson, I can safely stop right there.  I have provided 
what I can but I am deliberately limiting it to as far as I 
have spoken.  Thank you, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The board’s decision to cancel the 
award to LSG Sky Chefs was against the advice of its own 
internal legal department.  Why did you take a decision 
against the advice of your own legal department? 
MS MYENI:   Chair, I said the motivation, when it comes to 
the board, it is not a gun put on the face of the board or on 
the head of any decision-maker within the board.  When a 
20 
motivation come, it is not a do or die.  You have got to 
read 
what 
is 
before 
you, 
understand 
the 
financial 
implications, understand the risk, understand also the – 
maybe capabilities of those that you prefer than what you 
already have.  In this case Air Chefs LSG provided similar 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 243 of 265 
 
services.  Now if we are to close Air Chefs and take LSG, 
that process ought to have been a properly deliberated 
upon process but whoever provides any motivation to the 
board, it does not mean that you will not have different 
views as the board.  One can decide to say yes, one can 
decide to say no.  So unless you are asking me as Dudu, 
then I can tell you what my view was then or what my view 
is today.  But, Chairperson, I am saying I can only go as 
far as this, it does not mean that when you are given a 
legal advice you must take every advice that comes.   
10 
It does not mean that the board memos, all board 
memoranda that were provided to the board meant that all 
of us will say yes.  It does not operate like that at that 
decision-making level.  You have got to apply your mind, 
you have got to ask questions as well.  It does not mean 
also 
that 
when 
you 
received 
the 
memorandum 
from 
whoever then it means that memorandum is like you must 
say yes, thumbs up.  You weight many things.   
My views might not even touch on the – say, for 
instance, another person would look at a risk that I would 
20 
not have thought about.  Another person in the board might 
raise another question that you did not think about or you, 
yourself, you would ask a question to say have we really 
thought about this or should we defer this decision and 
then come back about it and say maybe let us explore this.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 244 of 265 
 
So it does not mean, Ms Hofmeyr, that because it 
came from a legal department of SAA then it meant that we 
must just rubber stamp and not apply our minds.  I am just 
saying that, Chair, I can go as far as that because it looks 
like these questions, they keep following each other, 
following each other.  I would not, in my personal capacity, 
replace Air Chefs without following a proper process of 
killing, killing a subsidiary, and opt for LSG instead of 
continuing with your own baby.  In other words, we ought to 
have killed a child that was established by SAA as a 
10 
subsidiary.    
In other words, low cost airlines like Mango, we 
would have like – it is a comparative to say, in other words, 
take our passengers to a competing airline, leave Mango.  
It was not going to be a good decision. 
This is my view, Chairperson, and I can only 
elaborate further at another forum, Chairperson. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, are you a lawyer? 
MS MYENI:   In the board you have a different type of 
skills.  I am not a lawyer but a lawyer might not be a 
20 
finance person.  A lawyer can be a legal expert but a 
chartered 
accountant 
can 
look 
at 
the 
financial 
risk.  
Another person would look at the HR component of the risk 
of whatever decision.  Then you listen to all other inputs 
from different people.  I do not have to be a lawyer to be 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 245 of 265 
 
able to take decisions that are good for that particular 
operation that you are running.  So if all of us would be 
lawyers in order to take good decisions then we will not 
complement each other.  You need very – a spread of skills 
to be able to complement each other.  Definitely you have 
seen my CV, Ma’am, therefore I do not think I need to 
respond to your question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you seek the guidance of any other 
lawyers to check whether they disagreed with the advice 
that your own legal department was giving you about the 
10 
consequences of cancelling the LSG Sky Chefs award? 
MS MYENI:   What was your question, Ma’am? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you seek the views any other 
lawyers about whether the advice of your own legal 
department concerning the consequences of cancelling that 
award were correct or not? 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, with respect, any submission to 
the board, is not for the board to rubber stamp.  People get 
bribed to push certain decisions to the board.  Other 
people do not get bribed but they think that this business 
20 
case, as executives, is a good business case but you need 
also a fair spread of different minds around an issue that 
you are talking about.   
You see, Chairperson, as the board, we were 
reporting to the shareholder ministry and as the board we 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 246 of 265 
 
had an oversight structure in parliament where we reported 
about the performance of the airline.  So if we were to kill 
Air Chefs, we needed first to get the approval to say then 
we are killing Air Chefs, we are taking Air Chefs’ functions 
to somewhere else.   
I am making a very broad statement but a narrow 
statement I can provide the Chairperson is that it does not 
mean that when a submission is made to the board ten 
people will have the same answer.  One person might say I 
prefer not to approve this and then sometimes they even 
10 
provide some motivation in terms of the reasons why they 
do not approve or eight people can say we are against this.    
Say, for instance, you are not at the board meeting, 
you are on your own wherever you stay but you are reading 
something via the email, you have no one to ask any 
questions but sometimes you follow up by asking questions 
to check if this decision you are going to take is the right 
decision. 
And the other thing is, I did not have veto power.  
So whether I wanted to say, as Dudu alone, let this 
20 
continue, it would never happen.  So I am just saying, 
Chairperson, I do not want also to waste much of our time.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, did you …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   It is important to say that I am not – one, I 
am not a lawyer.  Two, it does not mean that any 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 247 of 265 
 
submission that a person makes in the board that means it 
is a done deal.  No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, did you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies.  Ms Myeni, did you believe 
that the legal department of SAA had been bribed to give 
the advice that they gave you on the consequences of 
cancelling the LSG Sky Chefs award? 
MS MYENI:   When I said it does not mean that every 
submission that is presented to the board means everyone 
10 
must then rubber stamp and approve.  I do not insinuate 
that somebody was bribed or not.   
I am saying the expectation of this Commission 
would be whether we were able to apply our minds when 
taking decision because then, Chair, you do not need a 
board.  If then that legal department would take decisions, 
why are they bringing it to the board?  Then it means the 
board was just a collective of like maybe people who do 
not think properly and who are not qualified to be able to 
use proper skills to assess risk involved, financial side of 
20 
the organisation, capability of whoever that is coming to 
render any service.   
But also, the labour issue that now you are – you 
have equipped Air Chefs, now you are closing Air Chefs 
with all the new equipment that existed Air Chefs, you are 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 248 of 265 
 
taking the business away somewhere else.  I also, 
Chairperson, do not want to talk too much about one 
service provider and take so much time about one service 
provider because, Chair, it would then mean the whole 
country lost by not giving LSG the contract.   
So, I am saying, Chair, please allow me to stop 
right there and not continue further about this question of 
LSG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, the problem, and in fairness I 
10 
must put it to you, with what you have said now about 
rubber stamping and the role of the board to interrogate 
what is placed before them, is that this decision was never 
within the delegated authority of the board, it was a 
decision that had been taken by the Acting CEO because it 
fell within ultimately her decision-making delegated, it was 
done off the back of a fully lawful and procedurally fair 
procurement process.   
So there was no motivation to the board, there was 
no decision that the board was required to take, the lawful 
20 
decision had been taken by the Acting CEO.  A letter of 
award was sent to LSG Sky Chefs and despite that, after 
receiving some tough questions in parliament, on the 
second September 2015, the board of its own account 
decided to overrule that decision.   
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 249 of 265 
 
So I put it  you, Ms Myeni, you cannot justify that 
decision on the basis that it is important for boards to 
consider carefully what come before them, you were 
overturning 
the 
lawful 
decision 
of 
your Acting 
Chief 
Executive Officer.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MYENI:   Sorry, I am losing – sorry, I am losing you a 
bit here.  Sorry, now I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr …[intervenes] 
10 
MS MYENI:   I can hear you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ms Hofmeyr says the difficulty with 
the response that you have given to her question is that 
this was not a case where the board was given any 
submission in order for the board to make a decision.   
She says this was a case where the decision fell 
within the delegation of authority of the Acting CEO Ms 
Mpshe and she had made a lawful decision but the board, 
after facing some tough questions in parliament on the 2 
September came back and then decided to overturn the 
20 
Acting CEO’s decision.  Ms Hofmeyr, did I put it correctly? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Almost verbatim, Chair, so thank you so 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so that is what she is saying.  So 
she says what do you say to that? 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 250 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, then may I not say anything 
unless I incriminate myself because once something is in 
parliament, Chair, once something is in parliament it 
attracts the board’s attention.  So that is why then, Chair, 
nobody was taking away anybody’s delegations of authority 
but it was being asked in parliament, as Ms Hofmeyr was 
saying.  So, Chair, I invoke my privilege of not saying 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What would you say …[intervenes] 
MS MYENI:   So that I do not incriminate myself, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What would you say to somebody who 
says you and your colleagues on the board ought to have, 
after getting questions in parliament about this issue, 
ought to have investigated it and then given answers to 
parliament maybe later on because the decision that had 
been made was a lawful decision made by somebody who 
was acting within her delegation of authority?   
What would you say to somebody who say maybe 
you were caught off guard by the questions that you were 
asked in parliament, as board members, but then you 
20 
should have investigated and then maybe subsequently 
went back to the board and say this decision was taken by 
the Acting CEO, she was acting within her delegated 
authority, maybe as the board we do not agree with it but 
she made a decision, it was a lawful decision, we will not 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 251 of 265 
 
interfere?   What do you say to somebody who might put 
that proposition to you? 
MS MYENI:   I will not make any comments, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If Ms Myeni has refused to answer that 
question on the basis that she is invoking her privilege 
against self-incrimination, Chair, we submit that that is an 
abuse of the privilege.   
Ms Myeni has given us almost twenty minutes of an 
account of this matter.  At this point she is seeking to 
10 
invoke the privilege to avoid answering difficult questions.  
Those will be our submissions in due course.  Do you want 
to respond to that, Ms Myeni? 
MS MYENI:   Again, Chair, it is not accurate that it was 
twenty minutes, that is the starting point, Chairperson.  I 
am sitting here, I am watching minute by minute on the 
iPad here and it is not fair to say I have given a twenty 
minutes response to the question or I do not know the 
comment that you have described, it was not twenty 
minutes.  Certainly, Chair, not. 
20 
 
Secondly, Chairperson, I said I am making a broad 
account of submissions that gets made.  I did not say LSG 
was not within the delegation of authority of Ms Mpshe.  
And secondly, as the Acting CEO.   
And thirdly, Chair, I cannot answer before you today 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 252 of 265 
 
to say what were the steps that were followed then in the 
process of cancelling the LSG tender.  I do not have that 
information, Chair, unless maybe I can go back to my 
documents.  Before going back to the documents, I would 
want to go back to the recording of the parliament about 
the things that were raised.   So, Chair, even now I have 
just spoken for one minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, you have given a version on 
this.  You gave it a few moments ago.  You said that your 
10 
decision to reverse the decision of the Acting CEO was 
based on the fact that you were concerned that it would 
“kill the child” and you associate the child being Air Chefs.   
 
Ms Myeni, the evidence – at least the submission 
that acting CEO Ms Mpshe placed before the board showed 
that the impact of this contract on Air Chefs revenue was 
less than 4.3%.  How could you possibly decide to overrule 
a lawful decision if the impact was only going to be less 
than 4.3% of revenue on the basis that it was going to kill 
the organisation? 
20 
MS MYENI:   Chair, the reference that is made was for me 
to explain to you, Chairperson, in broad terms and now I 
am being asked about a further question which I am going 
to happily invoke my privilege to say I prefer not to 
respond to this question, Chair. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 253 of 265 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, Ms Myeni, you remember this 
morning I said you must make an election – and I think I 
repeated during the day – each time a question is put to 
you whether you are going to invoke your privilege to 
refuse to answer or whether you are going to answer and I 
said if you are going to answer, you know, cannot later on 
say you are revoking – you are invoking the privilege.   
Now when you in response to a certain question you 
have – there are some things that you say or you have a 
lot to say but when you are being challenged on your 
10 
answer you then invoke your privilege and say you prefer 
not to answer because you do not want to incriminate 
yourself, it will come across as if you are quite happy to 
give an answer as long as you are not being challenged on 
it or when you think the question is easy, you answer, but 
the moment questions become difficult, you then invoke 
your privilege.  That is how it will come across.  So I just 
mention that so that you are aware.  Okay, alright.  Ms 
Hofmeyr? 
MS MYENI:   Thank you, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  The other decision 
that the board took at that meeting of the 28 September 
2015 when you decided to cancel the award to LSG Sky 
Chefs and give the contract to Air Chefs was to reduce the 
Acting CEO’s limit on her delegation of authority from a 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 254 of 265 
 
100 million to 50 million.  Was that an act of retribution 
against Acting CEO Ms Mpshe for having taken this 
decision that you did not like on LSG Sky Chefs? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chair, may I invoke the 
privilege, Chairperson, in case I incriminate myself, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we will argue in due course that 
Ms Myeni is not abusing the privilege for the reasons I 
have given previously.  Ms Myeni, in conclusion, Chair, 
subject to your questions, but let me conclude and then, of 
course, if there are other aspects now doubt you will 
10 
address them, with respect.   
Ms Myeni, the legal team of the Commission is 
likely to submit in due course what I am going to set out 
for you now as having emerged from the evidence that you 
have given over the last two days and all of the other 
evidence that has been presented to the Commission and I 
do so so that you have an opportunity to answer or 
respond to what I am putting to you now. 
So, Ms Myeni, the likely submissions of the legal 
team in due course to this Commission will be that you 
20 
knowingly 
misrepresented 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
the 
Department of Public Enterprises in 2013 that the board of 
SAA had resolved to change the Pembroke transaction in 
circumstances where you knew that they had not done so 
and that misrepresentation cost SAA in the order of R800 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 255 of 265 
 
million.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MYENI:   I do not have a response, Chairperson, so 
that I do not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The Jacob Zuma Foundation received R2 
million 
that 
originally 
came 
out 
of 
the 
Free 
State 
Government’s 
coffers, 
it 
was 
routed 
through 
VNA 
Consulting, when from VNA Consulting to your son’s 
company, Premier Attraction, went from Premier Attraction 
to Mr X’s company and if it were to be found by this 
Commission that that R2 million constitutes the proceeds 
10 
of crime, do you agree that the Jacob Zuma Foundation 
should have to pay that money back to the National 
Revenue Fund? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I 
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, we will argue in due course 
that you set up meetings with the former President Zuma 
so that those seeking to influence the President would 
have an opportunity to do so.  Do you have a response to 
that? 
20 
MS MYENI:   Chairperson, may I not respond so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Myeni, it will be argued in due 
course, received benefits from BOSASA including security 
upgrades valued at just less than half a million rand, travel 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 256 of 265 
 
and accommodation benefits just in excess of R100 000 
and cash.  Do you have a response to that? 
MS MYENI:   I do not have a response, Chairperson, may I 
invoke the privilege of not incriminating myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You handed over confidential police and 
NPA information to Mr Agrizzi on the 23 September 2015 in 
the morning at the Sheraton Hotel.  Do you have a 
response? 
MS MYENI:   I thought we had – oh sorry, these are 
conclusive remarks. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed. 
MS MYENI:   Okay.  I stand by the answer that I gave, 
Chairperson, and I would rather not respond so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The submission will be that you 
managed to delay and undermine the execution of a search 
and seizure warrant at your home in October of 2019.  Do 
you have a response to that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, to the 
question so that I do not incriminate myself. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You arranged for the State Security 
Agency to conduct an unlawful vetting operation at SAA of 
managers and their support staff.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 257 of 265 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You tried to use the outcome of that 
operation to remove a member of the finance department or 
move her to another department.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You used false whistle blower reports to 
start investigations against managers whom you wanted to 
remove.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I  
incriminate myself. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You created a climate of fear and 
intimidation while you served as the Chairperson of the 
Board of SAA.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I  
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You bullied Dr Dahwa, the head of 
procurement when he refused to agree to your unlawful 
30% set aside policy.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, so that I do 
not incriminate myself. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your decisions at SAA during your 
tenure as Chairperson took no account of the considerable 
negative consequences for the fiscus whenever you had to 
approach the Minister of Finance both in relation to the 
Airbus swap transaction and the Pembroke transaction. 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 258 of 265 
 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I  
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   R50 million that would have constituted 
the cancellation fee to BNP Capital was approved by you in 
circumstances where there was no justifiable basis for that 
cancellation fee to be paid.  Do you dispute that? 
MS MYENI:   May I not respond, Chairperson, in case I  
incriminate myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, that brings me to the conclusion 
of my questions.  I think I went one minute or two over the 
10 
allocated hour.  Chair, it has done full circle because we 
ended with the BNP Capital issue, that is the issue that we 
started, the aviation evidence was about 18 months ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, thank you.  We are going to 
stop here for the day.  One thing that does remain is that 
Ms Myeni still needs to be questioned with regard to Eskom 
so arrangements will have to be made in due course about 
that.  So that is the one point. 
20 
 
The other point is the one that I mentioned earlier, 
namely that there is no time now and it is not convenient 
really to look at Ms Myeni’s entire evidence and see which 
questions she may have justifiably invoked the privilege 
not to incriminate herself and which ones - in respect of 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 259 of 265 
 
which ones she might not have done so justifiably or 
correctly.   
I think the legal team would want to have a look at 
the transcript and they would take a view one way or 
another in regard to whether there is a need to do anything 
about any of the answers or questions or invocation of the 
privilege.   I will probably will also have a look and see and 
obviously if there is something that needs to be raised with 
Ms Myeni’s legal team it will be raised and if there is 
nothing then there will be nothing.  So that is another point 
10 
that I wanted to mention. 
But apart from that, before we adjourn, I just 
thought that I need to say something or to draw the 
attention of the public to some – to say something about 
what has happened over the past three days because it is 
something that has not happened before and it is important 
that the public also understands some of the things that 
happen and why they happen. 
When 
a 
Commission, 
such 
as 
this 
one, 
is 
established, it is established primarily to establish facts in 
20 
regard to certain matters that fall within its terms of 
reference, matters that are viewed as very important and in 
the public interest and order to carry out its mandate, a 
Commission such as this would conduct investigations and, 
when necessary, have public hearings such as the ones 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 260 of 265 
 
this Commission has had since August 2018 and it relies 
largely on the cooperation of people who have knowledge 
in regard to the matters that fall within its terms of 
reference in order for it to carry out its function properly. 
Now prior to Wednesday this week then where 
about two or so witnesses who had invoked the privilege 
not to incriminate themselves and therefore sought not to 
answer certain questions.  But, for the most part, they 
answered most of the questions that they were asked.  So 
Ms Myeni was the first witness who sought not to answer 
10 
most of the questions that were asked that were put to her 
and answered only a few that she felt she could answer 
without the risk of her incriminating herself. 
Now 
when 
the 
regulations 
applicable 
to 
this 
Commission were made, and they were made by the 
President at the time that the Commission was established, 
they have since been amended on two or three occasions, 
they included a provision in Regulation 8.2 to the effect 
that a witness who gives evidence before the Commission, 
that evidence relates to matters before the – fall within the 
20 
terms of reference of the Commission, that that evidence 
would be inadmissible in subsequent criminal proceedings 
against that witness.  That, therefore, meant that if 
somebody gave evidence before the Commission and, in 
doing so, incriminated himself or herself, that evidence 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 261 of 265 
 
would not be used in subsequent criminal proceedings 
against that person and therefore that person could feel 
free to be as helpful to the Commission as possible 
knowing that that evidence would not be used against him 
or her. 
But the Commissions Act 8 of 1947 is the legislation 
that governs this Commission together with the regulations 
and in Section 3(4) it provides as follows: 
“Any person who has been summoned to attend any 
sitting of a Commission as a witness or who has 
10 
given 
evidence 
before 
a 
commission 
shall 
be 
entitled to the same witness fees from public funds 
as if he had been summoned to attend or had given 
evidence at a criminal trial in a Superior Court held 
at the place of such a sitting and…” 
And this is the relevant part: 
“…in connection with the giving of any evidence or 
the production of any book or document before a 
commission, 
the 
law 
relating 
to 
privilege 
as 
applicable 
to 
a 
witness 
giving 
evidence 
or 
20 
summoned to produce a book or document in such a 
court shall apply.” 
Now this latter part of Section 3(4) is understood to include 
the privilege against self-incrimination and it is this 
provision that enables a witness who appears before this 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 262 of 265 
 
Commission 
to 
invoke 
the 
privilege 
against 
self-
incrimination and therefore to refuse to answer questions 
that may tend to expose her to criminal prosecution. 
 
As Ms Hofmeyr indicated when this issue was dealt 
with, either yesterday or on – I think on Wednesday, the 
case law relating to this is to the effect that the court, or in 
this case the Commission, that is the Chairperson, needs 
to give a witness latitude if he or she claims that she 
believes that if she answers a certain question she may 
incriminate herself.   
10 
As Ms Hofmeyr indicated, the case law does not 
mean that whenever a witness invokes the privilege it 
means necessarily that she cannot be compelled to answer 
a question that he or she feels she may incriminate herself 
if she answers but it would seem on the case law that the 
court, or in this case the Commission and the Chairperson, 
is required to give quite some latitude to the witness when 
she does so.   
This is despite the fact that Regulation 8.2 of the 
Regulations of the Commission do say that if a witness 
20 
gives evidence before the Commission, her evidence 
cannot be used against her in subsequent criminal trials. 
 
The fact that Section 3(4) of the Commissions Act is 
there simply means that a witness is able to invoke it and 
the Commission cannot act illegally, the Commission has to 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 263 of 265 
 
operate within the ambit of the law and that includes that 
provision.   
Therefore, 
the 
Commission 
must 
respect 
that 
provision but the Regulation or Regulation 8.2 enables, it 
seems, any witness who wants to assist the Commission 
and wants to put his or her side of the story, to do so, it 
enables him or her to do so knowing that his or her 
evidence will not be used in any subsequent criminal trials 
against him or her. 
 
So the Commission has to operate within this – and 
10 
I though it is important to mention this and refer to the 
Section for the education of the public as well. 
 
The provision does not mean that the Commission 
cannot compel a witness to answer certain questions but it 
can only do so if the invocation of the privilege is not 
justified and it would see from the case law that it would 
not be justified if the apprehension of the witness that she 
may incriminate or he may incriminate himself or herself if 
she or he answers a certain question is not based on 
reasonable grounds but it is a matter that the Commission 
20 
needs to deal with properly and carefully having regard to 
its obligation to operate within the ambit of the law and 
having regard to the obligation to strike a balance between 
the rights of witnesses as well as its own mandate.   
I thought that I should just make those remarks so 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 264 of 265 
 
that the public can have some understanding of the legal 
framework 
surrounding 
what 
has 
happened 
since 
Wednesday because it is something that had not happened 
before in the past two and a half years that – during which 
the Commission has been hearing evidence.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  I think that it is 9.30 
tomorrow 
morning, 
is 
that 
right, 
when 
we 
will 
be 
assembling? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it will be 9.30.  Is there anything 
you want to say arising? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay.  So tomorrow, yes, we 
will be – we will have a session here to complete Ms 
Kwinana’s evidence.  We will start at half past nine.  Mr 
Buthelezi, is there anything you want to say arising 
from…? 
MR BUTHELEZI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nothing.  
MR BUTHELEZI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it remains for me to thank you, Mr 
20 
Buthelezi and your instructing attorney or your colleague 
for all the cooperation and to thank Ms Myeni and Ms 
Hofmeyr.   
We will adjourn and, as I said, with regard to Ms 
Myeni, there is still the Eskom part and there may still be 
06 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 300 
 
Page 265 of 265 
 
something else arising out of the invocation of the privilege 
but that will be dealt with through the right channels in due 
course.  We are going to then adjourn for the day.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 7 NOVEMBER 2020
