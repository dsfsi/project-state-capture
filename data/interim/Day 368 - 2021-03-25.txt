PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 25 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Franklin, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you Chair.  As – as you know… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  We continue today with the evidence of 
Mr Symington. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Before we do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  I had informed you earlier of an 
application brought by the State Security Agency in respect 
of the evidence to be led by Mr Loggerenberg after Mr 
Symington.  There have been numerous interchanges 
between the parties and a resolution has been received – 
reached rather which obviates the need for the application 
to be argued. 
 
Counsel for the SSA is here and has asked the 
20 
commission’s indulgence to place on record at this point 
that their attitude so that he can then be excused 
thereafter.   
 
I understand that the representatives for Mr Van 
Loggerenberg would similarly like to place certain matters 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 4 of 244 
 
on record if you allow them to do so after the SSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before I allow the SSA I just wish to 
announce that at 2:00pm this afternoon I will make a public 
statement about the events of Tuesday evening in this 
commission this past Tuesday during the evening session 
of the commission. 
 
That will be at two o’clock at this venue.  Okay 
alright – and then also I just need to mention to you Mr 
Franklin and all counsel and legal representatives present 
and the witnesses that we will take an early lunch today at 
10 
half past twelve but we will resume at two. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Counsel for the SSA can 
then address me. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chairperson I made an appearance 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   On behalf of Mr Loyiso Jafta 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Who is the acting Director General 
of the SSA.  Chairperson majority of what has been said by 
my learned colleague is correct. There has been numerous 
engagement and exchanges that necessitated that the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 5 of 244 
 
whole application that was brought before this commission 
should be not IU’d or the motion moved however my client 
has certain disquiets that I am under instruction to 
ventilate in the commission. 
 
Chairperson the need for us to enter an appearance 
in 
these 
proceedings 
was 
firstly 
premise 
on 
a 
constitutionalism. 
 
Chairperson the fundamental constitutional principle 
is that an individual can do anything but that which is 
forbidden by law. Whereas the government can do nothing 
10 
but that which is authorised by law.  So this is a trite 
principle of the law. So now the acting General of SSA 
deemed it prudent to bring this Honourable commission to 
certain 
principles 
of 
the 
law 
necessitated 
by 
the 
application. 
 
If 
I 
direct 
this 
Honourable 
Commission 
to 
Intelligence Services Act 65 of 2002 particularly Section 4 
which has – which reads as follows: 
“A Director General must as far as it 
reasonably practicable take steps to ensure 
20 
that identity of members of the agency are 
protected from unauthorised disclosure.” 
 
Equally so Chairperson Section 26 of the same Act 
reads as follows: 
“A person commits an offence if he or she 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 6 of 244 
 
not being a member by words, conduct or 
demeanour pretends that he or she is a 
member encourages a member not to carry 
out his or her duty to perform any act in 
conflict with his or her duty.” 
 
Now Section 26.1.a. 333 says: 
“A person commits an offence if he or she 
discloses classified information or material 
entrusted to him or her by the Director 
General 
or 
a 
member 
without 
the 
10 
permission of the Director General.” 
 
Chairperson equally so which is legislation that we 
deem finds application in this situation is Section 4 of the 
Protection of Information Act No 84 of 1982 and for the 
record 
in 
fact 
let 
me 
just 
quickly 
go 
take 
it 
from 
jurisprudence which is now established in our courts in the 
Minister of State Security versus the Public Protector this 
is a recent judgment Chairperson if this commission wants 
that I should give it a full citation I will be glad to do so. 
 
Now the general principle is that… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no do not. – no do not do – do not do 
so.  Do not do so.  How much time should I give you to 
make your address? 
UNKNOWN 
COUNSEL: The last – perhaps about five 
minutes I will be done. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 7 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five minutes more okay alright. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Five minutes more.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL: If the Chairperson goes to paragraph 
17 of the judgment Chairperson will see in quotation at 
paragraph 17 page 10 of the judgment it say: 
“Just because a secret document already is 
in the public domain does not justify its 
further disclosure by an order of this court.” 
 
This is now the judgment that came out recently. 
10 
Chairperson now when I looked at the affidavit of the 
witness that is about to testify particularly at paragraph 83. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one who will testify after the one 
who is about to testify? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL: To be precisely Mr Van Loggerenberg 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Chairperson this is what he says at 
paragraph 83 of his affidavit and I quote. 
“I have always been and remain able and 
20 
willing to implicate persons from the highest 
office of the land to Ministers, Deputy 
Ministers, 
Politicians, 
Senior 
State 
Officials, Politically connected persons, big 
business and executive the officers of the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 8 of 244 
 
constitutional oversight bodies, members of 
Parliament, 
head 
of 
state 
organs, 
law 
enforcement officials, secret agents and 
operatives of the state and many entities 
registered 
both 
in 
South 
Africa 
and 
elsewhere in the world.  However I do so – I 
need to be permitted by law by specifically 
SARS and the State Security Agency and 
Police Crime Intelligence to do so. The 
afforded access to records that I know of 
10 
participated in compiling and oversaw, be 
afforded access to witnesses whom I know 
by name and worked with over the years 
who I know and will be able to corroborate.” 
 
Now 
if 
I 
want 
to 
tidy 
up 
my 
submissions 
Chairperson today I wish to state the following: 
 
Notwithstanding the legal principles that I have 
given to the commission the founding – the affidavit 
submitted by Mr Van Loggerenberg in these proceedings 
particularly the 3.3 that I have been given by my client I 
20 
will not mention the names because these are some of the 
names that are protected.   
 
Now if one has regards to paragraph 4 at the end it 
says: 
“The full statement of Mr Van Loggerenberg 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 9 of 244 
 
will 
be 
uploaded 
on 
the 
Commission’s 
website 
as 
soon 
as 
00:07:00. 
 
The 
transcripts will be uploaded daily.” 
 
Now I am mindful of the fact that we have reached a 
consensus where we say the names particularly belonging 
to the list provided by Mr Loggerenberg will be redacted.   
 
The question now that remains is that what happens 
to those that has already been disseminated through 3.3 
letters?  They still remain in their original form. 
 
Chairperson I do not make this submission very 
10 
lightly.  My instruction is that in its original form the 
affidavit that was file by Mr Van Loggerenberg is in breach 
of Section 26 of the Intelligence Services Act and this 
Honourable Commission cannot be used as an instrument 
to countenance such behaviour and I hope and this is my 
client’s 
instruction 
that 
an 
investigation 
will 
be 
commissioned to stay – to know exactly under what 
circumstances was the names allowed to be – to find 
themselves in the affidavit. 
 
These are my only concerns as far as my client is 
20 
concerned.  As I said on the Notice of Motion there are two 
prayers that I requested one of which is evidence in 
camera and the second of which is the redaction of names. 
 
As I have stated Chairperson that there is no longer 
a need for us to participate and in fact the last issue was 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 10 of 244 
 
insofar as the Rule 3.3 my understanding of the Rules of 
the Commission Chairperson if you allow me is that 3.3 has 
a before – if perhaps for the record I need to read the rule 
itself.  It says: 
“If the commission’s legal team intends to 
present to the commission a witness whose 
evidence 
implicates 
or 
may 
implicate 
another person it must and this is now cast 
in 
peremptory 
measures 
through 
the 
secretary 
of 
the 
commission 
notify 
the 
10 
person in writing within a reason time 
before.” 
 
So now my understanding is that the commission 
has gone through the affidavit of Mr Van Loggerenberg and 
the analysis was that none of our clients or none of our 
members 
are 
implicated 
otherwise 
had 
they 
been 
implicated they would have then received the 3.2 Notices. 
– 3.3 I beg your pardon Chairperson. 
 
Chairperson if there is anything else that you need 
me to address that is the submission or that is my 
20 
instruction as far as my client is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, no there is nothing than 
you very much. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  And then is it Counsel for Mr 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 11 of 244 
 
Van Loggerenberg? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair I will be very brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Mr Van Loggerenberg has requested 
that I make the following points which will be in response 
to what my colleague has already forward. 
 
The first point Chair is that Mr Van Loggerenberg 
has at all times been both cognisant of and respectful of 
10 
the legislation governing the operations of the SSA. 
 
The second point is that the names that have been 
mentioned in his affidavit have in the main all been in the 
public domain for close to a decade both through court 
process and through media coverage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Mr Van Loggerenberg took great 
care to only name those who have been listed in the public 
domain.  He goes further to state that he could name many 
more but due to the fact that those identities have not yet 
20 
been exposed he has taken every caution to avoid 
disclosing their identities. 
 
The third thing is that Mr Loggerenberg did not go 
out purposefully to seek out these individuals.  The 
evidence presented by him came to his knowledge over 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 12 of 244 
 
time through the actions of these very operatives. 
 
Furthermore whenever these actions came to his 
knowledge he took extreme care to inform the SSA and to 
protect the SAA as best as he could. 
 
Mr Van Loggerenberg also does not seek to tarnish 
the entire SSA that is most certainly not his intention.  He 
is merely advising the commission of those operatives who 
he deems it appropriate for the commission to be aware of. 
 
When Mr Van Loggerenberg received the application 
from the SSA Chair it was he who initiated the dialogue to 
10 
say let us reach a compromise, let us redact those names.  
I personally Mr Van Loggerenberg said will go through my 
affidavit redact the names and insert pseudonyms.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   The last point Mr Van Loggerenberg 
wishes me to make Chair is that whilst he is aware, 
cognisant and respectful of legislation he does not believe 
that legislation can ever be used by individuals to protect 
or to clothe them from any unlawful behaviour that they 
may have been guilty of.  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Please sanitise the podium 
again.  Yes Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you Chair.  I have nothing to add 
on the SSA issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 13 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And with your leave may we continue 
with the evidence of Mr Symington? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us do so.  Good morning Mr 
Symington. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
oath 
you 
took 
yesterday 
or 
affirmation whichever it was will continue to apply this 
morning. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay you may proceed Mr 
10 
Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Symington we 
concluded with your main affidavit yesterday what I would 
like to do this morning is put further affidavits to you and 
get your comment on certain issues.  Please would you get 
before you the file which is – the bundle which is SARS03.  
You have that? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And would you please turn to page 659.  
That is an affidavit which runs to page 697 please look at 
20 
page 697?   
CHAIRPERSON:  697 you said? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  That is correct. I am sorry I have taken 
you too far.  It is in fact page 688.  You have that? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 14 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN:  It is – reflects that this affidavit was 
deposed to by you on the 24 t h of February 2021 can you 
confirm that? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And do you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of this affidavit which is described as affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Franklin did you say page 
688? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  On 688 I do not have an affidavit I have 
10 
got a picture of somebody Officer Kushlo. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Is the – is the Chair looking at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am having SARS Bundle 2. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  No 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN:  Do you have that Chair?  Just to 
orientate you the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got 688 is the page? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Yes that is the last of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And it begins at page 659. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And it is called Affidavit in Reply by Mr 
Symington. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got the last page of that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 15 of 244 
 
affidavit. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you and Mr Symington you have 
confirmed the truth and accuracy of the contents of that 
affidavit? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Chair Mr Symington’s main affidavit was 
Exhibit WW3 may I ask that this affidavit in reply be 
admitted into the record as Exhibit WW3.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit – oh that affidavit starts at 
659 is that right? 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You suggested it should be WW? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  3.1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the affidavit of Mr Johan Daniel 
Vlok Symington starting at page 659 will be admitted as an 
exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit WW3.1. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you Chair.  Can I take you to your 
affidavit please Mr Symington and particularly paragraph 5 
on page 660?  You say there that various person implicated 
in your main affidavit which we went through yesterday 
20 
were duly notified of such by the commission and some 
have elected to file affidavits in response to certain 
allegations in your main affidavit and you were provided 
with the affidavits deposed to by four named persons and 
they are I will just use the surname for purposes of this 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 16 of 244 
 
exercise.  Rapholo, Visser, Maphakela and Mothle is that 
correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  You also say in your affidavit that for 
purposes of responding to those statements you consulted 
with various SARS employees.  You say that in paragraph 
13 on page 662.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Sir I did. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And you confirm that on the 29 t h of 
January 2021 and for purposes of compiling this affidavit in 
10 
reply you consulted with SARS employees once again I will 
just 
use 
the 
surnames 
Mr 
Kingon 
formally 
acting 
Commissioner of SARS and currently head of stakeholder 
engagement.  Broughton Chief Litigation Officer of SARS.  
Nkabinde Legal Specialist and Mosithe also a Legal 
Specialist.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV 
FRANKLIN: 
 And 
you 
procured 
a 
confirmatory 
affidavits where necessary to confirm what they told you at 
that meeting? 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair I did. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  What you have done then is you have 
taken each of the affidavits in turn and you have given your 
response to it and I would like to simply highlight some of 
the paragraphs in your affidavit.  Please look at page 661?  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 17 of 244 
 
There is a heading Response to Mothle’s affidavit and just 
to remind the Chair Mr Mothle is the attorney who 
conducted the inquiry into your grievance against Mr Titi, 
is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Alright please look then at paragraph 14 
– paragraph 14 I understand to be a summary of what you 
were advised by the SARS representatives with whom you 
consulted, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  On 14 yes. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN:  On page 662. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Could I please ask you to look at 
paragraph 14.6?  Now you told the commission yesterday 
that there had been a report that had been drawn up by Mr 
Mothle in which he had essentially upheld your version of 
events and found that there was fault on the part of Mr Titi 
and that an inquiry should be convened in relation to Mr 
Titi’s conduct.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN:  You also explained that sometime 
thereafter and I think you said effectively out of the blue 
you 
then 
received 
an 
addendum 
report 
and 
in 
the 
addendum report for the first time your conduct had been 
scrutinised 
and 
you 
were 
found 
to 
have 
committed 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 18 of 244 
 
misconduct, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair indeed. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Alright so if you would look then at 
paragraph 14.6 at page 663 you summarise here what you 
were told by the SARS officials with whom you consulted, 
is that right? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  If I may then just take you through it.  In 
summary: 
“1. After he submitted his first report Mothle 
10 
was called to a meeting held at SARS 
offices. 
2. 
Mothle 
was 
told 
that 
he 
had 
misunderstood 
the 
instructions. 
 
He 
disputed this. 
 3. 
He 
was 
instructed 
by 
R 
Mokoene 
together 
with 
Lebelo 
to 
prepare 
an 
additional report which also dealt with my 
behaviour.  He was expressly pointed to the 
issue of my swearing as an issue to report 
20 
on in the supplementary report. 
4. He requested a letter about how he 
misunderstood the instructions but never 
received such a letter. 
5. After leaving he shared his discomfort 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 19 of 244 
 
about the instructions in a discussion with 
Rapholo and 
6. With regard to the addendum report no 
additional evidence was obtained prior to 
reaching 
the 
conclusions 
and 
recommendations.” 
Can you confirm that is an accurate summary of what was 
told to you by the SARS officials? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair indeed. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Then if I could ask you to turn to 
10 
paragraph 21 on page 666 this is still part of your detailed 
response to Mr Mothle’s affidavit?   And please turn to 
paragraph 21.3?  And this is what you say: 
“The first report …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that paragraph 21.3? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Correct on page 667 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Do you have that Mr Symington? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN:   
20 
“The first report can hardly be said to be 
incomplete or inadequate this is most likely 
why Mothle initially resisted instructions to 
“expand” on his first report.  Unfortunately 
the irresistible inference to be drawn from 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 20 of 244 
 
the facts is that Mr Mothle was pressurised 
inter alia by R Mokoene and Lebelo to 
frame 
me 
for 
misconduct 
and 
that 
he 
ultimately buckled under this pressure and 
produced the addendum report.  The sole 
purpose of which was to justify SARS taking 
disciplinary action against me.” 
Now you have – you have reached a – a serious 
conclusion there perhaps you can please elucidate for the 
Chair what it is that leads you to this conclusion that the 
10 
addendum report was planned purely at framing you? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Chair so I need to go slightly back in 
sequence and maybe start off where I was initially informed 
by SARS that an – that Mr Mothle would be appointed to 
investigate my grievance against Mr Titi. 
 
At – it was made very clear after I have asked what 
the Terms of Reference would be for an investigation.  It 
was made very clear to me and by way of email which is in 
one 
of 
my 
annexures 
that 
the 
investigation 
will 
be 
focussing on the grievance which I lodged against Mr Titi. 
20 
 
And on that basis the investigator Mr Mothle 
produced a report dated 31 May 2017 and then handed to 
me I think on the 11 t h of May of that year. 
 
And the report in fact went into my grievance 
investigated it, interviewed me extensively, interviewed Mr 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 21 of 244 
 
Titi more than once and as a result the report what was – 
which was then produced to SARS found that my grievance 
was in fact valid. 
 
And then a series of interventions which happened 
behind the scenes which we later found out about via 
emails that were provided to me by SARS from the SARS 
email server.  It was then found that a meeting was held 
between SARS representatives and Mr Mothle where Mr 
Mothle was in effect pressurised by SARS to – to change 
the outcome of his report and he then executed that 
10 
hesitantly so and he expressed his – how he felt about it. 
 
He uses the word hesitantly I am saying unethically 
then went back used the exact same facts exonerating Mr 
Titi 
and 
recommended 
four 
very 
serious 
disciplinary 
charges against me. 
 
Now no one ever laid any – a complaint about me.  
Not my line manager Mr Louw, not Mr Titi, no one filed any 
grievance against me yet that was then the outcome. 
 
And – so – and that led me to the conclusion that 
there was only one reason that the second report or the 
20 
addendum to the first report was asked for and that was to 
effectively remove me out of SARS because when you look 
at those disciplinary charges each of them is I was found 
guilty which by the way I would not have been – but if so 
any one of them would have led to my immediate dismissal 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 22 of 244 
 
out of SARS.  No other warning letters or anything like that 
and that is what led me to this Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you then please look at 21.4 on 
page 667 what you have done there is to draw the Chair ’s 
attention to the introduction to the addendum report and 
you say that the wording of that introduction supports the 
inference in the preceding sub-paragraph.  The wording is 
at page 667 and it is as follows: 
“1.4 Following the elucidation of the Terms of 
our mandate we accept that the additional 
10 
elements of the incident that requires specific 
investigation and recommendation include inter 
alia  
1. The 
apparent 
breach 
of 
the 
employer/employee 
trust 
relationship 
by 
Symington. 
2. An analysis of the content of the audio and 
video recordings released to the media to 
establish the true intent of the protagonists 
(Symington 
and 
Titi) 
and 
the 
actual 
20 
underlying circumstances and associated 
nuances of the incident.” 
And in 21.5 you have said: 
“It is suspicious to put it mildly that an 
independent 
attorney 
appointed 
to 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 23 of 244 
 
investigate my grievance against Titi in 
which I allege illegal conduct by him and 
others finds in his first report that on the 
probabilities Titi was complicit in holding 
me against my will but then without any 
further investigation, interviews or even a 
communication to me accepts an instruction 
to investigate an apparent breach of trust 
by me towards my employer. 
This is all the more disturbing to me 
10 
if regard is had to the fact that Mothle 
deemed it appropriate to interview Titi twice 
before he finalised his first report.  As is 
apparent from my explanation of my resort 
to expletives and Mothle’s concurrence that 
such expletives were not directed at Titi he 
then deemed it appropriate to canvass this 
particular issue with Titi again.” 
And then you have made certain references.  I think that is 
self-explanatory. 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair it is. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And then just to highlight one further 
issue in the first sentence in 21.6 you say that: 
“No such allegation was ever brought to my 
attention 
prior 
to 
the 
issuing 
of 
the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 24 of 244 
 
addendum report.  I was never asked to 
comment 
or 
respond 
to 
any 
such 
allegations.” 
Is that factually correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:   Then could I direct your attention to Mr 
Kingon’s confirmatory affidavit. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Mr Chair if I may? 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:  Just before we go there I think it is also 
relevant to know that when I was initially informed that Mr 
Mothle would be appointed I was informed of this on the 
21 s t of November 2016 by Mr Rapholo and in that email the 
very same individuals that later sat with Mr Mothle to 
change the scope of the investigation if you can call it like 
that were cc’d in that mail.   
So they knew in November 2016 and this was Mr 
Tebogo Mokoene, Mr Luther Lebelo, Kosie Louw, Glengale 
– Klengane Matabule no – you would notice that Mr 
20 
Tebogo, Mokoene, Luther Lebelo, Klengane was in the 
meeting with Mr Mothle later on when they gave Mr Mothle 
other instructions.   
 
 
But in November it was very clear to them and to 
me what the Terms of Reference would be so they never 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 25 of 244 
 
objected against it they never said anything.  In fact Mr 
Mothle was then appointed by them on those terms that 
were – that were expressed to me and I think that is 
relevant because those very same people who knew the 
exact terms of Mr Mothle later said to Mr Mothle no you 
misunderstood our terms.  So I just wanted to … 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Thank you for that addition.  I wanted 
you to look please at the confirmatory affidavit of Mark 
Kingon which appears at page 730 to 733.  Mr Kingon 
records in paragraph 3 that he was approached by your 
10 
lawyers with a request to consult and provide information 
regarding his recollection of a meeting held on the 31 s t of 
October 2019 attended inter alia by him, Moseto, Ledwaba 
and Mothle, that is correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And what Mr Kingon does is to give his 
recollection of that meeting in the affidavit and I would like 
to direct your attention specifically to paragraph 9 on page 
732 and this is what Mr Kingon says: 
“I further recall that during this meeting I 
20 
gained the distinct impression that Mothle 
had 
been 
coerced 
into 
preparing 
the 
addendum report.  Given some of the words 
used during the engagement it was my 
perception 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 26 of 244 
 
instruction to prepare an addendum report 
was to “get” Symington by any means 
possible.” 
Is that what Mr Kingon told you? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  And the relevance, of 
course, is that the meeting was held and Mr Kingon was in 
the meeting with Mr Mothle when they asked him about this 
addendum report in 2019.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Then going back to your 
main affidavit in reply.  At paragraph 682, you then deal 
10 
with the affidavit of Mr Maphakela.  Is that correct?  At 
page 682. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And similarly you have set out a 
detailed version of events in which you take issue with 
some of what he had said.  Correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair I did. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I direct you to one particular 
issue?  Is on page 685 and it is under the heading:  The 
issue of whether the Hawks were aware of Maphakela’s 
20 
opinion. 
MR SYMINGTON:   H’m.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Just pausing there.  Why, for you, is 
it important to establish whether the Hawks were aware of 
Maphakela’s opinion? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 27 of 244 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, Chair, it is later when Advocate 
John Abrahams withdrew the charges against Messrs 
Gordhan and Pillay and Magashula, on the early retirement 
issue.  That was on 31 s t October 2016.  Mr Abrahams made 
– wrote a letter afterwards to the Head of the Hawks and 
asked but why was not my memorandum of 2009 available 
to the Hawks.   
 
And the nuance, I read, yes, that he was asking, 
sort of, if this memo was available to them, then you know, 
why was it not handed over to the NPA.  And so this – so 
10 
when we discovered that Mr Maphakela also gave a legal 
opinion back in November 2014 about the lawfulness of 
Mr Pillay’s early retirement. 
 
Then it became relevant to understand that then 
why was this piece of information which is, you know, 
which advised SARS very strongly that the early retirement 
of Mr Pillay was in fact lawful.  Why was this opinion then 
not available to either the Hawks or the NPA?   
 
Because certainly it was available to SARS and 
anybody interested in rule of law, would have handed this 
20 
legal view, at least, over to the Hawks to consider.   
 
And so would anybody who is interested in the 
rule of law have handed over my memorandum of 2009 to 
the Hawks and this is the relevance of it.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  At paragraph 48 on page 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 28 of 244 
 
685, you say that, in your main affidavit, you dealt with 
what was relayed to you regarding a meeting held between 
Maphakela, Kingon and Broadman on the 16 t h of April 2018 
and you asserted that during this meeting Maphakela 
informed Kingon and Mr Broughton that he had previously 
provided his November 2014 opinion to the Hawks.  
 
You explain in 49 that Mr Maphakela does not 
directly deal with your affidavit but in an affidavit, a further 
affidavit, he – sorry, his affidavit, he records his responses 
to queries addressed to him by the Commission.   
10 
 
And what he says is, firstly, that he had no 
knowledge whether Brigadier Xaba was aware of his 
opinion dated the 5 t h of November 2014.  And secondly, 
that he had never provided his opinion to SARS. 
 
You said that those allegations contradict the 
allegations in your affidavit but because you do not have 
direct knowledge of what was discussed at the meeting of 
18 
April 
2018, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
consult 
with 
Mr Broughton and Kingon on the issue. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What you have done in paragraph 52 
is to quote from Broughton’s confirmatory affidavit.  Is that 
correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I then just take you to the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 29 of 244 
 
relevant parts of what Mr Broughton has confirmed to the 
Commission?  5.3: 
“At the end of the meeting on 16 April 2018, I 
asked Mr Maphakela what he meant when he 
said that he an “ethical problem” with the 
investigation 
of 
the 
early 
retirement 
of 
Mr Pillay...” 
 
5.4: 
“Mr Maphakela explained that his view was 
that there was nothing illegal in the early 
10 
retirement of Mr Pillay. 
He had explained that he sent SARS a written 
opinion, explaining his views on the early 
retirement. 
Mr Maphakela explained that he had also been 
contacted by members of the Hawks in the 
course of their investigation. 
He said to me that in this meeting he had 
expressed his view but there was no illegality 
in the early retirement and that a member of 
20 
the National Prosecuting Authority was also 
present at the meeting...” 
MR SYMINGTON:   He did. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then in 5.5: 
“After 
the 
meeting 
with 
the 
Hawks, 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 30 of 244 
 
Mr Maphakela said he received the request to 
assist 
in 
obtaining 
a 
statement 
from 
Mr Symington and that because he had told 
both SARS and the Hawks what his opinion 
was concerning the illegality of the early 
retirement when he forwarded the mail to 
SARS, he wanted to express very clearly that 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
participate 
in 
that 
investigation...” 
 
And then jumping to para 6 of Mr Broughton’s 
10 
affidavit.  He says as follows: 
“I had come to know about the “hostage” 
incident between Mr Symington and the Hawks 
through the media and had it found it very 
peculiar and irrational but after Mr Maphakela 
explained why he had sent the email refusing 
to get involved, using the phrase for “ethical 
reasons”, did it make sense why it was so 
important to retrieve Mr Maphakela’s email. 
The reasons behind Mr Maphakela’s email is 
20 
that an independent attorney acting for SARS 
had advised SARS in writing that the early 
retirement was lawful and had it expressed 
this opinion to the Hawks and the member of 
the NPA. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 31 of 244 
 
In short, the reasons behind his email of the 
“hostage” incident in a clearer and more 
serious context but further than that questions 
are raised as to how neutral the criminal 
investigation was...” 
 
So you can confirm that is the gist of what 
Mr Broughton 
explained 
to 
you 
about 
what 
he 
had 
established in a meeting on the 16 t h of April 2018 from 
Mr Maphakela himself. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Indeed Chair. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Could I then leave your 
additional affidavit and take you to another affidavit in 
SARS Bundle 03 and it is an affidavit that has been filed 
before the Commission by Mr Moyane.  And you find it in 
bundle, SARS-03, pages 12 to 37. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chari, but before we go there.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is there something else you would 
like to ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   Ja, just by way of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Maphakela? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   ...affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Back on page 687.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Certainly.  Go ahead. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So ...[intervenes]  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 32 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just wait for us.  687. 
MR SYMINGTON:   It was on 687. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:   The – in Mr Maphakela’s responding 
affidavit, he advised explicitly that he did not hand over or 
shared his written opinion dated November 2014 and so – 
which I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He shared it with whom? 
MR 
SYMINGTON: 
 
 
With 
the 
Hawks 
or 
the 
NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   And...  But...but...  He did not deny that 
he shared his view with the Hawks or the NPA.  And so, the 
denial was focussed on the written opinion of November 
which he denied and which may be so.  I could not...  But 
what happened was that he had a meeting with the Hawks 
and the NPA where he shared his view with them, not 
necessarily in writing and not that document that he shared 
the outcome of his research.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if he did not share the – his written 
opinions with the Hawks.  Do we know how the Hawks 
20 
would have known about the fact that the email that they 
demanded from you had reference to him having given an 
opinion or refusing to get involved because of ethical 
reasons?  Do we know? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, the only assumption I can make 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 33 of 244 
 
out of that and I think I did draw an inference out of that in 
one of the affidavits, I will remain with the responding, is 
that, 
the 
Hawks 
must 
had 
some 
interaction 
with 
Mr Maphakela on the early retirement matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SYMINGTON:   And that is why then the Hawks wrote – 
forwarded that email – oh, that letter from Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR 
SYMINGTON: 
 
 
Not 
directly 
to 
SARS 
but 
to 
Mr Maphakela and then asked Mr Maphakela to forward the 
10 
mail or to make arrangements for me to do the affidavits.  
So there must have been something there which made the 
Hawks think or...  you know that they should write to 
Mr Maphakela.  And my suspicion is that they – that that 
rose out of the meeting where he shared his views with the 
Hawks and it then so happened, apparently, that a member 
of the NPA was in that meeting as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Franklin. 
MR SYMINGTON:   I am not sure whether that answered 
your... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  [laughs]  It is okay.  Well, 
Mr Maphakela had been involved in a particular matter, 
namely, to give an opinion to SARS about Mr Pillay’s early 
retirement.  Other than that, as far as you know, he had 
not been representing SARS in its interactions with the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 34 of 244 
 
Hawks or you? 
MR SYMINGTON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct. 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, I am not aware of any – what he – 
he certainly did not interact with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, represent – he did not represent 
you. 
MR SYMINGTON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are unaware that he may have 
represented SARS ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As you recall. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes.  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know. 
MR SYMINGTON:   The first time that I really became 
aware of this – of the firm of attorneys and Mr David 
Maphakela was his name in that email.  I have never dealt 
with them before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes, ja.  Well, it is just that one 
wonders why the Hawks would have decided that they 
20 
should send that email or letter to him, rather than sending 
it to SARS.  Mr Franklin, you might be able to throw light? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I think you have elucidated it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  I had asked you to look, 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 35 of 244 
 
please, at – still in SARS-03 at Mr Moyane’s witness 
affidavit which appears at pages 12 to 37.  Do you have 
that?   
MR SYMINGTON:   Just give me the page number? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is at the beginning of the file, 
page 12. 
MR SYMINGTON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Mr Moyane has responded to various 
of the allegations made against him by a number of 
witnesses including you.  And he deals with your evidence 
10 
at page 21 from paragraph 33 until paragraph 51.  Pages 
21 to 25.  Have you read what Mr Moyane says in relation 
to your evidence? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, I did. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And is it correct that this affidavit 
came to light subsequent to you having deposed to the 
affidavit in reply which we have looked at a few moments 
ago? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  If I can take you to certain 
20 
of the allegations made by Mr Moyane.  Paragraph 33 on 
page 21 and this is really a summary which he makes.  He 
says:  In essence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On what page?  I am sorry Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   21, Chair. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 36 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ja, you may continue. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.   
“In essence, Mr Vlok Symington’s evidence 
against me is intended to support the theory 
that I was part of a state capture inspired 
conspiracy aimed at the dismissal of Minister 
Gordhan by inter alia: 
1.  Knowingly laying false charges against him. 
2.  Committing perjury and denying that I was 
the complainant in Mr Gordhan’s criminal case, 
10 
and 
3.  Fraudulently 
or 
actively 
concealing 
evidence which was exculpatory in respect of 
Mr Gordhan’s alleged involvement in the Pillay 
retirement issue...” 
 
He then turns to deal with those topics.  I am 
interested in the third one for present purposes.  He 
addresses that in paragraph 36 on page 22.  And if I may 
read that out to you? 
“I 
now 
deal 
with 
the 
main 
thrust 
of 
20 
Mr Symington’s testimony, namely the unlawful 
concealment of exculpatory evidence in the 
form of: 
1.  Mr Symington’s 2019 memorandum which 
allegedly 
found 
that 
the 
Pillay 
retirement 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 37 of 244 
 
scheme was lawful, and 
2.  The legal opinion of an external attorney by 
the name of Mr Maphakela who had also 
include that the Pillay retirement scheme was 
lawful...” 
 
And 37: 
“The thesis is that, had the Hawks been given 
these two documents, then the charges would 
not have been pursued and Mr Gordhan and 
others would not have been prosecuted. 
10 
Support for these areas is also based on the 
fact 
that 
in 
its 
statement 
subsequently 
withdrawing the charges the NPA sighted the 
belated 
emergence 
of 
the 
Symington 
memorandum and its alleged reputation of the 
requisite mens rea (subjective intention) on 
the part of Gordhan...” 
 
And then paragraph 38 is the important one and 
I am going to ask you to comment on it. 
“The above theory is, unfortunately, based on 
20 
a false premises, namely, that the Symington 
memorandum 
had 
declared 
the 
Pillay 
retirement to be lawful and problem free, 
apparently, without any qualification. 
This is the biggest lie ever told in support of 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 38 of 244 
 
the unfounded allegations against me, more 
particularly, in that...” 
 
And then he gives four reasons why he comes to 
that conclusion and he does so with reference to certain 
parts of your memorandum.  I take it you have read those 
reasons? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then he says in 39: 
“How 
anyone 
can 
ever 
construed 
that 
document as a legal opinion confirming the 
10 
lawfulness of the scheme is confounding and 
probably false or at best misleading...” 
 
So 
Mr 
Moyane 
makes 
very 
straightened 
allegations against you and in effect contents that your 
memorandum does not in any way indicate that the Pillay 
retirement scheme was lawful.  What is your response? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, Mr Chair, Mr Pillay would have – 
well, approached me in March 2009, wanting to know 
whether what he wants to do is lawful.  There would have 
been no other reason for him to ask me that because my 
20 
expertise lay – well, one half of it laid in the area of 
retirement, the funding from a legal point of view.   
 
And so the intent, his at least, but I know mine 
was to give him my version of – the outcome of my 
research about the lawfulness of these things.  And I, in 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 39 of 244 
 
fact, later on when the Hawks – when Mr Pretorius wanted 
to know how did I arrive at the outcome of my 2009 
memorandum, I went into the details of the law.  There is 
more than one law involved there.  And there I went into 
the 
detail 
at 
how 
I 
arrived 
at 
the 
outcome 
of 
my 
memorandum of 2009. 
 
It was – there was no other reason that I wrote 
and did the research because my research that I did, back 
in 2009, was about the lawfulness of whether this can be 
done.  So I really regard this as absurd then to say that the 
10 
outcome does not talk to the lawfulness or otherwise of the 
scheme. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do want Mr Franklin to quickly go to 
that memorandum. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I have that and that is my next 
document Char.  It is Bundle 02, SARS Bundle 02. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   At page 202. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Well, I could ask you this 
20 
question Mr Symington, while I am waiting for the file to 
look at the opinion, briefly.  Is there nothing in the 
memorandum that makes it clear that what you were 
investigating was whether Mr Pillay could be allowed to 
retire early?  Is there nothing that says that is to that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 40 of 244 
 
effect in the memorandum? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, well, I think we need to look at 
the wording then. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, Chair, 202. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Two...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   202. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Two, zero, two.   
MR SYMINGTON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And perhaps we can start at the 
beginning for ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   ...to answer the Chair ’s question.  
But firstly, this is a memorandum addressed from you to 
the Commissioner.  Its subject is:  Early retirement, 
Mr Ivan Pillay.  And the background is as follows: 
“Mr Ivan Pillay requested me to consider 
certain 
elements 
that 
formed 
part 
of 
his 
decision to apply for early retirement from the 
Government 
Employees 
Pension 
Fund, 
the 
GEPF. 
20 
These elements are: 
1.   His application for early retirement from 
the GEPF. 
2.   His application to the Minister of Finance 
to waive the early retirement penalty. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 41 of 244 
 
3.   His request to be appointed on contract 
after his early retirement from the GEPF...” 
 
I am just stopping there.  Although the three 
elements that would make up this, what is known as the 
Pillay retirement package. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, indeed. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then you have headed under the 
heading:  The Technical Position, you said: 
“Approach individually. 
All three elements are technically possible 
10 
under the rules of the GEPF read together with 
the employment policies of SARS. 
Mr Pillay has reached the required age for 
retirement. 
He is entitled to request the Minister to waive 
the 
early 
retirement 
penalty 
and 
no 
technicality prevents SARS from appointing 
him on a contract after his retirement from the 
GEPF...” 
 
Is that the summary of your ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   ...findings? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, indeed.  And there, I think, 
you know, in my mind it is very visible that to have arrive 
at this outcome, I researched the law. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 42 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SYMINGTON:   And it is not an easy road to get to the 
to - well, to ultimately get to the rules of the GEPF but that 
is where, ultimately, the law takes you, starting off with the 
SA Revenues Service Act.  Then going into the Public 
Service Act which then leads you into the Government 
Employees Pension Law which then takes you into the 
rules of the fund itself.   
 
And by saying that he has reached the required 
age for early retirement.  Now SARS does not have early or 
10 
late or middle or retirement ages.  The early retirement age 
for SARS and normal retirement and later retirement is set 
out in the Public Service Act, not in any SARS’ policy and 
so on. 
 
So the only way that I could have, as an 
example, arrived at that outcome was my research into the 
Public Service Act.  Similar to the next part which in 
layman’s terms, because that is how people referred to it, 
says that the – that he is entitled to request the Minister to 
waive the early retirement penalty.   
20 
 
Now that, again, is done in terms of the Public 
Service Act but here, of course, I use layman’s terms which 
the fund itself uses.  It is actually not the Minister that 
waives any penalty.  It is actually done by the fund itself 
together with the anticipating employer. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 43 of 244 
 
 
But I think the point I am making is the outcome 
of this, could not have been reached without an in-depth 
legal research. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know about in-depth 
Mr Symington. 
 
You 
did 
say 
yesterday 
that 
the 
Commissioner at the time, when he sought legal advice, 
mostly just the outcome. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did not – would not be interested in 
a lot of things, which I assume, would be how you got 
10 
there. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Indeed.  And that is why the memo 
reads like it reads but I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but what was your position at SARS 
at the time of preparing this memorandum? 
MR SYMINGTON:   I was an Executive in heading up the 
so-called Product Oversight Division of – at SARS which 
deals with legal – the legal framework for all our products, 
like, BAT, Corporate, Income Tax, Personal Income Tax and 
so on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SYMINGTON:   But the – but up to that point, maybe a 
little bit earlier, my whole career at SARS was focussed on 
matters relating to retirement funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 44 of 244 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   And I was known inside SARS and 
outside of SARS as a knowledgeable individual on legal 
matters relating to retirement funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did SARS have a dedicated legal 
department? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you in that department? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the department in which you were 
was basically the Legal Department of SARS as well? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well..  Yes.  So it was called 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it a section or unit that would be 
the bigger unit or section? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes.  It was the whole Legal Unit 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:   ...which was overseen by Mr Louw. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   He was the head of the unit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   The Chief Legal Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And I operated within that unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So Mr Louw, his position was 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 45 of 244 
 
Chief Legal Officer? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And was giving legal 
advice part of your duties? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, it was legal advice but mostly, 
you know, I was giving advice about the interpretation of 
the laws that we administer at SARS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Ja.  And there are a number of them, 
you know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not this type of issue, retirement and so 
on? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, yes, but earlier in my career. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier.  But I mean ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   At that point in time, I moved on my 
career.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you had started as having – 
with having knowledge on retirement policies and law in 
20 
relation to SARS. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair and that would have been 
the reason that Mr Pillay came to me and to no one else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, well, I see that part of one of 
the topics you deal with there is financial risk which 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 46 of 244 
 
obviously is not law, you know, and the memo although it 
does say you were requested by Mr Pillay to consider 
certain elements that formed part of his decision to apply 
for early retirement, I think part of what Mr Moyane is 
saying, you are not saying in your memo you had been 
asked to consider the lawfulness of the earlier retirement 
and, of course, when one reads a legal opinion one is used 
to person who gives the legal opinion articulating what the 
question is that he or she is asked to give an opinion on 
and usually it will be the lawfulness or otherwise of 
10 
something and whether something is constitutional or not 
constitutional and so on.  So which is missing here and in 
the memorandum there appears, as far as I can see, does 
not appear to be any reference to any legal instrument.  
Am I right?  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, but I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may have before you prepared. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may have consulted a lot of legal 
instruments. 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Absolutely, but this is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the memorandum there seems to 
be no reference to any legal instrument that may have or 
that you relied upon for anything in regard to this. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 47 of 244 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, so this is the way that we would 
normally write to any Commissioner, is that you – they are 
normally only sort of interested in the outcome of your 
research, so this memorandum, you know, was addressed 
to Mr Gordhan at that time, he was the Commissioner.  I 
knew sort of the way that he liked to be informed and well 
knowing that if he wants to know more about what I have 
written then he would ask me to go into more detail, so one 
would give – normally one would give – almost an 
executive summary of the outcome of what you and 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I hear what you say.  I hear what 
you say but I think what cannot be denied is that if my 
reading of your memo is correct is that there is no 
reference to any source on which the opinion may because 
based, such as a statute or regulations and things like 
that. 
MR SYMINGTON:   That is so, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is one.  And the memo does not 
make it clear that what you have been asked to answer is 
20 
the question whether Mr Pillay’s early retirement would be 
lawful or can be approved or anything like that. It does not 
make that clear.  So it may well be that to the extent that 
Mr Moyane is maybe saying the memorandum does not 
have the useful features that one expects to see in a legal 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 48 of 244 
 
opinion, it may well be that he should not be criticised for 
saying that.  What do you say to that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, that may very well be.  
CHAIRPERSON:    But you say you also intended to get a 
legal opinion. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   What I need to maybe point out as well 
is that my reference to the GDPF, the rules of the GDPF is 
in fact a law. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a legal instrument. 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, no, no, it is a part of the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is what I am saying, that you 
are saying that is a legal instrument. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Oh, yes.  Yes and this is ultimately 
where …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where you found… 
MR SYMINGTON:   Where you find the validity of the early 
retirement, the validity of the waiving of the penalties.  So 
and the GEPF Is not like any other fund, it is not a private 
20 
fund, it is established …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   By law. 
MR SYMINGTON:   By law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Not in terms of the law but by law. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 49 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   By law. 
MR 
SYMINGTON: 
 
 And 
you 
would 
understand 
the 
difference between the two.  So the reference to the rules 
of the GEPF is in fact a reference to the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Just perhaps to 
conclude on the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Mr Symington, what was the point of 
this memorandum, why were you approached to give it? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, I think I explained it at one point 
that I was known as the individual in SARS to go to if you 
need to know anything about pension funds or pension law 
and so, yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright and the propositions that had 
been put to you, as I understand it, are recorded under the 
background, in other words that Mr Pillay had made a 
request and the request basically consisted of three parts.  
The first was he wanted to – he wanted early retirement 
from the GEPF.  Secondly, he wanted the Minister of 
20 
Finance to waive his early retirement penalty and thirdly, 
he wanted to be appointed on contract after his early 
retirement from the GEPF, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   That is so, Chair, and to add to that, all 
three those, he is governed by law, so the reason that he 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 50 of 244 
 
would have asked me to do this was to check on the 
validity of it and certainly when I use words like technical 
position, it is the legal technical position and so that was 
why I – that was not why I wrote it but this was the 
outcome of whether it is lawful or not. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then in response, as I 
understand 
it, 
to 
those 
three 
requests 
and 
three 
propositions, 
you 
record 
your 
conclusions 
under 
the 
technical position. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Second paragraph you say: 
“Mr Pillay has reached the required age for early 
retirement.” 
Is the addressing question one, issue one? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, it does. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then you say: 
“He is entitled to request the Minister to waive the 
early retirement penalty.” 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is that addressing number two? 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then you say no technicality 
prevents SARS from appointing on a contract after this 
retirement from GEPF.  Is that addressing issue 3? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 51 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying you may not have 
used certain language that maybe one normally expects in 
a legal opinion but you say one, you were asked to give an 
opinion. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To give that opinion you needed to look 
at the law with special reference to pension law and the 
rules of the GEPF. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that you answered those three – you 
10 
dealt with those three issues on the basis of pension law 
and the rules of the GEPF, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, in respect of the first two 
issues.  In respect of the third issue, I was not relying on 
pension law, that is labour law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Employment contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Which is, you know, one of the appeals 
that I am interested in as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:   And I have in fact done some work at 
SARS in appeals, as an example, the – as you would know, 
very complicated area of the difference between and 
independent contractor and a common law employee and 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 52 of 244 
 
those also, I do that under that experience to answer 
number three, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Franklin, I 
see we are way past the tea break. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not know whether – probably we 
should just take the break now and you can finish up 
after… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I should not be long after tea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  We will take the tea 
10 
adjournment and we will resume at ten to twelve.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin, I see they have put here in 
addition to the file I had before, the file that relates to your 
next witness.  Is that because you asked them to do that 
or…? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No, there are still some… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Practical issues to attend to on that 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am still in file SARS bundle 03. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is the one I have now. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 53 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Mr Symington, there is 
just one further aspect of Mr Moyane’s version that I want 
to put to you and that is at paragraph 51 on page 25.  Do 
you have that?   
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  It seems this is Mr 
Moyane’s response to the evidence about the ostrich 
incident as you have described it on the 18 October 2016 
and what he says is, regarding his internal grievance about 
being allegedly: 
10 
“…blocked by my bodyguard from leaving a room 
and for which I had apologised, these are human 
resources issues which have no bearing on alleged 
state capture, there is no need to dwell much on 
such spurious allegations.” 
What is your response to that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, I am sure it may be a human 
resource matter if one looks at what the grievance is but 
the whole incident of 18 October 2016 was instigated by Mr 
Moyane so it is much more than simply a human resource 
20 
issue, he was effectively in control of what happened 
inside that room. 
 
Mr Titi and Mr Moyane – and we learnt this 
afterwards – was on the phone with each other during the 
incident so sure, it is a human resource issue but only in 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 54 of 244 
 
as far it goes to the grievance itself which I lodged. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  And then finally, if I 
could ask you to go to SARS bundle 02, page 261. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going to come back to this one? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No, not anymore, thank you.  Do you 
have page 261? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got 261. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Just a moment?  Yes, Mr Franklin, 
thank you. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, we looked at this string of 
emails yesterday, they were sent in the aftermath of the 
incident on the 18 October.  You testified that you had 
meeting, you had got some explanation from Mr Moyane, 
you did not think it made any sense.  You set out in a 
lengthy – sorry, an email on the 21 October why you did 
not think that the explanation given to Mr Moyane made 
any sense, that is the email at page 262.   
At 261 he responded to you in the email at the 
bottom of the page and we went through that yesterday.  
20 
Can I direct your attention to the email at the top of the 
page 21 October 2016, this is you writing to Mr Moyane 
and Mr Louw regarding Ivan Pillay and could I ask you to 
look at the last paragraph?  You say: 
“I really hope we can get this whole thing behind us 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 55 of 244 
 
as soon as possible.  This has happened at a time 
when I am still trying to process why units and 
projects that I built and created from scratch 
producing significant tax revenue each year was 
reallocated elsewhere.” 
Now you have been an employee since 1990, you were 
there during that era that Mr Moyane was Commissioner, 
can you put that comment in perspective please?  What 
were you referring to? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, maybe – and I will hold it 
10 
short, but maybe I must go back to meeting which I, in my 
recollection, happened around August 2015 where the new 
model of SARS as it was apparently designed by Bains was 
presented to the executives of SARS and as a fait 
accompli, we have never participated in any aspect of the 
design, we have never – we were never consulted about 
our divisions that we managed at that point in time about 
our expertise or anything and when we saw this model, it 
soon for a number of us, we could not see ourselves in that 
model.  It was  - the model was foreign to us.   
20 
Now 
I 
must 
emphasise 
this, 
that 
as 
SARS 
employees, we have gone through many changes so we are 
used to a change, we are not resistant to a change as we 
would normally expect of employees who are not used to 
change.  But this model, we – I, and I do not, because I do 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 56 of 244 
 
not want to speak on behalf of others, I was not able to 
see how this model is going to be more efficient than what 
we had at that moment, number one.   
Number two, I could not see myself in that model.  
Up until that point in time I was heading up a division 
within legal which I explained earlier was called product 
oversight where most of the design of our products 
happened from a legal point of view and as what I referred 
to as something on the side, I was asked back in 2009 or 
so to establish what we refer to as the VDP unit of SARS, 
10 
the voluntary disclosure unit of SARS and so that was set 
up by myself and over the years that unit has produced a 
significant amount of money.  On average we were on 
about R2.5 billion a year by the VDP process and that unit 
was just removed out of my care, it did not fit into where it 
used to belong, so – and that is what I meant when I wrote 
this part in the mail to Mr Moyane, it was just to express 
that what has happened now, this whole incident thing, this 
bizarre – which one would never have expected to happen 
to anybody in SARS was now added to the confusion about 
20 
this model and where I fit into this model.  And so, Chair, 
that is where that part came from. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Mr Symington, unless 
there is anything else you wish to bring to the attention of 
the Commission, that concludes the testimony of Mr 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 57 of 244 
 
Symington. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Thank you, Chair.  Just maybe one 
word or so, Chair.  First of all just thank you for the 
opportunity, it is – many of us have lived with what we 
have experienced as a nightmare and this is, you know, 
being given the opportunity to share what happened to us 
is a relief in more than one way and I myself have lived in 
SARS, I have seen SARS when it was referred to as Inland 
Revenue, before 1994.  I have lived in it when Mr Gordhan 
and Pillay and Mr Barry Hore drew us into a whole  
10 
different direction, modernising us so much so that by 2008 
or ’09 we were recognised internationally as one of the 
best at tax administration, one of the most efficient tax 
administration and to then see this happening to SARS in a 
very short space of time from 2014 up to – well, it was less 
than four years where we could visibly see that our 
efficiency rate has dropped and you could see it in what we 
call the buoyancy rate, you know, which is just a measure 
to measure our efficiency has dropped in Mr Moyane’s time 
and so I just hope, Chair, that this will never happen again 
20 
and I think your Commission is instrumental in ensuring 
that it will not ever happen again, Chair, thank you very 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Symington, thank you for 
availing yourself to assist the Commission.  You are now 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 58 of 244 
 
excused.  Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the next 
witness that we intend calling is Mr van Loggerenberg.  
There are, however, practical issues which need to be 
attended to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Consequent upon the arrangements 
that have been made with the SSA there is going to be a 
substitution of the existing affidavit by a redacted affidavit.  
We had wondered whether it would be possible to proceed 
10 
without that document but I do not think practically it will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And so we would ask for the time to 
make those practical arrangements and then to commence 
with the leading with Mr Van Loggerenberg.  I cannot tell 
the Chair exactly how long that will be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   But I imagine it will be more than 
half an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in that event, because we were 
20 
going to take an early lunch at half past twelve, maybe we 
may as well adjourn now, maybe we should – if we adjourn 
now and take the same amount of time that we would have 
taken if we had adjourned at half past twelve, then we 
would resume at half past one but then at two there will be 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 59 of 244 
 
that interruption.  So I do not know what you think, 
whether… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I think, Chair, that would be 
perfectly in order, that would give us enough time to get 
SARS in order and Mr van Loggerenberg ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And we will have half an hour, it will 
be interrupted for a while and then we will continue.  So 
that is in order from our side, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay, let us adjourn now 
10 
and then we will resume at half past one. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we ready Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes thank you Chair, we would wish 
to call our next witness who is Mr Van Loggerenburg.

oath or affirmation. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Johannes Hendrikus Van

MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth the whole truth and nothing

CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated Mr Van 
Loggerenburg. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you Chair, good afternoon Mr 
Van Loggerenburg.      
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Good afternoon sir. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You should have a file on the bench 
behind you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, sorry Mr Franklin, thank you Mr 
Loggerenburg 
for 
availing 
yourself 
to 
assist 
the 
20 
Commission. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   It is my honour Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you Chair, it is called SARS 
Bundle 02.  You have that?  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 61 of 244 
 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   I do, yes Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please, would you open that up to 
page 3?  You see that is the commencement of an affidavit 
in your name, correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then please turn to page eight 
zero.  It appears from that page that this affidavit was 
deposed to you on the 11 t h of November 2020.  Can you 
confirm if that is correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chair.  
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And can you give the Chair the 
assurance that the content of the affidavit is true and 
accurate?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Absolutely, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair may I ask that Mr 
Van Loggerenburg’s affidavits from page 3 to page 80 of 
SARS bundle 02 be admitted as exhibit WW2? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Johannes Hendrikus 
van Loggerenburg starting at page 3 will be admitted as an 
exhibit as it is marked as exhibit WW2.  
20 
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you 
Chair. 
Mr 
Van 
Loggerenburg I am going to take you to various different 
topics in your affidavit and I would like to start off with just 
a brief introduction, and then with your employment history.  
 
And you were an employee of the South African 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 62 of 244 
 
revenue services from November 1998 until he resigned in 
February of 2015, is that correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am going to take you to your 
career at SARS, but before we do I just want to remind you 
that certain of the information that you wish to disclose 
and 
originally 
disclosed 
in 
your 
original 
affidavit 
is 
sensitive and that there has been a process of redaction at 
the request of the State Security Association.  You're 
aware of that?  
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   I am aware of a that 
Chairperson it was my offer to them. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And I just want to be sure, please 
that neither of us inadvertently refer to a name or any 
other piece of information that has been redacted. I think 
you understand the process perfectly.  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   I understand, Chairperson.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Could we then begin 
with your career at SARS, and I am going to just take it at 
various stages, if you could start at paragraph 15.  And 
20 
what you say there is that you joined SARS in November of 
1998, correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   It is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And there are a number of different 
units that you either established and or were head of 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 63 of 244 
 
during your time, and the first unit to which you were 
assigned, was known as the Special Investigations Division 
of SARS that we call SI, is that correct?  
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBURG: 
 
 
Yes, 
that 
is 
correct. 
Chairperson I should just perhaps say there was a 
distinction between division and unit within the revenue 
service.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, and so you were assigned to 
the Special Investigations Division and you were tasked to 
build a manual case selection, tracking and monitoring 
10 
system as part of a small unit.  And that unit was 
formalised in 1999, and named the SARS Tax and Customs 
Intelligence Unit, the STCIU, is that correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And the purpose of that unit, you 
have made a reference to tax gap and the definition of tax 
gap, can you explain what that is to the Chair, please?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Chairperson, simply put, the 
tax gap is a term used by revenue authorities worldwide, 
you refer to the ideal tax amount collected per fiscal year 
20 
by a revenue authority versus the actual amount collected.  
So if everybody paid their tax, and nobody made 
any mistake, you would get a 100% compliance and then 
there's the real take, and that gap in between is the tax 
gap, and this is the holy grail for revenue service, is that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 64 of 244 
 
we want to go and collect more tax.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  In paragraph 20, you 
say: 
“That the mandate of the unit was to track and 
monitor ongoing investigations and audits of the 
then SARS Special Investigation offices, country 
wide.” 
And you also say that: 
“It was to allocate cases based on a manual 
suspicious activity report in SAR system.” 
10 
And briefly, what was the or is the SAR system? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Chairperson it is in those 
days; it was a manual document that you have to fill in by 
hand. But it was borrowed from the American suspicious 
transaction report, which is really the equivalent almost of 
first information of crime form that you would complete at 
the Police Station if you want to report a crime or a 
suspected crime.  
So, it was of a specific design to enable the person 
who 
was 
completing 
the 
report, 
to 
give 
sufficient 
20 
information and data available, that would enable one to 
analyse 
it 
in 
a 
uniform 
manner, 
whether 
it 
was 
a 
standardised form.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Then in paragraph 21, 
you explain that: 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 65 of 244 
 
“At two years later in the year 2000 as part of the 
modernisation of SARS, you were tasked by senior 
management to start an experimental unit known as 
the SARS Special Compliance Unit, the SCU.” 
Just pausing there, the process of modernisation that you 
talk about, can you explain to the Chair when did that 
begin 
and 
under 
whose 
auspices 
and 
what 
was 
its 
objective?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Yes, Chairperson there were 
many elements of modernisation, but I guess the primary 
10 
ones at the time, I referred to in paragraph 20.5, just the 
preceding paragraph on the same page, which were known 
as Yaka[?] and modernisation as a whole.   
Which sought to look at the improvements, whether 
it was Information Technology, design of what would later 
become known as eFiling that we all use today, but also 
improvements in terms of human resource management, 
fiscal 
management 
within 
the 
institution, 
productivity 
planning, and aligning all of that with the medium term 
expenditure framework, fiscal cycle.  
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, and you say: 
“That 
the 
SCU 
mandate 
was 
to 
assist 
law 
enforcement agencies to control organised crime, 
from a revenue customs and excise perspective.” 
Can you just explain to the Chair in what way it would do 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 66 of 244 
 
this? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Yes, Chair towards the late 
1990’s the revenue service was increasingly being looked 
to 
by 
other 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
and 
state 
intelligence and prosecuting authorities to help them to 
address crime, which was one of the I think there were 
seven 
key 
priorities 
for 
all 
government 
agencies 
countrywide.  
And one of them was to address, crime rates which 
were very high at the time, and in order for the revenue 
10 
service to contribute to that and pick up on the demands 
that came from the respective agency, we saw a dedicated 
component was created with a view to assist in precisely 
that.  
It may be useful to just recall that this was around 
the time that the law enforcement landscape in South 
Africa began to modernise as a whole.  Chairperson, you 
may recall, the introduction of the Financial Intelligence 
Centre Act, the introduction of the Prevention of the 
Organised Crime Act, the Prevention of Rough[?] Activities 
20 
Act, and Special Investigations Unit and so forth.  
And all of them were creatures of statute, and many 
of those laws, in fact, incorporated the revenue service 
into that aspect.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right in para 28 on page 8, you say: 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 67 of 244 
 
“That this unit, went on to make a marked impact 
against organised crime from a tax customs and 
excise perspective, and worked closely with the 
South 
African 
Police 
Service, 
the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Authority, 
the 
National 
Intelligence 
Agency, 
South 
African 
Secret 
Service, 
Marine 
Coastal Management Asset Forfeiture Unit, and 
Metro Police Departments.” 
Is that correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
10 
If I could add, there were also different multi-agency task 
grouping set up at the time where the revenue service also 
participated in, and in respect of those entities mentioned 
in 
my 
paragraph 
28 
there 
were 
also 
operational 
agreements that existed between the revenue service and 
specifically these State organs that I mentioned here to 
give guidance on how we assisted. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, and then in paragraph 
30, you explained that after a time, you were tasked to 
return to the TCIU.  That is the unit that we spoke about 
20 
earlier, which you joined in November of 1998.  It was set 
up and named as the TCIU in 1999 but you returned to that 
unit in order to enhance its capacity and capability, and 
that was then renamed the SARS Business Intelligence 
Unit, the BIU, is that correct?  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 68 of 244 
 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson, 
in 
fact, 
there 
were 
something 
similar 
being 
formed 
elsewhere within the revenue service at the time under the 
customs and excise component, and the business decision 
was to say let us not duplicate let us get the resources 
together under a single umbrella, which was the specific 
task that I was given at the time and which I reported to as 
I state there, Mr Tshabalala.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   But you say in paragraph 34 that: 
“The BIU you grew in size and continued with the 
10 
mandate to conduct case selection, tracking and 
monitoring of non-compliance and investigations 
and audits and research on the so called tax gaps.” 
Could you give the Chair an idea of practically what these 
tasks entail, how is it that the BIU executed its mandate on 
the topics that you have identified? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   This is very long and very 
briefly put, they were organised into if I can call them best 
or sub-units or sub-grouping.  The staff was in that had 
particular backgrounds or skills or capabilities, interests, 
20 
that would focus on different parts of the economy.  So, to 
one extent what that meant is that the revenue service now 
had a research capability that could collect, collate and 
analyse and distribute knowledge of specific areas in our 
economy, to those parts that had to either service, collect 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 69 of 244 
 
tax or enforce the tax laws, or customs laws or excise 
laws.  
 
In the main that was how they were organised but at 
the same time, they also worked very closely with those 
agencies that I mentioned earlier on because, of course, 
what they were looking at which included non-compliance, 
in terms of all the acts administered by the revenue 
service, inevitably, they would overlap with people who are 
not necessarily doing the right thing in our society.  
And so as a consequence, then they work very 
10 
closely together to try and collect all this information and 
make sure that this information was made available to the 
parts not only within the revenue service elsewhere, that 
would enable government to address the misbehaving or 
whatever. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you.  Then, in paragraph 
14, you explain that: 
“In 
2005, 
you 
were 
tasked 
to 
oversee 
the 
amalgamation 
of 
several 
enforcement 
units 
countrywide into a single unit then named in as the 
20 
SARS National Enforcement Unit, or NEU.” 
Just pausing there, you say that this task was part of the 
continuous improvements at SARS.  Is this a continuation 
of the modernisation program that you were speaking of?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Yes, so within the roadmap 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 70 of 244 
 
of the revenue service becoming more modern, one will 
have to look at each and every different part of the entire 
service, describe the route and the road it followed to 
modernise.  
In this particular instance, I am restricting my 
evidence to that part which I was part of, which was the 
enforcement 
component, 
the 
revenues. 
Around, 
2005 
Chairperson what we found was that there were too many 
tasks teams, units, components, divisions, everything else 
that were effectively all trying to achieve the same thing, 
10 
which was to enforce the law and to catch the bad guy, and 
hold them to account, collect the money from them.  
And so the logical thing was to do was to look at 
those different units in grouping that were almost similar, 
and to bring them together under a single umbrella, and 
give them a single management, so that they do not 
duplicate, they do not compete with resources and then 
you make the best with what you have in terms of number 
of people available, and your skill set.  
It also makes it easier for administrative purposes 
20 
when you plan for fiscal management, Human Resource 
Management, production planning, reporting to Parliament 
or whoever.  It just make sense, not have many of same 
and that is effectively what resulted in creation of what 
became known as the National Enforcement Unit. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 71 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right moving forward in para 44, 
page 10.  You describe how you then served as an advisor 
to what was known as the compliance division for a while, 
and then you were promoted in this period to the role of 
manager special operations, which was a sub-division of 
the enforcement division of SARS in 2007, is that correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then para 49, you explain that, by 
2010, you were promoted to the position of group executive 
and oversaw the alignment and functioning of five units, 
10 
which we will deal with in greater detail later.  And is it 
correct that those five units resorted under a sub-division 
which 
was 
known 
as 
the 
Projects 
and 
Evidence 
Management and Technical Support Division?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That was one of the sub-divisions of 
what would become The Tax and Customs Enforcement 
Investigations Division, the TCEI of SARS.  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And initially, you reported to the 
20 
then Deputy Commissioner of SARS, Mr Ivan Pillay and by 
early 2012, you reported to the chief officer of Tax and 
Customs Enforcement investigations Mr Jean Ravel, is that 
correct?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 72 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then finally, as regards your 
employment history, you resigned from SARS in February 
of 2019.  As you say, your last job title at SARS was group 
executive tax and customs enforcement investigations, 
airline 
projects, 
evidence 
management 
and 
technical 
support, correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Chairperson, I actually 
resigned in 2015, not 2019.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry, did I say 19?  Sorry, February 
2015, as is in your statement. 
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:    But the rest is correct, the 
statement also reads 2015.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Good, I would like to then take you 
to paragraph 53 and ask you please to explain the 
workings of the five units.  Earlier you had said in 2010, 
when you were promoted to group executive, you oversaw 
the alignment and functioning of five units, I take it, is 
these five units.  
And could you identify them and then briefly 
describe their functions. So the first one, which is dealt 
20 
with in paragraph 53.1, on page 11, is the National 
Projects Unit, the NPU.  What did that unit do during your 
time?  
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Chairperson the National 
Projects Unit is actually the later iteration of the National 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 73 of 244 
 
Enforcement Unit that I described earlier, which was the 
conglomeration of small little bits and pieces of units that 
were doing the same work at the same time.  By this time, 
we had developed a project investigation methodology and 
we were able to measure investigations reporting Standard 
Time.  
So, we were able to predict how many audits or 
financial 
investigations, 
preliminary 
investigations 
we 
could do in 208 work day fiscal year with the number of 
people that we have available.  And so, we used the 
10 
project that enables not just to track a transactional single 
instance, you can now look at a group of taxpayers at any 
time or a specific topic, cross all tax types, of all taxpayer 
type and utilise all the different tools and powers in 
remitted revenues.  
So the National Projects Unit was then the largest 
investigative component of time that had presence in the 
majority of the provinces, in the country and they then 
conducted 
what 
was 
known 
as 
civil 
and 
criminal 
investigative project within these projects.  It might be sub-
20 
project cases, preliminary investigations and whatever the 
case might be and their aim was literally to go after the 
bad guy.  
So I am not talking about ordinary taxpayers who 
forget to file their tax returns or anything like that I mean, 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 74 of 244 
 
organised, or very deliberate tax customs in the excise 
offenses.  They focused particularly on what we call the 
illicit economy, which would include all criminal activity as 
a fiscal consequence in South Africa.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry to interrupt, could I ask you to 
speak up or speak closer to the mic, I am told that you are 
not audible. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   I am sorry, I apologise 
Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Not at all, that is much better.  So 
10 
that was the first of the five units that you were in charge 
of the second is dealt within para 53.2.  It is the 
centralised/ central product, sorry, projects units, which 
you say: 
“Consisted of a small centralised office with a 
national 
mandate 
to 
conduct 
civil 
investigative 
projects aimed at combating preventing recovering 
tax, 
customs 
and 
excise 
losses 
in 
the 
illicit 
economy and criminal enterprises and to detain, 
seize and forfeit illicit controlled and smuggled 
20 
goods associated there with.” 
I am not sure…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should stop there, Mr 
Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, it is time for the…[intervene] 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 75 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will have an interruption for me to 
address certain matters and thereafter, we will continue. 
On Tuesday evening this week this Commission had 
two sessions, a day session and the evening session, 
during the evening session, I had the cross examination of 
Minister Pravin Gordhan, Minister of Public Enterprises by 
Mr Tom Moyane’s counsel Mr Mpofu as well as the re-
examination of Mr Gordhan on, by his counsel, Ms Le 
Roux.  Towards the end of Ms Le Roux’s re-examination or 
Mr 
Gordhan 
certain 
events 
happened 
and 
certain 
10 
statements and utterances were made which ought not to 
have been made.  
I have given myself the opportunity to watch the 
video of the last 15 minutes of those proceedings just to 
make sure that I see exactly what happened, and it seems 
to me that, as Chairperson of this Commission, it is 
imperative that I address this matter.  
Many things may have happened during those 
proceedings in the evening section, that maybe should not 
have 
happened, 
and 
maybe 
there 
may 
be 
certain 
20 
statements that also may have been made, that maybe 
should not have been made.  But I am not going to deal 
with all of them, I am going to deal with those that I regard 
as the most serious. 
This Commission is established in terms of the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 76 of 244 
 
Constitution 
of 
our 
Republic, 
it 
is 
a 
Presidential 
Commission.  It was established by the former President, 
Mr Zuma.  I was asked to Chair it and I agreed, because I 
regarded its work as very important for our country, and for 
our democracy.  It has been sitting for just over three years 
and during this time many people have appeared before 
me, including lawyers, attorneys and advocates.   
Many people have sort to assist this Commission, for which 
we are very grateful and many lawyers who have appeared 
before this Commission have conducted themselves in an 
10 
acceptable way.  That is not to say there have been no 
incidents that were not acceptable and that one would have 
preferred not to have happened.  But by and large the 
overwhelming majority of people who appear before the 
commission, cooperate with the commission, show respect 
to the commission, show respect to one another.  
 
Sometimes false tensions rise, but on the whole 
everyone manages to ensure that the proceedings of the 
commission continue.  I am grateful to all of those who 
show respect to this commission, and to show respect to 
20 
others who have a role to play in this commission.  
 
On Tuesday evening Mr Mpofu who as I have said 
appeared for Mr Moyane, told counsel for Mr Gordhan to 
shut up.  He also told Mr Gordhan to shut up.  I have never 
had any lawyer in any court proceedings or in any 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 77 of 244 
 
commission or forum, tell another lawyer to shut up, or a 
witness.  
 
The general Council of the Bar of South Africa, 
uniform rules of professional conduct provide under the 
heading duties regarding cross-examination of witnesses.  
Rule 3.3.5: 
 
“In all cases it is the duty of the advocate to 
guard 
against 
being 
made 
a 
channel 
for 
questions which are only intended to insult or 
annoy either the witness or any other person 
10 
and to exercise his own judgment, both as to 
the substance and form of the question.” 
 
Rule 4.12 reads, and the heading is ill feeling and 
personalities between counsel: 
 
“Clients, 
not 
counsel, 
are 
the 
litigants.  
Whatever 
may 
be 
the 
ill 
feeling 
existing 
between clients, it should not be allowed to 
influence 
counsel 
in 
their 
conduct 
and 
demeanour towards each other or towards 
tutors in the case.  All personalities between 
20 
counsel should be scrumptiously avoided.  In 
the trial of a cause it is improper to allude to 
the 
personal 
history 
or 
the 
personal 
peculiarities or idiosyncrasies of counsel on 
the other side.  Such conduct cannot be 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 78 of 244 
 
tolerated.  It impacts upon the dignity of the 
commission and is taken in a serious light.  
Not least because the proceedings of this 
judicial commission of inquiry are televised to 
the public.  Even the matters that are being 
investigated by the commission, it is to be 
expected that those who appear before it 
would make serious allegations and that these 
are quite firmly and passionately denied.  That 
there may be animosity between accuser and 
10 
defender in certain cases is to be expected.  
However, 
both 
witnesses 
and 
implicated 
persons 
are 
entitled 
to 
engage 
legal 
practitioners to assist them.  This gives legal 
practitioners, namely practising attorneys or 
advocates 
an 
opportunity 
to 
assist 
the 
commission in its work, in the cause of 
protecting their clients’ interests or rights.  
That opportunity however comes with certain 
responsibilities. 
 
A 
legal 
practitioner 
is 
20 
required at the very minimum to ensure that 
the decorum defeating the forum in which she 
or he appears, is jealously maintained and that 
his or her conduct does not bring the forum in 
question, into disrepute.” 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 79 of 244 
 
 
I record my extreme concern that that did not 
happen during some of the exchanges on Tuesday evening.  
Not only was disrespect shown, to some of the people in 
the hearing, but also it was shown to the commission and 
to me as the Chairperson.  
 
My task as the Chairperson is not made any easier 
when legal representatives all shocked of what their noble 
profession 
requires 
of 
them, 
incidentally 
the 
same 
considerations apply to public figures.  All persons who are 
given a platform at the commission, whether as a witness 
10 
or an implicated person or as a legal practitioner, have a 
duty to the public and indeed to our democracy to ensure 
that they engender public confidence in processes such as 
those being followed at the commission, and that they 
maintain minimum standards of conduct and decorum 
expected of them when they are in a forum such as this.  
 
I want to make it clear that in any meeting or forum 
where there is a Chairperson, it is the duty of that 
Chairperson to make sure that the proceedings of that 
meeting or forum are conducted in a smooth manner.  That 
20 
is also my duty as Chairperson of this commission.  
 
It is my right and obligation to make sure that I 
allow somebody who needs to be allowed the opportunity to 
speak, to speak but it is my right to determine when they 
may speak.  It is my right to determine how long they may 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 80 of 244 
 
speak.  It is my right to determine when they must stop 
speaking.  
 
So that I give somebody else a chance, also that 
the proceedings may continue.  Mr Mpofu was told by me to 
sit down at a certain stage, towards the end of the 
proceedings.  He was not the first legal practitioner that I 
told to sit down in this commission.   
 
I have a clear recollection that I have told Mr Barry 
SC, who represents Mr Koko in this commission, a few 
times to sit down.  I remember that I have told Ms 
10 
Mbantshwa 
who 
represents 
Ms 
Mamela 
in 
these 
proceedings to sit down and I think I have told a certain 
attorney also, whose name I cannot remember, to sit down.  
 
It is my duty to make sure that these proceedings, 
the proceedings of this commission, continue in a smooth 
manner and where I need to ensure that somebody speaks, 
I will decide that that person will speak and I will allow him 
or her but where I decide that that person has said enough 
or that that person should be heard at another time, I am 
the one who will decide.  
20 
 
No legal practitioner including Mr Mpofu, has a right 
to begin to tell any other person in this commission, to 
shut up.  That power belongs to the Chairperson of the 
commission and even I will not use the words shut up.  
That conduct is unacceptable to this commission and it is 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 81 of 244 
 
important that the public and other legal practitioners 
should know that this conduct is not acceptable in this 
commission. 
 
As I have indicated there may be other utterances 
or conduct, but I have decided to focus on the most serious 
utterances that were made that day.  I may have to 
consider in due course, what to do in the future if a 
witness or an implicated person or his or her lawyer is not 
prepared to subject themselves to the authority and 
instructions of the Chairperson.  
10 
 
The 
right 
to 
cross-examine 
is 
granted 
to 
an 
implicated person by me on the understanding that that 
implicated person and his or her legal representative will 
subject themselves to the directions of the Chairperson 
during the proceedings.  
 
The right to cross-examine and the right to re-
examine they are all part of the right to be heard.  The 
right to be heard is not absolute.  The right to be heard is 
not absolute.  The right to cross-examine that is only 
granted by the Chairperson after applying his mind to an 
20 
application 
for 
cross-examination 
is 
granted 
on 
the 
understanding that the implicated person and his or her 
legal 
representative 
will 
subject 
themselves 
to 
the 
authority of the Chairperson.  
 
Where everyone or anyone can stand up and tell 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 82 of 244 
 
other people in the proceedings to shut up and not rather 
request the Chairperson to ask the other person to please 
keep quiet, if that is allowed then there will only be chaos 
in the proceedings of this commission. 
 
That I will not allow.  Irrespective of who does it.  I 
thought that it is important that I address this issue quite 
clearly so that anybody in the future who contemplates 
doing it, knows quite well what my attitude is and what is 
acceptable and what is not acceptable.  
 
That is all I wanted to say about the events of 
10 
Tuesday evening.  Thank you Mr Franklin, we may proceed.  
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
Mr 
van 
Loggerenburg, we were busy with the five units that were 
under your control from 2010  until 2015 as I understand it 
and we had got onto the second of those, which is the CPU 
and I wanted to ask you what is meant by the phrase the 
elicit economy.   
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBURG: 
 
Chairperson, 
it 
is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Franklin, what is the page? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  It is 12, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.   
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Chairperson, I can talk for 
days on this, but in essence the revenue service made a 
distinction 
between 
money 
supply 
that 
came 
from 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 83 of 244 
 
legitimate economic activities, whether it is business or 
people getting paid or transactions or whatever the case 
might be, in the formal sector as well as the informal 
sector.  
 
So although there would be merging micro and 
small businesses, that would technically not always comply 
with let us say for argument’s sake a municipal bylaw or 
something.  That would have been seen as the licit 
economy. 
 
Then super imposed over that is the elicit economy 
10 
which refer to those activities within society that have an 
intent or, intent to achieve or physical consequence.  In 
other words someone makes money somewhere or spend 
money.  
 
But the activity is unlawful and illegal.  So that is, it 
is an artificial distinction because you of course find 
unlawful and illegal activities within legitimate businesses 
form, but the elicit economy focussed on those people who 
were committing crime with the view to make money, and in 
South African law as is the case mostly in the world, the 
20 
source of or the origin of the income is not relevant for tax 
purposes.  
 
Income is taxable.  So that is essentially in a 
nutshell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure whether you are speaking 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 84 of 244 
 
in a manner that allows them to hear you. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Am I too soft? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember they made a request.  Ja, I 
think you must raise ...[intervenes] 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Lift my voice, sorry.  Okay.  
Should I repeat what I said Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I did hear.  They are not making an 
indication that they did not hear.  It looks like they did hear 
but I think it is better if you raise your voice.  Just repeat, 
ja.  
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  I apologise, Chair.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  I am sorry.  Mr van Loggerenburg, it 
may be easier if you bring the mic closer to you if you can.  
Move that file.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So that is the 
second of the five units.  The third is dealt with in 
paragraph 53.3, it is the tactical interventions unit, the TIU 
and that consisted of offices at ports of entry around the 
country.  What was the focus of that unit? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Chairperson, this was a 
component of the - what was and still, I do not know if it is 
20 
still known as the customs border control unit, which is a 
paramilitary component within the revenue service that 
came about in the mid 2000’s by statute.  
 
Many people would have seen them in their black 
combat uniforms at border posts or at the airport perhaps.  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 85 of 244 
 
Where they carry handcuffs and some of them carry 
firearms and they have a K9 unit that look for drugs and 
that sort of thing.  
 
Now, so the tactical intervention unit is a part of 
that border control unit that was sliced out, because they 
were an investigative component as opposed to a visible 
policing component and for that reason they came to resort 
into the subdivision.   
 
They were based at the majority of the ports of 
entry which is the harbours, the commercial points of entry.  
10 
Harbours, 
airports 
and 
land 
border 
ports, 
and 
they 
conducted investigations from the point where goods may 
have entered the country, up to the point where those 
goods end up within the country, as well as goods leaving 
the country from the point where they originate.  
 
Maybe it is something that is manufactured all the 
way through the port of entry to another jurisdiction and 
they then focussed on those types of investigations.  This 
would be, they would be the people who looked at 
smugglers of illegal goods or drugs or cigarettes or 
20 
whatever the case might be and as I say they have peace 
officer status and they are more of a paramilitary nature.  
 
They would conduct inspections and raids and 
arrest people and detain goods and that sort of thing.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  The fourth of the units in 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 86 of 244 
 
paragraph 53.4 is the evidence management and technical 
support unit, the METS and that as I understand it was a 
small, centralised unit comprising of scarce and expensive 
expert skills.  
 
Can you explain briefly what the role of that unit 
was?   
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Yes.  Chairperson, as a 
developed 
mental 
state 
constitutional 
democracy, 
the 
government departments are not all where we would like 
them to be for many reasons.  Historical reasons, economic 
10 
reasons and all sorts of other reasons.  
 
One of the side effects of that, is that sometimes 
you do not have the ideal number of expert skill sets.  For 
instance we needed very good mathematician who could 
understand very complex mathematical formulations and 
help us in that sense.  
 
I am using one example.  Those types of people are 
scarce in South Africa firstly.  They are even more scarce if 
you want to get them to come and work for a revenue 
service and they are typically also very expensive.  So in 
20 
an ideal situation one would one day want people like that 
in every national projects unit in the country. 
 
Every tactical enforcement, tactical interventions 
unit but you cannot have that and so this unit was a 
centralisation 
of 
the 
country’s 
best 
experts 
in 
that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 87 of 244 
 
subdivision who then provided an auxiliary support service 
to these three units I have already described to you. 
 
National project, central project and the tactical 
intervention unit, and I have given you an example we had 
a PHD in mathematics there.  We had a world class 
forensics IT laboratory.  In fact it was the best in the 
country.  
 
The police used to ask us to help them with their 
complex matters.  We had PHD’s in criminal law or auditing 
experts and that sort of thing.  So this unit was really just 
10 
a centralisation of those rear and expensive skills that you 
would 
make 
available 
on 
demand 
to 
the 
respective 
investigative units, within the context of the cases they are 
working on and on a prioritisation model. 
 
So if it is a case that is more important, it really 
needs a particular type of skill, we make that person 
available 
to 
that 
theme 
for 
that 
duration 
of 
that 
investigation. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you, and then the last of the 
five units is described in 53.5.  It is the high risk 
20 
investigation unit, the HRIU.  We will hear more about this 
in a different context in due course.  Please explain what 
that unit did.  
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBURG: 
 
Chairperson, 
this 
unit 
conducted also auxiliary supportive assistance to the other 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 88 of 244 
 
investigative units and also to other law enforcement 
agencies.  In those instances where the tasks required in 
the context of an investigation was such that it presented 
either a risk to the revenue service official and here I mean 
life and limb. 
 
All risk to the evidence.  All when we were 
investigating people who we knew would put up resistance 
beyond law fare but actually threatened people, shoot 
people, abduct people and that sort of thing.  They were, I 
mean by 2012 they were six people so it was a very, very 
10 
small team. 
 
That is, they kind of did the support work for the 
bigger investigations that we were working on.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  You have explained that 
in by way of structure, one had the division which is known 
as the TCEI and then under it was the PEMTS and the five 
units that you have described and then there was a 
separate division, is that right, or subdivision rather of the 
main division and that is one which you described in 
paragraph 54 and that subdivision was known as the 
20 
criminal investigations and preliminary investigations and 
enquiries subdivision, correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And it had two units.  The first was 
the 
national 
and 
regional 
offices 
of 
the 
criminal 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 89 of 244 
 
investigation unit and the second was known as the 
preliminary investigations and enquiries unit, correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  That is correct, Chairperson.  
I could add the criminal investigations unit is the oldest 
enforcement unit in the revenue service.  It has its roots in 
the days when the revenue service came about in terms of 
the act in 1997, and they had grown over time so they had 
the biggest footprint in terms of offices all over the country 
and they probably in my view had the most experienced 
criminal investigators that focussed on SARS related 
10 
criminal offences.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, and having regard to that 
overview Mr van Loggerenburg, I think it is safe to say that 
your career at SARS was very much enforcement and units 
that had as their objective, the monitoring of illicit 
activities and the insurance that revenue was collected as 
it ought to be collected and that persons who were not 
complying with the law, would be apprehended and dealt 
with. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Yes, Chairperson.  In one 
20 
way or another as provided for in terms of the SARS 
regulatory 
and 
legal 
framework 
and 
of 
course 
the 
constitution. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And you have described earlier the 
process of modernisation and your own area in the revenue 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 90 of 244 
 
services was modernised as I understand it.  you spoke 
about that process taking place effectively from around 
1998 and onwards, and can you give the Chair an idea how 
successful was that modernisation process, where was 
SARS as an organisation in 2013, 2014? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Chairperson, this is not in my 
affidavit but I can answer the question.  There is an 
internationally recognised measurement instrument that is 
applied by tax authorities and customs authorities to 
measure their efficacy and efficiency and status, areas that 
10 
they need to develop and areas that they are very good at.  
 
That is commonly known as the tax administration 
diagnostic assessment tool.  People have to be specifically 
trained to use this tool and it takes some time.  External 
people go into these authorities and they measure different 
points in different ways.   
 
Quite a sophisticated system.  I know that by 2013 
the South African Revenue Service scored among the top 
five revenue and customs authorities in the world in 
respect of that diagnostic assessment tool.   
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  In paragraph 59 you 
allege this, you say: 
 
“As a result the prominence of SARS ability to 
enforce laws it oversaw and its capacity to do 
so, became increasingly effective over the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 91 of 244 
 
years, ultimately being praised and studied 
worldwide.” 
 
That is what you have just alluded to now. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:  Well, that is one example 
Chair.  This – the acronym they used for that tool is TADAT.  
That is one example.  I mean there have been many 
publications over the years since the late ‘90’s until 2013. I 
know that other countries in fact in January/February 2014 
the United Kingdom sent a delegation to come and spend 
time with us to understand how we were managing to impact 
10 
on the illicit tobacco trade because they – they did not know 
how.  So I mean it is a – the Revenue Service was well 
known and well received worldwide and actually steady. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Right I would like to move on to your 
investigative methodology which you have dealt with as a 
topic in paragraph 63 page 17 and following and could I ask 
you firstly to just highlight for the Chair and just to put a 
figure on this obviously these figures one can get more 
accurate figures but just a ball park figure.  The last 
sentence in paragraph 63 says that: 
20 
“At the time and this time I presume is when 
in the – in the early 2000’s or 2010?”   
Do you know what time you are talking about here? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes it would have been around 
– around 2009 to 2010 Chairperson. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 92 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And your estimate was that he illicit 
economy was costing the state in excess of R100 billion per 
annum. Is that – that a – as far as you know an accurate 
figure? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chairperson and it is a 
well-known figure one that was widely published at the time 
and… 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And then in order to address that loss and 
in order to execute your mandate I understand that the focus 
areas which were prioritised in terms of what was known as 
10 
the SARS Illicit Economy Strategy which you deal with in 
paragraph 66 on page 19.   
The focus areas that were prioritised in terms of that 
strategy which was approved and presented to Parliament 
was as set out in paragraph 66.1 to 66.13.   
So you need not go through them all but do I 
understand it that there was in place at least from 2006 until 
2013 an approved Illicit Economy Strategy which was 
followed? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chairperson the – the Illicit 
20 
Economy Strategy existed before and so these focus areas 
and the preceding paragraph the manner in which matters 
were identified for investigation.  But the significance of this 
is the fact that it was presented to Parliament and accepted 
in that year. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 93 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was presented in Parliament and? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And accepted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And accepted okay. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  In other words for me it means 
a lot more if Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Is aware of it and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I accept that. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And they do not stop us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is just that you swallowed your word 
10 
accepted.  So . 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I apologise again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I am a nervous character Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No relax.   
ADV FRANKLIN:  And Mr Van Loggerenberg I understand 
that it was presented on more than one occasion to 
Parliament over at least that period 2006 until 2013? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chairperson in fact we 
were often called to Parliament in the preceding years and 
20 
post years on different matters often relating to shall I say 
common crime problems facing the country.   
Not 
only 
did 
they 
call 
the 
ordinary 
parts 
of 
government that you would expect to be called by Parliament 
meaning the police or prosecuting authority and so on but 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 94 of 244 
 
the Revenue Service was also always called to come and 
account and I in fact I attended many of those sessions and 
they were very difficult because you have to prepare quite a 
lot of documentation and so on.   
All 
of them 
pushing the 
Revenue Service and 
expecting more of the Revenue Service to do its bit to 
address organised crime and crime in general in the country. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And then to give the commission an idea 
of the ambit of the activities of the PEMTS sub-division you 
say in paragraph 67 that that sub-division supported by 
10 
others was at the forefront of investigating at least 87 
projects as at the time that you resigned from SARS to the 
best of your recollection.  Now do I understand you to say 
there were 87 odd live projects at or about 2015 when you 
left SARS? 
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBERG: 
 Yes 
Chairperson 
it 
was 
certainly not less it may be more and when I say projects 
that would be overarching focus area with multiple audits, 
multiple 
financial 
investigations 
and 
multiple 
civil 
investigations, multiple entities, multiple tax 00:06:08. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And just to highlight one that we will 
examine in greater detail in due course paragraph 66.9 you 
talk about smuggling activities with a specific emphasis on 
tobacco and alcohol related products.  That obviously was 
one of the focus areas and I take that there were a number 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 95 of 244 
 
or projects in relation to that particular objective? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chairperson there was one – by 
this time there was on project with multiple sub-projects 
underneath it so the project that the evidence leader Mr 
Franklin is referring to which was known as Project Honey 
Badger would count as one in this 87 projects. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Right then I would like to take you to 
another topic which you deal with from page 23 and onwards 
and it is entitled Resistance Encountered by SARS during 
Investigations.   
10 
Now I take it that not everybody in the country 
thought that compliance was a good idea.  What you have 
done here is you have highlighted for the benefit of the 
commission some of the obstacles that you as SARS 
compliance units encountered in the way of executing your 
mandate and could I ask you to – to just explain that for the 
benefit of the Chair and perhaps you can do so in phases 
what you have done in this section of your statement is to 
begin in 2003 and then you have gone forward to 2014.   
But could you give the Chair an idea of the type of 
20 
resistance that was encountered by SARS concerning these 
investigations and projects that you have outlined? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chairperson when – when the 
Revenue Service began to make an impact on particularly 
organised crime in the early 2000’s and here I mean we were 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 96 of 244 
 
putting illegal drug dealers and drug manufacturers and cash 
in transit heists type organised crime people in jail for tax 
evasion.   
Though at first I think they – they when I say they I 
mean the bad people, the crooks, the rogues did not see it 
coming because it was a new thing in the South African 
environment. But to the extent that some did on – in my early 
days at the Revenue Service I picked up that the common 
trend was really to corrupt people.   
So the bad guys would simply pay money to an 
10 
official to either make something happen or make something 
not happen.  And that was kind of the standard informal 
counter that the bad guys had.   
By the time we had the Special Compliance Unit and 
we were now focussed and we were all on a mission to make 
an impact now the bad guys began to alter their way in which 
they responded to us.  So the typical responses would be to 
delay you know when you – when they are obliged to submit 
information or to ask for extra time or to you know get sick 
and say they are not available they can only come in two 
20 
weeks’ time or – the sort of typical defences that you find but 
in addition to that we began to encounter the names 
dropping.   
So somebody would say to us you know if you touch 
me you going to touch so and so and if you touch so and so 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 97 of 244 
 
he knows Minister so and so.  So it just you know when you 
deal with me maybe we should go and sit somewhere and 
see if there is not a way of making this go away which is 
what we used to call names dropping.  It became a term.   
So somebody would come in from a raid or from an 
interview or anything and they would say oh there was some 
names dropping again with this one.  It began to be – get 
more and more so where it would happen just here and there 
it became – it would become more frequent.   
And another trend at the time that I began to see was 
10 
– was where people were being threatened literally.  They 
were told if you want your job, you want to stay in your job 
you better back off which is what we called the make the life 
difficult kind of statement.  So somebody would say well give 
me your name and your surname you know I know so and so 
– so you – if you want your job you may want to do things in 
a particular way.   
And that escalated by the mid-2000’s to our people 
being held hostage, our people being shot at, our people 
being shot, our people being murdered, assaulted and 
20 
threatened in that manner.  Their families threatened, 
equipment stolen and that sort of thing.   
To – I mean to a point I remember even we uncovered 
a plot and this is public knowledge where they were planning 
to bomb my office.  So this – in time that is the kind of 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 98 of 244 
 
resistance that we began to experience and certainly by the 
mid-2000 I began to experience two things internally with the 
people that I was working with.   
One 
was 
that 
some 
people 
felt 
incredibly 
uncomfortable to do this kind of work.  They said look we 
auditors, we – this is not – we do not want to carry guns.  
And at the same time from labour there were demands for 
increased danger pay and for the purchasing and supply of 
bullet proof vests and bodyguards and that sort of thing.  So 
it – it over time became more and more the norm.   
10 
But I must say Chair I think we were good at 
mitigating those risks and where people did not want to work 
on cases we did not force them to work on cases and where 
bodyguards had to be provided they were.  Where bullet 
proof vests had to be acquired and provided they were.  We 
could not quite afford danger pay but we certainly did what 
we could.   
And then I think because we were that effective in 
countering these attacks on us it changed.  You still got 
these here and there but it kind of almost changed almost 
20 
immediately and it began to turn into personal attacks on 
individuals.   
So usually in the form a rumour or an accusation but 
completely unsubstantiated and generally they would be – 
they would be 00:14:50.  So it is kind of like this guy cannot 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 99 of 244 
 
be trusted because this is what he has been doing or 
salacious of some kind or accused of corruption and that 
certainly began to increase and it – it ultimately became 
what I described as a cottage industry.   
People created dossier of these things which at face 
value if you do not know anything it makes a good read but 
the minute you dig into it then you find it is complete 
nonsense and that just became the par for the course by at 
least 2013/2014.  
 ADV FRANKLIN:  Alright then in the section on page 25 
10 
under the heading The Climate Set for the Final Attack on 
SARS.  You have set out various examples here.  Could I 
take you forward to paragraph 86 on page 33 and what you 
have said is this: 
“SARS lost any semblance of effectively 
countering the sorts of attacks I have already 
described from end September 2014 when 
the appointment of then Commissioner Tom 
Moyane was announced by then President 
Jacob Zuma out of the blue and he took 
20 
office almost immediately.  Almost overnight 
when Mr Tom Moyane took over the public 
attacks 
on 
SARS 
and 
its 
officials 
ran 
unabated and Mr Tom Moyane did absolutely 
nothing to defend SARS or allow people in 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 100 of 244 
 
SARS who were able to defend SARS and its 
officials and work to do so.  In fact he 
prohibited this emphatically in this regard I 
refer to Annexures 1, 2 and 3.” 
Just pausing there you have made quite blunt 
statements there regarding the former Commissioner we will 
get to some of the detail but can you describe in your own 
words to the Commissioner why you say that as from the 
time of the appointment of Mr Moyane SARS lost any 
semblance of effectively countering these attacks? 
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chairperson in 2014 these sort 
of dossier type attacks that I described earlier were 
happening thick and fast.  It was if not a weekly it was a 
daily occurrence.  Now if I may Chairperson refer just to the 
previous page?  Page 33 at paragraph 85 page 33, 
paragraph 85.  What I quote here is a statement issued by 
the South African Revenue Service on the 31s t of July 2014 
to the media.   
ADV FRANKLIN:  This is before Mr Moyane’s appointment? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Correct.  So in – as I said 
20 
Chairperson now we – we now under attack from all sides 
with these claims and we have had that before so we know 
the best way to deal with these sorts of claims is to take the 
dossier and unpack it in detail and demonstrate the truth so 
that whoever has it can weigh up the two against each other 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 101 of 244 
 
and decide for themselves.  But now they were just coming 
in thick and fast.   
But by 31 July 2014 the Revenue Service was quite 
capable of dealing with this in this manner.  But at this time 
persons 
from 
within 
the 
states 
– 
state 
intelligence 
environment began to feed these dossiers into the media and 
so the media would come to the Revenue Service and ask for 
comment and that is the origin of this statement.   If I may 
read Chair if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may but at some stage I would like 
10 
you to tell me how SARS dealt with these attacks prior to Mr 
Moyane coming in because you implied or suggested that 
after he came on board it appeared that the – SARS was no 
longer dealing with these attacks in the same way as it might 
have done before his time.  So at some stage if you can deal 
with that but you can read what you would like to read. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Thank you Chair.  What the 
Revenue said to the public at the time was that they were 
aware that people had a vested interest in creating confusion 
amongst state institutions. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Just for the record you are reading from 
the official document communicated by SARS to the media 
on the 31s t of July 2014. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  That is correct Chairperson.  I put a 
footnote of the origin of where I got it from the internet. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 102 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is quoted on page 33 of the bundle? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   
“So first of all the Revenue Service wanted 
the public to know that there – that the 
Revenue Service was aware that there were 
people who had a vested interest in creating 
confusion amongst state institutions.  And 
the Revenue Service was in no doubt that 
10 
they were behind these allegations as they 
had been in the past.  It has become common 
place for certain individuals with an interest 
in perverting the course of justice to compile 
dossiers, files and information which purport 
to uncover corruption but are in fact a 
concoction of some fact and much fiction.  
Such dossiers are then distributed to the 
media, certain law enforcement agencies and 
political players in the hope of disrupting or 
20 
flouting 
SARS 
action. 
 
SARS 
now 
has 
significant and credible evidence showing 
incidents of spying, double agents, dirty 
tricks, leaking of false allegations and the 
discrediting 
of 
officials. 
 
SARS 
is 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 103 of 244 
 
collaborating with the directorate of priority 
crime investigations the Hawks and State 
Security.  We are confident that soon many 
of the undesirable practices in the industry 
will come to light and the individuals will be 
held to account.”  
These are just my emphasis it is a much longer 
statement Chairperson.  It partly speaks to your question to 
me Chairperson if I may then respond to your question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  At this point in time the 
Revenue Service had begun to formerly engage with both the 
State Security Agency and the Directorate of Priority Crime 
Investigations to say look this is a problem.  It is not just 
affecting us it is affecting you too.  There is something going 
on.  We need to sit around a table and deal with this.   
The manner in which the Revenue Service responded 
to these types of fake dossiers up to that point Chairperson 
was firstly you need to have the fake dossier in your hands.  
You then take it line by line and you go and investigate the 
20 
claim.  The investigation has as aim to take the hypothesis 
as stated in the dossier and either prove the hypothesis 
correct or incorrect.  If it is found to be incorrect one would 
then want to investigate what is the purpose, what is the 
objective of putting something like this out there as if it is a 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 104 of 244 
 
fact when it is not a fact?  And the only way you can deal 
with it is unfortunately painful and it takes a lot of time is 
you have to take each allegation determine as much as you 
can where it originates from then you need to go and check 
the facts, then you need to put the two together and either it 
is proven to be so or proven to be not so.   
But that does not solve the problem of another 
dossier landing on your doorstep the next day so in the – in 
the Revenue Service 
environment and I think in the 
production environment engineers talk about corrective 
10 
action and action at a disposition level and corrective action 
is you want to fix the bigger problem whereas at a 
disposition level you want to deal with that problem.   
The car that has come out the factory with the broken 
steering wheel must be fixed but why is it coming out of the 
factory 
with 
a 
broken 
steering 
wheel 
there 
must 
be 
something wrong in the factory.  And so at this point in time 
we were in discussion and I am not sure if Mr Franklin will 
take me there but I was party to some of those discussions 
to see how do we deal with this problem?   
20 
Because it was not just that the Revenue Service was 
under attack the Prosecuting Authority was under attack in 
the same way, the Hawks were under attack in the same way 
and other parts of government.   
When Mr Moyane arrived two things happened.  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 105 of 244 
 
These dossiers and particular the one began to gain 
incredible traction in the media.  Up until that point it was 
easy for us to if the media asked questions and they 
provided the dossier to give them the counter and say look 
this is who made the dossier and these are the facts. 
But in this instance we were not given the dossier.  In 
fact we were not even necessarily asked for comment.  And 
then a – that would be front page news the next Sunday 
above the fold with photos of me as the poster boy or these 
things.  And instead of determining hold on a second here is 
10 
somebody saying that you bugged Zuma and that you broke 
into his home in Forest Town and you planted a listening 
device there and it is on the front page of the biggest selling 
newspaper in the country hey what is your story?  There is 
none of that.   
 
In fact the opposite happened.  It is accepted as if it 
is proof.  And then it begins and now it begins to escalate 
and escalate so it was no longer a case of dealing with these 
dossiers as they come in it is now we are not even allowed 
to respond to the dossier or see them. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN:  By way of example could I take you back 
to your statement?  Paragraph 77 on page 26 you have said 
that you had personal experience of this because you say: 
“In my case by way of example in December 
2014 I was specifically instructed in writing 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 106 of 244 
 
by SARS executive Mr Luther Lebelo in an 
email exchange between myself and the then 
commissioner Mr Tom Moyane and Mr Luther 
Lebelo 
to 
withdraw 
a 
bland 
denial 
of 
wrongdoing based on a leaked report I had 
never ever seen or else face summary 
dismissal.  I withdrew my denial under 
duress.” 
 
You then attached to your affidavit as JVL1 on page 
81 an email string could I take you to that please?   
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  The second email at the second half of the 
page is sent on the 19t h of December 2014 by you to Mr 
Lebelo correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And this relates to leaked to the media of 
the Sikhakhane Report is that right? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The so called Sikhakhane 
Report yes Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  Right.  And we will deal with it in a little 
20 
more detail in due course.  You were implicated in that? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I discovered this in April 2015 
Chairperson when it made public on the Revenue Service 
website. 
ADV FRANKLIN:  And what you said to Mr Lebelo was this: 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 107 of 244 
 
“Following my previous email note my reply 
to the media following various requests and 
based on the fact that the Sikhakhane Report 
has been leaked to the media.” 
And then what follows as I understand it in the quotations is 
the text of a letter that you wished to send to the media 
regarding this matter.  Is that correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I – Chairperson in fact what 
precedes this was me asking permission to respond because 
I am being asked to personally respond they do not want an 
10 
answer from the Revenue Service.  They want an answer 
from me.   
 
So I asked Mr Lebelo copying in Mr Moyane 
whether I can use my constitutional rights to issue something 
because to just keep quiet it is not good for us as the 
Revenue Service or for me.  I received no reply and you will 
see at the time there five minutes to twelve at night I then 
because of the deadline by the newspaper to me that I will 
simply notify Mr Lebelo of what I am saying to the 
newspapers.  And so I took the mid-road.  In other words, I 
20 
did not want to say anything that would breach Chapter 6 
or any of its sections.  I just wanted a denial and some 
level of protection.  That is the context ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Let us then look at the response 
from Mr Lebelo dated the 20 t h of December 2014 which you 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 108 of 244 
 
will find at page 81, the top of the page that we were 
looking at.  He says a number of things but am I right by 
summarising it by saying that if you were to release your 
statements to the media it would be regarded as a gross 
misconduct 
and 
you 
would 
render 
yourself 
liable 
to 
summary dismissal? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson, I was told 
you are not allowed to defend yourself, you are not allowed 
to defend the institution.  You do so and we fire you 
overnight.   
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I ask you to look at the – 
there are further examples that you have put up in your 
statement and the second one is JVL-2 at page 83 and that 
is a letter from attorneys acting on your behalf.  Is that 
correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And could you just explain to the 
Chair what the context of that letter is? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chairperson, the – if I can 
call it the media propaganda attack on the Revenue 
20 
Service, commenced on 12 October 2014.  The headline in 
the newspaper was: SARS Bugged Zuma.  And then it 
contained a whole lot of claims as fact.  And it relied on 
former 
and 
current 
Revenue 
Service 
officials 
and 
intelligence 
officials 
or 
an 
official 
which 
remained 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 109 of 244 
 
unnamed.  They were anonymous sources.   
 
On that point, I attempted to engage with 
Mr Moyane with a view to explain to him clearly the 
Revenue Services are under attack here and clearly there 
is something bigger but I can help to protect the Revenue 
Service.  The annexures I have attached to my affidavit are 
few.   
 
If I had to attach all the evidence of me 
attempting to help the Revenue Service address those 
articles, I would just waste your time Chairperson.  So I 
10 
have elected to just pick a few across the time period. 
 
The 10 t h of November one is one that followed a 
newspaper article, again, with the headline and big photo 
of me that said:  Taxman’s Rogue Unit Ran Brothel.  And 
page 2, page 3 and page 5 and page 6 in the editorial, they 
were all dedicated to telling the country about the small 
little unit and how terrible they were.   
 
It was clear to me that the institution was under 
a very ominous and powerful attack by this time and that is 
why I sought my attorneys to address Commissioner 
20 
Moyane rather than just me because up to that point, I was 
just being plainly ignored.   
 
You will also note Chairperson that I copied the 
then Company Secretary because I wanted the matter on 
record.  The essence of this letter is really to say to the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 110 of 244 
 
Commissioner:  Look, these newspapers are harmful to the 
institution.  They are harmful to me.  I am not allowed to 
defend myself.  Nobody in the Revenue Service is doing 
anything about this.  It is running unabated.  It is all 
nonsense.   
 
I say at paragraph 3 on page 83.  It is the last 
paragraph on the page of my attorney.  It says clearly: 
“Our client is of the view that SARS as an 
institution 
and 
certain 
SARS 
official, 
in 
particular our client, has been subjected to 
10 
consistent scurrilous and defamatory attacks 
that are aimed to discredit them, most notable 
published in article...” 
 
You can read the rest Chair.  I then highlight a 
number of concerning matters to Mr Moyane in this letter 
and then I am now desperate to do something to make this 
stop wherein which I, first of all, deny the allegations as 
they stood up until that time directly or indirectly.  And I 
now wanted to lay criminal charges against the newspaper 
and everybody else who were busy publishing these things. 
20 
 
On page 83 at paragraph 5, right at the bottom 
Chair, I again make the point to Mr Moyane that in terms of 
my arrangement with SARS, I am not allowed to say 
publicly.  So having regard to the persistent and continuing 
defamatory attacks on me in the media, it places me in an 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 111 of 244 
 
unattainable situation because it is just running unabated.   
 
I then ask:   
“Please can I have permission to release a 
single media response...” 
 
It continues on page 85, at the top Chairperson. 
“...to the aforesaid allegations? 
Our client undertakes in this regard to submit 
the statement for approval from SARS and to 
release same via SARS...” 
 
And I had hoped that at that point that the 
10 
Commissioner would agree that if he vets the statement to 
be issued, at least we can protect the institutions and my 
rights.  The last comment was just that I had heard along 
the grapevine that the so-called Sekukane Panel had been 
finalised.   
 
I asserted my right to that report as I was 
entitled to.  In fact, the report is named:  Investigation into 
allegations of conduct of Mr Johannes van Loggerenberg.  
And I asked the Commissioner for a copy of the report.  
Well, this letter was never responded to. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then the third of the annexures that 
you have put up is JVL-3 at page 87.  The letter dated the 
16 t h of October 2014.  And am I correct that this was 
directed to the then Commissioner, Mr Moyane, together 
with a number of others whose names appear on page 86 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 112 of 244 
 
by the six authors of the letter whose names appear on 
page 90? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And can you tell the Chair who are 
those six people?  Were they members of the so-called 
“rogue unit”? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chairperson, they were 
members of the South African Revenue Service High-Risk 
Investigations Unit, dedicated civil servants who had 
placed their lives on the line for many people.  I do not use 
10 
that term that some people use.  I also do not use it as so-
called.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  So the members of that unit 
wrote to Mr Moyane and other senior SARS officials.  We 
not need to read the letter but it looks, in its entirety, as I 
understand it, there were a number of requests which they 
made of the then Commissioner including, for instance, 
bringing legal action against the newspaper.  A request for 
a meeting.  An offer to be polygraphed, et cetera, et 
cetera.  Do you know what happened in response to this 
20 
letter?  Did Mr Moyane address these requests or exceed 
to any of them? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chairperson, if I may just 
very quickly explain the origin of this letter?  This letter is 
the first whistle that was blown at the Revenue Service 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 113 of 244 
 
that we have on record.  As I said earlier in my testimony.  
The first of the vicious media propaganda campaign that 
was aimed at the Revenue Service, commenced on the 
12 t h  of October 2014 with the headline:  SARS Bugged 
Zuma. 
 
Chairperson, if you go to page 91 and 92, you 
will see at 92 it is dated the 13 t h of October.  In other 
words, that would be the Monday of the Sunday Times of 
the publication of that article.  On page 91, it is a message 
from the Commissioner.   
10 
 
This is from Mr Moyane sending an internal 
newsletter to the 14 000 odd people in the Revenue 
Service 
in 
response 
to 
the 
newspaper 
article 
that 
commenced the day before. 
“He starts by asking whether all had seen and 
read the Sunday Times story about SARS 
yesterday.   
Like a bad picture in a negative exposé of 
what we are about.   
In fact, it is a dent our image and our 
20 
reputation before our important stakeholder, 
the South African taxpayer.   
We had lost the moral high ground with these 
serial allegations...” 
 
Mr Moyane accepted that what he read in the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 114 of 244 
 
Sunday Times on the 12 t h of October as fact.  He went 
further.  He then communicated in his position as the 
Commissioner of the institution of which he had only been 
at for less than two weeks.   
 
He say to everybody else in the institution that 
this is so.  The six people on page 90 who made up the full 
complement of the unit that had been defamed in that 
article then addressed the Commissioner, the Deputy 
Commissioner, the Chief Officer of Risk, the Chief Officer 
of 
the 
Tax 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement 
Investigations 
10 
Division, the Group Executive, Mr Godfrey Moloi and the 
acting Group Executive who was standing in, in my place 
and they coordinated collectively in an email and letter 
dated the 16 t h of October.  In other words, three days later. 
 
In this letter, they first of all indicated all the 
claims in the newspaper were false.  They indicated that 
wherever these claims came from, they requested that 
these matters be investigated.  They 
submitted and 
subjected themselves to investigations.  They asked for 
immediate polygraph tests.   
20 
 
They 
also 
asked 
that 
criminal 
charges 
be 
brought and that legal action be taken against the Sunday 
Times.  And they asked for engagement.  They asked for 
the institution to speak to them and defend them. 
 
They also asked that if anybody accused them or 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 115 of 244 
 
made claims against them, that those people do so on oath 
and they requested that they be treated fairly in terms of 
labour practise.  And they asserted their rights to be 
presumed innocent in terms of the Constitution.’ 
 
They 
also 
named 
some 
of 
the 
intelligence 
operatives that they were aware of who were behind some 
of these attacks.  They did not seek any animosity between 
SARS as the employer and themselves.  This is on record. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  If I could ask you, please, to 
then go forward to paragraph 99 on page 39?  And what 
10 
you 
have 
done 
her, 
as 
I 
understand 
it 
Mr 
Van 
Loggerenberg, is you have collected together a very long 
list of the allegations that were out there concerning the 
high-risk unit.  Are these a collection of what was said 
publicly or alleged publicly in connection with that unit? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson, they are – 
the themes, the...  Well, they were not published as 
allegations.  They were published as a fact.  But these 
were the claims that were published, claims made and they 
are sequential in terms of the timeline.   
20 
 
So if you look at 99.1:  Broken into the home of 
former President Zuma.  It would have been the first article 
of 12 October 2014.  Found listening devices in former 
President Zuma’s home.  It would also be that article.  It 
then goes on and ...[intervenes]  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 116 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Mr Franklin, I 
thought you said we should go to 99 but ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, it is paragraph 99, page 
39...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, paragraph 99.  Not page. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I am sorry.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Page 39. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it.   
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   You had pointed out the first 
10 
sub-paragraph Mr Van Loggerenberg. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, Chairperson.  So I just want to 
first illustrate to you that the list which continues for quite 
a few pages makes up the, what I call the media 
propaganda attack on the Revenue Service which span two 
calendar years and run uninterrupted despite all efforts 
and attempts to assist and get to the bottom of this.   
 
The second thing, Chairperson, if I may.  What is 
important to realise here is that the nature of the claims 
are...  I know one should not weigh up crimes but when 
20 
somebody says six people or ten people broke into the 
home of the former President in Forrest Town with that 
specificity and blunt...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, he was current President 
at the time.  In fact ...[intervenes]  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 117 of 244 
 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   In fact I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   ...I think the date of this is 
the time when he was the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  If it is...  Is it not in...  You said 
early 2010 that he was President at the time. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If it was 2007, he was not President yet 
but if it was in 2010, he was.  I am just looking at 
paragraph 99. 
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson.  I am just 
trying to recall the exact wording of the media article.  
They dated the incident to sometime after his acquittal of a 
criminal matter in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   And his election as President 
of the African National Congress.  So that was when the 
incident supposedly happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Which I think would have 
20 
been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   If I am not mistaken, 
Chairperson, it would end 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  At that time, he was not in 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 118 of 244 
 
government. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Now they then say that this – 
these tax officers, Tax and Customs... people broke into 
his home and planted a listening device there and listening 
to him and whoever else.   
 
I am giving you an example, Chair, because 
when this is published, it is now 2014, Mr Zuma is now the 
President of the country.  One would imagine...  This is not 
10 
a report about a custom official taking a bribe to let a 
container of cigarettes come through the board.  This is 
something at a next level.   
 
The response to it is the oddest thing to me.  
These people are not rounded up.  They are not made 
...[indistinct 
– 
dropping 
voice. 
They 
are 
not 
asked 
...[indistinct – dropping voice]  It is nothing.  It is just one 
story after the next, after the next, after the next, after the 
next.   
 
There is no criminal case.  There is no super 
20 
task team assigned to jump on this thing and call these 
people to get to the bottom of it.  Nothing.  It just runs.   
 
Now we know, Chairperson, before – as I sit 
here before you.  We now know this is not true which begs 
the question.  If it was not true, if none of these things are 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 119 of 244 
 
true.  Why?  What were these articles supposed to achieve 
at this institution?  That is my comment Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  And could I take you to 
paragraph 102, please? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   On page 41.  What you say there is: 
“Mr Tom Moyane and various newsletters and 
public 
utterances 
by 
the 
spokesperson, 
Mr Lebelo on behalf of SARS never questioned 
the veracity of these false claims and to the 
10 
extent that they knew that these were false 
and were denied by the entire HRIU on record, 
never revealed the true facts publicly and 
instead opened the advanced false narrative at 
all times...” 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chairperson.  
There are so many examples, like, television interviews 
and radio interviews, news releases, comments, public 
comments.  There are just so many for that entire period.  I 
should just correct this.  The spelling error of Mr Lebelo’s 
20 
surname.  It is one L.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Then you say at 103 up 
to 105: 
“Mr Tom Moyane had absolutely no interest in 
understanding the facts and truth behind any 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 120 of 244 
 
rumour or fake news report about SARS on 
12 October 2014 onwards...” 
 
And then you refer to your annexures. 
“All attempts by me to meet him and to ensure 
that he was fully briefed were either ignored or 
rebuffed. 
I, again, refer to my examples...” 
 
And then you say in 105: 
“It 
was 
absolutely 
clear 
to 
me 
by 
November 2014 that the attacks on SARS and 
10 
the specific persons there suited him and 
others perfectly. 
He 
immediately 
began 
to 
alter 
SARS 
management 
by 
suspending 
the 
Executive 
Committee in November 2014, following the 
fake news headline about brothers being run 
by SARS. 
All executive members of SARS will confirm 
this...” 
 
So again, you have made some hard hitting 
20 
allegations against the former Commissioner.  Would you 
like to add anything to the reasons you have given already 
as to why you formed this conclusion? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I think, Chairperson, if so 
required that I amplify this particular sets of events as I 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 121 of 244 
 
described as a fact, I am happy to do so.  It would mean to 
just go and get some records of the law and so forth.  But 
the fact of the matter is.  As soon as Mr Moyane the story 
started and I have given you examples of where we – we 
could not just say we want to help.  We said in no 
uncertain terms this is wrong.  This is false.  There is an 
attack.  I used the words:  The institution is under attack.  
He did not speak to a single one of us.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean that despite these serious 
allegations appearing in a newspaper or newspapers over a 
10 
certain period of time, allegations being made against 
officials within SARS, never called any of those officials 
against whom allegations were made in the newspapers, to 
find out what you have to say about this, nor did he ever 
send a note or email to say:  I want to hear what you have 
to say about these allegations? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chairperson, there was no need.  
They wrote to him on the 16 t h of October.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   If I can take you to the...   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess, you – it looks like your 
answer is yes but in addition, you want to tell me the 
officials actually wrote to him? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   They begged him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 122 of 244 
 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I want to just, if I may Chair.  
There 
is 
one 
small 
little 
portion 
I 
want 
to 
just 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what page? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   It is ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Are you talking about the Annexure 3 
at page ...[intervenes]  
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   The L3’s. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, the L3, page 86. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what part of the letter do you 
wish to ...[intervenes]  
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBERG: 
 
 
It 
will 
at 
page 
88 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, go ahead. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Now at this point, they are 
only responding to what has been reported in the media as 
up until that date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBERG: 
 
 
They 
say 
to 
the 
20 
Commissioner: 
“We wish to emphatically deny the specific 
allegations that we were ever involved in 
illegal interceptions of communications in any 
way 
or 
form 
including 
emails 
and 
phone 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 123 of 244 
 
calls...” 
 
Then they go on with this emphatic denial.  The 
so-called 
house 
penetrations, 
illegal 
surveillance, 
investigation in any manner or form, any of the taxpayers 
mentioned in the Sunday Times articles at any time.  
Specifically, 
Messrs 
Malema, 
Mbalula, 
Kodwa 
and 
Hlongwane.    
“We deny that we were paid from a secret cost 
centre...” 
 
And they give the cost centre. 
10 
“We deny having ever conducted mail theft and 
utilising illegal tracking devices. 
We deny that we ever bugged President Zuma 
or that we have ever been near his home in 
Forrest Town. 
We place on record that we have never 
received or possessed any equipment of any 
nature that would have been used in illegal 
activities as described above. 
We object to the implied suggestion that the 
20 
internal 
communiqué 
in 
SARS 
dated 
13 October 2014, as attached, which seems to 
create 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
media 
allegations are fact and that we were rogue 
elements in SARS...” 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 124 of 244 
 
 
I think that is a typo.   
“In particular, we emphatically the allegation 
that 
we 
possessed 
or 
used 
fake 
identity 
documents as stated...” 
 
And so it goes on Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   My point is.  When you open 
the 
newspaper 
and 
you 
read 
something 
about 
this 
Commission that suggests that the people here in this 
Commission are up to no good.  One would imagine some 
10 
kind of response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBERG: 
 
 
Not 
only 
from 
the 
Commissioner, but also those people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   If they keep quiet and hide 
away.  Well...  But if they write something and put it on 
record that ask the Commissioner to please...  this is... 
here is a problem.  We are under attack.  Please, we need 
to do things.  We need to lay criminal charges.  Somebody 
20 
needs to investigate us.  We want to go on polygraph tests 
and so on.  But nothing of it, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   In fact, the next story comes 
which is the brother and the very next day the Executive 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 125 of 244 
 
Committee is suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there was never a response to this 
letter, the joint ...[intervenes]  
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it emailed to the Commissioner?  
Was it hand delivered or how was it? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   It was emailed to all the 
recipients identified on... 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that it is appears to...  Oh, it is 
addressed to a number of people.   
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were – they all held various 
positions 
within 
SARS, 
the 
people 
to 
whom 
it 
was 
addressed, except for – Mr Moyane was the Commissioner, 
obviously.   
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then the next one was Mr Pillay, who 
was Deputy Commissioner.  The others were officials within 
SARS. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   They were part of the 
20 
component that this unit resorted under.  So they were part 
of different levels of management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I think they wanted to make 
sure that this is on record. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 126 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Okay.  So you say there was 
no response to the letter, either by way of something in 
writing or a phone call to call a meeting, either individuals 
or the whole group to take the matter further? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No, Chair.  I mean, at the 
very least, one would have expected the Revenue Service 
would hold a public:  Look, we have noted the articles.  We 
view them as very serious.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   We have, in the meantime, 
10 
received denials from these people and we are looking into 
the matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Something like that but there 
was none of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   In fact, I followed this up in... 
[end of recording session]  So there are also emails from 
me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   ...which I wanted hand 
delivered to Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   ...because I went into greater 
detail. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 127 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That also found its way into 
the - the media calling it a confession but everybody, 
ultimately, apologised to me and said it was not a 
compression, it was a denial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   And so...  I can keep you 
very busy Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Which I do not want to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  It is fine. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   The point is simple that the 
institution is under a significant media attack.  You need to 
respond to the media.  You cannot let this continue.  It is 
now making the whole institution look terrible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Thank you, Mr Van 
Loggerenberg. 
 As 
it 
transpires, 
as 
you 
will 
know, 
subsequent to these events and as recently as December 
of last year, various components of the narrative in relation 
20 
to the high-risk investigative unit have been dismantled or 
there had been definitive findings in respect of..  We will 
get to that in due course.   
 
But it is a matter of public record, for instance, 
that 
the 
Sunday 
Times 
withdrew 
their 
allegations 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 128 of 244 
 
unconditionally.  And that most recently, the full bench of 
the Gauteng Division of the High Court has issued a 
judgment in relation to the lawfulness of the unit.  You are 
obviously aware of that? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Well, Chairperson, there is a 
very long list, which I again, do not want you to keep you 
occupied with.  I want to say the following in respect of 
what Mr Franklin has asked of me.  It is so that the full 
court made the decision.   
 
Well, issued the judgment in which - within the 
10 
judgment it also said that the manner in which the Public 
Protector 
determined 
that 
the 
unit 
was 
established 
unlawfully was wrong, it was flawed.   
 
But that is what we are down to.  We are down to 
how a unit was created.  I want to know about who are the 
people that started this what we have bugged Zuma and 
broke into homes and...  So it has reduced to that now.  It 
is what is left.   
 
The 
Sunday 
Times, 
actually, 
retracted 
and 
apologised twice, Chair.  The second time was in 2018 and 
20 
they went a step further.  They admitted that they had been 
used as 
part 
of a project to cause harm to state 
institutions.   
 
There is a recent independent media panel that 
was instituted by the South African National Editors Forum 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 129 of 244 
 
chaired by a retired Justice Cathleen Satchwell and to 
assess it.  It is going there of what happened.  It is going 
there.   
 
I, again, I can go into lots of detail.  I mean, one 
of the common issues is the question of how come the so-
called Sekukane Panel report was never taken on review 
and set aside in a court of law.  We tried to do that. 
 
Senior counsel told us, you cannot because this 
not an administrative action.  This is just a document.  A 
legal opinion and it is a bad one.  You cannot.  You waste 
10 
the court’s time and your money.   
 
So the whole propaganda, as far as I am 
concerned Chair is, it is not worth putting people through 
trauma again.  Ja.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Mr Van Loggerenberg, in 
due course, if and when we introduce another affidavit of 
yours.  You have very helpfully collected together 53 
different episodes in relation to the undoing of this 
narrative.  We will place that before the Commission in due 
course.   
20 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...we normally take a ten minutes’ 
adjournment at four but I have been thinking whether we 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 130 of 244 
 
should take it earlier because we started earlier than two. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, it would be convenient.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, let us take a ten minutes’ 
adjournment.  So we will resume at ten to four. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, you, Chair, Mr van 
Loggerenberg, you had given us a detailed account of the 
issues in relation to the high risk investigation unit and you 
have also outlined the attacks on SARS and their growing 
intensity, as you see it, towards the latter part of your 
tenure.  Can I now take you to the section in your affidavit 
which is headed: 
“The reasons for the attacks and capture of SARS” 
Which starts on page 42. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what you – the point you make 
in para 106 is a very important one so let me just read it 
out: 
“I am advised that I am not allowed to elaborate on 
audits, 
financial 
investigations 
or 
criminal 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 131 of 244 
 
investigations by SARS as they are subject to 
Chapter 6 of the Tax Administration Act of 2011.  I 
am quite capable of doing so, if authorised.  To the 
extent that I am lawfully allowed to do so because 
this information is in the public domain, I set out 
only these under this heading.” 
So what you have produced for the Commission, as I 
understand it, is information which is in the public domain, 
you are not here revealing anything which is the subject of 
Chapter 6 of the TAA.  Is that your intention? 
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson, I just want 
to make a very clear point on this, if I may, Chair?  When I 
say in the public domain it does not necessarily mean 
people can read about it in the newspapers, the clause in 
the secrecy – regulation secrecy clause in the Tax 
Administration Act allows one to share information  in the 
course and scope of their duty and by virtue of that it 
became public so if I, for instance, as a SARS officers had 
to go and register a criminal case with the police or – then 
it also becomes public, then it is no longer protected.  
20 
Thank you, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Please turn to page 43, 
paragraph 108.  You say: 
“I state this...” 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 132 of 244 
 
Sorry, let me go back to 107 otherwise it does not make 
sense.  You say: 
“I wish to reiterate that what I list here are 
examples and not in any way a full and complete 
views of all such types of cases.  I respectfully 
submit to the Commission that this part of my 
submission is a but a snippet of a much larger tale.  
Some aspects are interconnected whereas others 
are not.  The commonality is that these cases 
stepped on powerful toes, caused various persons 
10 
to attack SARS in various ways as set out above all 
aimed in one way or another to cause disarray at 
SARS.” 
And then 108: 
“I state this since these matters resorted under 
PEMTS and my oversight and have been brought to 
a halt and taken no further since 2014 following the 
events of capturing SARS.” 
So just stopping, you have given a number of examples of 
improper perhaps unlawful conduct in paragraph 108.1 to 
20 
108.20 and what you say is that attempts to address this 
misconduct have come to a have not been progressed 
further since 2014.  Is that what you are saying here? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 133 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, it is not necessary to go into 
all of the details but could I just highlight certain of them 
and we can take them as broad categories without going 
into the specifics.  Let us take 108.7 as an example.  You 
say there that: 
“Various investigations by SARS into politically 
connected persons and entities have been ceased 
and taken no further since 2014.” 
Is that your understanding? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then 108.17 which is – you have 
talked about a project Honey Badger which focuses on the 
tobacco trade.  We will go to that in due course but is it 
your evidence that the various projects under project 
Honey Badger have not progressed in any meaningful way, 
as you understand it, from about this in 2014? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson, if I may, 
108.17 and 108.3 on page 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you earlier say 108.17? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson.  So it is 
20 
the paragraph just quoted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Which relates to project 
Honey Badger focusing on the tobacco trade and the fact 
that I am saying it came to a halt.  If you go to page 43 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 134 of 244 
 
paragraph 108.3, there I speak of evidence uncovered in 
2013 and 2014 implicating inter alia members of – I give an 
acronym there but it is Anti-Illicit Tobacco Task Team, 
Hawks, National Prosecuting Authority, State Security 
Agency, South African Police Service, Crime Intelligence, 
private tobacco manufacturer British American Tobacco 
South Africa, a private security firm, forensic security 
services and state intelligence offices and so on, I go on, 
and then I mention the serious offences.  That would be 
part of the reason why I say at 108.17 nothing happens. 
10 
 
Now I was provided with a document yesterday by 
my attorneys which forms part of the list of documents that 
I provided to your Commission, Chairperson, that request 
for records from the South African Revenue Service which 
would enable me to support what I have submitted to you, 
Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, that has been added to SARS 
bundle 02 and it is page 865. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Sorry, 865 of which bundle? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Just hang on, we have just added it 
20 
so give me a moment please?  Yes, you will see that SARS 
bundle 02 has as EXHIBIT WW5 a correspondence section.  
If you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Franklin, you said? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is SARS bundle 02. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 135 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And it is in the correspondence 
section which is EXHIBIT WW5 and it is page 865. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is that the – that is a covering letter 
from SARS and then at page 867 and following is a 
document.  Is that the document you are referring to? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So this was received from SARS and 
you 
had 
requested 
certain 
information 
and 
this 
in 
10 
information  provided by SARS.  Can you just identify on 
page 87, it is a document which is headed criminal and 
illicit economic activities interoffice memorandum, project 
Honey Badger pictorial overview and then the content of 
the document really starts on page 868.  Chair, would you 
just give me a moment to confer? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am sorry about that.  Chair, for 
reasons which I will explain later, I do not want to proceed 
to deal with this document now. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Alright.  Well, other than 
that, Chair, the point I wanted to make is then without 
referring to that document, if I am allowed to still make the 
point. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 136 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Is that it is quite clear to me 
that based on what I was provided a few days ago that 
nothing happened. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, well let us go into that in 
some more detail.  We were at paragraph 114 page 54 of 
your affidavit and that is a section of your affidavit headed: 
“Case study tobacco industry” 
And you have taken that as a case study because this is 
one of the 87 projects that resorted under you.   You 
10 
explained that Honey Badger on its own is a single project 
and that there are many, many subcomponents to it and 
you have told the Commission that you have had a 
complete view of the entire project and you were what is 
known as the project owner, so you are well-placed to talk 
about Honey Badger. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please would you look at paragraph 
124, 125 and 126?  What you do there is to give the 
Commission a sense of the quantum of the election of 
20 
excise duties from local tobacco manufacturers and would 
you take the Commission through those paragraphs and 
just illustrate the point that you are making in relation to 
the quantum of excise over those periods? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 137 of 244 
 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chairperson, the cigarette 
industry in particular, which is a sub-element of the 
tobacco trade or sector, has always been a problem and 
government has been losing a lot of money and those 
legitimate businesses have suffered also.   
 
2011/2012 fiscal year, the revenue service collected 
R10.8 billion in excise duty which is the specific tax levied 
on cigarettes from the sector.  When the Minister does the 
– usually the February budget speech he always talks 
about – or she maybe, hopefully in the future – will talk 
10 
about sin taxes and you will always hear some murmurs in 
the crowd when it comes to alcohol or cigarettes, it is that 
tax excise.   
 
So in the fiscal year ‘11/’12 the revenue serviced 
collected R10.8 billion in excise from the tobacco sector.  
Now in the following year – and this is attributable to all 
the activities in the Revenue Service, including Honey 
Badger, it went up to 11.5 billion for the fiscal year 
2013/’14.  For the fiscal ‘14/’15 it went up to 13.1 billion.  
What this shows is for the period of Honey Badger 
20 
operating there was a 15% year on year increase in excise 
flow of money coming into the Revenue Service attributable 
to just this small sector in our economy.  So it was an 
upwards growth. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 138 of 244 
 
 
Now of course I am only talking about excise tax, 
with 
that 
automatically, 
Chairperson, 
will 
be 
the 
consequence Value Added Tax, Income Tax, Payroll Tax, 
Fuels Development Levy, Unemployment Insurance Fund 
contributions monthly and so for.  So it just be seen as a 
broad indicator and not the full number, it would need more 
granularity to give you the full figure. 
 
Somewhere in my affidavit I make the point that we 
did a test in December and January, December 2013 and 
January 2014, to measure whether Honey Badger had any 
10 
effect at all in this upward scale and the analysts at the 
Revenue Service, they worked very hard, took into account 
not just the sales of cigarettes and the excise and so on 
but also the importation of subcomponents of cigarettes 
like what they call filter rods, those are the things they cut 
to put at the end of the cigarette, that is the filter, the 
paper, the ink that they use to print the packets and so 
forth and the figure was published, it went up by 25%.  The 
illicit component of the total industry as whole was not just 
halted because it was in absolute upward curve, we turned 
20 
it back which meant that where people were cheating the 
system before they were now actually voluntarily complying 
and voluntarily paying their money to the Revenue Service 
without us having to knock on their door. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 139 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You have given us those figures and 
then, could I ask you by way of contrast to then look at 
paragraph 137 on page 57 and you had spoken about the 
10.8 billion, the 11.5 billion and the 13.1 billion over the 
periods 
2011/’12, 
2013/14 
and 
2014/’5. 
 
And 
what 
happened then in relation to the period 2015/’16 and 
2017/’18? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Well, Chairperson, I mean, 
such a dramatic figure, I had to really check it properly and 
I asked academics to help me check this.  The very next 
10 
year dropped by 15% which is significant.   
 
The following year it dropped by a further 15%.  I 
am not sure if I quote the figures here of the percentage of 
the illicit component of the industry but it shot up to 30% 
which meant …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is in circumstances where for 
about three financial years or so before 2015 it was going 
up. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chair, we were winning 
that war.  The people, the few people, I must tell you, 
20 
because it is not many people, they were really, really 
making an impact.  In fact I can tell you, Chair, we had  
well-known tobacco manufacturers coming to us telling us 
look, we know you are coming for – we are in trouble, we 
want to fix it. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 140 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are not even talking about a 
situation where after that year on year increase that was 
happening over a certain period of time to the 2015/2016 
year, you are not even talking about a stagnation, you are 
talking about a decrease after that. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And a significant decrease. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   15% year on year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   The inverse of that is that 
10 
the illicit part of the economy shot up to further the market, 
I mean you can equate it to every third cigarette you 
bought was crooked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Then please look at 
page 58 paragraph 138 where you say at the time that you 
resigned from SARS: 
“Honey Badger had promised to collect at least R3 
billion extra in excise taxes as well as additional 
income and other tax types or noncompliant and 
20 
criminal manufacturers and role-players identified 
would have been made to be compliant going 
forward by one way or another as allowed for in 
legislation administered by SARS.  In this regard, in 
some 
cases, 
these 
processes 
had 
already 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 141 of 244 
 
commenced by way of full disclosure of some that 
were under investigation.” 
Then 139: 
“There were also a number of ongoing efforts to 
identify assets and conduct audits of entities and 
individuals as well as a number of criminal cases, 
none of which I have seen to have been concluded 
ever since.” 
That you confirm the accuracy of that? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Absolutely, Chair.  I should 
10 
say at the end of the fiscal year ‘14/’15, Chair, which is the 
so-called “1 trillion year”.  Should have had at 1.3, that 
money was not collected.  I can also maybe add there, 
Chairperson, there is one particular case that I am very 
familiar with, where – which I put to SARS actually in late 
2014 in Mr Moyane’s time to Advocate Sikhakhane SC and 
it was a serious case where I believed we could collect 
R600 million in a fairly short space of time and the people 
who had committed that fraud and also corrupted one of 
our officials in the process admitted to this and they were 
20 
prepared to accept guilt, pay the monies and even plead 
guilty in a criminal court.  That is how we had them red-
handed.  I know for a fact that matter went nowhere, 
absolutely nowhere. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 142 of 244 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Mr van Loggerenberg what you have 
done for purposes of your evidence is you have referred 
the Commission to various cases and you have called them 
case 1, case 2, case 3, etcetera.  We need not go into the 
details of any of them but am I correct that there is a 
familiar refrain in these cases and it is in essence, let us 
take case 2, paragraph 155, page 61: 
“To the best of my knowledge this part of Honey 
Badger effectively came to a halt sometime in late 
2014 or early 2015.” 
10 
And we see that in case 3 as well and case 4 and other 
cases that you have highlighted.  So to your knowledge am 
I correct that these cases were live projects, were live at 
the time that you were at SARS but you have since leaving 
seen no evidence of them having progressed any further, is 
that correct? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson, I have 
also seen evidence now – I think I am not allowed to refer 
to it but I have also now seen formal confirmation by the 
Revenue Service themselves to that effect.  I should just, 
20 
Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, you said 
something when you were facing Mr Franklin and I do not 
think it would have been recorded.  Do you want to repeat  
your answer?  Just make sure that you speak loudly. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 143 of 244 
 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   A bit louder. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because when you speak from 
…[intervenes] 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Oh, when I turn my face?  I 
am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, then it is not recorded.  In the 
transcript it will be written inaudible. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I am very sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I am not used to… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to just repeat that answer? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chairperson, there is a 
document that I have seen which was provided to the 
Commission which I am not allowed to… 
CHAIRPERSON:   To talk about. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Talk to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, talk to. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   But I cannot un-see it, I have 
seen it, it was also provided to my attorneys and I studied 
it.  So I do not want to make life difficult for any of the 
20 
parties involved, I just want to say that over and above 
what I have said to you now, Chairperson, which is to 
confirm that nothing happened between 2014 to date, I 
have now also seen evidence from the Revenue Service 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 144 of 244 
 
that that is the case, nothing happened between 2014 to 
date.  Nothing.  
 
I just want to also add, Mr Franklin highlights one 
common denominator between all these cases, which is 
that they all came to a halt in and around 2014, late 2014.  
There are three other common denominators which I would 
like to, Chairperson, just highlight to you. 
 
One is that virtually every single one of them have 
connections to politicians and politics, all of them relate to 
sophisticated 
and 
complicated 
criminal 
schemes, 
10 
racketeering would be the offence. 
 
And 
then 
fourthly, 
all 
of 
them 
have 
state 
intelligence operatives’ footprints all over them.  I just 
want to highlight that to you, Chairperson. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then, Mr van Loggerenberg, if we 
could go to the section of your affidavit headed “Inclusion” 
you have made various statements there but could I ask 
you to look at paragraphs 208 and 209 in particular.  You 
say: 
“There is also no doubt in my mind that Mr Tom 
20 
Moyane had a clear brief to restructure SARS and 
dismantle its enforcement capabilities as soon as 
possible.  This was evident to me from inter alia his 
promotion of the false claims and attacks on SARS, 
his inactivity to protect SARS as to be an institution 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 145 of 244 
 
and employees affected despite my please and 
begging him, his and Mr Luther Lebelo’s public 
statements and newsflashes issued at the time in 
his name.” 
You refer again to your annexures.  And then in 209: 
“The net effect of dismantling PEMTS in particular 
was that all the cases I have described here as well 
as many I cannot, have all been negatively affected 
in one way or another either by slowing them down, 
closing 
them 
completely, 
allowing 
insight 
into 
10 
SARS’ evidence and giving those subjects under 
investigation an advantage over SARS which has 
ultimately led to SARS having no real effective 
means to address the illicit economy or organised 
crime from a tax and customs’ perspective.” 
So just pausing there, you talk about the dismantling of 
PEMTS, can you explain what you are describing there? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chairperson, it was 
dismantled, it was brought to a close in a very short space 
of time.  I should just perhaps repeat, Chairperson, if need 
20 
be, I say in my affidavit I keep my whole affidavit narrow 
and to the point and I have a long tale to tell and I am 
known to be longwinded too, should there be any need for 
further examples or evidence, I am very happy to make it 
available to people at the Commission at your direction, 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 146 of 244 
 
Chair.  It is common cause, I have read the affidavits of Mr 
Mazzone submitted to the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Bain? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, Chair.  He was the head 
of Bain South Africa at the time when they provided 
services to the Revenue Service but I can just tell you, 
Chair, I – when I ...[indistinct – word cut] service I would 
have still expected to see some people appear before 
Court, some detentions, some seizures, none of that 
happened.  In fact, I had conversations and received phone 
10 
calls from the bad guys celebrating – “sjoe we got away, 
we are so lucky you’re gone”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   And I mean some of these 
people I discussed these things with many years later when 
I wrote a book on the subject on tobacco in South Africa 
and I got the opportunity to sit down with them and I got 
really into the detail of what went down and they were all 
very, very happy when this came to an end. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you – sorry Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Franklin I see in paragraph 205 
of Mr van Loggerenburg’s affidavit that he clearly says he 
knows various persons who were involved in what seems to 
be clear criminal activity, but he says he believes he’s not 
allowed to name them, but I think he says if he’s given 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 147 of 244 
 
legal authority to name them, he would have no difficulty.  I 
assume that he is not talking about people who he 
protected in terms of the identity via the Intelligence Act, is 
he talking about people because whatever he says may 
disclose their personal tax information? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is as I understand it.  So, 
there’s two categories, people whose identities cannot be 
revealed and the second is people whose information 
cannot be revealed without the authority of SARS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And, Chair, so that’s perhaps a good 
point at which to come in and say, that’s as far as we can 
take Mr van Loggerenburg’s testimony now.  He has 
produced 
an 
affidavit 
which 
answers 
certain 
of 
the 
allegations made by Mr Moyane against him.  Because of 
the same constraints as held us up this morning we cannot 
– we do not feel it would be right to introduce that now.  
The document which we got from SARS we would also like 
to make doubly sure can be produced but what I would ask, 
and I would hope that Mr van Loggerenburg is able to 
20 
corroborate on this score is that we end his testimony now, 
or for the present, but that we ask for an opportunity, and it 
ought not to take very long, at some point over the next 
few weeks where we can complete that part of the 
testimony which will be the introduction of his affidavit and 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 148 of 244 
 
the introduction of the document from SARS so that he is 
able, properly to explain everything in those affidavits and 
that  affidavit as well but we would want to make certain 
that it proper to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that would be in order.  Can 
I find out, Mr van Loggerenburg, whether the information 
you are talking about in paragraph 205 in your affidavit and 
maybe elsewhere in your affidavit which you can’t disclose 
because it would contravene the tax legislation, I take it 
it’s obvious that it would be – it doesn’t prevent you from 
10 
disclosing that information to the Commissioner of SARS, 
isn’t it? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   No, not at all Chair, in fact 
the Commissioner would be aware, and it’s included in the  
long list of information that I indicated that I would have 
liked and simply, Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me tell you what my question 
is, whether the current Commissioner of SARS or staff 
under him are aware of the information you have which 
relates to allegations of criminal activities by certain 
20 
people that you can’t disclose publicly?  In other words, 
can I have the confidence that SARS is aware of the 
information you have and that they should be working on 
those matters. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   I can’t say Chair. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 149 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t say it later. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Let me rather not commit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but in terms of them knowing the 
information are you able to say you know that they know 
the information that you have, that you talked about? 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   It’s been there all along, I 
have not seen them act on it Chair, had they…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of knowing – the same 
information 
that 
you 
know 
because 
the 
current 
Commissioner of SARS is what, two years, in office or so. 
10 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   I’m not sure of the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he has not been there for a long 
time, I would imagine that he might be interested in 
pursuing any criminal – any allegations of criminal activity. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   Chairperson, at the end of 
my affidavit, I took liberty to recommend certain things 
because of my long tales. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR VAN LOGGERENBURG:   He suggests something along 
those lines, that nothing ought to prevent the revenue 
20 
service, the State Security Agency, the Inspector General 
of Intelligence and so forth, in the meantime to contact me 
and I will certainly help them because then you won’t have 
the restrictions I have now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no I understand…[intervenes]. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 150 of 244 
 
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBURG: 
 
 
And 
I 
do 
believe, 
Chairperson, that 2. – 205, which you highlight is just one 
of those matters that I so dearly wish I could have sat here 
and testified today because it would have really related to 
evidence you have heard before in this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay, alright.  They have heard 
you, I would imagine that you are available all they need to 
do is contact you and you will assist, ja, okay, alright.  
Thank you very much Mr van Loggerenburg for availing 
yourself to assist the Commission we appreciate it very 
10 
much.  I hear from Mr Franklin that, in all probability you’ll 
be coming back with regard to the other affidavits but 
thank you very much for availing yourself, you are now 
excused. 
MR 
VAN 
LOGGERENBURG: 
 
 
Thank 
you 
for 
the 
opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, that concludes the SARS work 
stream for now as the Chair will know we have to finish Mr 
van Loggerenburg, of course Mr Moyane was due to appear 
20 
today to be questioned but is ill and so arrangements will 
need to be made for him to come back on another 
occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And if I may, I will make contact with 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 151 of 244 
 
the Commission in order to try to set up the appropriate 
arrangements for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is, it for now, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, we are going to 
adjourn the day session of the hearing for about 15 
minutes and then I will come back and then we will start 
the evening session.  I will be hearing the evidence of Mr 
Anoj Singh in the evening session, we adjourn.

ANOJ SINGH:  (d.s.s)

ADV

My

UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  Good afternoon Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Again Advocate Annaline van den 
Heever.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Duly instructed by Mr Tshepo 
20 
Matsopo, Matsope Attorneys.  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  I understand Chair, 
the parties have exchanged some latest affidavits, but we 
will deal with them in due course.  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 153 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not think they will stand in the way 
of Mr Singh testifying today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what you may wish to do is just to 
remind the public where we were with Mr Singh’s evidence 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Last time and from where we will 
continue ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we will cover today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Last time when Mr Singh was 
here, 
he 
testified 
in 
regard 
to 
his 
secondment 
and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to say Mr Seleka before you 
proceed, if your voice could remain as loud as that for the 
rest of the evening that would be excellent.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  The personality 
comes in, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the problem, if you compliment 
20 
somebody or praise them, then they change.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Ja, last time Mr Singh testified 
or lead, his evidence was lead in regard to his secondment 
and we also went into the issues pertaining to Trillian 
McKinsey or McKinsey Regiments and in respect of that we 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 154 of 244 
 
led Mr Singh’s evidence on the corporate plan.   
 
There is the corporate plan, there is the master 
service agreement.  We started on the corporate plan and 
we have to finalise that before we move to the master 
service agreement and we will then be left once we have 
dealt with those two matters pertaining to McKinsey 
Regiments 
and 
Trillian 
we 
will 
be 
left 
with 
Tegeta 
transactions, which are the pre-payments of the 1.68 
billion rand, the 659 million rand and then the 2.17 billion 
rand penalties. 
10 
 
Ja, I think we will try to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  If you think of something else you will 
add it later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will add it.  I hope my learned friend 
will not jump up.  Mr Singh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And say you did not mention that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct.  Mr Singh, I want to 
start you know so that we complete the Regiments issue.  
Remember last time when you were leading the, testifying 
on this, there was an issue about who rendered the 
20 
services in respect of the corporate plan.  
 
A couple of things I want to, I want us to clarify 
before we move on and to do that I want to turn firstly to 
your affidavit which is the second affidavit in Eskom 
Bundle 16.  Eskom Bundle 16, this is Exhibit U37.2, and I 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 155 of 244 
 
would like you to turn specifically to page 755.   
 
Page 755, follow the black numbers.  It is way, way 
to the back.  So Mr Singh, what we are trying to establish 
from the evidence is whether the party that rendered 
services in respect of the corporate plan is Regiments or 
Trillian.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Or none of the above.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are, do you want me to do that 
exercise based on I think what you might have read prior to 
coming here again, because the evidence that I am about 
10 
to show you indicated that Regiments is the one that  
rendered services in respect of the corporate plan.   
MR SINGH:  Okay Mr Chair, well then let us lead the 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again? 
MR SINGH:  I said let us lead the evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us lead the evidence, okay.  So let 
us look at paragraph 24 of your affidavit on page 755 and 
just for context, you are dealing here with the 1.68 billion 
rand submission to the board that is prepared in December 
20 
2015 and in paragraph 24 you say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Jus a second.  Remind everybody 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that about.  So, ja. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 156 of 244 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  That 1.6 billion rand submission 
Chair, which we will come to when we deal with Tegeta 
because I am going to be referring to these paragraphs for 
a different purpose.  It was a submission made by Mr Singh 
and Mr Koko for the board to make a decision in respect of 
a recommendation to make, to resolve to make a decision a 
pre-payment to now [indistinct] which one were you 
seeking to have paid this 1.6 billion. 
 
The board said they understood you to mean Glenco 
OCM 
should 
get 
that 
amount. 
 
You 
will 
give 
the 
10 
Chairperson in due course your version of who you had in 
mind for the board to make that decision in respect of, but 
we will come to that.   
 
For 
present 
purposes 
Chair, 
I 
want 
to 
just 
demonstrate ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Mr Singh’s evidence as to who 
even on his version was actually working in respect of the 
corporate plan.  Mr Singh, then paragraph 24 you say: 
 
“I recall that at the time Koko pressed the 
20 
urgency of the suspension, the submission on 
me, 
which 
in 
turn 
caused 
me 
once 
the 
submission was presented, to me to engage 
Eric Woods of Regiments.” 
 
This is in December 2015: 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 157 of 244 
 
 
“For 
the 
reasons 
set 
out 
below. 
 
The 
engagement of Wood was important in that the 
financial implications originally included in the 
submission were clearly not dually considered 
by Koko and Daniels.  Therefore I requested 
Wood to attend to the issue of the financial 
implications 
of 
the 
transaction 
in 
the 
submission.  Wood at the time was involved 
with 
the 
cash 
unlocking 
initiatives, 
with 
reference to the corporate plan of the financial 
10 
implications of such a transaction.  I recall 
that 
I 
received 
the 
amended 
submission 
electronically from Regiments as I was not in 
the office at the time.  I instructed my Maya 
Balmer to affect my electronic signature to the 
document and forward it to Daniels.” 
 
So Mr Singh what I read here is a clear indication 
on your part of your knowledge that even as at December 
2015, it was in fact Eric Wood of Regiments who was 
rendering services in respect of the corporate plan.  The 
20 
funding plan for the corporate plan. 
 
So you could not be mistaken whether it is Trillian 
or Regiments.  You knew exactly that it was Regiments.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think I do not think we ever 
disputed the fact that it was Regiments or Trillian and 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 158 of 244 
 
hence we used ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, no.  Mr Seleka is not saying 
Regiments or Trillian. 
MR SINGH:  No, no I am coming ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He is saying Regiments.  
MR SINGH:  Yes, and I agree that the document mentions 
Regiments.  If you look at the email that came from Mr 
Wood for anyone for that matter, it would have been 
Regiments email and what is always the contention is 
whether the individuals at that time were subject to the 
10 
navigator secondment agreement between Regiments and 
Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Singh, no.  We spent a lot of time 
last time when you were here, on the question of who 
provided the services.  That is what Mr Seleka is talking 
about.  
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You say last time you did not want to say 
it was Regiments and I think he may be saying you wanted 
to say it was Trillian, maybe Regiments and Trillian but I 
20 
seem to recall that at a certain stage it appears you seem 
to be saying Trillian but he is now saying your own affidavit 
makes it clear that it was Regiments.   
 
Do you accept that it was Regiments who provided 
the services? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 159 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You say correct? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Then Mr Singh, I do not 
even need to refer you to the affidavit of Mr, what is his 
name?  Amang Koa which was McKinsey’s official who 
submitted a statement to the commission because he also 
10 
says the same thing.  That it was Regiments that rendered 
the services in respect of the corporate plan. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Chair, I have not seen that affidavit, so 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a statement, yes.  
MR SINGH:  Really? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, he had not seen it but if it 
says what he says it says, you have no problem with it. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson, sorry to interrupt 
you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  We were this morning at 08H49 
forwarded an email with a number of attachments.  The 
statement that my learned friend is referring to, is one of 
those.  My instructing attorney have written a letter to the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 160 of 244 
 
commission and I have discussed it with my learned friend.  
 
We want the opportunity to have regard to this 
statement before we deal with the content thereof.  It is a 
61 page statement ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fair enough. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Containing a vast amount of 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And I think in fairness before my 
client needs to concede, as per the question of my learned 
10 
friend, the issues pertaining to that I think he should be 
afforded the opportunity to have regard to the statement, 
duly consider it and consult on it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine, but I guess what 
you have no objection to is the question that says if that 
affidavit says what Mr Seleka says it says, as to who 
provided the services you would have no problem with that 
part of it. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson, we still have a 
problem with it.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You still have a problem with it? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  I still have a problem and I will 
explain to Chairperson why I have a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not worry. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Because you will recall from the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 161 of 244 
 
last time Chairperson, that there were certain statements 
made to my client without referring him to the exact 
paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  That leads to confusion and 
incorrect statements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no but I am on your side.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying do not worry to argue it, let it 
be dealt with after you have had a chance to consult with 
10 
your client.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  We are indebted to you 
Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Chair, I was even making a more 
substantive point which is to the extent that he concedes it 
is Regiments that rendered services.  Then I do not need 
to refer to this statement.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think they have a problem, so 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let them get a chance to look at it with 
its client and then it can be dealt with later. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson, again I apologise 
for 
interrupting. 
 
My 
learned 
friend 
stating 
that 
he 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 162 of 244 
 
conceded Regiments rendered the services is incorrect.  
He conceded that he mentioned the word Regiments in this 
affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, no, no, no.  When I put the 
question, 
he 
conceded 
that 
Regiments 
rendered 
the 
services.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson, we will deal with it 
in due course.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh, so I know 
10 
the difficulty is the payment of the 30.6 million rand, 
because one entity rendered services, the invoice came 
from a different entity which is Trillian.  The invoice came 
to you and you ensured that that invoice was paid to 
Trillian but not to Regiments.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to confirm whether that is 
true? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think he is waiting to see what 
is the question. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes, do you confirm that that is 
correct Mr Singh?   
MR SINGH:  No sir, that is not correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you did not pay Trillian 30.6 million 
rand for services rendered by Regiments? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 163 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  What did you do? 
MR SINGH:  I did not ensure that the invoice was paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that is the part that you were talking 
about.  
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, the ensuring part.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So when the invoice came to 
you, what did you do with it? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I do not have a recollection of what I 
10 
exactly did with the invoice, but I think in testimony that we 
led the previous time, we went through an entire process, 
that that invoice would have went through for validation 
and verification before it was paid.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what you said was that the 
invoice came to you, and there was nothing wrong with it 
coming to you because of the position you occupied in 
relation to the project and you passed it on to the relevant 
people to process.  
 
I think that is the term you used.  
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And certainly my understanding from 
what you said was that you were saying that once you 
passed it on to the relevant people to process, one or more 
of them had the obligation to check for example whether 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 164 of 244 
 
there was a contract on the basis of which Eskom had paid 
and maybe to check other things as well, and if they did 
not do their job, I think that is what you were saying it is 
not your fault.  
 
I am just putting it in my own words.  
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think that is what you were saying 
and you were saying if any of those people picked up a 
potential problem, they were entitled to come back to you 
but nobody came back to you. 
10 
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you said. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so what was the purpose of you 
giving them the invoice?   
MR SINGH:  To conduct all the verification and validation 
checks that are required per the policy and procedure.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, for what purpose? 
MR SINGH:  For the invoice to be paid. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so you gave them the instruction 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  No, I did not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  To process the invoice ...[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:  I did not give them an instruction. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 165 of 244 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
The 
validation, 
the 
verification 
...[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:  That does not constitute an instruction to pay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, let me just complete it.  You gave 
them the instruction to do, follow that process of validation 
and verification in order for the invoice to be paid. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, forwarding an email which I do not 
even remember doing with somebody with no instruction 
does not mean go and pay.  It means go and do what you 
are supposed to do to make sure that if you pay you have 
10 
complied with all the policies and procedures of Eskom.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let me put it this way.  Let me ask 
you this way.  Is it normal procedure or was it normal 
procedure that if you were involved in a project because of 
your seniority, invoices would be sent to you.  Was that 
normal practice at Eskom when you were there? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, external audits sent me invoices.  I 
used to receive invoices from various ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, you are speaking too fast. 
MR SINGH:  Oh, sorry sir.  I was just saying it is not 
20 
unusual for suppliers to send invoices to me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To you? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  I receive invoices from external auditors and 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 166 of 244 
 
the like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Even that process Mr Chair, I explained in 
detail the last time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  As to how that would be undertaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  In terms of the specifics Mr Chair, you can 
refer to the 1034 document.  I think it is an Eskom policy, I 
think procurement document that basically sets out who the 
10 
people are that are responsible to make sure that invoices 
are matched to contracts. 
 
Contracts that are loaded and so on.  So the 1034 
document is a document that effectively outlines that 
procedure.  The fact that the CFO receives an invoice Mr 
Chair, cannot be authorisation for the invoice to be paid, 
as it would invalidate every single policy and procedure 
that any organisation puts in place.  
 
So the mere fact that I received it cannot be viewed 
as I approved the invoice and substantially I did not 
20 
approve the invoice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but just let us get the procedure or 
process right.  so going back to my question would you say 
it was normal for service providers involved in projects 
where you were involved, to send invoices to you? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 167 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think if you just look at the 
McKinsey invoice for example, it was addressed to me to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I do not want a single thing.  I 
want to know whether it was normal. 
MR SINGH:  In my view it is normal sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay no that is fine, and what role in 
terms of Eskom procedures were you supposed to play in 
regard to invoices when you had received them? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, my role would have been to as I said 
send it to the relevant people to ensure that the policies 
10 
and procedures of Eskom is followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  I would not be in a position to if I did not put 
my signature there and say I approved this invoice, that is 
when someone can act on it, can say the CFO has signed 
this document and therefore I acted.  This document does 
not bear my signature.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now so are you saying to me that the 
Eskom procedures in relation to the payment of invoices, 
despite contemplating that invoices could be sent to the 
20 
CFO did not expect or require the CFO to do anything other 
than just pass them on? 
 
Is that what you are saying? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the policies and procedures of any 
organisation is built in such a way that it actually prevents 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 168 of 244 
 
exactly what you are requesting me to confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  So the policies and procedures of any 
organisation, would want to ensure that there is not let us 
call it, they call it the technical term is basically called 
system override or process override.  So if I had to 
basically sign that invoice the day it landed on my desk, 
that would have been policy override or system override. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would have been policy? 
MR SINGH:  That would have been policy override or 
10 
system override. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  So before it went through any of the checks, I 
would have said I am happy, pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  That would have been override. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you see let me put it this way.  
Did Eskom procedures require or contemplate that the CFO 
after receiving an invoice from a service provider, to do 
anything about it or with it other than passing it on to 
20 
junior staff? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Junior to him. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I refer you back to the 1034 
document. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 169 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And the 1034 document is very clear.  It 
states that the contract management process is the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
procurement 
practitioner. 
 
The 
procurement practitioner has to make sure that they take 
the relevant documentation through to the delegated 
authority to have those documents approved.  
 
In this case Mr Chair, I was not the delegated 
authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
10 
MR SINGH:  So if the CFO was a delegated authority 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  I would then expect yes for it to come back to 
me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And even so Mr Chair, even if I received that 
invoice that required it to come back to me, I would have 
not put my signature to it until it went through the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
20 
MR SINGH:  And then arrived to me ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Post that process.  If that process indicated to 
me that all of the processes and policies were followed, 
then I would affix my signature to it, for them to 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 170 of 244 
 
proceeding, it is on its way.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you see for me as long as at some 
stage there are invoices that where the CFO plays a role, 
then I can understand.  Maybe depending on the amounts, 
maybe depending on the nature of the projects.  That I can 
understand.  
 
No one expects that the CFO should say whether a 
R1 000-00 invoice must be paid or not, you know. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But my difficulty arises if your evidence 
10 
suggests that the Eskom procedures in relation to the 
payment of invoices, do not anywhere contemplate or 
require that the CFO should have a role, a substantive role 
at least in regard to some transactions or some invoices, 
depending on the amounts other than just passing the 
invoice on to other people.  You know, I can understand if 
it is below a certain amount, may you just pass it on but I 
have in mind that there must come a time when the 
amounts are so big that the organisation would want its top 
finance official to have checked that this is in order. 
20 
 
Whether the top finance official checks after some 
junior staff member and junior management staff had 
looked at it and then it comes to the CFO after if it passes 
all the various units.  It is fine, but I just would have 
difficulty with the situation where the only role for the CFO, 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 171 of 244 
 
irrespective of the amount involved in the invoice is just to 
pass it on without any substantive role to you, and then it 
will go to various junior people until it is paid.  
 
That is what I seem to have difficulty with. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think let me explain two of the 
concepts.  The first one I think when you sort of, let us 
deal with the easy one first.  I think when you deal, when 
you refer to junior people, I think that statement needs to 
be corrected firstly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean junior to you. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Ja, but even them too Mr Chair, junior to me 
could be very senior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I accept. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But still junior to you. 
MR SINGH:  Yes, because they could be at general 
manager level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:   Or even senior general manager.  So junior to 
me are very senior people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:  Or to the CFO for that matter.  The second 
point Mr Chair, I have not come across a document that 
within 
the 
Eskom 
environment 
that 
required 
me 
to 
specifically sign of an invoice for a specific amount.  The 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 172 of 244 
 
only document that I have come across is the delegation of 
authority framework and the 1034 document as I have 
stated.  
 
In both, they refer to a delegated authority.  So if 
you were the delegated authority and if you were the CFO, 
then you would need to sign something.  The delegation of 
authority does not refer from what I remember, to an 
invoice.   
 
It refers to contracts, it refers to approval amounts 
and yes, if there was anything in there that required me to 
10 
sign specific invoice or contract or document, then it  
would obviously then arrive at my – my desk for signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying where are you saying 
that in terms of the Eskom procedures you would not be 
required to approve or authorise any payment if you were not 
the delegated authority in respect of that contract or that 
project but if you were the delegated authority … 
MR SINGH:  Then you could pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you would have approved that is what 
you are saying? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are saying here you were not the 
delegated authority. 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So – but just to get it clear where you 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 173 of 244 
 
are the delegated authority yes indeed you would be 
required to approve payments relating to that project. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Mr Singh you have defended this 
payment in your affidavit as payment for services that were 
rendered.  Is that correct 
MR SINGH:  Correct Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I find your answer difficult to 
comprehend because it is this payment that was one of the 
10 
issues or charges against you before SICA and this payment 
has cost you your profession.   
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Has cost you your profession. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if you – if you have regard to the SICA 
finding the particularly this payment the make a finding that I 
signed the invoice or approved the invoice yet again I 
request the commission to prove that I approved the invoice.  
My signature does not appear on the invoice Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I do not think they say you signed 
20 
the agreement – I mean the invoice. 
MR SINGH:  You said I approved it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes they say you approve. 
MR SINGH:  I did not approve Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because if you did not approve that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 174 of 244 
 
payment you would not have passed it on for payment. 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you did not approve of that R30 million. 
MR SINGH:  My passing on again I would say for the 
Chairman’s I think I am saying it for the third time Sir.  Me 
merely passing on an invoice does not mean I approve for it 
to be paid.  There could be a number of issues with that 
invoice that I am not even aware of that needed to be taken 
care of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us go back to an answer 
10 
you gave last time to question it later relating – related to 
this issue.  I think if I recall correctly you considered that if 
for example as you put it if there was something glaring in 
the invoice you would be expected to say no but this cannot 
be paid. 
MR SINGH:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made an example and I do not know 
whether the example was if you knew that you had 
contracted A to render the services but the invoice was now 
coming from E you would say but we did not contract E.  Do 
20 
you remember that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think the example for present 
purposes may not be very appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know what you are talking 
about. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 175 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:  But Mr Chair to your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the a - the principle you – ja the 
example ja. 
MR SINGH:  Let us use the glaring example.  So for example 
let us say that the Trillian invoice arrived and it was for R150 
million it is glaring but the contract value that we have got 
approval for was only R100 million.  So the invoice coming 
from Trillian could never have been R150 million.  So that 
invoice would not even go past my desk.  I would send it 
back to Trillian and say what is this for?  So yes something 
10 
like that would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what would also be glaring I would 
think that you would concede is if the services were 
rendered by A – I know – I think you do not like A and B. 
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the services were rendered C. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you got an invoice from D instead of 
an invoice from C that would be glaring would it not? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think again it would be glaring to the 
20 
extent that the point of departure would be if you were 
expecting and understood that you had received services 
from Trillian which is my departure point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see you do not want to stick to C and D.  
You do not A you do not want B you do not want C you do not 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 176 of 244 
 
want D. 
MR SINGH:  Okay we use A and B Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us look ja. 
MR SINGH:  If – if your departure point was that you receive 
services from A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  And then you got an invoice from B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  It would be glaring. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be glaring. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I – ja.  Ja but in this case is the 
position not that you received an invoice from Trillian in 
circumstances where to your knowledge the services that 
you rendered by Regiments. 
MR SINGH:  Which – this is again where we – it comes back 
to the departure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR SINGH:  I said it comes back to the departure point.  My 
departure point was we received services from Regiments 
20 
staff that was seconded through a secondment agreement 
between 
Regiments 
and 
Trillian 
and 
therefore 
Trillian 
provided the services to Eskom for the corporate plan.  If 
there was ostensibly an obligation or a liability Regiments 
we have not received any invoice from Regiments or those 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 177 of 244 
 
services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but Mr Singh if you know that you have 
received services from Mr Seleka and instead of receiving an 
invoice from him for the services that he rendered you 
receive an invoice from your Counsel you are going to say 
but my Counsel did not render these services it is Mr Seleka 
who rendered these services and indeed you might pick up 
the phone to Mr Seleka and say why is my Counsel serving 
this – sending me an invoice in respect of service that you 
provided?  Or you might phone your Counsel and say but you 
10 
never rendered any service.  Is it not?  Would that not be the 
reaction? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair at the time my expectation was that we 
were receiving services from Trillian and hence I passed the 
invoice on.  If the validation process indicated otherwise it 
would have not been paid.  It should not have been paid.  
And again Mr Chair I refer you back to the letters received 
from McKinsey.  They approved the payment to be made to 
Trillian so it was on – even on McKinsey’s version they 
accept that Trillian had – was the party that needed to be 
20 
paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the letter from – the letter or letters 
from McKinsey that you are talking about did you receive 
them before you passed the invoice onto other officials at 
Eskom to process? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 178 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After? 
MR SINGH:  Yes after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Because you see I want us to 
focus on what could have been going on in your mind when 
one 
you 
knew 
that 
the 
services 
had 
been 
rendered 
Regiments but the invoice was from Trillian.  And I just put it 
to you a few minutes ago what I would expect to be the 
reaction of somebody who had that knowledge that it is 
Regiments who rendered the services but now I am being 
10 
sent an invoice by Trillian.  And the fact that you – and it 
seems to me you – you would not be able to say but I must 
pay Trillian because I have not received an invoice from 
Regiments.  Because what if you receive it after when you 
have already paid the wrong party.  That is what you would 
be concerned about. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I said to you the – the difference in 
opinion as to whether it should have been Regiments or 
Trillian is the reference point and the departure point.  In my 
view Trillian rendered the services.  So when the receipt – 
20 
when the invoice arrived it was within my expectation it was 
then passed on for the validation and verification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought – sorry.  Oh okay.  Did you 
want to say something? 
ADV 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER: 
No 
I 
just 
let 
him 
answer 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 179 of 244 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Because I want to at some stage 
maybe based on the questions being asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER: 
 
With 
reference 
to 
actual 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Before the commission deal with 
this particular issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Because with the greatest of 
respect to Chairperson and to my learned friend I think to 
put hypothetical propositions to the witness is something 
totally different if one actually has regard to documents 
before this commission that is presented to the commission 
where somebody in Eskom physically approves the payment 
and those documents are before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no that is another – another stage.  
I am still at the stage as – that relates to what was the 
20 
reaction expected of him as CFO when he knew that the 
services had been rendered by Regiments but the invoice he 
was getting was from Trillian.  Just at that stage what 
transpires later on we can come to in due course.  So – so 
Mr Singh I just – I said some few minutes ago that my 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 180 of 244 
 
expectation was simply that – my expectation would be that 
when you know that the services were – when you knew that 
the services were provided by Regiments and you received a 
Trillian invoice you would not pass it on.  You would pick up 
the phone or write either to Trillian or to Regiments or to 
both to say we are only liable to Regiments that is the only 
party that we can pay. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair for all intents and purposes of the 
paying we were of the view that Regiments was a sub-
contractor to – sorry not Regiments.  Trillian was a sub-
10 
contractor to McKinsey at the time through the business – 
how can I say?  Or the merger and acquisition process that 
was unfolding between Regiments and Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is something that you did not 
properly enquire into to exactly establish what is the 
position, is it not? Did you ask for documents and the 
secondment agreement that you have been talking about?  
Did you ask for any documentation to check whether what 
the nature of the relationship between Regiments and Trillian 
and Trillian and Regiments and not Trillian and McKinsey 
20 
and McKinsey and Regiments? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that again I would respectfully submit 
that is the process of the validation that would have had to 
happen.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 181 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   In my view we understood this.  Even McKinsey 
understood – I mean yes McKinsey understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how could you have that understanding 
when in your own affidavit you say the person that you 
passed to render the services if I understand it correctly was 
Mr Eric Wood of Regiments that is in paragraph 24 of your 
affidavit.  When you say in 25 the engagement of Wood must 
be taken to be the engagement of Wood of Regiments was 
important bla, bla, bla and then I think you continue – how 
could you think of Trillian having rendered services when you 
10 
knew because you were the person who asked Regiments to 
render the services.  And why did you not approach 
Regiments and say what is going on – why am I receiving an 
invoice from Trillian and not from you? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair at that point in time Mr Wood was 
ostensibly wearing two hats. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should not matter to you because you 
had not – you had not as I understand your affidavit engaged 
him in his personal capacity.  You engaged him as part of 
Regiments.  
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair and he was as I said wearing two 
hats at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you wanted to pay him – to pay the 
right hat is it not the wrong hat? 
MR SINGH:  And Mr Chair I ostensibly submit that we did 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 182 of 244 
 
pay the right hat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though you accept that Trillian did 
not render services? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I said Trillian for all intents and 
purposes rendered the services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR SINGH:  With Regiments staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You see earlier on you agreed as I 
understood you that yes Regiments rendered the services 
now you say Trillian rendered services for all intents and 
10 
purposes. 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair.  You – you got well – what I had 
referred to was the paragraph that Advocate 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Advocate Seleka led.  So that was how – 
that is what I was referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay Mr Singh I am a bit lost.  This 
letter you are referring to it is on page 697 – 697. 
CHAIRPERSON:  697 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And what letter is that again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The letter which Mr Singh says they 
relied upon as a Director from McKinsey to pay Trillian 
directly. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 183 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that the letter Mr Singh 9 February 
2016? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This letter reads: 
“Authorisation to pay sub-contractor directly.  
We 
refer 
to 
the 
professional 
services 
contract 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
consulting 
services for six months entered into between 
Eskom and McKinsey dated 29 September 
10 
2015.” 
 
Now as before I move on we have shown you this 
corporate plan agreement was not properly signed last time 
on your appearance.  You recall that? 
MR SINGH:  So ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You recall that we showed that the 
corporate – the agreement relating to the corporate plan or 
funding plan was not properly signed. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The MEC. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair on that point the 1034 document again 
refers to the fact that there is a binding agreement on the 
issuance of a letter of acceptance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry what is that? 
MR SINGH:  The 1034 document.   
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 184 of 244 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What is the 1034 document? 
MR SINGH:  It is the Procurement Procedure Manual for 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What does it say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you – I am sorry but you are not 
answering the question Mr Singh.  Mr Seleka is asking you 
whether you remember that the agreement was not properly 
signed.  You remember when you were here last time there 
was – we looked where Mr Mbalane was supposed to sign. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The page that was missing.  So he is 
asking you whether you remember that. 
MR SINGH:  No yes I remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was (talking over one another.) 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Just for the record again my client 
at no stage conceded that that agreement was not properly 
signed.  He agreed that there is no signature that was 
affected as it was put to him. But to put to him at this point 
20 
that he agreed that there is – that the agreement was not 
properly signed is simply not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he is able to say no I do not agree 
that I conceded that was not properly signed what I agreed 
to is the following.  So I think you can – Mr Singh do you 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 185 of 244 
 
want to respond to the question?  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mr Seleka wants to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That question is not right.  The question 
is you repeated it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is the correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is the correct question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Whether he recalls. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am not asking him to agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. So do you recall that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do okay. Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then the second paragraph says: 
“Subject to 
1. The terms of the agreement relating to any 
payments to be made by Eskom to us. 
20 
2. Us issuing a written confirmation of our 
satisfaction with the relevant services to be 
performed by Trillian to McKinsey. 
3. The correctness of the amount to be invoiced 
we hereby agree for and authorise Trillian to 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 186 of 244 
 
invoice and be paid directly by Eskom for 
any services performed by it in pursuance of 
our obligations under the agreement.” 
Now my question to you is were these preconditions met? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I would not know whether these 
preconditions were met or not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So how did you rely on this letter to 
support and defend the payment of over R30.6 million as the 
CFO? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair again I did not rely on this letter 
10 
because I did not approve the invoice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No  … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you remember when I was asking 
questions you said that Eskom was justified in paying Trillian 
because of among other reasons the letter that had come 
from McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have confirmed that this is the 
letter you had in mind.  So Mr Seleka is saying but this letter 
has certain conditions. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If those – if you do not know whether those 
conditions were met it cannot – it could not support you and 
you could not think it was supporting you if you did not know 
whether those conditions were met.  But if you knew that the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 187 of 244 
 
conditions that it placed on you as Eskom to make sure they 
were met before you paid then you could still rely on that if 
that is what it says.  What do you say to that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I do not understand the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the question is I am now putting it in 
my own words.  The letter from McKinsey you cannot say – 
you cannot rely on it to justify paying McKinsey –  
MR SINGH:  Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Trillian if it said it could only pay Trillian if 
certain conditions were met and you pay without knowing 
10 
whether those conditions were met because it provided 
support or authorisation for you to pay Trillian directly only if 
those conditions were met.  If you pay Trillian without those 
conditions were met then you have acted outside of that 
letter.  So you cannot rely of it.  What do you say to that? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson again with the 
greatest of respect my – I do not want to unnecessarily 
object the record will reflect what Mr Singh said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no let Mr Singh answer this 
question now we want to test the evidence of what he said 
20 
and he understands what he said.  If he thinks we have 
misunderstood he will tell us. Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if you have regard for the last 
sentence I think – yes in the first paragraph it says: 
“As you know McKinsey has sub-contracted a 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 188 of 244 
 
portion of the services to be performed under 
the 
agreement 
with 
Trillian 
Proprietary 
Limited (Trillian).” 
So that is what I was referring to.  If McKinsey 
confirms that they had sub-contracted their portion of the 
work to Trillian in their own letter you – because the question 
that you have posed to me would you have been surprised – 
why were you not surprised because you got an invoice from 
Trillian yet Regiments was expected?  And I am saying 
because at all relevant times we understood that Trillian was 
10 
a sub-contractor to McKinsey for this corporate plan.  And 
this letter 00:23:41.  So I was referring to this letter’s 
content as it relates to that paragraph to your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  And Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  May I say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh you were not relying on that 
letter.   
MR SINGH:  No, no. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This letter – let me finish. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This letter you have told the Chairperson 
you did not have it at the time you received the invoice.  You 
did not have this letter at the time. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 189 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I am using the letter to demonstrate 
that it was at all relevant times whether it was McKinsey or 
whether it was Eskom we were under the expectation that we 
were receiving services from Trillian.  As evidence to support 
my assertion that that was the case at that point in time I 
refer to this letter.  So that is the context behind that. 
 
Secondly this letter is dated 9 February the invoice is 
paid when Sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No when did you receive the invoice? 
MR SINGH:  That is immaterial Sir.  When was the invoice 
10 
paid? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not know you tell the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we – no, no. 
MR SINGH:  It was paid in April. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you received it also important. 
MR SINGH:  No, no I agree Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But I am saying is Mr Seleka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Points out that this letter is of no relevance and 
20 
I am saying it is of relevance.  Because we received – the 
payment was only made in April. Notwithstanding the fact the 
invoice was received in January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR SINGH:  So if the pro – if it is taken that I approved the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 190 of 244 
 
invoice these processes would have not happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that – I think that we –where we 
were was the question of what role if any this letter played in 
your conduct at the time you received the invoice and you 
have said – you have said that no the letter was not there at 
the time you received the invoice. But what you say you were 
saying is you were under the impression over a certain 
period that Trillian was a sub-contractor for McKinsey and 
you say in support of that you referred to this letter which 
came after as showing that at some stage Trillian was the 
10 
sub-contractor of McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And now we are back to the conditions 
Mr Singh.  If you say you do not know well what is your 
answer?  Do you know whether or not these conditions were 
met?   What was your answer? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I was not party to the process that 
20 
validated this invoice for payment and these would have 
been – the documents attached here would have been some 
of the documents that was undertaken by the – through the 
validation process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but that does not answer the question.  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 191 of 244 
 
What was your answer about the conditions whether they 
were met or not? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I was not aware of whether they were 
met or not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then my next question was.  How in 
your affidavit you refer to one of these letters as the reason 
why you paid Trillian.  You have told the Chairperson that is 
the reason why you paid Trillian you relied on this letter.  
How could you have relied on this letter to support and 
defend the payment of over R30 million that was my 
10 
question? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in compiling the affidavit to the 
commission 
we 
undertook 
to 
try 
and 
explain 
to 
the 
commission the process that was undertaken by Eskom to 
validate the process to indicate that the processes that were 
set out by Eskom were followed.  In this – in the documents 
that are attached to this payment you will see that there is 
documents that validates not only the Trillian portion but it 
also validates the Eskom portion – the McKinsey portion.  
The – the entire R100 million Mr Chair was validated by the 
20 
Eskom process and that is what this attempted to explain.  If 
– if –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  If Mr Seleka is saying that I should have not 
included this because it was not in my personal knowledge 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 192 of 244 
 
then it is a very different approach that we would then 
adopted to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can we go to the affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where he refers to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is on – let us start on page 601. 
CHAIRPERSON:  601? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  601 Chair paragraph 34.  And Chair as 
we do so can I – can I clarify to Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What would have been my – what my 
expectation would have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not for you not to include the document 
but when you include it to be satisfied that everything in that 
document was done accordingly. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that in impractical it would never be 
then I would just submit everything that was only in my 
personal knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back – let us go to the relevant 
20 
part of the affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – oh Chair the live stream has been 
interrupted is down they requesting an adjournment to sort it 
out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Okay let us adjourn 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 193 of 244 
 
hopefully it will not take long – five minutes – six minutes – 
ten minutes.  Ten minutes and we will resume after that.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  Chairperson, we were going to page 
601, paragraph 34 to look where Mr Singh refers to that 
10 
letter that seeks direct payment to be made ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So paragraph 34 of Eskom Bundle 16, 
page 601 reads: 
“With regards to the R 30 million payment to 
Trillian, I wish to highlight the events that led 
to the mandate given in respect of work to be 
done and subsequent payment made...” 
 
And 
then 
there 
sub-paragraphs 
to 
that 
paragraph, 34.1, .2, .3, .4, .5 and then .6 that is where he 
20 
refers to the letter which is on page 603. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, just, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
The 
context 
behind 
including 
this 
...[intervenes]  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 194 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay just hang on Mr Singh.  Had you 
finished? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you referring to some parts of this?  
Had you finished?  Or did Mr Singh interrupt you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, there is an interruption because I 
think the Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you much finish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him finish Mr Singh. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then I will give you a chance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And then 34.7 which says: 
“Lastly, the invoice submitted by Lebelo of 
R 30.6 million...” 
 
And the Chairperson wanted to see where this 
reliance is placed in Mr Singh’s affidavit for this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we found it in paragraph 34.6.  
And ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   34.6: 
“...with regard to the R 30 million payment to 
Trillian, I wish to highlight the events that led 
up to the mandate in respect of work be done 
and subsequent payment be made...” 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 195 of 244 
 
 
Well, what is the point of which your question 
was made?  Were you saying that – I understood you to be 
saying to him, he says in his affidavit that it was as a 
result of the McKinsey letter, maybe among other things, 
that he or Eskom made payment to Trillian?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you were saying? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because he had also repeatedly said 
10 
to you, to the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then continue.  I just wanted to see the 
wording. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I said I wanted to see where he gives it 
like that in his affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And my point is, Mr Singh, that if you 
are to rely on a document.  Remember, the document has 
to do with a payment to be made.  It is a financial aspect.  
In your capacity as the CFO, which is you are the 
gatekeeper in respect of finances.  That you would in 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 196 of 244 
 
relying on it have ensured that whatever is stated in that 
letter as pre-conditions in particular, those conditions have 
been fulfilled. Your comment? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, having regard to the questions that 
have been posed by Mr Seleka.  I would like to, again, 
refer to paragraph 34.  If we may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And in particular, can we look at Annexure 
AS-4?  Which I think, if i...  AS-4.  Yes, it is on page 650.  
So...  Are you there, sir? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, I would like to point out a 
couple of things in this AS-4 document and we will then 
correspond to Advocate Seleka’s question.  If you look at 
the document on the – below the date, 29 September 2015, 
you will see that the enquiry is directed to someone at 
Eskom, a Mr or Ms Molekwane.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying to see... 
MR SINGH:   Just below the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Before – just below the telephone 
20 
number? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  So, Mr Chair, that is for all intense 
and purposes, the procurement practitioner that I have 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 197 of 244 
 
referred to previously, who would have the responsibility to 
make sure that this letter is issued, the contract is put in 
place and so on, and then load it into the system and once 
the invoice comes, they also have obligations to perform.  
So in this case, Ms Molekwane would be one of those 
people to perform those functions.   
 
Then, Mr Chair, while we are on AS-4.  I would 
just like to again point you to the next page, page 651 
which is not directly related to Advocate Seleka’s question 
but I would just like to point out that there is a confirmation 
10 
above the signature of Mr Koko, the paragraph that is 
headed Confirmation.   
 
And there it actually says:   
“We confirm that a contract will exist between 
Eskom and McKinsey & Company on the above 
basis. 
Please include your acknowledgement thereof 
by 
signing 
below 
and 
deliver 
the 
undersigned...” 
 
And that relates to, again, to whether a valid 
20 
contract existed between Eskom and McKinsey, which is a 
separate point but I just thought I would point it out right 
now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   The next point I would like to go to Mr Chair 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 198 of 244 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Mr Singh.  Just before you move 
on.  That statement, you have read it previously.  It says 
contract will exist.  What do you want to make of it? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have said before.  I am not a 
legal person but from my understanding of commercial law 
which I have done many years ago.  I think, if there is an 
offer and an acceptance there is a binding contract.  This, 
in my view, is a very – it contains the terms, the 
conditions, the deliverables, the price rates.  That is the 
10 
offer and it is signed by Mr Koko.  It is then in turn 
accepted by Mr Weiss.   
 
So on my understanding of commercial law, this 
letter is sufficient to be evidence that a contract exists 
between the parties.  But again, as I said, I am not a 
lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is your understanding of how 
Eskom concluded contracts as a matter of practise and 
actually one could even talk about Transnet.   
MR SINGH:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it your understanding that when it 
talked about the need for there to be a contract before 
payment could be made, it talked about letters or whether 
it talked about a formal document which is a contract or 
agreement? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 199 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I refer back to this document called 
the 1034. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And the 1034 document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where do we find this 1034 document?  
You have mentioned it a number of times. 
MR SINGH:   I think we can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it in the bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know, Chair. 
MR SINGH:   We can make a copy available to you if 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you have been speaking as if 
we should know what document that is. 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue.  I think your 
counsel is... 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, I have got a copy 
for yourself and I have got one for... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Otherwise, copies can be made by 
the staff if we need more copies. 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I object Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 200 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, where are the other people?  Okay 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, may I just have a 
second to confirm, please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, we will hand the 
one copy that we have got in the interim ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   ...to my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and then copies can be made. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   I hear my learned friend wants 
to object.  Maybe he can state why he wants to object.  
[laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   I always assume that the 
Commission is there to establish the... facts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he was not serious. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was just ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   I could not see the tongue in 
20 
his cheek because his face was turned away.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay alright.  Okay Mr Singh, 
you were ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...making a point by referring to that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 201 of 244 
 
document. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just make the point. 
MR SINGH:   So...  Can we pass the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you want until ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   We pass the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   But the original point relating to Mr Seleka, I 
think is then, Mr Chair we go through to the documents, 
AS-6.1 to AS-6.5.  And those documents, Mr Chair, are 
10 
documents that indicate where the work was accepted or 
work was delivered to Eskom.  And you will see various 
signatures by various employers of Eskom to indicate that 
work had been done.  And that is typically the validation 
process that I had been referring to.   
 
Then, Mr Chair, if you go to page 698 which is 
AS-8, you will see that that then culminates in the invoice 
being supported by Mr Govender on the 8 t h of April 2016 by 
attaching his signature thereto.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   So Mr Chair, that is the process that would 
entail to be followed in terms of the validation process.  So 
when Mr Seleka says to me that I should have ensured that 
these conditions were met.  It would have been up to the 
procurement practitioner to ensure that all the conditions 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 202 of 244 
 
or, alternatively, Mr Govender who I think was the Project 
Manager on this assignment at the time, given that he had 
supported the invoice.  To ensure that those conditions or 
any conditions for that matter would have been – needed to 
be fulfilled.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR SINGH:   So the context behind submitting this 
document was to respond to an allegation that was made 
10 
by Mr Pillay in his affidavit regarding the surprise that he 
had regarding Trillian being paid R 30 million for no work 
being done.  So these document, essentially, was to prove 
that it did not need to be a surprise because there was a 
proper process that was followed to appoint McKinsey and 
Trillian.  And secondly, that there was validation that was 
actually done relative to the R 30 million that was paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, if you go back to page 684, 
that Annexure AS-6.1. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Page 684. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, page 684.  Eskom Bundle 16, page 
684.  That annexure you referred to 6.1. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say it indicates that work was 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 203 of 244 
 
done.  Can you tell the Chairperson, it indicates what was 
done by who? 
MR SINGH:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you are referring to what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 684.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Please tell the Chairperson, it 
indicates work done by who? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, if you look at the heading of 
the document.  It says ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  Where does it say work was 
done? 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, that is what I am trying to 
explain, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir.  If you look at the heading of it, it 
says Monthly Work Completion Certificate.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Looking at schedules at page – what?  
684?  That is the page I am at. 
MR SINGH:   684, sir.  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   And it is – if you look just below the Eskom 
logo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   It says ...[intervenes]  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 204 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh, 
Monthly 
Work 
Completion 
Certificate.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:   And then there is some stuff that is in there.  
There is a contract number there.  There is a PO there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   The contract, the name, submission of reports 
and then there is some stuff there that is not legible but 
basically you can see it is actually signed off by two 
parties.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, work done by who? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It indicates work done by who? 
MR SINGH:   McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how does it relate to the letter you 
are referring the Chairperson to? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again, I come back to the context 
why this was submitted.  The context behind this was 
submitted was to give an appreciation to the committee 
relevant to the allegation that was made by Mr Pillay.  
Mr Pillay made an allegation and I responded thereto by 
20 
including this document.  
 
The... but answering directly to Mr Seleka Pule’s 
point.  Sorry, Advocate Seleka’s point.  The work that is 
validated is validated as the contract and that would be the 
McKinsey contract.  So you would get the validation that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 205 of 244 
 
would probably head up to, as I understand it, the full 
R 100 million.   
 
From there, we would then say:  70% goes to 
you McKinsey, 30% then goes to you, Trillian.  So that is 
the purpose of these documents.  I do not know if that 
answers your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you paid McKinsey or if you paid 
McKinsey the whole amount of fees for the entire job and 
left it to them how they pay whoever their subcontractor 
10 
was.  This problem would not have arisen, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think you are correct but if I have 
regard to my submission to the Portfolio Committee.  And 
again, it is a very long time.  Maybe I am mistaken in 
saying this.  But I think evidence was led at the Portfolio 
Committee at the time by McKinsey that it was actually a 
policy of bears that they did not actually want their 
subcontractor ’s fees to be paid to them but they wanted 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but they could not dictate to you as 
20 
Eskom.  If you ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   If we had a policy different.  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  They could not dictate to you. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am saying is.  If you only had 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 206 of 244 
 
– if you had a contract with McKinsey and the work had 
been done whether by on behalf of McKinsey and you paid 
the whole amount to McKinsey and left it to McKinsey and 
whoever 
their 
subcontractor 
was, 
whether 
that 
was 
Regiments or Trillian.   
 
You say:  That is between the two of you.  You 
must act in accordance with the arrangements that you pay 
80% of the contract value to... contractor.  Then you would 
not be in this problem.  The problem simply arises because 
you as Eskom undertook to pay the subcontractor directly 
10 
and now the question has arisen whether you paid the 
subcontractor that had done the work.  But otherwise, if 
you paid the whole amount to McKinsey, then there would 
not be any problem, I supposed. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would agree with your hypothetical 
scenario, up to the point where you said had we paid in a 
hypothetical scenario to the main contractor and then 
everything else would have been left for them to resolve 
between themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR SINGH:   I agree with in this situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   But you would have – there is a possibility of 
that happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 207 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   In that, McKinsey could have just sort of 
transfer R 30 million to Trillian or Regiments, for that 
matter, without anyone actually being there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it would not be your problem 
because you had no contract with Trillian, you had no 
contract with Regiments. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the obligation relating to the SDNL 
is part of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but it is part of the contract 
between you and McKinsey.  So if you had any issues, they 
10 
would be with McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not with Trillian or Regiments. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And insofar as you may have sought 
to resolve any issues that arose, you would act in terms of 
the contract between you and McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, I am 
20 
going to – you will read Mr Amanquoa’s(?) statement to the 
Commission.  I just want to place on record.  This, you do 
not have to comment because of what my learned friend 
has said:  He requires time to look at the affidavit or the 
statement. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 208 of 244 
 
 
But 
you 
will 
see 
from 
that 
statement 
that 
according to McKinsey: 
“1. 
These 
preconditions 
in 
the 
letter 
were not fulfilled...” 
 
So the letter, ultimately, could not be relied upon 
for the purpose for which the letter sought to achieve.   
 
Number 2, McKinsey says” 
“2. 
We never had a contract for Trillian, 
whether for the Corporate Plan, Funding Plan 
for the Corporate Plan or in respect of the 
10 
MSA...” 
 
Which we are going to come to now.  They 
confirm that it was Regiments that rendered the services.  
But this is now for you which I want to ask and you can 
comment 
on. 
 
McKinsey 
says, 
consistent 
with 
Ms Matshepo, that Eskom had internal people who could do 
the work.  And you will see in Mr Amanquoa’s[?] statement, 
he also says:   
“Eskom had internal resources and personnel 
experienced 
in 
this 
matter 
because 
the 
20 
Corporate 
Plan/Funding 
Plan 
had 
to 
be 
prepared annually...” 
 
He says it was the new management, which was 
yourself, Mr Molefe who wanted McKinsey to come and 
give an objective assessment.  But Eskom itself had the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 209 of 244 
 
personnel to do the work which is what Mr Matshepo said.  
If you have a comment on that you may comment because I 
want to move on to the master service agreement. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if we – in the spirit of closing this 
topic, is it possible to ask for maybe a 15-minute recess to 
look at the paragraph specifically that Mr Seleka refers to 
and maybe we can give a comment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What do you say Mr Seleka to 
that?  He is asking for about ten minutes’ adjournment to 
look at paragraphs ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, to look at the statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   It is the paragraphs ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it means looking at it, it might help to 
close the issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I could give you...  I have the 
paragraph numbers.  You could go read tonight and come 
back tomorrow. 
20 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you want to look at those now? 
MR SINGH:   ...close this matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Chair, that is perfect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us take ten minutes.  We are at 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 210 of 244 
 
nine minutes past seven.  We go up to twenty past.  I have 
in mind that we should stop at eight.  I am just mentioning 
it so that we could be on the same page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of the arrangements, we are 
meant to continue tomorrow evening as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we have not finished.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Maybe if I can place the 
following on record as counsel for Mr Singh.  I would rather 
suggest that we continue at this point.  I have already 
placed on record that this is a voluminous document.  
There are intricacies in the document.  Even in the 
paragraphs that my learned friend is referring to.  And I as 
counsel – and I have just confirmed my attorney, believes 
that it is in the interest of Mr Singh that we rather have 
20 
regard to this document overnight and revert on the issues 
tomorrow.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   I understand my client wish to 
deals with it and get it over and done with but we are here 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 211 of 244 
 
to protect his interest too.  Thank you very much. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is consistent with my 
suggestion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Singh, I think your counsel is 
overruling you. 
MR SINGH:   It seems that I am overruled, sir.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   In your interest.  Okay alright.  Let us 
continue.  You will look at that and then when tomorrow – 
when you come back tomorrow, then it can be revisited. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, shall we then deal with the 
supply development agreement? 
MR SINGH:   Master service agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The master service agreement.  Tell 
the Chairperson, how does that agreement come about? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it in the file that is in front of me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whereabout? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, you want the agreement 
20 
itself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In another...  No, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in a different file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, maybe you 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 212 of 244 
 
should also Mr Seleka of his undertaking at the start that 
his voice will keep on being projected ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Because currently, we are not 
hearing him that well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is my fault.  I complimented him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja-no, he will try and speak up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will raise my... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will raise the voice, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the – the master service 
agreement Chair is in Eskom Bundle 14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is one on page 8... 8771.  But I 
want to find one which is...  8771.  We also found it earlier.  
Ja, you will also find on page...  Is the Chairperson already 
at the other page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   877.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, I found it.  I got it, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 213 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to have it in front of me as 
you asked me about it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, indeed Chair.  Ja, eight...  
Ja...  Ja, Mr Singh, the – if you could just tell the 
Chairperson in a nutshell what this agreement related to 
and when was it concluded? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of the MSA or the Master 
Services Agreement between McKinsey and Eskom, given 
the discussion we had a short while ago, the Master 
Services Agreement was – well, the concept of the Master 
10 
Services Agreement predated my arrival at Eskom so 
whatever I would relay to you, I relay to you from the facts 
that I have gathered post or to this process of investigation 
and we will also understand which parts of the MSA I was 
directly involved in and I am sure Adv Seleka will lead that 
evidence in due course. 
 
But, Mr Chairman, my understanding of the Master 
Services Agreement was that Eskom was in need of 
services relating to turnaround and McKinsey was engaged 
to provide the services relating to the turnover and those 
20 
specific 
aspects 
related 
to, 
for 
example, 
new 
build, 
generation, the primary energy space, some balance sheet 
for cash optimisation options, claims management and 
those were the basic areas that this Master Services 
Agreement related to.   
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 214 of 244 
 
In addition to that, one of the main points relating 
to Master Services Agreement was that it was actually a 
risk-based one, so the extent that McKinsey did not 
perform or deliver the value that was expected in terms of 
the contract then no fees were recruited reciprocally or  
alternatively, if they had delivered services then obviously 
value would accrue to them and then a fee would be 
[indistinct – dropping voice].  That is my understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, I just remembered looking at my 
learned friend that I actually sent her the paragraphs which 
10 
I intended referring Mr Singh to during the course of the 
day 
but 
anyway, 
so 
you 
will 
get 
the 
paragraph 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but that is too short a notice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
made earlier, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Singh, the other question 
was, when was it concluded? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not have independent 
recollection? 
MR SINGH:   No, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, you can look… 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 215 of 244 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can look. 
MR SINGH:   I had it …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have read Dr Weiss’ affidavit. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have read Dr Weiss’ affidavit to 
the Commission. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let me ask me not when but was 
the contract concluded? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Sir? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it concluded? 
MR SINGH:   My personal knowledge, before reading Mr 
Weiss’ testimony, yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, maybe just for the 
record, we were providing during the course of January, by 
we we mean the legal team with three redacted statements 
of Dr Weiss, Misala and Dr Fine.  Subsequent to that, my 
attorney directed a letter – and just to put you into context, 
these redacted statements consisted of two or three pages 
where it was obviously – obvious that they were long 
20 
statements.  There were no annexures even attached to the 
redacted statements where reference were made in the un-
redacted portions and where we asked to comment on.  
 
At that point my instructing attorney wrote a letter 
to the Commission and say please provide us one, with the 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 216 of 244 
 
complete statements and two, with the relevant annexures.  
There was never any response to that nor did those 
statements arrive un-redacted with the said annexures.  So 
at the time when my client deposed to the original affidavit, 
he reserved his right to respond thereto.  So we now know 
that it seems – they are seemingly included in the 
reference bundle but I want to make it clear for the record 
that that is what the position was at that time and that my 
client has subsequently dealt with those little portions that 
was un-redacted at the time.  So just – I think it is 
10 
important that you understand the background of this.   
 
So specifically, my learned friend now wish to again 
deal 
with 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
these 
three 
persons 
statements and he needs to refer my client to the 
paragraphs because last Thursday when we dealt with this, 
my learned friend referred my client to paragraph 17 of the 
statement and he then put it to him why did you not deal 
with this?   The other that - the redacted statement we 
provided with did not have a paragraph 17 in.  So my client 
at that stage said oh, maybe it was an oversight. 
20 
 
So it is against that background that I again say 
that we must be circumspect when we deal with statements 
that is in the possession of the Commission and which we 
want to rely on because otherwise we must lead the 
witness and because the witness, because of the fact that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 217 of 244 
 
we are in the position that we are, to accept what we put to 
him is correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think you have made your point.  Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, I do not know of what my 
learned friend is talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My approach is always to give the 
witnesses that I would lead the full affidavits.  So I do not 
know how redacted statements came to my learned friends.  
10 
So I am not able to comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But, Mr Singh, in his affidavit has 
said that the agreement was signed on the 7 January 2016 
which is on page 623 paragraph 92.1 and so that is why I 
was asking you …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   623? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, we will have to go back to Mr 
Singh’s bundle, which is Eskom bundle 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before we go there, because you 
20 
asked him when the agreement was concluded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that not shown in page 877.24 or is 
that something else?  Which is 7 January 2016 which that 
date is written under the signature of Mr Mabelane. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 218 of 244 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there is no date even under the 
signature of whoever signed on behalf of McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and Chair will see there are two 
different dates.  There is one of Mr Mabelane which 
appears to be 7 January 2016 and then there will be on 
behalf of McKinsey – what they did is hard to see what it is 
but you get to know what the date is when reading Dr 
Weiss’ affidavit and that date is 11 January 2016.  So my 
question to Mr Singh was whether he knows that this 
10 
agreement 
was 
concluded, 
whether 
you 
know 
the 
agreement was concluded. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, on the objective evidence of Mr 
Mabelane signing on the 1 January 2016, that is what the 
affidavit refers  - or my affidavit refers to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, which is the 7 Jan. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I wish you could tell the 
Chairperson that even in February the steering committee, 
which you were the Chairpersons of, were still talking 
20 
about 
an 
agreement 
to 
be 
concluded, 
the 
steering 
committee which you had on the 9 February 2016. 
MR SINGH:   So can we go to the specific steering 
committee minutes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you want the committee – you want 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 219 of 244 
 
those minutes? 
MR SINGH:   If we have it here, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Page 875.32, Eskom bundle 
14(c), Chairperson.  875.33 …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, is it 875 or 879? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   875.  And look at page 875.34, 
paragraph 7, purpose of this meeting.  Well, firstly – sorry, 
sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the issue about page 875.3?  
You referred us to that page. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, stay there for a moment, 
Chairperson, thank you.  Mr Anoj, just stay there.  So the 
document …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, on our papers, on 
the reference bundles that were disclosed it stops at 
875.32 and then it moves over to 876.  That is the 
documents that were discovered to us as the reference 
bundle.  We are just trying to - I am saying this because 
we are trying to follow ourselves what is going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are those the minutes, minutes of the 
Top Consulting Programmes Steering Committee meeting 
held at Corome(?) Boardroom 9 February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 220 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say about the concern that 
Mr Singh’s legal team do not have page 875.34? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am asking whether on that page, 
Chair, is this the document.  Okay, I do not – I am not on 
my – give us the right page because when Ms Lynne Brown 
was testifying I was also following here to assist with the 
page numbers.  Just check which page on the cell phone, 
is it the same page?  Thank you.  The investigator confirms 
it is the same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which page is the same as which page? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is 875.33, so the document is 
on that page even on the soft copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the concern is they do not have a 
number of pages including 875.34. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I am asking… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, we have got a hard 
copy that we found amongst our documents, we will look at 
that in the meantime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is a steering committee meeting 
20 
of 9 February 2016 at 12.30, then you have a list of those 
who are present.  Members, Mr Anoj Singh, Chief Finance 
Officer, Chairman.  Then you have Mr Matshela Koko, Mr 
Abram Masango, Edwin Mabelane and Willie Mjola.  Mr 
Singh you confirm that you were the Chairperson of that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 221 of 244 
 
steering committee? 
MR SINGH:   Correct, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So then you turn the page, page 
875.34 under paragraph 7 or item 7 which is purpose of 
this meeting.  Then it says: 
“Prish 
informed 
the 
committee 
members 
this 
meeting is set up to assist the McKinsey contract to 
provide guidance and support to the top engineers’ 
programme as well as provide guidance to and 
approval of all work package initiatives as defined 
10 
in the services level agreement to be entered into 
between McKinsey and Eskom for generation of 
services.” 
This is what I was referring to.  In this meeting on the 9 
February 2016 the steering committee was still envisaging 
the services level agreement which is the same as the 
Master Services Agreement as an agreement that is to be 
entered into. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, from my understanding and my 
recollection  the Master Services Agreement was – had 
20 
been concluded by this date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please speak up a bit? 
MR SINGH:   I am saying, Mr Chair, for all intents and 
purposes, my recollection, I was not involved in the let us 
say the negotiations and the finalisation of the contract or 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 222 of 244 
 
the Master Services Agreement and for all intents and 
purposes I was under the impression that the contract had 
been concluded.  The reason why this Steerco had actually 
been set up was because of the fact that, as I was given to 
understand, was that there were two conditions precedent 
that required the Steerco to be set up hence the Steerco 
was then put in place so for all intents and purposes, my 
understand was the contract was in place and signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but you see when you testify and I 
ask you that general question, I am expecting you to tell 
10 
the Chairperson everything which would also include 
referring the Chairperson to this meeting which you chaired 
on the 9 February which suggests differently from what you 
are saying.  So you could say in my view, Chair, this is how 
I took it but I know in the minutes of this meeting which I 
chaired, something else is stated. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, if I had recollection of this 
paragraph that was referred to by Adv Seleka, I would have 
brought it to him, I did not have – well, I had access to the 
minutes, but I did not really pay attention to this specific, 
20 
how can I say, passage that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not speak too far from the mic. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry.  Just I am saying to my recollection, I 
have given you a response as to my knowledge.  The 
contents of the minutes, I had access to the minutes, yes, 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 223 of 244 
 
but I did not have reference to the interpretation that Adv 
Seleka has put to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what would have been the basis of 
your understanding that the agreement was concluded? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I said, the reason why the 
Steerco was actually set up was, as I understood it at the 
time, was to give effect to one of the suspensive conditions 
that was contained in the Master Services Agreement.  So 
why would we set up the Master Services Agreement if we 
did not have – not why we set up a Master, why would we 
10 
set up a steering committee that is this, which was 
envisaged in the Master Services Agreement or the SLA if 
it was not fine?   
 
And, Mr Chair, it is also conceivable that you would 
have a signed contract but maybe certain aspects thereof 
are still being negotiated or still to be completed at a later 
date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, talking of the condition, 
that was a suspensive condition and it has to be fulfilled 
on the 31 January 2016.  Now maybe you would like to tell 
20 
the Chairperson was that condition fulfilled as at that date? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, on – if we look at the date of the – 
let us put it this way first, I do not have reference to the 31 
January as the date because that was not in my personal 
knowledge but if you have reference to the date of 9 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 224 of 244 
 
February then it would probably be presumable that it was 
not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did not hear you?  Then…? 
MR SINGH:   I said I did not have reference or personal 
knowledge regarding the date of 31 January. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So I cannot comment on 31 January but if we 
had – if we take the 31 January as a given then obviously 
9 February would… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, it is given, it is in the 
10 
agreement, 
it 
is 
in 
the 
contract, 
the 
service 
level 
agreement which I gave you on page 877.1 of the same 
bundle and the clause is on page 877.7.  It reads, clause 
3.1.  The title is:  Conditions Precedent.  Clause 3.1 says: 
“The provisions of this agreement other than the 
surviving provisions which are the unconditional 
and of immediate force and effect on and with effect 
from the date of signature of this agreement are 
subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the following 
conditions precedent by 31 January 2016.” 
20 
And then you have those conditions.  So it comes from 
there.  Does it mean you were not aware of that provision? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir, I was not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you seem to have been hands-off 
at Eskom. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 225 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You seem to have been hands-off at 
Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   Hands-off? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, hands-off. 
MR SINGH:   Well – do I need to comment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he is suggesting that you were 
hands-off at Eskom and you can say yes, I was hands-off 
or no, I was not hands-off or I do not know if I was hands-
10 
off or not hands-off, depending what the true position is. 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I would say that I was not 
hand-off. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were not hands-off? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in the meeting of the 9 t h they talk 
about an agreement to be entered into and you are not 
aware that the date for preconditions to be fulfilled is 31 
June 2016. 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir.  Mr Chair, if it would please the 
20 
committee I would then like to refer the committee to page 
875.38. 
CHAIRPERSON:   875 point? 
MR SINGH:   Point 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:   38? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 226 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are we back at the minutes? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got the page.  Continue? 
MR SINGH:   Sir, I would just like to draw attention to the 
paragraph that starts with Dave and Charles. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Item? 
MR SINGH:   The paragraph that starts with Dave and 
Charles, it is somewhere in the middle of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under the heading: 
10 
“Resolved/actions for comment.” 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  So, Mr Chair, the paragraph reads: 
“Dave and Charles will ensure alignment with the 
contract from outside of the process to the PMO 
office. 
 
The 
delegation 
consent 
form 
Edwin 
delegated to Prish to manage this contract.  The 
delegation consent form approved by the board is 
Edwin and Prish as senior managers who managed 
this contract.” 
So, Mr Chair – and the reason why I refer you to this 
20 
paragraph is in the context of Mr Seleka’s comment around 
me being hands-off.  Not that I am hands-off, there are 
people that are appointed to do certain things.  So the 
context behind me referring you to this is that there were 
officials that were appointed to ensure that certain things 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 227 of 244 
 
are done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I was being very diplomatic using 
the word hands-off.  It is either hands-off or completely 
ignorant of the issues that were facing Eskom from a 
transaction point of view. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we will go back to this point.  Mr 
Chair, if you have regard for the board approval to 
conclude the contract, I was not the delegated authority o 
conclude the contract hence Mr Mabelane is the signatory 
to the contract.  So again, the contents thereof, if I am not 
10 
the delegated authority to sign the contract, I will again 
respectfully submit that I would not be expected to know 
chapter and verse of the contract especially when officials 
are appointed to specifically take care of those issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the irony is this, you know you 
have to form a steering committee because it is condition 
precedent of the agreement. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, when someone requests me to chair 
a committee or says to me that there is a committee being 
established that you need to check, I ask why, so they tell 
20 
me why. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not understand, you were in the 
negotiations for the conclusion of this agreement. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I was not in the negotiations for the 
conclusion of this contract and being in the negotiations 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 228 of 244 
 
for the conclusion of the contract also would not mean that 
I actually know all the terms and conditions of the contract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I think you know that the condition 
was not fulfilled on the 31 Jan 2016 because CDH has said 
so. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, are we talking about whether I knew 
it on the 9 February?  Are we talking about when CDH 
ultimately said it whenever they said it because CDH did 
not say it on the 9 February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Both of them, at the time of this 
10 
meeting? 
MR SINGH:   At the time of this meeting, Mr Chair, I did 
not know that, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you would have known when you 
started the steering committee, Mr Singh.  When you 
established it you would have known. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, my evidence is that I did not know, 
if Mr Seleka has something else put to me to show that I 
did know, then I would suggest that you put it to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, you would have known when did 
20 
you establish the steering committee which you chaired, 
you chaired all of – you chaired that steering committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he is saying, Mr Seleka, if you do 
not accept his evidence that he did know …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He does not know. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 229 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell him – refer him to something that 
suggests that he knew. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, Chair, I do not know when he 
started the steering committee, so if Mr Singh says he 
does not know, we will accept that position, Mr Singh.  
May, I – okay, so we are dealing with whether this contract 
was concluded based on the allegation that it was signed 
on the 7 Jan.   
Let me show you another letter which is addressed 
to 
yourself, 
it 
is 
on 
the 
same 
Eskom 
bundle 
14, 
10 
Chairperson, page 876.  Now you will recall this letter 
coming from McKinsey date 30 March 2016. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is a letter where McKinsey 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, let me try and find it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, page 876, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Looks like I do not have that page.  Oh, 
okay, I have got it.  Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.   
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, can we just have a 
second?  We are also trying to find it, but for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I think the best thing for me to 
have the soft – the electronic copy. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 230 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thanks, so yes Mr Singh and the letter 
dated 30 March 2016 comes from McKinsey’s, addressed to 
yourself as the Group CFO of Eskom and it refers 
to...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And it has no second page with a 
signature? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On my bundle there is not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is page 877, this one is not 
10 
double-sided Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This one is not double-sided. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the page after page 876, the next 
page I have is 877.1 which is the Service Level Agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, no then it is missing page 877, you 
are correct.   I have it.   Mr Singh do you have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will I need the second page for now 
immediately? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair.   It is exactly the one we 
20 
will ultimately be referring to.  Mr Singh does yours page 
877? 
MR SINGH:   It does, sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It does, thank you.  I think Chairperson 
should keep them, just keep them.  Thank you, Chair. 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 231 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the letter with the subject heading 
top consultant’s programs, so we refer to your letter to us 
dated February 19, 2016 and our response is dated 
February 25, 2016: 
“This 
letter 
serves 
as 
an 
update 
on 
further 
developments 
since 
our 
last 
letter 
to 
you 
on 
February 25, 2016.  In particular, you may recall 
that we have confirmed to you that we will not be in 
a position to commence a relationship with Trillian 
10 
or any other partner plus sub-contractor until the 
criteria below have been met and approved by our 
global risk and legal teams.” 
And I skip that, we go to the next paragraph below the 
bullet points. It says: 
“We have requested the above and other additional 
relevant 
information 
from 
Trillian 
on 
separate 
occasions including via letters to them dated 25 
February 2016 and 10 March 2016.  We have to 
date not received any formal response to each of 
20 
the letters despite the respective deadlines of 25 
February 2016 and 11 March 2016.  We have also 
accepted discussions with Mr Eric Wood on a 
number of occasions during these meetings Mr Eric 
Wood orally provided partial information concerning 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 232 of 244 
 
Trillian.” 
I want to skip that to go to after the bullet points Mr Singh 
where the paragraph actually starts: 
“As a result McKinsey's interactions with Trillian 
have now been terminated with confirmation having 
been sent to Trillian.” 
And here is the part I wish to canvass with you now 
because that first part I have read relates to emanating 
any relations with Trillian.  This paragraph says: 
“We acknowledge that the draft of the services level 
10 
agreement between Eskom and McKinsey entails 
the requirement of outsourcing a percentage of the 
total consulting fee to a supplier development 
partner.” 
And my emphasis for present purposes is on that statement 
with the word draft of the service level agreement on 30 
March 2016, McKinsey tells you the SLA is still a draft, 
your comment? 
MR SINGH:   I see that, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you have no further comment? 
20 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what did you put to him on 
which he does not wish to comment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That paragraph about…[intervene] 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 233 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the second last from the bottom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second yes, correct.  That as of 
this date, 30 March 2016, McKinsey is telling him that the 
SLA, the service level agreement it is still a draft.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, that goes against the averment 
that the agreement was concluded on the 7 t h of January 
2016.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, then oh yeah, you have 
10 
already heard the paragraph from Dr Weiss, let me 
conclude on this let us go to Dr Weiss’s statement in 
Eskom bundle 14.  We stick to the same bundle [c], yeah 
not paragraph 17 I will give you the page, the page 
reference that is on page 690.   
MR SINGH:   Are we on this one?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom bundle 14, I think the same one 
you have. 
MR SINGH:   690? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, six nine zero, right at the 
20 
beginning of the bundle, yeah right at the beginning.  
MR SINGH:   We there, sir. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 You 
are 
on 
that 
page? 
 
So 
he…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember not to speak too far away 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 234 of 244 
 
from the mic, Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   I said I am there, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 29 and 30, now you will 
see how he ends which is different from how he starts, and 
he says: 
“With the letter of acceptance in place, we had a 
signed agreement between Eskom and McKinsey 
and we began to work on the turnaround program in 
January 2016.  At the same time, we will continue to 
work 
to 
finalise 
the 
service 
level 
agreement.  
10 
Despite McKinsey's efforts, Eskom delayed signing 
the SLA. I eventually received the signed SLA from 
Eskom in late September or early October 2016 by 
then, 
Eskom 
had 
terminated 
the 
turnaround 
program, and had compensated McKinsey for our 
work.  At the time, I did not expect that McKinsey 
would receive any additional compensation from 
Eskom.” 
Paragraph 30: 
“The SLA that I received was signed on behalf of 
20 
Eskom as of January 7, 2016.  After consulting with 
in house counsel regarding the SLA, I signed the 
SLA on behalf of McKinsey as of January 11, 2016, 
which was the approximate date that McKinsey 
began to work on the project. I understood that 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 235 of 244 
 
Eskom’s preference was that the SLA be signed as 
of the effective date, which was the date that we 
began work.  I regret any confusion that this may 
have cost.” 
So you follow what is happening there, Mr Singh.  He gets 
the agreement only, well signed by Eskom, he gets it only 
in late September or early October 2016 and he back dates 
it to 11 January 2016.  You follow that? 
MR SINGH:   I do, Mr Chair with regards to Mr Weiss’s 
statement, I think these were parts of the statement that 
10 
counsel was referring to that was redacted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, please repeat that? 
MR SINGH:   I said the paragraph that Advocate Seleka 
refers to are the paragraphs that counsel referred to that 
were 
redacted. 
 
We 
did 
not 
have 
access 
to 
these 
paragraphs in the affidavits that was submitted. 
However, in going through Dr Weiss’s transcripts I 
obviously follow the narrative that was being led and to be 
quite honest, the first time that I knew that there was no 
contract in place, or that there was no contract signed as 
20 
of January, was when Mr Weiss confessed to the fact that 
he had not signed the contract on the 11 t h or whatever, 
January 2016.  That was the first time that I heard of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are not in a position to dispute 
what he says in this regard namely that Eskom - that he 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 236 of 244 
 
only received or McKinsey only received the contract in 
September, October 2016 and it was dated 7 January 2016, 
and although he signed it towards the end of the year, it 
was 11 January 2016, you are not disputing that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, this, this is not within my personal 
knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you do not know. 
MR SINGH:   So cannot confirm or deny the content. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does it mean, Mr Singh, that in the 
10 
various Steering Committee meetings that you had, you 
never had sight of the agreement? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We spoke last time about the fact that 
you were part of weekly meetings. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That would have been under another 
agreement? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   That would have been in reference to the 
corporate plan.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thereto you said you were not aware 
that there was no agreement because that was somebody 
else's responsibility to make sure it was in place but you 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 237 of 244 
 
were under the impression that was in place, is that right? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, her and I think that one, the 
meetings went on for something like four or five months I 
think we said. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, here the meetings that Mr Seleka 
talking about would have gone on for how long without 
there being a contract?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, these - just the context behind 
10 
these meetings.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, these meetings occurred as a 
consequence of the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As the consequence of? 
MR SINGH:   As a consequence of the agreement.  So the 
agreement envisaged…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but if there was no agreement, it 
could not be as a consequence of the agreement.  
MR SINGH:   That is from my perspective, Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understood there was an agreement. 
MR SINGH:   I understood as I said, the first time that I 
understood that Dr Weiss had backdated his agreement, 
and that he was presented with an agreement from Eskom, 
as he says in September or so was the first time that I 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 238 of 244 
 
knew that was when he testified, I have no prior knowledge 
of that.  
 
So, for all intents of purpose, I was given to 
understand that the Steer Co meetings was a consequence 
of the contract.  In terms of the purpose of the meeting, 
the purpose of the meeting was to basically provide 
operational oversight in terms of the actual work that was 
being done, vis-a-vis, the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but going – let us go back to my 
question. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under this agreement, which you thought 
existed at the time, which you now accept, I think, did not 
exist at the time.  At the meetings that you attended, would 
have gone on for how long? 
MR SINGH:   You mean in terms of hours?  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, in terms of over a month, two 
months, three months. 
MR SINGH:   No, they were I think it lasted until August. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that would have -  from about 
20 
January? 
MR SINGH:   No, you had February, there was one in 
February, there was one in March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but they were they monthly, more or 
less? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 239 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   I think it could have been more or less 
monthly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   More or less, ja. 
MR SINGH:   But it was called as and when it was 
acquired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And throughout that periods, you thought 
there was an agreement but you had never seen it. 
MR SINGH:    That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you never asked for it? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you were the most senior person in 
those meetings? 
MR SINGH:   Other than Mr Matshela Koko and the group 
executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was he senior to you? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he senior to you, Mr Koko? 
MR SINGH:   We were all I guess on the same levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you were all on the same levels, 
okay alright.  So you were one of the senior people here.  
20 
You see that is part of difficulty, it is the same difficulty I 
expressed in regard to the corporate plan.  
You know, it is just difficult for me to understand, 
how you being an accountant - and if it was a lawyer, I 
would say the same thing.  But maybe I do not need to 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 240 of 244 
 
refer to the profession, maybe just a senior manager or 
anybody how you could over a number of months, take part 
in meetings, which are supposed to be held in terms of 
some contracts, without ever seeing the contract. 
And yet the meetings are supposed to be held in 
pursuit of provisions of the contract or to try and advance 
the work done in terms of the contract.   That seems quite 
strange to me, because I would imagine that I am taking 
you back to the corporate plan, because there you were 
the most senior, you agreed.  That you were supposed to 
10 
give guidance to those who are junior to you in terms of 
what should be done in terms of this contract or what 
position should we take.  How do you give that guidance 
without having seen the contract, in terms of this one, too?  
Even if there were other executives who are at the 
same level as you, I would expect all of you to at least, 
have seen the contract.  Even if there was somebody else 
who is responsible for the details, to have seen the 
contract, and familiarised yourself with this provisions, 
because I am not sure how you can engage in any 
20 
meaningful, serious discussion and be part of serious 
decisions being taken, supposedly, in terms of a contract 
or to advance certain projects under the contract when you 
have never even seen the contract.  That that is where I 
have some difficulty, do you want to say something? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368

MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
Yes, 
Mr 
Chair 
I 
think 
Mr 
Chair 
in 
organisations, I guess, not I guess you have to place 
reliance on individuals within an organisations that are 
required to perform certain functions. And as I have read 
out to you, previously, Mr Govender and Mr Mabelane were 
the delegated, through the delegated consent form were 
the individuals that were mandated to understand the 
provisions of the contract and give effect thereto. 
In terms of the role that the CFO play, the role that 
CFO play was to ensure that the initiatives that the CFO 
10 
agree to was implemented, it realised there is certain 
value. And if Eskom and McKinsey agreed that those, that 
that value was realised, through the process that was 
established between McKinsey and Eskom then the CFO 
acted as a body, as a coordinating body relating to those 
initiatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying to me, as far as you 
are concerned, it is in order for somebody at the level of 
CFO of an organisation such as Eskom to take part in a 
structure, I am talking about the Steering Committee, which 
20 
is supposed to be a structure established in terms of 
certain contracts, or to advance the project of the contract 
over quite some time without ever saying, let me see this 
contract under which we are working.  
Because the structure, which you are part of you 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 242 of 244 
 
say you understood it to be there, that binds the project 
under the contract or whatever the project was.  So you, 
you say it is in order for somebody at the level of CFO, and 
take over six months or whatever the number of months 
from February to August, without really ever having said, I 
need to see this contract, under which we are working. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, when you are dealing with the level 
of individuals as Mr Govender and Mr Mabelane who were 
general managers in their own right at Eskom one would 
place an inordinate amount of reliance on the fact that 
10 
what you are requested to do is a contract that they are 
managing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there one of them who reported to 
you? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there one of them who reported to 
you or not really? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Seleka, I see we are at seven 
minutes to eight but you might have one or two questions. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Singh, you should tell the 
Chairperson that you were the Chairman of the Steering 
Committee. 
MR SINGH:   Sir, I was the Chairman of the Steering 
Committee.  
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 243 of 244 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and then…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
that 
makes 
it 
even 
more 
astounding.  How does the Chairman, chair a structure that 
is based on a certain document, and yet he has never seen 
that document? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that is the reason why the Steer Co 
started with Mr Govender giving an overview of what the 
document actually entailed and McKinsey was part of this 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I can tell you Mr Singh I would never 
10 
Chair any structure which is based on a certain document 
without having read that document because what your 
whole mandate, I suppose is supposed to come from that 
document, isn't it? 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair, the Steer Co itself had a 
mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm? 
MR SINGH:   The Steer Co itself had a mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where did it derive it from, not from the 
contract?  Where did it derive its mandate from? 
20 
MR SINGH:   I would have to check the mandate, I am 
aware that had a mandate, but I have not seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But am I right to say your evidence is 
that Steer & Co was established in terms of the contract as 
far as you understood at the time? 
25 MARCH 2021 – DAY 368 
 
Page 244 of 244 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair let us - we can proceed 
tomorrow Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright let us adjourn we will 
proceed tomorrow but before or when I adjourn, I would 
like to see both counsels for the legal teams. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
