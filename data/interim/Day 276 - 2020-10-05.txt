PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 05 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning everybody.  Where is the 
other light that makes – makes – ensures that it is not so 
dark – it is very dark. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I think it stands here as I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is it?  Why is it not there?  
Reverend where is the other light that is usually there?  
Am I the first one to notice there is a light missing? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No you are not the first DCJ.  I think 
there might be – yes I thought – the explanation DCJ is 
that the light is here when there is a witness here present 
with us.  This time around there is not a witness Mr Nick 
Linnell is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Are we ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are ready indeed DCJ.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath to the 
witness. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just say for the record I have 
authorised that this witness is – his evidence via video link 
or whatever technologies used without being in the venue 
physically.  It may be necessary later on to arrange for him 
to confirm in person in Johannesburg that his evidence that 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 4 of 134 
 
he gave via video link was true and correct but let us have 
the oath administered in the meantime. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR LINNELL:  Nicholas Hugh Linnell. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR LINNELL:  I am prepared to do that. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR LINNELL:  I do. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR LINNELL:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Linnell.  You may start Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Linnell you 
can hear me? 
20 
MR LINNELL:  I can hear you Counsel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson the bundle we 
are using today is Eskom Bundle 06 Exhibit U16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the bundle is Eskom Bundle 06? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 06 correct. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 5 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Exhibit will be something else inside 
the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is – well it is already marked on the 
spine.  Mr Linnell you have been provided the bundle by 
way of electronic email? 
MR LINNELL:  I have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will just have to raise your voice Mr 
10 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you DCJ.  Mr Linnell just 
housekeeping matters at the beginning.  Confirm with me 
the bundle we find your – your statement which was 
submitted to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee dated 
21 November 2017.  That starts on page 1 of the – of the 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you using red numbers or black 
numbers? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am using the red numbers.  Thank you 
20 
DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have recently been using black 
numbers.  Is there a reason to change to red numbers for 
consistency? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  I have realised the different work 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 6 of 134 
 
streams arrange their files differently DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we should all use the same because 
otherwise it is going to be confusing to whoever reads the 
transcript because they will – they might think we are using 
the black numbers then sometimes red numbers.  We 
should be consistent.  I think let use black numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Black numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless there is a particular reason. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why they should be – they would – if 
10 
there will be a problem but let us use black numbers so 
that what will be made clear is that we used red numbers 
up to a certain point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From a certain point we used black 
numbers throughout. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay DCJ.  Mr Linnell the pagination on 
the documentation is as follows:  At the top right hand 
20 
corner there is a pagination in red but there is also a 
pagination in black at the left top corner of the documents.  
MR LINNELL:  I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we – yes you can see that.  We 
will… 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 7 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  Yes I can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  We will use the pagination 
numbers on the left – the top left hand corner. 
MR LINNELL:  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is – okay thank you.  So that 
statement then is on page 4 left hand corner. 
MR LINNELL:  Yes I have got that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Got that and it is – it is until page 12.  
The last page is page 12.   
MR LINNELL:  Right. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm – ja the date of it is 21 
November 2017.  You see that last page? 
MR LINNELL:  Correct.  21 November 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Then it has your name 
Nicholas Linnell below the date.

ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Linnell.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it identical or in any way different from 
the affidavit – because there is an affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I just… 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 8 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is the position that the unsigned one 
which you have referred to was used in [00:08:34] and then 
the affidavit was used for the commission? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that Mr Linnell? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you hear the Chairperson Mr 
Linnell? 
MR LINNELL:  Yes absolutely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that? 
MR LINNELL:  [00:08:48] of the three statements correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay if we could go then to the 
affidavit which is on page 29.  Just to also place it on 
record.   
MR LINNELL:  I have got page 29 correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it starts with a schedule of 
documents and we have a list there on that page and the 
affidavit itself starts on the next page; page 30. 
20 
MR LINNELL:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And it runs up to page 42. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that Mr Linnell? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think he is still going there. 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman that is correct page 42 is the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 9 of 134 
 
last page of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR LINNELL:  Prior to the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Linnell so 
that is – that you also confirm to be your affidavit before 
the commission? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your voice is going down Mr Seleka. 
MR LINNELL:  I do confirm that.  Your voice is going down. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That you also confirm to be your 
10 
affidavit before the commission? 
MR LINNELL:  I do confirm this is my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Linnell.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Seleka, I think you asked 
him to confirm that this is 
his affidavit before the 
commission but it is actually written in the Parliament of 
the Republic of South Africa Portfolio Committee at page 
30. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 30 yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is where it starts is it not? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says in the Parliament of the Republic 
of South Africa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says Portfolio Committee. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 10 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Linnell can you go page 30 of 
the bundle which will be the first page of your affidavit? 
MR LINNELL:  To which page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 30. 
MR LINNELL:  Okay.  I am there thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  You will see at the top of the page 
your heading there it is in the Parliament – in the 
Parliament of the Republic of South Africa Portfolio 
Committee on Public Enterprises [National Assembly] and 
then [Corporate Governance in Eskom].  You may need to 
10 
explain whether in fact this is an affidavit you submitting 
before this commission or is it an affidavit you are 
submitting before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee? 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman this – this affidavit was 
initially presented to the Parliamentary Committee.  I 
resubmitted the same document to this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So that is the affidavit that 
has the South African Police Stamp of 9 March 2018.  Okay 
alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is some noise that comes through.  
I do not know whether it is – ja that noise; that sound.  
What is that?  It is like somebody is chewing.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is somebody out there.  Okay

affidavit which was also the statement you made – 
supplementary statement I beg your pardon which you had 
submitted to the Portfolio Committee; that is on page 26.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 26.1.   
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman I have that – I have the same 
document 
Counsellor 
is 
referring 
to 
but 
not 
in 
the 
pagination of the bundle but I have that document that he 
is referring to.  It is titled the Supplementary Statement, is 
that correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is dated 29 November 2017.

at the end at page 28 signed on 29 November 2017 at 
Cape Town.  And then Mr Linnell’s name appears after that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You can see that Mr Linnell? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 12 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  I have got that document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then lastly Mr Linnell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry; I am sorry; I am sorry.  I 
may – I do not want to confuse anybody.  There are 
actually 
two 
supplementary 
statements. 
 
There 
is 
a 
supplementary statement and then there is a second 
supplementary statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the next one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have looked at a wrong page.  The 
supplementary affidavit – statement starts at page 26.1. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And goes up to 26.4 is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is dated – it says it is signed on 
the 29 November 2017 at Cape Town.  It is not actually 
signed but it has got Mr Linnell’s name.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Linnell do you follow?

annexures? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Together with its annexures.

Page 16 of 134 
 
mark Exhibit U16.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supplementary statement of Mr 
Linnell starting at page 26.1 is admitted and together with 
its annexures if any and will be marked Exhibit U16.2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The next statement is the second

ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Together with its annexures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then we also… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did we cover all of them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I beg your pardon Chairperson?  We 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 17 of 134 
 
then also referred to Mr Linnell’s additional submission 
which is on page 518 of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what are those? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is his… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like just a reference document.  
When I looked at it it looks like it is there to – for 
convenience to say what you find where. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He – he does provide additional 
10 
answers to some of the questions raised arising from his 
affidavits Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 518. 
CHAIRPERSON:  518.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is indeed not in the form of an 
affidavit.  518 until 5 – 525.  Insofar as we may refer to it 
Chairperson we will be guided by the Chairperson whether 
we need to mark it as an Exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja I just reflect on it maybe we will 
20 
see when we… just reflect on it maybe we will see when 
we… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come to it at some stage.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 18 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Linnell you would address the 
Chairperson and let us start off with a little bit of your 
background in regard to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Seleka.  I think 
somebody is saying that they are going to go on strike 
today I must not have water here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I can give the DCJ mine it is not open. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no do not worry I am sure they will 
organise.  Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Linnell you know 
we will focus mainly on your affidavit and let us start by 
you telling the Chairperson a little bit of your background 
in regard to your qualification and what you do. 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman my – my – at the time of this – 
the events surrounding this inquiry I was in [00:26:30] of a 
company called CTNA Project Management and traded as 
The Project Office is a consulting and project management 
company and at the time it had offices here and in the – in 
United Kingdom.  My background prior to that was many 
20 
years ago I practiced as an attorney in Zimbabwe and 
subsequent to that I worked in the corporate environment 
in South Africa.  I hold a BL LLB Degree and B.Com 
Honours Degree and during the time of this incident I was 
a consultant with the Project Office. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 19 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Were you admitted as an attorney 
in South Africa Mr Linnell? 
MR LINNELL:  No I am not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know that you have been referred 
to as the legal advisor to Ms Dudu Myeni? 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman it is – it is – that is often 
referred to – that title is often referred to me.  I am 
uncomfortable with that.  I was formally an attorney in the 
neighbouring country and so by profession I did train and 
practice as an attorney but in South Africa I have never 
10 
practiced as an attorney and I have not held myself out to 
be an attorney.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  You know coupled with that we 
understand that your introduction to the board members of 
Eskom you would have introduced yourself as a lawyer or 
that you were a lawyer at least – at the very least? 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman that is correct I think the 
narrative was that I was a lawyer by profession and – or 
professional training I think the words but that was 
followed by the statement that I am a consultant and that 
20 
as the capacity in which I appeared before the committee – 
for the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now relative to the events you allude to 
– alluded to earlier which your testimony is really about 
could you tell the Chairperson when you faced – when you 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 20 of 134 
 
were first contacted in regard to what was said to be the 
establishment of an inquiry at Eskom and who first 
contacted you in regard to that? 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman it was the morning of the 6 
March 2015 I received a call from Dudu Myeni.  She, at the 
time, was the Chairman of South African Airways.  The 
organisation now is doing a similar project.  She asked me to 
urgently attend a meeting with the president, with the then 
president of South Africa in Pretoria.  As a result of that, I 
flew to Pretoria that same day and I met Ms Myeni at the 
10 
presidency around midday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you go to your affidavit, page 31 and 
that is the left-hand corner pagination, paragraph 5. 
MR LINNELL:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You there? 
MR LINNELL:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it reads: 
“I was contacted on 6 March 2015 by Ms Dudu 
Myeni and asked to travel the same day to Pretoria 
to attend an urgent meeting with the president.” 
20 
 
Is that what you are referring to? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is sounds like you were asked to drop 
everything and fly to Pretoria the same day and that is what 
you did.  Is that right? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 21 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say in paragraph 7 of your 
affidavit: 
“On arrival at the presidency ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before he gets to seven.  Tell me 
Mr Linnell, did you know Ms Myeni by that time?  How did 
you know her?  How come somebody could phone you in the 
10 
morning and say drop everything and come to Pretoria and 
you do exactly that? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, as I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you not have anything to do? 
[laughing] 
MR LINNELL:   No, I did have something to do Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.. 
MR LINNELL:   At the time I was engaged in a similar project 
at South African Airways in which time I would have 
interfaced with Ms Myeni on a very regular basis.  So I would 
20 
have known her relatively well.  And he(sic) phoned me and 
said could I attend an urgent meeting with the president that 
same day? 
CHAIRPERSON:   How long have you known Ms Myeni at... 
by that time?  If you are able to remember. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 22 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:   I would say three or four years.  I think, I 
stand corrected, three or four years Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you... had you been a consultant 
to the SAA or to her personally or to also another entity in 
which she was involved? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, that is correct.  Prior to 
looking... doing this contract at South African Airways, I did 
a similar one at Mhlathuze Water Board.  Ms Myeni was the 
chairman on that Water Board at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  What actual... what job did you 
10 
actually do for Mhlathuze Water Board?  Now, obviously, I 
am looking for details.  I just want present idea what you 
were doing.  Were you acting like the board’s legal advisor?  
What were you actually doing? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I acted as the coordinating 
party to an enquiry into alleged of the then chief executive 
officer which is very similar to the work that we are engaged 
with in this testimony today.   
 
That... it was not in the capacity as a legal advisor.  In 
that instance, as at SAA, here typically I would use a firm of 
20 
attorney who would work alongside with me to provide any 
legal expertise required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was... were your services required 
whenever there were allegations of misconduct or poor 
performance or similar things by employees at Mhlathuze 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 23 of 134 
 
Water Board?  Is that what would give rise to the need for 
your services? 
MR LINNELL:   Just to reiterate.  Mhlathuze Water Board, 
yes.  Subsequent to that, there were a number of other 
contracts which were unrelated that, for example, internally 
internal disciplinary hearings or such matters as sexual 
misconduct and harassment and whatever.  That there were 
different types of ... and there were small but...   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   I did sign a waiver(?) [connection not clear] 
10 
at Mhlathuze Water Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And at SAA, was it also work that 
went along the same lines that you did? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, that is correct.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
LINNELL:   Mr 
Chairman, 
at 
SAA 
that 
project 
commenced with an identical assignment which was the 
inquiry into the alleged misdemeanours against the then 
chief executive officer of that organisation.  And I draw(?) 
[connection not clear] inquiry.  Again, its professional legal 
20 
team next to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would have begun to do some work 
for SAA or Ms Dudu Myeni at SAA around what, 2013/2012, 
2011 or thereabouts? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I think it was 2014. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 24 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   I stand corrected.  I might have been 
[connection not clear] 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then at the Water Board would 
have been much earlier?  Would have been earlier than that? 
MR LINNELL:   I think that started Mr Chairman about two 
years earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   And then there was a gab in between. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now I will ask you a question that 
10 
might relate to something else that you are not going to 
testify here about but I heard a lot of evidence last year 
about the dismissal of certain managers or senior people at 
SAA and I think it was around to 2014 if I am not mistaken, 
2015.   
 
One of them was miss I think Thule Moshe(?)e if I am 
not mistaken.  Another one was Dr Dojwa(?).  Would those 
people be some of the people in which your... in respect of 
whom your services had been utilised? 
MR LINNELL:   Not directly related to their dismissals Mr 
20 
Chairman but I  was aware of both instances. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   I interacted with [connection not clear] Ms 
Ngese(?) and I never interacted with Dr Dojwa.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 25 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:   But I was aware of both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   Both instances but I was not directly 
[connection not clear] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Report.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because now we know how and when 
they... he got to know Ms Dudu Myeni...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and what it is was about. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Linnell, I do not know whether 
you are aware that it has been reported that you and mister 
or Mrs.  Ms Dudu Myeni’s Mr Fixer.  Were you aware of that? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I have seen reference to that 
been 
repeated(?) 
[connection 
not 
clear] 
correct 
Mr 
Chairman. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And were you the Fixer for Ms Dudu 
Myeni?  Do you understand what the concept means? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chair, I think it is an unreasonable 
association or narrative to put to it.  In the context that I was 
engaged with a number of instances where things were fixed 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 26 of 134 
 
in a proper sense and that might be fairly attributed.  But the 
narrative itself is... it is probably unreasonable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I should have asked this question earlier.  
How did Ms Dudu Myeni know you or your services?  Was it 
through some advertising that you did or you made a 
presentation 
and 
to 
SAA 
or 
Mhlathuze 
Water 
Board?  
Because I see you live in Cape Town and Mhlathuze Water 
Board is in KZN and SAA had offices in Joburg.   
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, at the time... the first time I 
[connection not clear] was at Mhlathuze Water Board and I 
10 
took over an assignment from a colleague.  So... well 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
you 
were 
recommended 
by 
a 
...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   A colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A colleague.  H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   [connection not clear] Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Linnell, you, I 
guess, would also be aware that this inquiry that was 
20 
intended to be undertaken at Eskom and you will talk more 
about it in due course ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am terrible sorry, Mr Seleka.  I know I 
am interrupting you again.  But I just want to ask this 
question before we go further. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 27 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have said Mr Linnell that you were a 
coordinator and you would bring in, I think, attorneys or 
lawyers who play a role in SAA, Mhlathuze.  And I know that 
in regard to Eskom too, you were said to be a coordinator.  I 
think that is how you prefer to... refer to it and you would 
bring the lawyers to assist.   
 
I kind of struggle with the need for a coordinator in these 
entities because I do not understand that there would be 
services that you could provide which attorneys would not be 
10 
able to provide.   
 
Are you able to enlighten me what your understanding 
was why Ms Dudu Myeni or the Mhlathuze Water Board and 
SAA would have felt that there was a need for your services 
in circumstances where your knowledge large was legal and 
they would not be able to dispense with the need for 
attorneys.  You would still bring attorneys to assist. 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I think the lawyers(?) 
[connection not clear] which I provided is distinct from what 
they do.  My experience and the extent(?), I would propagate 
20 
my services for, would be to provide an independent 
oversight of an inquiry of that nature.   
 
My experience is that, in any investigation it becomes, 
not my object(?) but it has a particular target or identify and 
direction.  And services that I offer would provide objectivity, 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 28 of 134 
 
it would question, it would request different angles to be 
pursued with interrogate(?) my answers given.   
 
And I think in those instances where I have worked with 
those professional(?) organisations, they would have valued 
and they do value, I think, those added value services.  They 
are different but they do add something to the task(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I must just say, I would need a lot of 
persuasion to accept that there was a need but let us go on.  
10 
Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.   
MR LINNELL:   [connection not clear] [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR LINNELL:   May I follow that Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I think it is a very distinct role 
that that services [connection not clear]  In every instance 
and the [connection not clear] of that could be with the 
people I have worked with.  It does provide an added value 
20 
service.  It does question.   
 
It does seek different [connection not clear] from it.  It 
questions. 
 
It 
enables 
you 
to 
intimate(?) 
within 
the 
forensic(?) people and the attorneys.  And it is not only an 
[connection not clear] provided services [connection not 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 29 of 134 
 
clear].  It is part of providing project management services 
which my company has better associated with.   
 
So it is not limited to the perception in that we might 
have in this instance.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  You know Mr 
Linnell, just on that line again.  You would have seen in your 
bundle the interview conducted with Paulo Sullivan.  And I 
want to just read from a page in regard to the interview 
which is page 545.  I am going to quickly read this.  You go 
10 
there Mr Linnell, 4, 5 ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   [connection not clear] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 454.  It says now: 
“Nick Linnell is Mr Fix It for Dudu Myeni.  Every time 
she gets into trouble, Nick Linnell has been running 
around, trying to put out fires and that includes at 
the Water Board in Richardsbay at SA Airways and 
as we now know here he has been assisting her in 
bullying the chairperson of Eskom and he pulled it 
off.  He makes it clear that Nick Linnell actually 
20 
drew up the suspension letters which he then served 
on those three individuals.” 
 
You want to comment to the Chairperson on this? 
MR LINNELL:   The person to whom you are referring 
[connection not clear] publishes those stories [connection 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 30 of 134 
 
not clear] to where I form my functions.  Maybe... well, 
maybe he did go and phrase Mr Fix It.  I am not sure.   
 
But certainly I have performed services, amongst others, 
[connection not clear] at state enterprises where she has in 
a functionary.  So then it is correct to the extent that I solved 
or fix problems.  If the brief is to perform a service I would 
hope(?) and expect to do that.  That would be correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it would be correct when they say: 
“Every time she gets into trouble, Nick Linnell has 
been running around, trying to put out fires and that 
10 
includes at Water Board in Richardsbay, at SA 
Airways, and as we now know, that they are 
referring now to Eskom.” 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, that is a personal narrative of 
the individual [connection not clear] that if you took it in 
isolation.  Yes, correct that I worked with Mhlathuze Water 
Board and SAA and again at Eskom.  So if that would be 
interpreted as following(?) her around and fixing problems, 
to that extent it would be correct but that might not be the 
right narrative to the functions I seek and performing. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will come back ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   They... [connection not clear] Mr Chairman, it 
purports to convey a meaning which is not correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will come back to the Eskom matter.  
Further on, on that same passage, on that same page the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 31 of 134 
 
two persons are talking in the interview 
“You say he is not a lawyer.  What exactly is he 
apart from being a Mr Fix It?” 
 
Then the response is: 
“He was a lawyer in Zimbabwe.  At that stage is was 
Rhodesia.  And he, in fact, was a magistrate in 
Rhodesia.” 
 
Is that correct that you were a magistrate? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Now let us go back to the date, 
10 
the 6t h of March 2015.  You are called by Ms Dude Myeni, as 
you say, to go to the president’s residence in Pretoria.  And 
tell us then, you did go there.  Is that correct? 
MR LINNELL:   I did Mr Chairman.  Could you just 
[connection not clear] that is correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, I will do so Mr Linnell.  That is 
on page 31.   
MR LINNELL:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 31. 
MR LINNELL:   Yes.  Yes, Mr Chairman.  The question was 
20 
after that...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You arrived at the presidency and what 
happened on the 6t h of March 2015? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I was met there by Ms Myeni in 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 32 of 134 
 
the expectation(?) of meeting the president.  She got a 
couple of hours, we just sat there in one of the empty rooms 
and she briefed me on what she said was the... what would 
be the instructions of the president in respect of an inquiry 
at Eskom.  If I... if you wish me to continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, just turn ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   That lasted a number of [connection not 
clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us start.  You arrive, you met 
with Ms Dudu Myeni at the presidency.  She started telling 
10 
you 
why, 
what this was 
all 
about.  
Just 
relate the 
conversation between the two of you as it happened as far 
as you are able to remember. 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I have to paraphrase that I 
cannot recall how it went but there would have been... there 
might been... it might even so we had a discussion on 
[connection not clear] investigation at the time.  I cannot 
recall that but at a point in time relevant to this, she 
explained in some depth that the president wanted an 
investigation into the affairs of Eskom.   
20 
 
And she had recommended to him that I would perform... 
I could perform that function.  And the purpose of me being 
there was for him to presumable consider and agree or 
otherwise to that suggestion.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it made clear to you by her Mr 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 33 of 134 
 
Linnell that what she was telling you was what was desired 
by the president? 
MR LINNELL:   Without a doubt Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the President, Mr Zuma, at the time, 
join you in that meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   No, he did not.  I think it was about four 
o’clock in the afternoon then he had left the office was his 
residence.  He had just left.  And I departed.  And in the 
process of departing, Myeni asked if I do not [connection not 
clear] attend the meeting on the 8t h which was...  
10 
 
This was Friday, the 6t h.  The 8t h would have been the 
Sunday.  If I could then again attend the meeting which was 
intended for the 6t h with him on the Sunday, the 8 t h.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   I then departed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Just before we move on.  Let me 
ask you this.  On the 6 t h, you meet with Ms Myeni and you 
meeting her at the president’s residence in Pretoria.  Is that 
correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR LINNELL:   Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you meeting her at the president’s 
residence or at the president’s office at the presidency?  I 
think the presidency... ja, the offices... the official residence, 
I think is something else. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 34 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I was [connection not clear] I 
think I have a recollection of being misdirected and I might 
have gone to which was known as the Union Buildings on the 
way but they are next to each other.  And the meeting was at 
the residence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the meeting was at Mahlamba 
Ndlopfu, at the residence? 
MR LINNELL:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  But I thought you said that at about 
four o’clock, you were told that the president had left for his 
10 
residence.  Did I misunderstand you? 
MR LINNELL:   No, that is correct but as I understood it, he 
left for his residence in Kwazulu-Natal.  So he was not... he 
was at his residence.  Apparently when I was there, that he 
was not in the rooms that we were waiting for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  So when you and Ms Myeni were 
having a meeting at the president’s residence, you got to 
understand at some stage that he was not there at the time 
as opposed to him having been there but left while you were 
waiting for him. 
20 
MR LINNELL:   When I arrived there Mr Chairman, my 
understanding he was in the residence at the meeting and 
during the course of the time that I was there, there was 
always the expectation that one would be summoned to see 
him at any moment.   
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 35 of 134 
 
 
That any moment drifted for a number of hours.  At a 
point in time, I think around four o’clock or late in the 
afternoon, it was announced that he had left that building 
and gone I think to KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LINNELL:   At which point, an arrangement was made to 
meet him on the 8 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So what then Ms 
Myeni talks with you about, it is an inquiry or you say an 
10 
investigation into Eskom’s affairs.   
MR LINNELL:   Correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not into SAA, SA Airways affairs? 
MR LINNELL:   Not at all Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did she mention anything about the 
suspension of the executives at Eskom in this meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I would imagine there was a 
discussion about suspensions because the discussion took 
place was Ms Myeni said briefing about the inquiry into 
Eskom and a discussion as to how at which the inquiry ought 
20 
to follow.   
 
So I... when I left there at four o’clock, in my mind it 
would have been both an approach that the top executives 
would be... it would be proposed that they would be 
suspended during the inquiry. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 36 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now during your conversation with Ms 
Myeni, did she tell you what problems Eskom was facing that 
needed to be dealt with? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, yes there was... there was 
quite a bit of background information provided.  As I recall 
and I did give it to your Commission.  There was... I took a 
photograph on my phone of one piece of paper which I 
subsequent 
found 
and 
sent 
to 
my 
computer 
but 
the 
photograph shows... the photograph was taken on the 6t h of 
[break in audio] and that had some details on a structure of 
10 
an enquiry.  So there would have been a discussion about 
what was to – what was expected to be taken, the 
approach to be taken for such an inquiry and that would 
have been a two way discussion, it would have been my 
suggestions as much as her suggestions.  It was a 
discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that she would have 
mentioned to you what at least some of the problems that 
she would have said Eskom was facing and she would have 
said there was a need for an investigation and she said 
20 
she had recommended you to the President as somebody 
who could conduct such an investigation.  Is that correct? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chair, I cannot recall the extent to 
which she gave me a background of the state of affairs of 
Eskom per se.  Having said that, I and every other South 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 37 of 134 
 
African, was very much aware of the state of Eskom at that 
time.  No one had any other idea than it was in a crisis and 
was in a vending(?) 01.38 national calamity(?) 01.43 so it 
did not need much elaboration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the – that Eskom was facing serious 
challenges was well-known at the time and you might not 
have asked for too much detail because you knew that 
Eskom had serious challenges, is that right? 
MR LINNELL:   Not quite, Mr Chairman, she would have 
offered [indistinct] 2.14 around insights that she might 
10 
have had.  I do not remember specifically any pertinent 
insights at that meeting that she had.  You know it was 
more – well, back on the 8 t h but she would have had some 
views on Eskom but I had a fair understanding of, as 
everyone in the country had an understanding, of what was 
going on at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did she say who had come up with the 
idea of an inquiry or an investigation at Eskom?  At that 
stage did she mention to you? 
MR LINNELL:   I cannot remember the words but there was 
20 
absolutely no idea, no other idea than she had been asked 
to broach this by the President.  So if there was one 
person who had told her to do it, it was the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, please continue, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Linnell, we 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 38 of 134 
 
understand from your statement that you also did your own 
independent what, research background research into 
Eskom’s affairs? 
MR LINNELL:   I did.  I started doing some research that 
evening and into the next day on the Saturday the 7 t h but 
that research was limited to desktop research and in media 
articles.  I went on the Eskom site and I took – printed out 
copies of some of the printouts, you know, the photographs 
of directors and maybe some structure, maybe press 
releases, I cannot remember specifically but I would have 
10 
done some more work after I left there on the 6 t h prior to 
the 8 t h. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 Yes.  So 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I think it is time for the 
break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at twenty past.  We will take the 
short tea adjournment, we will resume at twenty five to 
twelve. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 39 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Linnell you 
can hear us? 
MR LINNELL:   I can hear you Mr Chairman.    
ADV SELEKA 
SC:   Thank 
you.  Just before the 
adjournment you were talking about the desktop research 
that you did.  You mentioned looking at the structure of 
Eskom and printing out some photographs of the directors.  
Do you recall?   
MR LINNELL:      Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you have done that?  
10 
MR LINNELL:      Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Can you explain to the 
Chairperson when you doing that having in mind to identify 
who should be suspended? 
MR LINNELL:      Not specifically I was trying to gain an 
insight into company people, it was a general research 
thing but it was not with any particular thoughts.  I was 
conscious of what would be my proposal to suspend top 
executives but that would not have preoccupied the 
research.  The research was just to try and get a better 
20 
understanding of the entity and who was who.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so we getting ahead of ourselves 
but let me ask you the question because of talking about 
the executives in your supplementary affidavit there is an 
indication by you that you would have come up with the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 40 of 134 
 
areas affected by the investigation and in which the 
executives would have to be suspended.    
MR LINNELL:     Not at that stage I know on the 7 t h so on 
the 6 t h of the 7 t h I would have been conscious whether it 
was by suggestion or my own intuition that if one was 
going 
to 
investigate 
entities 
such 
as 
Eskom 
or 
the 
allegations that were found at that time.  I would propose 
that the key players were removed as a precautionary 
suspension during that investigation.       
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so that is…[intervene] 
10 
MR LINNELL:      That would be my belief.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Mr Linnell so that exercise 
you would have done after in days following shall I put it 
that way.  
MR LINNELL:    Yes out of the six.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  So going back to your 
affidavit on the 6 t h you say the President did not meet with 
you in that meeting.  You understood that he had left for 
his residence in KZN.  Can you take the Chairperson from 
that on to how the next meeting was arranged?  
20 
MR LINNELL:      When I left the Presidency on the 
afternoon of the 6 t h I was aware already, it was really clear 
in my mind I would be travelling to Durban on the 8 t h to 
their meeting.  So effectively what I thought was the 
purpose of the meeting on the 6 t h were most found and 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 41 of 134 
 
transferred to Durban on the 8 t h.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you would have understood that 
from Ms Dudu Myeni? 
MR LINNELL:      That is correct Mr Chairman.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this meeting on the 6 t h apart from 
you and Ms Dudu Myeni there was nobody else that 
attended the meeting? 
MR LINNELL:      There was no one else Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Apparently you had that discussion 
with Mr Zola Tsotsi on the 6 t h or on the 7 t h, is that right?  
10 
MR LINNELL:     Mr Chairman my person awareness of Mr 
Tsotsi would have been on the morning of the 7 t h I was 
given his cell phone number he had my number and phoned 
me and there was talk that he was also meant to be at the 
meeting on the 8 t h and I asked him during that meeting if 
he could obtain the key company documents that we would 
need if we were going to have that meeting on the 8 t h 
which he undertook to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:      At the meeting of the 6 t h of April at the 
Presidents residency between you and Ms Myeni, Ms Myeni 
20 
mentioned Mr Zola Tsotsi the Chairperson of the Eskom 
board in any way or is that something you cannot 
remember?      
MR LINNELL:      Not to my recollection I do not think his 
name was mentioned, not that I can recollect.  
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 42 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay. Alright, please continue Mr 
Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Mr Linnell the 
conversation with Mr Tsotsi how would it have come about 
if mention was not made of him in the meeting on the 6 t h 
how would your conversation with him have come about? 
MR LINNELL:      I cannot remember Mr Chairman but what 
I do recall simply because at the time I was able to look 
back at my own records I had a telephone conversation 
with him on the Saturday morning of the 7 t h.  I then recall 
10 
that with my telephone records demonstrated that so from 
that moment I had to try and work out what had been the 
conversation bearing in mind I was only reflecting on this 
maybe a year or so later it was not relevant at that time to 
think about that.  So I was having to recollect when was my 
first engagement with him regarding any other notes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it apparent from your telephone 
records who initiated the all?  
MR LINNELL:      I cannot recall that Mr Chairman I just – 
the process that I adopted is when this issue became an 
20 
issue I needed to go back and work out what had happened 
and the only way I could do that is look for source 
information on my computer and on my phone and that is 
the reason I was able to find the photograph which I had 
taken on the 6 t h and subsequently transferred that to my 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 43 of 134 
 
computer.  So much of my earlier recollections of this was 
taken from trying to find out a starting point and work back 
from then.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so what was your conversation 
with him about? 
MR LINNELL:      I cannot recall all that Mr Chairman I 
certainly it pertained to me requesting copies of corporate 
documentation which I would bring to Durban so I was 
aware that he was coming during that conversation to 
Durban and it might have only been about that time knew 
10 
he was coming to Durban.  My recollection is that I left on 
the 6 t h at that moment I did not know he was going to be 
there; I did not think that anyway.  So maybe it was an 
introductory type conversation who am I and who is he I do 
not think I met this man particularly before that and I asked 
him for the documents and that was the end of the 
conversation.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so that incident is referred to in 
paragraph 14 of your affidavit page 31 paragraph 14 which 
reads: 
20 
“During the following days Saturday 7 March 2015 
of course which is not inserted there.  Mr Tsotsi 
either called me or I was provided his contact 
number 
but 
I 
requested 
from 
him 
company 
documents and policies which would be required for 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 44 of 134 
 
proposing the enquiry and its terms.  During the 
exchange it was evident he would be able, he would 
also be at the meeting in Durban on Sunday 8 
March 2015.” 
Do you see that?    
MR LINNELL:      Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well I would have asked you who 
provided you with his number.  
MR LINNELL:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I would be asking you who 
10 
provided you with the number. 
MR LINNELL:   I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When one  looks at paragraph 14 Mr 
Linnell one gets the impression that the person who had 
the need for a conversation or a discussion was you rather 
than him, because you point out that you requested from 
him company documents and policies, that might suggest 
that you would have called, because you wanted to get 
those documents in preparation for the meeting in Durban 
the following day.  Does that help you remember whether 
20 
you called him or it doesn’t help you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I don’t think – I don’t think that 
would be a correct assumption, I am stating in that 
paragraph that arising out of that conversation I asked him 
for documents.  He might have phoned me and I might have 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 45 of 134 
 
phoned him, it wasn’t particularly relevant to me who 
initiated the call at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and the documentation were 
exchanged with you, you did receive documentation from 
him? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman the next morning, and it might 
be referred to in one of the documents, but I go from 
recollection, so the next morning which would be Sunday 
morning when I was travelling to Durban for this scheduled 
10 
meeting he sent me delegations of authority documents, I 
think there were two, and that’s the only ones I got as I 
recall from Mr Tsotsi at that time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, just to assist you Mr Nick Linnell 
we have emails sent to you on page 530 and 520 by email 
dated 8 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 530, which is the first email, 
according to the timestamp and then page 529.  Let’s start 
at page 530 Mr Linnell. 
20 
MR LINNELL:    I am just getting there, I’m nearly ready. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright. 
MR LINNELL:   I can carry on because I recollect the 
documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the email comes from Mr Zola 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 46 of 134 
 
Tsotsi, 
it 
is 
addressed 
to 
yourself, 
NickL@theprojectoffice.co.za 8 March 2015, the timestamp 
is 11:57:57 it says: 
“Hi Nick, 
Herewith are the docs as discussed. 
Regards, 
Zola” 
Now it is not apparent from this email what ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   That is correct I would have re ... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Carry on. 
10 
MR LINNELL:   Yes, I did, that was the document I 
received and together as attachments on that document 
were the delegations of authority ...[indistinct – break in 
audio] 
and 
the 
delegated 
powers 
...[indistinct] 
or 
procedures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, there’s another email if you to 
page 529, page 529 so it’s the page before, the time was 
...[intervenes]    
MR LINNELL: That was 5:29.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes the timestamp on that one is 
20 
11:59:19, so it would have come after the one we referred 
to just now. 
MR LINNELL:   That ...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that one seems to be specifically 
dealing with the delegation of authority, also on the 8 t h of 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 47 of 134 
 
March 2015, do you see that? 
MR LINNELL:   I am looking at page 531, am I on the 
wrong page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   529. 
MR LINNELL:   530, 529? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   Yes 529 is the one I have just referred to, 
attached to that document I did get that, and I got the 
delegations of authority and it had annexures attached to 
that email, I see that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, if you go – if you could please go 
back to page 530. 
MR LINNELL:   530? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, where the email simply says: 
“Here are the docs as discussed.” 
You are there? 
MR LINNELL:  [No audible response] yes I received a – I 
received – I believe I received that email and there’s no 
attachments.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that’s what I was going to ask you 
20 
about.   
MR LINNELL:   There’s no attach ... – sorry?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I said that is exactly what I was going 
to ask you about. 
MR LINNELL:   I believe I received that email but there 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 48 of 134 
 
were no attachments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Shall we move on then to 
the meeting on Sunday 8 March 2015.  Were you travelling 
from Cape Town to Durban? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Jo’burg? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or was it from Jo’burg? 
MR LINNELL:   Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, did you go back to Cape Town on 
the 5 t h? 
10 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I don’t know why I thought 
you travelled from Jo’burg to Durban, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Linnell what time was the meeting – 
or no let me ask you this way, what time did you arrive 
more or less at the President’s residence in Durban? 
MR LINNELL:   I think it was probably about just before 
midday, thereabouts.  I think just – or thereabouts to 
midday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What time had the meeting been 
scheduled for? 
MR LINNELL:   I cannot recall Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I guess whatever time it was 
probably you were not late, probably you came more or 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 49 of 134 
 
less on time? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chair I didn’t – my experience with 
meetings such as this and from my experience the day 
before the scheduled of the meeting does not necessarily 
dictate when it starts, so I got there, I took the earliest 
flight to get there and I went straight there, it’s the 
presidency in Durban North, Morningside I think it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Morningside would not be Durban 
10 
North, but it is in Durban, Morningside, Gauteng as, 
Jo’burg has their Morningside too. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair.  Yes, did you hear Mr 
Linnell, we can carry on. 
MR LINNELL:   I didn’t hear, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I was saying Morningside in Durban 
is not in Durban North but Morningside is in Durban and 
Gauteng has got its own Morningside too. 
MR LINNELL:   Yes, it was the one in Durban correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, a flashy suburb Mr Linnell. 
20 
MR LINNELL:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A flashy suburb.   
MR LINNELL:   I missed that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A flashy suburb. 
MR LINNELL:   I cannot hear that. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 50 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says a flashy suburb.  A flashy 
suburb. 
MR LINNELL:   Oh, a flashy suburb.  Mr Chairman to 
digress the house is not flashy State property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay [laughing]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well I hope you are going to hear me, I 
am carrying on.  When you arrived at the President’s 
residence who do you find there? 
MR LINNELL:   To my recollection there was Ms Dudu 
Myeni,  Mr Tsotsi, Ms Dudu Myeni’s son, Thalente, and 
10 
another gentleman whose name I recollected or discovered 
later called Jabu, so that was the group that met. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you go right away into the meeting 
upon your arrival? 
MR LINNELL:   Did I sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you go right away into the meeting 
upon your arrival? 
MR LINNELL:   We went straight into the meeting on my 
arrival.   I recollect it was just in one of those ante rooms 
and everyone congregated in that room and then there 
20 
followed a discussion.  It wasn’t a formal, I think it was like 
a lounge. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was the President part of that group 
upon your arrival.    
MR LINNELL:   He was not no Mr Chairman. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 51 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when you arrived at the President’s 
private residence who welcomed you? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
said 
private 
residence 
...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL: Just to clarify that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said private residence, I think it is 
an official residence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it the official residence, the 
President’s official residence or was it a private residence?   
10 
MR LINNELL:    Yes it is the State House correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The State House okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I beg your pardon. 
MR LINNELL:   I think Ms Myeni welcomed me and she was 
the call it the coordinator of that meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you say that Mr Linnell, 
namely that she was the coordinator of that meeting you 
must be quite clear what you are talking about because 
you know what a coordinator does, isn’t it?  
20 
MR LINNELL:   I think in terms of coordinating insofar as 
what I deem as general become relevant as we get into 
this, further into my affidavit but her coordination was call 
it the chairman or the person facilitating the meeting, I 
would call her a facilitator, probably not coordinator. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 52 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  So she would 
have – I mean using those concepts, coordinator/facilitator 
she would have arranged this meeting. 
MR LINNELL:   Most definitely.   Well I say most definitely 
Mr Chairman that is my perception yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Certainly, as far as you were concerned 
because she was the one who asked you to come to the 
meeting in Durban.    
MR LINNELL:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Mr 
Linnell 
just 
relate 
to 
the 
Chairperson then what gets to be discussed in this 
meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   It was – my understanding in advance was 
to discuss the details of the proposed inquiry and to meet 
the President with regard to discussing the proposed 
approach to it, so it was to meet the President, but it was 
also to meet and discuss what we were going to say to the 
President. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, so this time around you went into 
20 
the details of the inquiry is that correct? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And is it correct also that this time 
around the suspension would not have been pointedly 
discussed? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 53 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you recall how many executives it 
was envisaged would be suspended? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh Mr Seleka can we do it this way, can 
you tell me the main features of the discussion that took 
place in that meeting?  The main points that were 
discussed at that meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman I think to start off there was a 
discussion about the state of Eskom and to my recollection 
Jabu had some documents, one of which I saved to my 
10 
computer on that same day and I provided the Commission 
with that document, and that related to – that document, 
that was one document but there was discussion around 
some documents which referred to the state of Eskom at 
that time so discussion around what was happening at 
Eskom was part of the discussion and that led to an 
affirmation that an inquiry into Eskom would be what was 
the proposal and from that moment we went on to discuss 
in the same session what would the appropriate approach 
would be to that inquiry, with the expectation that this 
20 
would be put to the President for his assent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the discussion was that there would 
be an inquiry at Eskom and that this would be put to the 
President, is that right? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 54 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   If I might – sorry if I might mention Mr 
Chairman it wasn’t so much a gathering to work out a 
proposal to propose to the President, it was – the 
expectation was make sure that the proposal we give the 
President fits his expectation, so it was preparatory to 
discussing it with the President, rather than a discussion to 
have an inquiry and then let’s put it to the President as a 
sequel, it was preparatory to a meeting with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see you don’t mention anything 
10 
suspension of executives, when I asked you to tell me the 
main features of or points of that conversation.  Is that 
because there was no discussion about the suspension of 
some or certain executives? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman there was definitely a 
extended discussion about suspension, it would have 
started with the principle of suspensions and why that was 
a good approach and then it would have been given that 
suspensions were a good approach which functionaries 
would be the appropriate people to suspend and that being 
20 
premised on the heads of those departments which one 
would be looking into and subsequent to that, and I think it 
was part of that same conversation the names of those 
individuals in those positions would have been provided, 
but it started off as saying there must be an – there has to 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 55 of 134 
 
be an inquiry the inquiry needs to have the people in key 
positions set aside for the duration of the inquiry, which 
functionaries should that be and then finally who are those 
functionaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so why did you not mention the 
suspensions as having been discussed as well earlier on? 
MR LINNELL:   Did I not do that Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You didn’t, that is why I asked you and 
yet I think it is such an important item, you didn’t mention 
it, that is why I asked you whether the reason why you did 
10 
not mention it was because it was not discussed. 
MR LINNELL:   Can I reflect in my statements but ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can refresh your memory. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Should I assist? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can assist. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Linnell you can turn to page 26.2, 
that is of your supplementary statement. 
MR LINNELL:  I am looking at black numbers which page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  26.2.  Paragraph 12. 
MR LINNELL:  The black numbers. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Black numbers – we will be referring to the 
black numbers all the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If I may repeat again 26.2. 
MR LINNELL:  Page 26.2? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes paragraph 12. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 56 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  Oh.  Ja – sorry it is – I have got a hard copy 
of that document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh.  That will be page 2 of it.  Page 2 of 
that document. 
MR LINNELL:  And I am looking at paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  12.  It reads: 
“Suspension…” 
MR LINNELL:  Thank you [00:01:15] paragraph 12 reads: 
“Suspensions were considered during the 
meeting 
of 
the 
8 
March. 
 
Cautionary 
10 
suspensions would have been a standard 
approach that I would have considered.  I 
would have considered key areas of the 
business that the inquiry would focus on and 
also were there any particular and anyone in 
particular in those areas may have had the 
propensity to interfere or have a such a 
presence as to create the perception of 
potentially impeding the investigation.” 
So thank you Mr Chairman I did mean to mention it; it is my 
20 
statement that we discussed suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now in this meeting do you 
remember what points you might have – what important 
points you might have made yourself during that discussion 
and on what issues they related to? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 57 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman yes I would have had in my 
mind fixed perceptions of my preferred approach and as we 
will see from my statement as we go through it there was – 
and it was mentioned in the presence of the President later 
on that there were certain conditions [00:02:41] was going to 
do an inquiry of this nature.  For example it had to be 
independent; it had to be external; it had to be transparent; 
it had to – it had to be free of internal and external 
influences.  Those – those were con – not conditions they 
were proposals that I said would need to be in an inquiry of 
10 
this nature.  And they were discussed and they were further 
mentioned in the presence of the President when he joined 
the meeting – or when – when he joined the meeting later.  
So yes – ja I gave certain … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did the President join the meeting at 
some stage? 
MR LINNELL:  Yes maybe it was an hour or two later Mr 
Chairman I cannot recall but it was – it was period later.  I 
think early in the afternoon he – we were in one room and we 
were then told to go to another room and he joined in that 
20 
other room.  So we got to the other room first; he then joined 
it.  It was another lounge environment and the group then 
presented to him the proposed inquiry’s approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it looks like there were two meetings.  
The one without the President in one room and another 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 58 of 134 
 
meeting in another room with the President but discussing 
the same issues.  Obviously can – the second one can be 
seen maybe as a continuation of the first one but the 
composition of the people who attended the one meeting 
excluded the President and the composition of the second 
meeting included the President, is that right? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct Mr Chairman.  So he was in – 
he was added to the second meeting but it was not so much 
a continuation it was – the first meeting was to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like a caucus? 
10 
MR LINNELL:  To agree a consensus – inform him what was 
going to be proposed.  So he – he was not involved in a 
discussion as much as this is what is proposed and he asked 
a number of – a limited number of questions as I recall and 
then he agreed and that agreement included agreement that 
certain – each of the people in that meeting needed to do 
certain subsequent steps thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just to separate.  Let us finish off 
with the meeting without the President.  So what was the 
conclusion 
of 
that 
meeting 
that 
did 
not 
involve 
the 
20 
President? 
MR LINNELL:  That there would be an – that it would be 
proposed to the President that there would be an inquiry.  
That I would coordinate that inquiry.  That it would be an in-
depth inquiry and all the things I had just mentioned and 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 59 of 134 
 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transparency. 
MR LINNELL:  Top three executives would be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And… 
MR LINNELL:  And if I might further add that all this was 
context on the basis that the proposals included that the 
President would be asked to seek the agreement or 
consensus with the Minister; the Chairman would seek the 
support and agreement of the board.  And they were – and in 
addition to that it would require the approvals as necessary 
10 
of the Minister of Finance.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now at that first meeting you said the 
people who attended were yourself, Ms Myeni, Mr Zola 
Tsotsi, Ms Myeni’s son, Thalente as well as another man you 
referred to as Jabu, is that correct? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  In that meeting you said that Ms 
Myeni played the role of I think Chairperson or – or 
facilitator, is that correct? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct.  Well it was an informal 
20 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR LINNELL:  But she was – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The meeting centred around – she was the 
person who was directing the discussion or not really? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 60 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now you – you did speak at that 
meeting, did you? 
MR LINNELL:  I did correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And… 
MR LINNELL:  Significantly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Zola Tsotsi also speak at the 
meeting – at that meeting? 
MR LINNELL:  He did yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Thalente? 
10 
MR LINNELL:  Correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Thalente speak at that meeting? 
MR LINNELL:  Not to my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And did … 
MR LINNELL:  I am not sure what he was there for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But did Jabu speak at that meeting 
as well? 
MR LINNELL:  Very much Sir.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LINNELL:  I think he would be in the source of a lot of 
20 
the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now did you end up finding out what 
his surname was – Jabu or did you not get to know that? 
MR LINNELL:  I do not – I do not recall ever asking who he 
was other than – I was introduced to him by name but after 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 61 of 134 
 
that I did not recollect his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LINNELL:  I only recollected his name when I was 
looking at the documents.  But he – my perception during 
that meeting of who he was was maybe incorrectly but like 
secret service.  He had very incisive information about 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LINNELL:  Which to me would have been someone who 
had internal knowledge of Eskom’s workings. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Now when … 
MR LINNELL:  But that was just a perception in my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now when the meeting moved to 
another room where you were joined by the former President 
did all of you move into that other room including Ms Myeni’s 
son and Jabu? 
MR LINNELL:  I believe so yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Linnell was 
this your first meeting with Mr Tsotsi in terms of you firstly.. 
20 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct Mr Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were meeting him for the first time? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were the issues pertaining to load 
shedding touched upon in this meeting? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 62 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  They would have been one of the biggest 
concerns discussed at that meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And who would have spoken about the 
issues pertaining to load shedding of those present in the 
meeting? 
MR LINNELL:  I cannot recall specifically – it was a 
consensus of view that load shedding and the risk of a so 
called blackout were very much on everyone’s minds at the 
time.  So I do not think anyone came with the view of an 
agenda point of load shedding so much as it was on 
10 
everyone’s mind that load shedding was a major risk. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay are you still on that statement 
because I could pick it up from there and see what – whether 
this cannot jolt your memory.  On that same page or in the 
bundle is 26.2 it is page 2 on your separate document – 
paragraph 10.  Well let me start at 9 it says – 8 I beg your 
pardon it say: 
“However Mr Tsotsi’s reference to Ms Myeni 
at the meeting jogged my memory with 
regard to another person present but not 
20 
mentioned by Mr Tsotsi.  A young black 
African male possibly named Jabu.  He was 
not specifically introduced but clearly he had 
insight and sources of people at Eskom.  In 
addition Jabu I think had a number of 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 63 of 134 
 
documents that dealt with alleged events at 
Eskom.  These were largely from unidentified 
sources and unverified content.  These were 
things that an investigation would identify but 
in part some of the allegations did not 
provide some value in scoping an approach 
to the investigation.” 
Does this help you remember who would have talked about 
load shedding – issues relating to load shedding? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman to the extent that Jabu might 
10 
have mentioned anything specific related to load shedding it 
would have been in relation to Duvha or Kusile or Madupe 
and the problems that they were having.  So there would not 
have been about load shedding but they would have been 
the inherent causes of load shedding.  So I would have 
thought he had some insights into at that level load shedding 
was the culmination of the problems within Eskom as 
opposed to the issue itself.  We were going to investigate 
why there was load shedding not that there was load 
shedding. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  So the President then meets or 
comes to join you at some point and you move into a 
difference room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they move into a different room first 
and then the President joins. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 64 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes did you hear what the Chairperson 
said? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am saying they moved to a different 
room first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the President joins in that room. 
MR LINNELL:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said the President joins and then they 
move to a different room? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I am looking at… 
10 
MR LINNELL:  I think this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which – which is which?  Did the President 
join you first and then you moved to another room or did you 
move to another room and the President joined you in that 
room? 
MR LINNELL:  The latter Mr Chairman.  That is – I think 
[00:15:14] in the meeting room before he comes in and so 
you are waiting his presence.  I think that is the way they 
like to do it.  There was no – otherwise he could have joined 
the room we were in but we had to go to another room and 
20 
he joined us in that room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson.  So 
when he joined – when he joins then in the other room you – 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 65 of 134 
 
you present to him what the – the group without him had 
discussed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe let us start with – I am sorry I 
am interrupting Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that when you – that is your group 
now you and the other people who had attended the first 
meeting when you came to the other room now where the 
President subsequently joined you I take it that you had 
finished talking about what you were going to propose or tell 
10 
the President and whatever discussion might have happened 
it was just some discussion but otherwise you had – you had 
had enough time to finalise what you would have been telling 
him.  Is that right? 
MR LINNELL:  Yes Mr Chairman I think what – if I recollect, 
we would have almost run out of a conversation before we 
went to this other room so there was a sense of waiting for 
the moment when we met the President.  It was not just that 
we had not concluded we had – we had wrapped up the 
conversation while we were waiting for his meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how long did the first meeting take if 
you are able to remember? 
MR LINNELL:  I would have left there around four o’clock'ish 
and if we got there at about elevenish the whole lot had been 
about four or five hours.  So – but a lot of that – this meeting 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 66 of 134 
 
was not like sitting around a board meeting.  This was a 
discussion so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were discussing. 
MR LINNELL:  There were times that.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as you were together. 
MR LINNELL:  The conversation [00:17:55]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as you were together? 
MR LINNELL:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but when you moved to the other 
room are you able to say that you had been in the first room 
10 
for about an hour or two hours or three hours or are you not 
able to say? 
MR LINNELL:  I would say three or four hours it had been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you moved to the other room. 
MR LINNELL:  But if I might Mr Chairman in the other room 
the people I mentioned were in the other room for about 
three or four hours.  Now Mr Chairman I say that – that does 
not necessarily imply a productive four or five hour meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR LINNELL:  In that time there was a lot of waiting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  No, no that is alright.  And 
then the time you spent in the second room now before the 
President came are you able to indicate it was thirty 
minutes, fifteen minutes or an hour or are you not able to 
say that? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 67 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  Maybe five minutes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR LINNELL:  Almost immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  And then that meeting now the 
second meeting how long did it take if you are able to give 
an estimate before you concluded and could leave? 
MR LINNELL:  Thirty minutes maybe Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About thirty minutes? 
MR LINNELL:  It was not long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not long.  Okay alright. 
10 
MR LINNELL:  It was not long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  And in this meeting 
Mr Linnell what gets to be discussed with the President? 
MR LINNELL:  It was – it was more a presentation to him 
that this was the proposed approach.  So I think the 
expectation I would imagine in his mind was there is going to 
be an investigation; how are you going to do it?  Rather than 
– that would have been the nature of it.  It was a discussion 
about this is the proposed approach. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So the question was not should we 
have an investigation or not?  It was a question of we are 
going to have it but how are we going to – how are we going 
to carry it out? 
MR LINNELL:  I would think that is a great spec to correct 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 68 of 134 
 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During that second meeting when you say 
it took about thirty minutes was the President in that meeting 
for more or less that time? 
MR LINNELL:  Well Mr Chairman we went into that room and 
I think we probably waited for him absent-mindedly with 
nothing to talk about for about five minutes.  It was – we 
were waiting for his entrance.  Then when he entered he was 
probably there with us for thirty minutes and then he left and 
then we left. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so the thirty minutes – so he would 
have spent about twenty-five minutes or so with you in the 
meeting but when he left that was the end of the meeting and 
you left. 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  It will come back to 
you.  Mr Linnell – so I asked about an inquiry along with that 
I want to ask about the suspension; was that also discussed 
in the presence of the President? 
20 
MR LINNELL:  It was correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take it that the group which had 
attended the first meeting made a presentation to the 
President to say; we have had a discussion these are the 
main points that we – we think – this is what we need to – 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 69 of 134 
 
needs to be done.  This is what we believe needs to be 
done?  Is that how it happened? 
MR LINNELL:  Correct Mr Chairman.  I think the introductory 
would have been done by Ms Myeni and as I recall her kind 
of jovial banter.  It is was not in a sense austere because we 
had – there was a jovial nature to it and – but he knew what 
the meeting was about and it was not as if why are you here 
to tell me?  It was – it was the extension of what are you 
here to tell me?  So I think Ms Myeni probably started that 
but everyone had a say in that probably Jabu might have – 
10 
he might not even have said anything in that meeting, I 
cannot remember.  Though he was present in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not having said anything? 
MR LINNELL:  So people who [00:23:35] I am sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Jabu might not have attended 
the second meeting? 
MR LINNELL:  No, no he attended the meeting but I do not 
recollect him being a vocal person in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LINNELL:  That might have been – that might have been 
20 
a cultural subservience I am not sure but the people who 
spoke more at that meeting would have been Ms Myeni, Mr 
Tsotsi and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Tsotsi gave evidence here and 
said when the President came in he spoke in Isi-Zulu and 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 70 of 134 
 
said [African language] or something to that effect.  Now I do 
not know whether you know Isi-Zulu or not?  Do you 
remember whether the President said anything in Isi-Zulu 
when he came in? 
MR LINNELL:  No I would not remember Mr Chairman it – it 
– there was a jovial on introduction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR LINNELL:  That what anyone said in that introduction I 
would not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No that is fine [African 
10 
language] would have – would have been what are we talking 
about or what is the discussion about?  But Mr Tsotsi also 
said it was quite clear that the former President knew exactly 
what the issues were which is what you are saying as well. 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman if that is the interpretation of 
what he said to Mr Tsotsi then it was not in that context.  It 
was quite clear that we all knew what we were discussing 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
MR LINNELL:  It could have been… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think Mr Tsotsi said that the former 
President did say in Isi-Zulu something to the effect that or 
asking what the discussion was about.  But Mr Tsotsi also 
followed up by saying it was quite clear he knew what the 
meeting was about and what the issues were. That is what 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 71 of 134 
 
he said.  So that latter part seems to be consistent with what 
you are saying as well. 
MR LINNELL:  Mr Chairman I think it goes further saying [?] 
absolutely I agree with Mr Tsotsi but the – the context of the 
meetings before that and even on the 6t h the context was Mr 
– the President wants an investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR LINNELL:  It was not – it was not as if one was going to 
say to him; we have got a good idea we are going to have 
this investigation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LINNELL:  The context was the President wants an 
investigation into Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So as you say in your 
affidavit Mr Linnell the President was clearly familiar with the 
purpose of the meeting? 
MR LINNELL:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If the question is asked Mr Linnell that 
did you at any stage ask yourself or even ask Ms Myeni you 
20 
are not at Eskom you are at SAA how is it that you are 
coordinating or facilitating or convening this meeting – 
meetings that would deal with issues pertaining to Eskom 
and not SAA?  Did you ask yourself that question or did you 
ask Ms Myeni that question? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 72 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  I did not ask her the question but only 
because I would have in my mind have a clear understanding 
of the answer to that question had I asked.  In my mind Ms 
Myeni is and publicly said to be a close confidant and 
political ally of the President and to the extent that she is 
also the SAA Chairman is because she has a confidant and 
political ally of the President.  And so her role there was not 
as the Chairman of SAA she was there because of the same 
reasons that she is the Chairman of SAA it is because she is 
the confident and political ally of the President.  So whether 
10 
she was doing his bidding insofar as Eskom or SAA or 
anywhere else that was my understanding.  So she was not 
there – had nothing to do with SAA she was there because 
she was his intermediary and she plays that same role in 
other domains.  It does not need to ask the question that 
was very clear in my mind why that was the case. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  So you say she played the same 
role in other domains? 
MR LINNELL:  In the sense that she has been the Chairman 
of [00:29:28] she has been the Chairman of SAA and 
20 
possibly other entities but I was – I was very conscious of 
the fact that she is politically connected and to that point as 
we go through this you will see right from that moment I was 
conscious of – we were dealing with an entity but there were 
politically connected personalities involved, and from the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 73 of 134 
 
moment of my first memorandum to the board and throughout 
to the terms of reference, they imposed certain degrees and 
independence, objectivity, impartiality and remunerational 
division(?) of any vertical interference.  So I was conscious 
of the dynamics at that meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   And they carried through into what I did 
afterwards. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But is it not ironical that this... I 
mean the very conduct on their part smacked as political 
10 
interference, nothing else? 
MR LINNELL:   It could do if you look in retrospect but at the 
time, my perception was this is excellent that the president 
who is duty bound to sort out these things is taken an 
imitative and doing something.  And in my mind, having an 
inquiry into Eskom, was a very necessary and urgent activity.  
Insofar as it might also been vertically motivated, I would 
have been conscious of the vertical(?) connection of it all 
because we all are.  And because of that, I would made sure 
in what I did, those connection were limited.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Some of us have no political connection. 
MR LINNELL:   I will not [connection not clear]  Well, it did...  
Mr Chairman, at political... everything in this country has a 
political undertone to it.  And one comes to anticipate that.   
 
And in this instance, I was conscious of that and I made 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 74 of 134 
 
sure that what I thought would limit that over the course of 
the inquiry would be limited.  But it was not like a threat.  It 
was not something that... I was just aware of it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   Some of my mind [connection not clear]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, one would expect the president 
of the country to be concerned with challenges in an entity 
such as Eskom, is it not? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, in my mind, this was exactly 
that he(?) ought to be doing.  This was his... I think we heard 
10 
on the texts(?).  This was his job.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Of course ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   This is what was expected of him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, how he or she or whoever the 
president is those(?) about handling, that might be a 
different thing but being concerned about what is happening 
at Eskom would be legitimate.  Would you expect that? 
MR LINNELL:   I lost your... the last point Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am saying.  How a president, whether it 
is he or she, handles issues relating to Eskom might be a 
20 
different issue but that a president should be concerned 
about challenges at an entity such as Eskom, would be a 
legitimate concern.  Is that right? 
MR LINNELL:   It should very much be.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 75 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes.  May I develop 
that point, Mr Linnell?  Because, it is one thing to express 
concern.  It is another thing how you deal with the issue.  
You understand that? 
MR LINNELL:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You cannot ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  We have included in your bundle.  
Ms 
Myeni’s 
statement 
to 
the 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
Committee.  And I want to make reference to that statement 
10 
because in her statement she says the president was not 
involved in these meetings.  Well, in particular, the meeting 
in Durban.  You have seen that? 
MR LINNELL:   Yes, I have seen that, correct.  Well, not 
correct.  I have seen it in her statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But she also says, why would the 
president meddle, and I am paraphrasing, meddle in the 
manner in which it is alleged by Mr Tsotsi?  The president 
should write to the minister and say propose certain steps to 
be taken.  So this goes to the ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR LINNELL:   Can I comment on...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Sorry, let me give you a chance. 
MR LINNELL:   To comment on that.  I did see what she said 
in her statement.  I would not agree with that.  I think it is...  
 
My perception is whether the president works directly 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 76 of 134 
 
through his ministers or he works in parallels, it is his 
discretion.  As long as he does it for the right reasons, the 
right purposes.   
 
So in this case, one might think the minister should have 
been in that meeting.  That did not perplex me one little bit.  
To my mind, he was taking an initiative.  That is what he 
should be doing.   
 
But I went to that meeting, one of the requirements that 
is not disrespectful was the president had contact the 
minister to share the discussions with her and in a sense 
10 
seek her concurrence to it.   
 
That was an outcome deliverable on that meeting with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now this point where Ms Myeni says in her 
statement Mr Zuma did not take part in that meeting and you 
say he did take part and you were both, that is yourself and 
Ms Myeni were in the same meeting, is quite strange.  Are 
you quite clear in your own mind that President Zuma was at 
that meeting and took part in the meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   Without any doubt Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you able to remember some of the 
points he raised or some of the questions he asked?  And if 
so, tell me. 
MR LINNELL:   I can tell you the gist of it Mr Chairman but I 
cannot [connection not clear] ...[intervenes]  
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 77 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I do not mean ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   He would be a man of [connection not clear] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not mean you must be... you must tell 
me verbatim.  I do not mean verbatim.  I just mean, you can 
just tell me the points in your own words.   
MR LINNELL:   Ja, the gist of it was, he asked, I would say 
half a dozen questions and that was it and then finally he 
said:  I would... and I am paraphrasing what he said at the 
end.  “Go and do it.”  Something like that.  But his 
10 
contribution to the meeting would have been five or six 
questions which I assumed at the time were kind of testing 
his understanding of what he was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka will ask you also about 
Ms Myeni’s version about her son having been there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may I allow the Chair to do so? 
[laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Ms Myeni also denies that her 
son, Thalente, was at the meeting.  What do you say about 
that?  You said her son, Thalente, was at the meeting.  She 
20 
says, no her son was not at the meeting.  What do you say 
about that? 
MR LINNELL:   My recollection, he was at the meeting.  But I 
think I said in my statement, he was present at the meeting.  
He was not a participant in the meeting. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 78 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think you say ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   ...if that makes any sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say he did not play any active role.  
He was just present. 
MR LINNELL:   He was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   It was as if... as if he was in his normal 
surroundings.  It was not... he would just quite comfortable 
just be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, you also told... you testified 
10 
that there was this other gentleman referred to as Jabu.  Mr 
Tsotsi gave evidence and said he knows Jabu quite well.  I 
think he said.  But he says he has no recollection that Jabu 
was at that meeting.  What do you say about that? 
MR LINNELL:   My recollection is that Jabu was at that 
meeting and [connection not clear] at the meeting.  I did not 
know that... I was not aware that Mr Tsotsi knew Jabu.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Linnell, talking of 
Jabu which you subsequently did a Google search and you 
20 
found that he is Jabu Maswanganyi.  Was this your first and 
last time you met with him? 
MR LINNELL:   When I did my submission originally to 
parliament, I had no recollection of hearing or seeing him 
again.  So it was when I found the document which is part of 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 79 of 134 
 
the bundle and I did the necessary search on, that gave me 
and the name... that led me to take who he was and that led 
me to ultimately concluded he was either in Johannesburg at 
Mr Tsoti’s house the next week when we had the various 
meetings on the 9 t h, 10t h, 11t h.   
 
My recollection, he would have probably been there but I 
would not swear to it that he was definitely there.  But I 
communicated via email with him in the subsequent weeks 
but that is...  
 
Because I found the documents, not that I originally 
10 
recollected communicating with him.  My recollection came 
from me finding documents where he and I have exchanged 
emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR LINNELL:   The following week. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So let us be clear on that.  You know 
from your emails that you did exchange emails with him after 
the 8t h of Mach 2015? 
MR LINNELL:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So there are emails exchange between 
20 
the two of you? 
MR LINNELL:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You have a faint recollection that 
you might have met with him at Mr Tsotsi’s house in Joburg? 
MR LINNELL:   If anyone deny that, I am not going to get 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 80 of 134 
 
into an argument with them about that but my sense is, if I ... 
for example, if I can answer it this way.  When I was told 
about the meeting, the so-called secret(?) of meeting on the 
16t h.   
 
My recollection is probably, he told me about that 
meeting which would have been a verbal communication 
because that is not writing.   
 
So when I put all that together and my sense is, he 
would have been... he would have passed through Mr 
Tsotsi’s house at a time that I would have been there in that 
10 
or the subsequent week.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So with regard to whether you met him at 
Mr Tsotsi’s house after the 8t h of March 2018, you are not 
sure about that.  But with regard to whether he attended the 
meeting in Durban, are you... are you sure about that?  You 
are not sure about that as well or what is the position? 
MR LINNELL:   I am sure about that.  And what reinforces 
that in my mind is the document I saved on my computer on 
the 8t h. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   It originates from him as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   So in a sense, if and one’s own memory, you 
need to 
corroborate 
a 
perception, it 
corroborated my 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 81 of 134 
 
perception. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, do you know where that 
document is in the bundle that Mr Linnell is talking about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be good to identify it now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair thank you.  Let me...  I want 
to find it.  Mr Linnell, if you could assist.  I ...[intervenes]  
MR LINNELL:   I am just looking for it now.  I think it is in 
the... probably in the original parliamentary annexures.  It 
could be attached to the second supplementary if I recall.  
10 
Or the third... the second supplementary, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second.  Yes, the second 
supplementary only deals with your identification of him. 
MR LINNELL:   You can ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of Mr Jabu Maswanganyi.   
MR LINNELL:   Ja, that is the document we are talking 
about.  I will have to find it.  It is in the bundle, I am pretty 
sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just remind me.  What does it deal with 
it again? 
20 
MR LINNELL:   I am sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just remind me, what does it deal with? 
MR LINNELL:   So the documents pertain to Koeberg and 
maybe Kusile, a couple of the power stations.   
 
But it is clearly dated prior to, I think, May 2014 because 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 82 of 134 
 
it talks to maintenance at Koeberg to be done in May 2014.  
So the document itself was not a recent document but the 
report of the document was to lay blame at the doors of two 
of the executives.  Those two was subsequently suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   Chairperson, who ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but are we able to find the document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we able to find the actual document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is... it should be here Chairperson.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe we can continue and somebody 
might assist to look for it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, my investigator will obtain the 
document Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe we can go back to it after 
lunch because ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it is five to one.  So maybe you can just 
move to other questions.  Then after lunch we can go back to 
it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Linnell, I just 
wanted to quickly put through the version of Ms Dudu Myeni 
and then we can move on to you because according to her, 
this meeting that Mr Tsotsi had with her in Durban, it was 
because Mr Tsotsi was concerned about his own position that 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 83 of 134 
 
the board was seeking to pass a motion of no confidence 
into him.  Was that issue discussed in your meeting in 
Durban? 
MR LINNELL:   Definitely not.  The first I heard about that 
was when I read the statement.  That statement seems to 
suggest that there was a prior meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   And I never heard about that either. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Ms Myeni never mentioned to you 
either on this the 6t h of March when you met her in Pretoria 
10 
or the 7t h of March or the 8t h of March in Durban, did she 
never say anything that indicated that these meetings were 
taken 
place 
because 
Mr 
Tsotsi 
had 
been 
asking 
for 
assistance or guidance or advice from her as to how to 
handle certain issues at Eskom? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, to the contrary.  My perception 
was Mr Tsotsi is more than an unwilling participant in that 
meeting.  He was doing his duty by being there but I think he 
was uncomfortable being there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR LINNELL:   So if you... yes, it was at his behest the 
meeting was taking place.  I would not agree with his 
behaviour being inconformity with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say his demeanour at the meeting 
then there and the discussions gave you the impression that 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 84 of 134 
 
he was really a reluctant participant in the meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   I do not want to place it too strongly Mr 
Chairman but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   ... I think he was uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think it could be something that 
part(?) he had? 
MR LINNELL:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LINNELL:   Correct.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LINNELL:   But Mr Chairman, it was not pertaining to him 
personally being uncomfortable about saying.  I think it was 
his role in the meeting that he was uncomfortable with.  If I 
make that point.  I think, the suggestion in Ms Myeni’s 
statement is that he was perplexed because he was about to 
be removed from his board.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   And that is why I am saying, he was 
uncomfortable with.  I think he was uncomfortable by being 
20 
at that gathering. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   If I can make that point? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  H’m.  Do you recall what Mr 
Tsotsi’ first reaction was to the notion that certain executives 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 85 of 134 
 
should be suspended at that meeting in Durban?  Do you 
recall what his initial reaction was to the notion that certain 
executives should be suspended? 
MR LINNELL:   He was very disturbed and arguing quite 
strenuously against it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And are you sure about that? 
MR LINNELL:   I am sure about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you remember what he might 
have said in... as to why he was opposed to it or is it 
something you cannot remember? 
10 
MR LINNELL:   I am not sure what exactly what it was but 
my... if I put it unkindly and I do not mean to do it.  My 
perception was you are not being strong enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR LINNELL:   Now that is unfair and unkind but he was just 
opposed I think to the destruction to the people concerned 
and that was absolutely genuine.  He was genuinely 
uncomfortable with that.  And that is why in my mind I 
thought it is unfairly.  You not [connection not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
20 
MR LINNELL:   I did not say that to him, you know, but that 
was my feeling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And his reaction to the idea that 
there should be an investigation or an inquiry at Eskom or 
into the affairs of Eskom, do you recall what his reaction was 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 86 of 134 
 
to that proposal? 
MR LINNELL:   My perception was at the time that he was 
quite comfortable with the inquiry.  He was uncomfortable 
with the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LINNELL:   He has... I see in his evidence, he has 
alluded to, he had previously wanted an inquiry himself.  To 
my recollection on the 8t h, I was not aware of that, that he 
had also wanted an inquiry.  He might have said it but that 
certainly did not come through in my recollection that he 
10 
wanted an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka.  Or should we take 
the lunch adjournment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   An opportune time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or do you want... do you have a few 
questions before we adjourn? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is an opportune time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
We 
are 
going 
to 
take 
the 
lunch 
20 
adjournment.  It is one o’clock.  We will resume at two o 
Clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:   Let us hope the break in transmission is 
not going to come back.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Some people were 
wishing for the opposite, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hey? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Some people were wishing for the 
opposite. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am very happy that we can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Linnell, you can 
hear us? 
10 
MR LINNELL:   I can hear you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So the storm apparently 
has passed.  Yes.  Just before the adjournment we were 
looking for the document which is annexed to your second 
supplementary statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio 
Committee which you have also submitted to us, the 
document titled Eskom Energy Crisis Load Sabotage.  We 
have since emailed it to you now. 
MR LINNELL:   Got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, may I beg leave to hand 
20 
it up?  Chairperson, with your permission, the document 
belongs with the second supplementary statement of Mr 
Linnell which is found on page 24 – I beg your pardon, let 
me refer to the back pagination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   27. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 88 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 24 is the red one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair.  27, 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want it to be put immediately 
after? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 28 and it will be page 28.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And 28.2.  Mr Linnell, do you see the 
10 
document, Eskom Energy Crisis Load Sabotage? 
MR LINNELL:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So you were busy explaining to 
the Chairperson that this is a document, I think, as I recall, 
you 
would 
have 
received 
from 
Jabu, 
Mr 
Jabu 
Maswanganyi? 
MR LINNELL:   That is my recollection, so it was this – I 
found it by its having been sent to my computer on the 8 
March 2015 and although it is not authored in any apparent 
way the metadata demonstrated where the document 
20 
originated and came from and that ultimately was Jabu. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You have familiarised yourself 
with the contents of this document? 
MR LINNELL:   I have indeed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you able to in a nutshell relate to 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 89 of 134 
 
the Chairperson what is contained in this document or 
should …[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   I will do.  Mr Chair, the document reviews a 
number of power plants within the Eskom Group but mainly 
deals with alleged corruption, maladministration, both at 
some 
of 
these 
plants 
but 
also 
in 
respect 
of 
some 
procurement issues and it appears to specifically target a 
number of individuals. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you finished?   
MR LINNELL:   Unless you are wanting me to elaborate? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  May I read it quickly into the 
record? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So Mr Linnell I am going 
to read it into the record.  Quickly I will go through it: 
“Introduction:  Eskom has the total generation 
capacity of 43 000 megawatts.  The current capacity 
is under strain due to the aging power plants.  Yes, 
it is true that some of the load shedding was 
necessary to protect the grid from the blackout but 
20 
in recent years load shedding has become a 
concern since it is driven by unclear factors.  This 
report will unveil how Eskom executives collides 
with the contractors to sabotage load capacity 
creating what is known as load losses.” 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 90 of 134 
 
Mr Linnell, what do you understand with that paragraph? 
MR LINNELL:   I think it is relating some of the power 
outages directly to the performances of certain Eskom 
executives and I think it is suggesting that there would be 
intentional behaviour as well as normal maintenance 
backlogs. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so you are saying in addition to 
normal maintenance load shedding could have been – I use 
the word for lack of a better word, manipulated? 
MR LINNELL:   That is what the document appears to 
10 
suggest, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what it means is there would have 
been 
incidents 
of 
load 
shedding 
which 
were 
not 
necessitated by the need to load shed but merely done by 
some people within Eskom when there was no need to load 
shed? 
MR LINNELL:   Correct, Mr Chairman, the one word used 
there is sabotage load - or the phrase is, sabotage load 
capacity.  So that would have quite a dire interpretation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when you were given this 
20 
document, if you can recall, as you say coming from Mr 
Maswanganyi, what was the reason – what was his 
explanation in providing you with this document? 
MR LINNELL:   I cannot say it but my recollection of the 
conversation was this indicates intentional disruption of 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 91 of 134 
 
the power grid.  The whole document as a whole indicates 
intentional disruption.  And, secondly, maladministration..  
So perhaps in a sense it is also intentional. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that aspect would have become 
part of what you would later draft as the terms of reference 
for the inquiry? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, when I would have read this 
document it would have conveyed to me that there was the 
possibility of intentional disruption as well as what one 
read frequently at that time, corruption as well.  So these 
10 
specific instances probably would have ended up as being 
followed through in the investigation but what it indicated 
to me at that time that these were indicative of some 
substance, 
be 
it 
allegations, 
that 
required 
to 
be 
investigated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   So it was a meaningful document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay, the – yes but my question 
was did sabotage, the load capacity sabotage, become part 
of the terms of reference that you would later draft? 
20 
MR LINNELL:   I do not think we – I do not think that term 
was used in terms of reference, I think that would have 
been – I would not have relied on this terminology of this 
document directly terms of references, terms of references 
are more broadly framed but they will – included this by 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 92 of 134 
 
anyone getting into the terms of reference.  So the 
terminology I would have avoided because it is descriptive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Okay, the second paragraph: 
“Western Cape gets Fire Power Station.  Western 
Cape gets Fire Power Stations.  Western Cape has 
two gas fire-powered stations, Ankerlig, (Saldanha), 
Gourikwa, Mossel Bay.  Given the lack of adequate 
access to natural gas the two power stations have 
been operating on diesel.  The two power stations 
have been operating on diesel on a peak load basis 
10 
meaning that they are not always switched on.” 
Well, you can see I am correcting as I read there. 
“They only operate during peak hours which is from 
4 p.m. to 7 p.m.  The two power stations have been 
converted to base load capacity meaning that they 
now operation 24 hours nonstop.  The reason for 
this conversion into a base load capacity is driven 
by the greed of Eskom executives to benefit from 
the diesel supply contracts and political sabotage 
through load sabotage.” 
20 
There again we see the concept load sabotage.  Did you do 
anything to investigate what is being alleged in this 
document? 
MR LINNELL:   No at this stage they just want my - the 
input into me drafting the ultimate terms of reference.  So 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 93 of 134 
 
all these issues would have been covered in one way or 
another in the terms of reference.  But there were two 
points here I think which is significant and again it comes 
back to comment we were talking about before lunch 
because this indicates greed, which is a form of corruption 
but it also talks about political sabotage, it has another 
connotation altogether.   
So if you have – whether it is true or not at this 
stage it did not matter, the implication was, if you were 
going to find out what was going on at Eskom one had to 
10 
be clear that influences on those scores were not going to 
interfere with getting to the bottom of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, as we continue on that 
document, I am reminded of what you said in your affidavit 
about the documentation given to you – if not given but at 
least shown to you by Mr Jabu.  If you could please go to 
page 32 of your – in the bundle, which is a page in your 
affidavit, paragraph 17 on page 32. 
MR LINNELL:   Yes, that is referring to this document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would have referred to – okay, let me 
20 
read.  It says: 
“To the best of my recollection, Jabu had a number 
of documents that dealt with alleged events at 
Eskom. 
 These 
were 
largely 
from 
unidentified 
sources and unverified content.  These were things 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 94 of 134 
 
that 
an 
investigation 
would 
identify 
and 
were 
background in context but in part some of the 
allegations did not provide some value in scoping 
an approach to the investigation.” 
So this document you say would fall under this category of 
documentation you are referring to. 
MR LINNELL:   If I understand what you are saying, this 
document would have supported that, what you have just 
read, that it would have formed an input into framing a 
terms of reference to get to the bottom of what was going 
10 
on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but the source of which was 
unidentified, the contents of which were unverified. 
MR LINNELL:   Yes, the document on the face of it is not 
authored so when I got this, whoever authored this – and it 
may have been authored in phases because it is difficult to 
work out exactly when it was created.  So my [indistinct] 
14.41 continued to spread is not – at the beginning of it I 
say Jabu gave certain documents.  So at the end of it when 
I commented the source of these things is not clear is 
20 
because I did not want to attribute a source of this 
document because it is not clear but the import of this 
document was serious enough to be included in the terms 
of reference or the general grounds of terms of reference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you would have been drafting the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 95 of 134 
 
terms of reference relied on this document? 
MR LINNELL:   I would not have put – now we have to 
check where – my document, my terms of reference is very 
detailed, now I would need to go and see if I put any direct 
references to this document in it but typically my terms of 
reference would have used generic terms rather than 
Gourikwa Mossel Bay.  I would not have been specific but I 
would have covered the content of this in the terms of 
reference without doubt. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So one question, to the extent 
10 
that the document forms part of your bundle or your 
statement, what was your intention about it? 
MR LINNELL:   Amongst others, these issues would need 
to be investigated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just repeat that?   
MR LINNELL:   And it was serious.  Sorry, amongst other 
reasons, the contents of this document would need to be 
investigated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR LINNELL:   So in addition to other issues, these would 
20 
also have to be investigated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were they investigated? 
MR 
LINNELL: 
  There was 
no investigation to my 
knowledge.  The terms of reference were aborted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  What would you say to the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 96 of 134 
 
Chairperson 
should 
he 
approach 
this 
document 
…[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   Sorry, should he would? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How should the Chairperson consider 
this document? 
MR LINNELL:  I would think it is a very important input into 
the determination to hold an inquiry, to make sure it is 
comprehensive because it implies political as well as 
individual interference with the efficiency of the company 
and it should be included in an investigation.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   That investigation would need to take 
account of the fact that there are parties involved who 
might be implicated in this document, that is specifically 
and generally. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Given that the document was 
given to you what, some five years ago and it did not, as I 
understand, explicitly form part of your terms of reference, 
the ones you drafted, one.   
 
And 
number 
two, 
that 
the 
inquiry 
that 
was 
20 
envisaged at the time did not take place, is there any value 
to be placed on the document?  Any weight, I beg your 
pardon. 
MR LINNELL:   I would disagree, Mr Chairman, I would say 
that it is in the reference to be comprehensive and would 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 97 of 134 
 
have covered every part of this document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your terms of reference, the ones you 
drafted, do you know whether or not Eskom did rely on 
those terms of reference to conduct …[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   They did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry?  You may carry on. 
MR LINNELL:   They did not rely on those terms of 
reference, they rejected them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now the terms of reference – I know 
you have exchanged them with Eskom.  Let us see whether 
10 
– what we found on page 71 of the bundle before us 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, have we finished the meeting 
of the 8 t h in Durban, the second meeting? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, we have not finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The document has …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do the documents not take us out of the 
context. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, maybe it is taking away from 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you must try and finish what 
happened at the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then move on so that the sequence 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 98 of 134 
 
of events is the right one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Follows, indeed, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Linnell? 
MR LINNELL:   I am with you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, there you go, okay.  That is 
alright.  Okay, we will come back to our terms of reference 
because they come after your meeting with the board, so 
maybe let us follow the sequence for a moment and as I go 
back to the sequence, I would like to quickly read out to 
10 
you just by way of completion what Ms Dudu Myeni says in 
her statement and you will find that on page 191.  So that 
takes us back to the meeting of the 8 March. 
MR LINNELL:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 191, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just those paragraphs, just to read 
them on record.  I know we have dealt with – we have put 
some of that version to you, Mr Linnell, that - I think they 
are more complete if you read them from the statement.  
20 
Are you there on page 191? 
MR LINNELL:   Ja, 191. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, paragraph 13, where it starts with: 
“The factual inaccuracies of statement Mr Zola 
Tsotsi about meeting with me.” 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 99 of 134 
 
Do you see that? 
MR LINNELL:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
(i) 
First is it factually true that Mr Tsotsi met 
me.  At his requested, as stated above, in 
Durban, but not in the presence of my son 
as he alleges.  I met him in the presence of 
the person who was advising legally.  I 
introduced Mr Tsotsi to Mr Linnell.” 
So you have already answered the Chairperson in regard to 
10 
whether or not Ms Myeni’s son was present in that meeting. 
MR LINNELL:   He was present, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  And we know that the 
meeting did take place in Durban at the President’s 
residence.  
MR LINNELL:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the official residence? 
MR LINNELL:   Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the official residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he said it was – it is state house. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The state house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is official, ja. 
MR LINNELL:   State house. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next paragraph says: 
“Secondly, it is factually untrue that I was leading 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 100 of 134 
 
the meeting.”  
Your comment quickly on that?  Well, you have said that 
she was coordinator/facilitator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he said she was like the Chairperson 
– she was like the Chairperson of that meeting even 
though the meeting was informal, is that right? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She goes on to say: 
“I did not outline any purpose of the meeting as 
10 
alleged by Mr Tsotsi.” 
Is that correct? 
MR LINNELL:  That would not be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She did? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did she outline the purpose of the 
meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   Yes, not in a succinct way but in a very 
broad descriptive way.  She most certainly did.  It was not 
like an agenda item, it was – but it was very clear what the 
discussion is about. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She writes further and says, about Mr 
Tsotsi: 
“He had wanted me to introduce him to a legal 
adviser who happens to be Mr Linnell.  I had 
already briefed Mr Linnell why we had to meet the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 101 of 134 
 
Chairperson of Eskom.  It turned out that most of 
the things, points I raised to Mr Tsotsi was correct 
according to Mr Linnell.  There were certainly not 
shortcuts especially if you were worried about being 
removed and also if you had things to hide.” 
Do you understand what she is talking about? 
MR LINNELL:   I can disagree with that.  At that meeting 
there was nothing to suggest at all that Mr Tsotsi was 
under threat of removal.  I only became aware of the threat 
to remove him the following week or the week after that.  
10 
Two weeks afterwards was the first indication that anyone 
wanted to remove him.   
 
The second thing is, I would say, I would never 
driven or flown on a Sunday all the way to Durban to meet 
Mr Tsotsi to discuss a risk he perceived to the removal of 
him from the board obviously, that would hardly be within 
the type of function that I could assist him with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to the extent that Ms Myeni says that 
she had already briefed you as to why the two of you had 
20 
to meet the Chairperson of Eskom, what – do you have 
something to say about that? 
MR LINNELL:   That would not be true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is the position? 
MR LINNELL:   I had been briefed to meet again with the 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 102 of 134 
 
President to discuss the approach to his idea of having an 
inquiry into Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LINNELL:   And, as counsel had mentioned before the 
lunch break, I had done some preliminary research with 
regard to that, not with regard to Mr Tsotsi’s position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you know for the first time that 
Mr Tsotsi was going to be at the meeting? 
MR LINNELL:   I think on Saturday the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 7 t h. 
10 
MR LINNELL:   The 7 t h, so on the morning of the meeting 
of the 6 t h I had a telephone conversation with him on the 
morning of the 7 t h.  At the end of that conversation I 
understood he would be at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So prior to that had you not been told by 
anybody including Ms Myeni that the Durban meeting would 
include Mr Zola Tsotsi? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I think – I do not know now 
whether on Friday the 6 t h it was indicated that during 
meeting that anyone else would have been at the 8 t h 
20 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   But clearly I knew by – if I did not know by 
the end of that day I knew by the morning of the 7 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   7 t h, okay.  Okay, yes continue, Mr 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 103 of 134 
 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The next paragraph 
(iii), the Chairperson has already asked those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not need to pursue them.  Thirdly: 
“The former President was not part of my meeting 
with Mr Tsotsi at any point.  The President greeted 
us in the room where we were…” 
And she goes on to say: 
“The burden of proving that the former President 
10 
was part of the meeting rests on Mr Tsotsi who 
should provide the minutes or evidence of the 
former President’s involvement in that meeting.” 
Was the former President not part of the meeting?  I think 
you have answered that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He has already told us that, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   He was present at the second part of the 
meeting most certainly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next paragraph says: 
20 
“Fourthly, I need to stress that my being at the 
former President’s official residence…” 
Well, you may or may not know this, Mr Linnell, her 
presence at the former President’s official residence in 
Durban was as per a prior commitment for a meeting on a 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 104 of 134 
 
different matter which had nothing to do with Eskom or 
SAA.  You may or may not have a comment on that. 
MR LINNELL:   I can – what I can say is there might have 
been another reason for Ms Myeni to be there but one of 
the reasons she was there was to discuss Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please turn the page, (iv) on page 192:  
She continues to write, says: 
“Furthermore, it is not true that I have had a prior 
knowledge of financial performance and operational 
matters of Eskom other than the information Mr 
10 
Tsotsi voluntarily shared with me including but not 
limited to load shedding, the claim by Mr Tsotsi that 
I spoke about the War room of Eskom is totally 
untrue.”   
Now according to your recollection Mr Linnell, and I think I 
asked that question early this morning regarding load 
shedding and 
who would have talked about aspects 
relating to load shedding 
MR LINNELL:   Ms Myeni would have been involved and 
would have had a contribution on that topic. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was anything mentioned about the 
financial performance and operational matters of Eskom? 
MR LINNELL:  Most definitely.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   And who would have done the talking 
on those aspects? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 105 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:      [Indistinct 00:57] would have been one, 
Ms Myeni would have been one and I’m quite certain Mr 
[Indistinct 1.02] would have contributed to that discussion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In your view – or your view but your 
recollection of how the meeting transpired, we may be 
asking this question again but who would have been the 
main speaker on those points? 
MR LINNELL:    I can’t say clearly, I think there was a 
discussion, think Jabu was particularly informative and he 
provided a lot of the discourse, Ms Myeni would have 
10 
provided input, if any one maybe Mr Tsotsi he would have 
been subdued as he would – he would have contributed but 
everyone contributed to the meeting and the one thing – I 
don’t have a recollection at that time of the war room 
specifically, it was certainly years later, at it may have 
been discussed but I don’t particularly remember the war 
room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, then, maybe I will read the next 
roman six as the last paragraph, it says, 
“I should further state, the most pressing issue was 
20 
not about Eskom but was about Mr Tsotsi himself.  
Prior to that meeting he had shared with me, his 
concern that the Board wanted to get rid of him and 
that some Executive at Eskom should be dismissed 
he, therefore, needed help of legal nature urgently”. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 106 of 134 
 
 
Well that point is alluded to in the – one of the 
paragraphs before, preceding, I think you’ve already dealt 
with it. 
MR LINNELL:     [Indistinct 3.04] Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let’s start with that one.  Is it true 
that the discussion or the meeting was about Mr Tsotsi 
himself? 
MR LINNELL:    There was no discussion about Mr Tsotsi 
himself.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the discussion was about Eskom? 
10 
MR LINNELL:      That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay, 
well 
I 
guess 
one…[intervenes]. 
MR LINNELL:    Mr Chairman, if I could comment, my 
recollection is, I arrived after the others and I think that’s 
my recollection, if they had a prior meeting as this 
document here suggests, they had a prior discussion, I 
don’t 
know 
anything 
about 
that 
discussion 
but 
the 
discussions 
I 
was 
part 
of 
[break 
in 
audio] 
and 
its 
operations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of course, when you say the 
discussion was about Eskom, at the Durban meeting, that 
would be in line with your evidence on the discussion that 
Ms Myeni had with you on the 6 t h at the President’s official 
residence in Pretoria? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 107 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:     That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that discussion was about 
Eskom and not about any individual.  
MR LINNELL:      That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe I can say, just to finish that 
paragraph for you Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last sentence of paragraph, roman 
10 
figure six, on page 192 says that Mr Tsotsi needed help of 
a legal nature urgently.  In that meeting in Durban did Mr 
Tsotsi – or did anybody talk about Mr Tsotsi needing legal 
help himself as opposed to, maybe, Eskom? 
MR LINNELL:  None whatsoever Mr Chairman and none 
followed.  As an outcome of that meeting I’d been asked, 
during the meeting to discuss that assistance, there was 
no assistance following that meeting.  So, that supports 
the fact that it was not discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Linnell, to 
complete on this, I wish to ask you to go to page 26.2, this 
is the supplementary statement which you have loosely 
before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct 6.17].     
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 108 of 134 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 26.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you have moved away from 192? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I’ve moved away from that one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, I think there is one more thing to 
be put to Mr Linnell.  Mr Linnell, Ms Myeni says in roman 
figure seven on page 192 that she needs to reiterate that 
she did not know Eskom Executives, nor did she know any 
of their acts of alleged wrongdoing.  She says she was in 
that meeting to advise Mr Tsotsi as a colleague at his 
behest and hence she introduced him to a legal advisor at 
10 
that meeting in Durban, which must be you.  What do you 
say about her statement that she did not know – or does 
not know any Eskom Executives?   
MR LINNELL:   I don’t remember her naming any particular 
names but we spoke about the functions and the names 
would have been mentioned, at least by Jabu because in 
the document we’ve just referred to certain names are 
being referred to in that particular document and that 
document was discussed.  Some of the names were 
discussed but I – it was certainly the functions the 
20 
functions were discussed and to my recollection Mr Tsotsi 
finally gave me the details of those three people in written 
format after the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi said that at the meeting one of 
the things that Mr Zuma – one of the questions Mr Zuma 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 109 of 134 
 
asked was whether Mr Tsotsi knew the names or the 
identities of the Executives who were to be suspended, do 
you remember anything along those lines being asked by 
Mr Zuma? 
MR LINNELL:   I don’t remember that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t remember. 
MR LINNELL:     …[Indistinct 8.44] in a sense that, 
presumably Mr Tsotsi would know his own staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well I think Mr Tsotsi made the 
point that it was quite clear that Mr Zuma knew the issues 
10 
that were supposed to be discussed at the meeting and 
that at some stage during the meeting he asked Mr Tsotsi 
whether he knew who the Executives were who were going 
to be suspended and I think Mr Tsotsi’s evidence before 
the Commission was that he responded to Mr Zuma by 
confirming that he knew the Executives to be suspended 
and I think he was saying that because prior to that point 
he said the discussion that had taken place, I think, before 
Mr Zuma came in had included the names of the Executives 
– three executives, that was what he said. 
20 
MR LINNELL:    [Indistinct 9.57] probably mentioned in the 
discussions  before, Mr Chairman, in the first session but 
to be honest those names at that time bore no resonance 
in 
my 
mind 
because 
obviously 
then 
I 
would 
have 
recognised them, so I wasn’t paying attention to names per 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 110 of 134 
 
se, my focus was on the titles or their functions, he might 
have mentioned the names, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so – but would you say that by the 
end of the meeting Ms Myeni did not know – or would not 
know the names of the Executives who were to be 
suspended, if they were mentioned? 
MR LINNELL:   I would think – they were mentioned in – 
everyone was mentioned in discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR LINNELL:      And starting off by function and then by 
10 
names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR LINNELL:    I can’t remember the names because I 
don’t know if she would have remembered the names but 
names were certainly mentioned and confirmed in writing 
later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She says she was at that meeting, 
simply to advise Mr Tsotsi as a colleague at Mr Tsotsi’s 
behest to introduce Mr Tsotsi to you.  She says that was 
the – that is why she was at that meeting, what do you say 
20 
to that? 
MR 
LINNELL:  Mr 
Chairman, it’s simply not – it’s 
absolutely clear that the purpose of the meeting was to 
traverse 
and 
prove 
an 
inquiry 
into 
Eskom’s 
current 
performance.  There was no discussion which took place.     
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 111 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one wonders whether – if that was 
the only purpose, whether it would not have been enough 
for her to give Mr Tsotsi your number and then Mr Tsotsi 
could 
reach 
you 
and 
the 
two 
of 
you 
could 
make 
arrangements to meet rather than have a meeting in 
Durban or can you not hear me Mr Linnell? 
MR LINNELL:    No, it was indistinct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I’m saying one wonders whether, if 
that was the purpose of the meeting, namely that she 
should – she was there to advise Mr Tsotsi at Mr Tsotsi’s 
10 
request and that she was there to just introduce Mr Tsotsi 
to you, whether it would not have been enough for her to 
give Mr Tsotsi your number and Mr Tsotsi could give you a 
ring and the two of you could arrange to meet, you 
understand? 
MR LINNELL:    I wouldn’t have to fly to Durban to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a Sunday. 
MR LINNELL:   You’re right Mr Chairman, I wouldn’t have 
had to fly to Durban to do that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR LINNELL:      Mr Chairman if I could elaborate just on 
counsel’s earlier question, at the end of that meeting we 
had identified the three people so everyone in the room 
knew there were going to be those three people [break in 
audio] for suspension so we left the meeting with that 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 112 of 134 
 
knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so…[intervenes]. 
MR LINNELL:      We might have got four more names later 
but we certainly knew that was the outcome of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and at that stage were the only 
three Executives who were discussed and who were going 
to be suspended in terms of the discussion at that meeting 
or was it four Executives? 
MR LINNELL:      To my recollection there was three 
people 
mentioned 
and 
we 
put 
three 
people 
in 
the 
10 
documentation, at a later stage the three became four and 
the three morphed into four so when the three became 
four, I cannot recall but I know in the document that I did 
immediately after this meeting, and including the narratives 
on the motivations for suspensions of those three they 
referred to, specifically, those three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, Mr Tsotsi also gave evidence 
along the same lines, namely that at the Durban meeting 
only three Executives were discussed as executives who 
would be suspended.  He said it was only later, I think at 
20 
the meeting of the 11 t h that, at some stage, the name of 
the 
Financial 
Director 
was 
included 
is 
that 
your 
recollection as well. 
MR LINNELL:      I think, Mr Chairman, that in the 
discussions on the 8 t h there is probably discussion about a 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 113 of 134 
 
host of people and positions but at the end of the meeting 
the view was, those were the three key positions and I 
would have thought Mr Tsotsi’s input on those three 
positions would have been quite critical because he would 
have known that best, no-one else would have known that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Linnell, indeed, 
you do say, in the supplementary statement which I was 
going to refer you to on page 26.2, your page 2, paragraph 
14. 
10 
MR LINNELL:      14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja but we can start at 13 because 
there you write, 
“I 
would 
not 
have 
known 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
individuals beforehand but at a meeting on 8, which 
I believe is March 2015, we had identified roles and 
names of three Executives and these were named 
by me in the briefing document I composed and sent 
to the Chairman, that evening, the 8 t h.” 
 
Paragraph 14 then says, 
20 
“Mr Marokane, CEO – I beg your pardon, Mr 
Matone, CEO, Mr Marokane, Group Capital and Mr 
Koko, Commercial and Technology were named in 
the suspension memorandum that I forwarded to Mr 
Tsotsi prior to the Board meeting on 11 March.  I 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 114 of 134 
 
cannot recall when the fourth Executive was added.  
Ms Molefe had not been initially considered as 
potentially impending the investigation and not part 
of my proposal”. 
MR LINNELL:    That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we understand that the ultimate 
decision was that 4 Executives should be suspended and in 
fact, that’s what happened. 
MR LINNELL:      That’s correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But to go back to the meeting in Durban, 
10 
was the conclusion of the meeting, therefore, that, one, 
There would be an inquiry that would be conducted at 
Eskom, into the affairs of Eskom, two, three Executives 
would be suspended and they were identified who they 
were or that Mr Zuma was going to speak to the Minister – 
brief the Minister of Public Enterprises or Mr Tsotsi would 
speak to the Board of Eskom, is that how the meeting 
concluded? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct Mr Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there another point I’ve left out of 
20 
importance that was concluded at that meeting?  
MR LINNELL:      I think, Mr Chairman, there was the 
general statement, it would have been discussed in the 
presence of the President, where my own decision on doing 
the inquiry which set out a couple of the principles of that 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 115 of 134 
 
inquiry, which would be independence of that and that, and 
I think I’ve documented that in the – one of the statements.  
So, there was a conclusion come to that the inquiry would 
take place it would have to be done in this particular way.  
One of those implications were that these people were to 
be suspended but there were other conditions mentioned at 
the end of that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just deal with them because I want to 
have a full picture of the conclusion of that meeting. 
MR LINNELL:  I think, Mr Chairman to …[break in audio] 
10 
the – that was an important point because that was the 
point of departure which led, ultimately, to the terms of 
reference and the approach of the inquiry which followed 
all the way through.  So the principles agreed about 
independence, transparency etcetera, etcetera followed all 
the way through from that … [break in audio] into the 
media briefing, into the terms of reference and they were, 
consistently applied.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay before you go there, one, your 
role, did the meeting in Durban agree as to what your role 
20 
would be in the inquiry or was there an understanding of 
what your role was going to be? 
MR LINNELL:    I left with the understanding that I would 
be – proposed to the Board that I would be the coordinator 
of the inquiry. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 116 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what were agreed to be the 
features of the inquiry you have told me about the 
transparency, what else, independence? 
MR LINNELL:      Yes, independence, it had to be 
transparent, it had to be thorough I think I documented 
some of those things…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you can look at the document if you 
want to refresh your memory.  Was it already mentioned, at 
that meeting, that the inquiry should take no longer than 
three months or did that come later? 
10 
MR LINNELL:      [break in audio] there was a discussion 
about that, Chairman, in the sense that in our earlier 
discussions if there is a long winded investigation that 
comes to nought to any event and it creates more damage 
than good. So, you have to go in, do it thoroughly and 
quickly and identify the main issues otherwise it will just 
peter out and so three months was an issue.  Counsel can 
you remind where – do you where we detail those, was it in 
the affidavit or the supplementary? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You could go to page 32 of the 
20 
affidavit, paragraph 20. 
MR LINNELL:      Which is on black page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   32. 
MR LINNELL:      Oh page 32? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 20 21 – well mainly 21. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 117 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:      Okay ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you can just read into the record 
the principles that you set out there, what you say from 
paragraph 20 to 21.9, do you want to read that quickly. 
MR LINNELL:      Would you like me to, certainly? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:      Paragraph 21 starts, 
“The President was fairly familiar with the purpose 
of the meeting and he provided a summary of what 
was propose arising from the earlier discussion 
10 
referred to above.  This included a number of key 
principles, 1.  For the inquiry to have credibility it 
needed 
to 
be 
open, 
independent 
and 
comprehensive, it needed to be free from internal 
interference.  2.  It needed to be quick as lengthy 
previous inquiries in other State entities led to 
greater harm than good.  3.  It needed the capacity 
and capability of the best investigators across 
commercial, financial, and technical disciplines.  It 
was, therefore, not suitable for one entity to 
20 
conduct it.  4.  It needed to be seen to be credible, 
sound communication with stakeholders and the 
public was necessary”,  
And then I comment on something which is in the 
ultimate, final version of the terms of reference which I 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 118 of 134 
 
cannot recall mentioning here but it – part of my thinking 
then was, you needed and overseer to comply or to deliver 
on the points of being credible and transparent.  In an 
inquiry of this nature the big risk is, no-one really knows 
the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, oh I thought the principles went up 
to 21.9. 
MR LINNELL:    Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think 21.6, you say, 
“The Board and the Minister must be in agreement 
10 
and supportive and seen to be so. 
21.7 
you discuss the implications of the Board 
and PFMA approvals.   
21.8 
the matter of suspension of top Executives 
was 
discussed, 
the 
rationale, 
supporting 
suspension was that,  
21.8.1 if investigators were going to have the 
freedom to follow the evidence there needed 
to be an environment free from fear or 
intimidation these conditions do not need to 
20 
be active, exist in the passing presence of 
key people can inhibit openness.  These 
were precautionary suspensions and those 
included would be counselled on that point 
as would the media release.   
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 119 of 134 
 
21.8.2 The risk to the business of suspensions of 
key people will be managed by appointment 
of 
capable 
subordinates, 
a 
strong 
communication 
strategy 
would 
convince 
stakeholders and the public that this was a 
positive and not a negative approach.  The 
inquiry would be limited to three months, 
your own role would be that of coordinator 
and you would interface with the Board and 
then at  
10 
22 
you say, the President listened to these 
views and asked one or two questions and 
then agreed.  He undertook to speak to the 
Minister and Mr Tsotsi was going to speak to 
the Board”, 
Is that how the meeting ended? 
MR LINNELL:      Yes, Mr Tsotsi was going to communicate 
with the Board, I was going to draft him documents to 
communicate to the Board that evening, which I did.  The 
President was going to talk to the Minister and all those 
20 
points – ultimately [break in audio 26.46] documents.  So, 
for example in the Board proposal it deals with issues of 
the approval of Ministry of Finance. So, all those issues 
which are recorded here were, ultimately, followed through 
and the documents entered later. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 120 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So Mr Linnell it 
appears to be – maybe you can verify this or confirm this 
to the Chairperson that these principles were coming from 
you, the underlying principle of the nature of the inquiry, is 
that correct? 
MR LINNELL:    I would like to agree with that, I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, we know that, when you met with 
Ms Myeni on the afternoon of the 6 t h of March 2015 in 
Pretoria, she told you that the President wanted an 
10 
investigation into the affairs of Eskom.  At that stage, did 
she talk to you about any principles that would govern that 
investigation or did she talk to you about any important 
features of that investigation or is the position that, that 
was not discussed at that stage but by the time you arrived 
at the Durban meeting you had ideas of what principles 
should be followed? 
MR LINNELL:     I think a bit of all those, Mr Chairman, so, 
[break in audio 28.39] discussion on the 6 t h, certainly some 
of these principles would have been discussed, I would 
20 
have raised them but on the – I think on the Saturday 
morning, I stand corrected but I would have commented on 
one of the documents that I, ultimately, did.  I started 
drafting a document – first version of a document early on 
the Sunday morning or late on the Saturday or early 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 121 of 134 
 
Saturday morning which started recording some of these 
kinds of things, [break in audio 29.15] certainly.  I’m not 
sure – I would have mentioned them, I suppose, on the 6 t h 
but they were very clearly entrenched by the 8 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, at that meeting on the 6 t h of March, 
in Pretoria between yourself and Ms Myeni, did the issue of 
the suspension of the Executives arise or did that only 
arise at the meeting – at the Durban meeting? 
MR LINNELL:      The principle of suspensions would have 
arose on the 6 t h, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, the two of you did discuss that in 
Pretoria? 
MR LINNELL:   Correct, not [break in audio] but the 
principle of suspension she is sitting at the top of the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no that’s fine, in Pretoria in your 
meeting CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine.  In 
Pretoria in your meeting with Ms Myeni you are saying that 
there was a need – there would be a need for some 
executives to be suspended was discussed but the actual 
20 
names were not discussed, is that right? 
MR LINNELL:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was there – did the discussion 
include portfolios, in other words to say the executives who 
would need to be suspended would be those who occupied 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 122 of 134 
 
certain – or who were leading certain portfolios or that did 
not also arise, it was just the suspension, that there may 
have to be a suspension without saying which positions 
would be affected or which persons would be affected? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, on this, I would not have 
understood the organisational structure as to who was who.  
So that would not have been an issue at all but that came 
clear on the 8 t h as to Mr Tsotsi had a role in identifying 
positions of influence in the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So who actually came up with the whole 
10 
idea that there would need to be suspensions on the 6 t h, 
was it you or was this Ms Myeni? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I would put to you that it 
would have been my recommendation.  Having said that, I 
cannot say that it was not also on her mind and in 
conversation there was an accepted discourse between the 
two of us that was necessary but where I am in doubt, it 
would have intuitively been my – an idea I would have seen 
it, if you are going to do this properly, this must happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR LINNELL:   We might have had the same thought, I 
cannot recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But the actual portfolios of – that 
would be affected by the suspension of the executives, 
those portfolios were only identified at the Durban meeting, 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 123 of 134 
 
is that correct or not? 
MR LINNELL:   To my memory recollection, yes, Mr Tsotsi 
would have been the one who knew those roles better than 
anyone and maybe Thabo but certainly Mr Tsotsi would 
have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now at the Durban meeting do you recall 
whether it fell upon you to raise the issue of the 
suspensions or whether somebody else in the meeting 
happened to be the first one to raise the issue of 
suspensions and, if so, who was that? 
10 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I do not have recollection – 
at the time there was no thought that that was an issue, 
the discussion was around we had to do an investigation, 
what is the best approach to do it and the suspensions 
were no more of an issue in say my recollection in mind 
than it being fair and transparent and thorough, they were 
all part of the same approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now do you remember whether the 
actual names came from Mr Jabu Maswanganyi or Mr 
Tsotsi.  Did you remember or is that something you do not 
20 
remember or who the names came from? 
MR LINNELL:   What I do recall is Mr Tsotsi having a role 
in a debate about the positions and then ultimately, as far 
as I recall, any maybe it is formed by I got the names from 
him in writing to make sure I wrote then down correctly.  
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 124 of 134 
 
He sent those to me.  Jabu would certainly have mentioned 
some of those names because in the document we referred 
to energy crisis just now, two of those names are in his 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Linnell, if you 
are still on your supplementary affidavit, paragraph 12.  
Just for completeness sake, talking of the suspensions 
considered on the 8 March and you said: 
“Precautionary 
suspension 
would 
have 
been 
a 
10 
standard approach that I would have considered.” 
Do you see that? 
MR LINNELL:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“I would have considered key areas of business that 
the inquiry would focus on and also whether anyone 
in particular in those areas may have a propensity 
to interfere or have such a presence as to create a 
perception 
of 
potentially 
impeding 
the 
investigation.” 
20 
Although paragraph 13 says: 
“I 
would 
not 
have 
known 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
individuals beforehand.” 
Do you see that? 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, the [distortion on audio] I 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 125 of 134 
 
would 
have 
considered, 
that 
would 
have 
been 
the 
consideration.  The principle of that is the consideration.  
So the consideration would be who are the functionaries 
who are going to be – might impede this investigation and 
what are the areas in which they work at.  That would have 
been my consideration. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and I think what the Chairperson 
was 
trying 
to 
establish 
from 
you 
is 
whether 
that 
consideration which ultimately becomes a decision of this 
meeting is something that you, as the legal adviser, 
10 
because that is how you have been labelled, you as the 
legal advised them to do.  Did you advise them to suspend 
the executives? 
MR LINNELL:   It was not – the meeting was not an 
advisory meeting but I would have certainly said if I am 
going to do this inquiry, these are the principles that I 
would want to have in place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so that was …[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   So …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was your advice to them. 
20 
MR LINNELL:   So I would have – sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was your advice to them? 
MR LINNELL:   Probably advised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says the meeting was not an advisory 
kind of meeting but he says he would have told the meeting 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 126 of 134 
 
that if he was going to conduct the inquiry or coordinate it 
he would have told the meeting that one of the things he 
would want to have done was the – would be the 
suspension certain key people.  Is that correct, Mr Linnell? 
MR LINNELL:   If I understood correctly, it would be – I 
would have advised that if I was going to do the inquiry, 
these principles should be in place but when I said it was 
not – the discussion, to start off with, was a discussion, 
everyone added their bit.  That would have been one of the 
bits or those points that we have read out just now would 
10 
have been points that I would have raised. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Linnell, then you do say on the 
next page – there is an aspect I think I should clear with 
you beforehand.  Before I go there, Mr Linnell, just to clear 
with you what the Chairperson had raised with you earlier 
which is what Mr Tsotsi says.  I am going to read from his 
affidavit quickly.  You will find it – and you can write this 
down – on page 167 of your bundle.  167.  And paragraph 
12.12 Mr Tsotsi write, this is his affidavit before the 
Commission: 
20 
“The President then enquired as to whether I knew 
which executives were to be suspended whereupon 
I responded that I knew as Dudu…” 
That is Ms Myeni. 
“…had mentioned them in the discussion prior to 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 127 of 134 
 
this meeting.  His response gave me the impression 
that he had been privy to this discussion.” 
Before I move on, let me ask you this …[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   Which paragraph are we on? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   12.12, sorry page 167.  Are you on that 
page? 
MR LINNELL:   12.12, I have got it, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have got that.  You heard what I 
read, you can look at it. 
 “The President then enquired as to whether  
10 
I knew which executives were to be suspended 
whereupon I responded that I knew as Dudu…” 
I believe it is Ms Myeni. 
“…had mentioned them in the discussion prior to 
this meeting.  His response gave me the impression 
that he had been privy to this discussion.” 
Do you see that? 
MR LINNELL:   I can see it.  I have no recollection of that 
particular part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson – ja, sorry, Mr Linnell, 
20 
may I interrupt you.  Chairperson, apparently we have lost 
the – SABC has lost signal for live broadcasting due to a 
storm.  Shall we proceed?  Thank you, Chair.   
 
Mr Linnell, we are at a stage where, as I understand 
what Mr Tsotsi here is talking about.  At the stage where 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 128 of 134 
 
the 
President 
is 
joining 
you 
in 
that 
second 
room 
…[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:  I understand.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   You follow that? 
MR LINNELL:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. Let me ask you a different 
question, whether did you get the impression that Mrs 
Myeni knew who were the executives to be suspended? 
MR LINNELL:   It is quite possible because – you mean 
before the 8 t h or on the 8 t h? 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Either 
or 
but 
that 
she 
knew 
…[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   Certainly on – certainly during the 
conversation on the 8 t h all these people were mentioned.  I 
cannot recall if their names per se, like Dan Marokane who 
was mentioned as a name, that would not have registered 
with me as a name because I was not familiar with the 
name but people and their positions were discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   So Mrs Myeni would have been aware of 
20 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  The next paragraph on the 
same pages, it say: 
“Dudu Myeni had informed me on my arrival that 
Nick 
Linnell, 
who 
is 
a 
lawyer, 
who 
she 
had 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 129 of 134 
 
commissioned to advise her at SAA and would be 
available to do the same for us at Eskom.” 
You may not know what he was advised but you are able to 
verify whether or not you had been engaged by her at 
SAA? 
MR LINNELL:   Certainly, I was – it was concurrent with 
this – the SAA work was concurrent with this work. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it concurrent with this work?  So 
you were then being engaged with Eskom to similarly 
assist at Eskom. 
10 
MR LINNELL:   It would have been materially the same 
kind of investigation.  Eskom one would have been much, 
much bigger. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You mean the Eskom task would have 
been much, much bigger? 
MR LINNELL:   Certainly.  The SAA one was limited in its 
scope.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did it also involve the suspension of 
the executives? 
MR LINNELL:   The executive was certainly suspended. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And an inquiry was established? 
MR LINNELL:   The inquiry followed and a disciplinary 
hearing followed and a settlement followed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  But we ultimately had settlement 
here at Eskom? 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 130 of 134 
 
MR LINNELL:  No, no, so the point – the point on SAA.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR LINNELL:   The record of the investigation is public 
record, it was in the Labour Court and it is about 3 000 
pages.  Maybe twelve instances or allegations proven and 
that is – as I understand has also been submitted to the 
Commission, that report.  So that is question of fact, 
objective fact, what the substance of those allegations, 
investigations resulted in.  The fact that there was a 
settlement, was more likely to be a political outcome rather 
10 
than a business outcome on that matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I should go back to a 
question that – or a topic that we dealt with briefly before 
lunch, Mr Linnell, namely the need for your services.  Now 
if you get involved in – if you – if Ms Dudu Myeni brought 
you into SOEs, state owned entities such as SAA to deal 
with, 
for 
example, 
a 
disciplinary 
matter, 
I 
cannot 
understand why it was necessary for her to bring you in 
when an organisation such as SAA would have a legal 
20 
department, people who are employed to deal with such 
things and indeed in some of the matters that have been 
testified about before me relating to SAA during Ms Myeni’s 
time at SAA involved law firms being brought in as well to 
chair 
disciplinary 
enquiry, 
to 
prosecute 
managers 
or 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 131 of 134 
 
executives.  So I ask myself the question, why was Ms 
Myeni bringing you in because the entity had the necessary 
capacity. 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, I would beg to differ, SAA did 
not 
have 
the 
necessary 
capacity 
and 
in 
organised 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How do you know that? 
MR LINNELL:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   How do you know that? 
MR LINNELL:   I worked that for 18 months, Mr Chairman, 
10 
I know that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know now …[intervenes] 
MR LINNELL:   Mr Chairman, if I could elaborate 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know now but I know SAA in the 
past to have had a position I think called a legal counsel, 
for example, which was occupied by some advocates in the 
past and I think the last I knew was Adv Pikoli was I think 
occupying that position recently.  I do not know if he is still 
occupying it, so I cannot imagine that SAA did not have a 
20 
legal 
department, 
did 
not 
have 
a 
human 
resources 
department.  Are you saying that one, SAA did not have a 
legal department?  Two, it did not have a human resources 
department?  Because running a disciplinary enquiry you 
do not actually even need a lawyer, human resources 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 132 of 134 
 
practitioners are enough to do that but if you feel you need 
a lawyer there would be a legal department and very often 
there 
would 
be 
people 
who 
are 
qualified 
in 
labour 
relations.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, before he responds – sorry, Mr 
Linnell. 
MR LINNELL:   Can I respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, Mr Linnell? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is [distortion on audio] to respond.  
The transcribers also now have a problem, so they are 
10 
asking for five minutes adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that they can sort out their 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Linnell, please do not forget 
the question and your answer. 
MR LINNELL:   I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we will take a break because the 
20 
transcribers need to sort out something as well.  Okay, we 
will adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.

Page 133 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have had a break of about what, 30 
minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes about 30 minutes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are still interrupted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the signal hasn’t come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anything that we have been told 
that is promising, or I had to speak maybe?   Is that an 
indication that something is happening, or not really?  It is 
10 
not the wonders of my voice.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would have been amazing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is Mr Linnell able to hear me? 
MR LINNELL:      Yes I can sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, and would the recording happen?   
Would it be possible to record or would it not be 
happening?   It won’t be possible, there would be no 
recording? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The message is there is a delay in the 
transmission of the recording so the recording keep the 
20 
words, it records late. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so maybe we must just adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think so. 
05 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 226 
 
Page 134 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Till tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Linnell we are going to adjourn 
because of this problem, the intention is to resume 
tomorrow, I take it that you probably are available to 
continue tomorrow? 
MR LINNELL:      I am sir. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay 
let’s 
do 
that, 
I 
think 
tomorrow’s witnesses maybe could be told to not arrive 
before twelve, I am not sure, because we will start with Mr 
10 
Linnell, and then once we are done with him then we will 
start with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes we will convey the message Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, so we are going to adjourn for the 
day and tomorrow we will start at ten o’clock, which is our 
normal time, okay, we adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA:   Thank you Chair.
