PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 1 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Hofmeyr, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If I may just indicate we have scheduled 
for today two witnesses.  The first is Professor Mokgoro 
who is currently the Premier of the North West Province 
10 
and after him we will be receiving the evidence of Ms 
Mamela.  Ms Mamela is a witness who is returning today 
she gave evidence originally in February.  Professor 
Mokgoro has not given evidence previously.   
I would just like if I may to locate Professor 
Mokgoro’s evidence because it has been some time since 
we actually have received evidence in relation to the 
matters that we will be traversing with Professor Mokgoro 
today.   
Chair you may recall back in the middle of 2018 in 
20 
fact it was – sorry 2019 it was we received evidence in a 
session of the first aviation evidence about a contract that 
had been entered into between South African Express 
Airways and the North West Government and it related to 
certain routes that were going to be established between 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 4 of 310 
 
Cape Town and Johannesburg airports and then the 
Mafikeng and Pilanesberg airports.   
And we received evidence Ms Babadi Tlatsana who 
was one of the directors of a company Koroneka that had 
been appointed to as a management company in relation to 
these air services that were going to be provided to the 
North West Province.   
We also received the evidence Ms Phatudi who was 
the CFO at the relevant time in the Department of 
Community, Safety and Transport Development and in the 
10 
course of her evidence she made reference to the fact that 
the first payment that was made from the North West 
Government to South African Express Airways was a 
payment in the amount of R50 million and that had been 
authorised out of the Premier ’s office by the then acting 
Director General and that was at the time Professor 
Mokgoro.   
So Professor Mokgoro provided us with a sworn 
statement in response to Ms Phatudi’s evidence and 
subsequent to that a determination was made that it would 
20 
useful to have him appear today he gave an undertaking 
and an offer at the end of his sworn statement to be 
available to the commission.   
And so we have taken him up on that offer and 
today we will be questioning him about matters related to 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 5 of 310 
 
that payment.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just ask for the lawyers for 
Prof Mokgoro to place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To place themselves on record yes.  They 
can do from where they are. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Yes.  Thank you very much Chairperson I 
am Mogera Mokote Advocate.  With me I have my attorney 
Mr Mahlangu Nhlanhla, my pupil Ms Dipalisa Dukele and on 
this ride she is not a legal representative but is a 
10 
[00:03:21] spokesperson Mr Vuyiso Lengese.  Thank you 
very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay please 
administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
PROF MOKGORO:  My name is Tebogo Job Mokgoro. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Not at all. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
20 
your conscience? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Certainly, I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 6 of 310 
 
me God. 
PROF MOKGORO:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much; you may be seated 
Mr Premier. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair just in relation to logistics for today 
Professor Mokgoro’s two sworn statements have been 
placed in a file that we have numbered DD32.  I 
understand that we are entering them now for the purposes 
10 
of a file number and then if I can just indicate what is 
contained in that file and Professor Mokgoro you should 
have a copy in front of you.  
PROF MOKGORO:  What is the number? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is – on the spine it is DD32.  That is 
just the name of the file.  But I – when I need to refer you 
to a particular page I will refer to the page number in the 
top right hand corner.  Chair the file comprises the first 
sworn 
statement 
of 
Professor 
Mokgoro. 
 
That 
is 
a 
statement which was deposed to on the 22 July 2019.  It is 
20 
followed by the annexures to that first sworn statement and 
you find that under Tab 2 in the file.  Then under Tab 3 was 
the 
second 
sworn 
statement 
deposed 
to 
on 
the 
17 
September 2019 and its annexures.  Just so that we can 
understand what had happened was Professor Mokgoro 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 7 of 310 
 
provided his fist sworn statement – there were certain 
documents that were missing from it.  We requested that 
they be provided.   
The second sworn statement purports to provide 
them but as I will deal with in Ms – in Professor Mokgoro’s 
evidence 
there 
are 
actually 
still 
some 
documents 
outstanding but we will address that in the course of the 
evidence.   
And then the last document in the file is simply a 
copy of the speech that the then Premier of the North West 
10 
gave in the first session of Fifth Legislature in June 2014.  
That is a document that I will make reference to in the 
course of the evidence.  And so those are the documents 
which comprise file DD32.   
If we may just enter the file name into the record 
and then I will make reference to the specific documents 
when we go to them if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should we say it is Bundle DD32 and 
then various documents… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will be Exhibit something. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – so we will say it is Bundle 
DD32. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair thank you. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 8 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just changing here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the spine.  Bundle DD32 yes.  And 
then with regard to the specific documents you will ask me 
to admit them as and when… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We come to them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair we are indebted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Professor Mokgoro if we could then 
commence. I understand that you are currently the Premier 
of the North West Province, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what position did you 
hold in 2014/2015 period in the Province? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I was the acting Director General in the 
office of the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And when – can you recall what 
20 
particular period that covered?  When did you seize to be 
the acting DG in the office? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I think it was sometime in 2015 once 
the Premier had appointed a substantive Director General. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But for the matters that we are concerned 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 9 of 310 
 
with today which take us up to March 2015 you were still 
the acting Director General, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what qualifications do 
you hold Professor Mokgoro? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I – I have a BSC Degree, an Honours 
Degree, a Master ’s Degree and I am also an Honorary 
Doctorate. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of which institution is that; that you hold 
the Honorary Doctorate? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Toledo University in Ohio in the United 
States. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Professor Mokgoro when you were in 
the position of acting Director General within the office of 
the Premier you then held the position of Accounting 
Officer as that position is understood in the PFMA, is that 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes that is true.  Accounting Officer in 
the office of the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  in the office of the Premier.  And did you 
20 
have an understanding at the time of what the legal 
obligations were of the Accounting Officer under the 
PFMA? 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 Yes 
certainly. 
 
During 
the 
first 
administration 2014 to – no 1994 up to 1999 I was the first 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 10 of 310 
 
Director General in the office of the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right so from that far back. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
You 
were 
familiar 
with 
the 
responsibilities. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like to take you to one or two of 
them in particular because they are going to be relevant 
10 
for the evidence today.  And for that purpose just so that 
you can have reference to the PFMA one of the files that 
has 
been 
placed 
before 
you 
is 
called 
the Aviation 
Legislation Bundle; you will see that on your left hand side.  
Chair you will be handed the relevant file in a moment.  I 
would like us to turn in that file to page 63, 63.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page –  
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I think I have it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is within the Public Finance 
Management Act that we have been discussing and which 
20 
we refer to as the PFMA for short.  And you will on page 63 
that there is a section there Section 36 dealing with 
Accounting Officers.  Is that a section that you are familiar 
with? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I am. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 11 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you will see that it is the Accounting 
Officer ’s in Section 36 of departments and constitutional 
institutions.  Here we are dealing with the Department 
which is the Provincial Department the office of the 
Premier and if you go down the page you will see at 
Section 38 there are certain general responsibilities of 
Accounting Officers.  Is that a section that you are familiar 
with? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair it is. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I would like to highlight just some of 
10 
the responsibilities that you held pursuant to this section 
of the PFMA when you were the Accounting Officer in the 
office of the Premier at the relevant time that we will be 
discussing today.  If you go to Section 38.1c.  And it is 1cii 
that I am interested in.  The section says: 
“That 
the 
Accounting 
Officer 
for 
a 
department trading entity or constitutional 
institution 
[c] 
must 
take 
effective 
and 
appropriate 
steps 
to 
[ii] 
prevent 
unauthorised, irregular and fruitless and 
20 
wasteful expenditure and losses resulting 
from criminal conduct.” 
 
Did you understand that in the period 2014/2015 to 
be one of your legal obligations? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I certainly did understand that Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 12 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And would you accept that unauthorised 
expenditure would be expenditure that was not budgeted 
for by a particular department? 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
Yes 
that 
would 
also 
include 
expenditure that did not go through a normal procurement 
process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Professor Mokgoro I have 
just been alerted to the fact that could we ask that you 
move yourself just a bit closer to the microphone.  It is not 
coming through as clearly as we might like. 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Oh I will pull it closer to you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Either way the [00:12:28] increased. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it does not have too close but do not 
be too far. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Okay Chair will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So we have clarified that 
unauthorised 
expenditure 
would 
be 
expenditure 
not 
20 
budgeted for; you accepted that.  You said unauthorised 
expenditure would be expenditure that had not followed 
procurement processes, is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we go over the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 13 of 310 
 
page to page 64 you will see another of the legal 
obligations of an Accounting Officer that I would like to 
highlight.  And you will find that in L down the page.  So it 
is actually Section 38.1l and what  
“That requires is for the Accounting Officer 
to take into account all relevant financial 
considerations 
including 
issues 
of 
proprietary, regularity and value for money 
when 
policy 
proposals 
affecting 
the 
Accounting 
Officer ’s 
responsibilities 
are 
10 
considered.” 
 
And I ask again is that an obligation that you were 
aware of having on you at the time 2014/2015? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Certainly Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then still on that page you will see 
that Section 38.2 a little bit way of the way down also 
gives another obligation to Accounting Officers.  It say 
that: 
“An Accounting Officer may not commit a department, 
trading entity or constitutional institution to any liability for 
20 
which money has not been appropriated.” 
 
Did 
you 
understand 
that 
to 
be 
one 
of 
your 
obligations? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Certainly Chair I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And an appropriation would take place 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 14 of 310 
 
through an appropriation bill at the relevant time in the 
year, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes certainly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And those appropriations are done 
pursuant to budgets that are developed for each of the 
departments, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So unbudgeted expenditure would be 
something that had not been properly appropriated, is that 
correct? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Certainly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we go down just 
to Section 39 where I will conclude this point.  I am 
interested there in Section 39.1b.  Because that is a 
further obligation placed on the Accounting Officer in 
relation to budgetary control.  It says: 
“The Accounting Officer for a department is 
responsible for ensuring that [b] effective 
and appropriate steps are taken to prevent 
unauthorised expenditure.” 
20 
 
Given your previous answers I take it you will 
accept that was also an obligation on you as Accounting 
Officer, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Professor Mokgoro I would 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 15 of 310 
 
like to then move away from the legislation bundle and we 
will go back into your bundle which is Bundle DD32.  Now if 
we could start at page 5 of DD32.  Chair this is where we 
will need to enter the first exhibit.  The first exhibit is the 
sworn statement of Professor Mokgoro dated the 22 July 
2019.  If that could be Exhibit 1 in Bundle DD32. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
sworn 
statement 
by 
Professor 
Mokgoro appearing from page 1 is admitted and will be 
marked as Exhibit – did you say 1? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  1 of Bundle DD32. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether you should say Exhibit 
1 or maybe say Exhibit 32.1 just to give that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly.  I think I was being 
approached about that very point at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  So if we can make it DD32.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That will be ideal thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Exhibit DD32.1.  ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  And then Professor 
20 
Mokgoro if we pick it up at page 5 of your first sworn 
statement which is Exhibit DD32.1.  You say there at 
paragraph 
10 
– 
you 
dealing 
with 
the 
origin 
of the 
transaction that the commission is interested in and 
received evidence about in the middle of last year.  And 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 16 of 310 
 
that 
was 
the 
transaction 
involving 
the 
North 
West 
Government and South African Express Airways and as I 
understand it you linked in paragraph 10 the origin of the 
transaction to this inaugural State of the Province Address 
of the Fifth Administration which was delivered in June 
2014, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Have you had occasion to take a look at 
the speech that was delivered at the inaugural State of the 
Province Address since then? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Recently yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And would – did you manage to find any 
reference to the airport development in that speech? 
PROF MOKGORO:  The matter was about the total 
development of Mafikeng. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  There was certainly reference to 
the development of Mafikeng.  Did you find any reference 
at all though to the specific issue of flights to Mafikeng and 
Pilanesberg airports in that speech? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I do not have any recollection of that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well we – that is why we placed this 
speech.  The text of the speech in your bundle.  We went 
to go and look at it and considered it quite carefully to see 
if there had been in the course of that speech of the 
Premier in June 2014 any mention at all of the airport 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 17 of 310 
 
developments and we did not find that.  Do you accept that 
it is not there? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Ja I accept that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But what you do say is it did talk 
generally about the development of Mafikeng.  Is that 
right? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct.  And then you go on and say 
that – that is at paragraph 11 on the same page that there 
was an announcement in that State of the Province 
10 
Address 
that 
there 
would 
be 
a 
resuscitation 
of the 
Mafikeng airport.  Do you now accept that that is incorrect? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Can you explain that error on your part in 
paragraph 11? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Well the – the major projects that were 
part of the MRRRP they have always been foremost in my 
memory about that huge project. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The MRRRP is something we are going to 
come to. 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because your sworn statement talks 
about it.  Just for present purposes can I ensure that you 
and I understand it correctly?  It was a – a project to 
revitalise and rejuvenate Mafikeng, is that correct? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 18 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It had nothing to do with Pilanesberg? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Pilanesberg was obviously not in 
Mafikeng Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes so it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just repeat that.  Just repeat your 
answer? 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
Pilanesberg 
is 
certainly 
not 
in 
Mafikeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you – you accept now that paragraph 
11 is incorrect insofar as you indicated that there was a 
specific reference in the speech to the resuscitation of the 
airport.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There were other things that that speech 
discussed as important initiatives that were going to be 
undertaken by the Province and particularly under the 
direction of the Premier.  I am going to just list a few of 
20 
them that we picked out for you to indicate whether you 
disagree with our understanding of the speech at all.  What 
the speech indicated the Province was going to be 
committed to were things such as safety nets and social 
services being provided to orphans and vulnerable children 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 19 of 310 
 
affected by HIV and Aids.  Do you recall that as a feature 
of it? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And to engage in social crime prevention 
programs, do you remember that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There would be empowerment programs 
devised for victims of gender based violence, do you recall 
that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There was going to be foster care and 
child protection services provided by the Province.  Do you 
recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There were going to be food production 
initiatives in order to improve food insecurity within the 
Province.  Do you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And there was going to be training of 
youth in various trades so that they could join the job 
20 
market which was an issue reflected in the speech. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There was going to be building of 
housing units for mining communities.  Do you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 20 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Subsidisation of agriculture and other 
small business initiatives?  Do you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
And 
critical 
water 
and 
sanitation 
investments to prevent another outbreak of water borne 
diseases that it led to the deaths of young children in the 
Province.  Do you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I recall that.  I recall that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we have a similar understanding of 
what the Premier was committing the Province in June of 
10 
2014 then when he gave the inaugural address.  Is that 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
What 
he 
did 
not 
mention 
was 
resuscitation of the Mafikeng airport, did he? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let us then go to what you have called 
the MRRR – I am going to call it the MRRRP project if I 
may?  I understand that stands for the Mafikeng Recovery 
Renewal and Repositioning Project or Program, is that 
20 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now you deal with that at page 8 
paragraph 21 of you sworn statement which we have 
entered as Exhibit DD32.1.  If we can pick it up there at 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 21 of 310 
 
paragraph 21.  Can you tell us about this MRRRP?  What 
was your understanding of it at the time? 
PROF MOKGORO:  My understanding of it was the state in 
which Mafikeng was in quite a sorry state that there was a 
need to come up with a comprehensive revamping of 
Mafikeng especially given its status as [?]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Now this – here you refer to this 
MRRRP and you talk in the course of your statement about 
various documents that were produced over the time the 
year 2014 which as I understand it from your statement 
10 
sought to give content to the project and the program.  Is 
that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Now what happened in October of 
2014 according to your statement is that a provincial 
planning 
commission 
was 
put 
together 
to 
develop 
a 
proposal for this.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I just want to our chronology right 
because we are going to look at the proposal in a moment.  
20 
But you are familiar with the evidence Ms Phatudi, is that 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I – I am. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Her evidence indicated that even before 
the planning commission presented its proposal in October 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 22 of 310 
 
2014 there had already been an initiative to get airlines to 
come and make a presentation at Sun City.  Do you recall 
that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I recall that there was such a 
presentation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Her evidence was that that took 
place in August so just so we get the chronology right.  We 
have got the Premier ’s State of Inaugural Address in June 
of 2014.  We have confirmed no reference is made to the 
resuscitation of the Mafikeng or the Pilanesberg airports in 
10 
that speech.  Then in August of 2014 six airlines get 
invited to make presentations to the Province at Sun City.  
Are you aware of that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I heard about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You heard about it.  Did you attend those 
presentations? 
PROF MOKGORO:  No I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No.   
PROF MOKGORO:  No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you know of any tender process that 
20 
was 
followed 
before 
they 
were 
asked 
to 
come 
and 
presentations? 
PROF MOKGORO:  As secretary of the Executive Council 
certainly when presentations – various presentations were 
made at EXCO I was but in addition to that once the policy 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 23 of 310 
 
broad policy statement had been made by the Premier at 
State 
of 
the 
Province 
Address 
the 
process 
of 
implementation would then look at priority projects and this 
will become clearer and clearer to normal government 
processes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Professor Mokgoro my question was were 
you aware before August 2014 when these airlines were 
invited to Sun City whether there was any tender process 
followed – a request for bids for example or a request for 
proposals.  Are you aware of that having been followed? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Once was the airline initiative was 
pronounced upon clearly the procuring department had a 
task to embark on procurement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Again we are in August of 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes hand on one second.  Her question 
was whether I think you were aware whether any tender 
processes were followed before August 2014. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Well I cannot remember precisely 
before what time but I certainly am aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
That 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Community, 
Safety 
and 
Transport 
Management a course one of the priority projects was in 
airport had an obligation to embark on a [00:26:44]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry Mr Premier could 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 24 of 310 
 
you just repeat that answer but look this side because I am 
trying to follow you. 
PROF MOKGORO:  I am saying – I am not – I am not 
precise in terms of before August or whatever but what I 
am saying as the progress of giving practicality to the 
policy initiative of the Premier which started at State of the 
Province Address I am aware that one of the priorities – I 
was aware that one of the priorities was to revamp the 
airports.  I do not have any recollection as to my 
awareness was before or after August. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  About whether tender processes were 
followed.  You are not aware whether – you were not – you 
cannot say from when you became aware if you did become 
aware that tender processes were not followed you cannot 
remember when? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I cannot be specific in terms of time I 
do not have recollection in terms of time all I am saying is 
I was aware that the Department of Community, Safety and 
Transport Development had the responsibility to procure 
like any other department and did report on procurement to 
20 
EXCO> 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  And that – and the – and because of 
my responsibility as Secretary to Executive Council I was 
aware. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 25 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Professor Mokgoro.  I 
appreciate that at some time back but I want to be clear 
about why the chronology is important.  Because we have 
established that there was no resuscitation of the airports 
referred to in the Inaugural State of the Province Address 
in June you see.  The first time it actually comes up is in 
that policy planning document which we are going to look 
at in a moment which is October 2014.  But critically 
between those two events six airlines get invited to Sun 
10 
City 
to 
make 
presentations 
and 
what 
I 
wanted 
to 
understand from you is whether you were aware of any 
procurement 
process 
being 
followed 
before 
that. 
 
I 
understand your evidence to be you do not; you are not 
aware of any procurement process being followed before 
that August 2014 invitation.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I was aware of procurement processes 
because that was reported on – on – at EXCO but when 
that was I do not have a recollection. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We will come to whether it was actually a 
20 
procurement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  You were aware 
of procurement processes having – taken place. 
PROF MOKGORO:  As reported by the relevant department 
to EXCO. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 26 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As reported – okay alright. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes as reported by the department to 
EXCO> 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Which I was secretary of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  But with regard to the nitty gritty of 
procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  I obviously was not involved. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Does that mean that the relevant 
department reported to EXCO or does it mean that the 
reports or report that the relevant department made to 
EXCO included saying there had been compliance with 
procurement processes from what you remember in terms of 
what they reported to Eskom? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair in terms of what they 
reported to Eskom, they did point out that they had invited 
six companies and they were going through that process of 
procurement.  I was aware that those reports were made to 
20 
Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Professor Mokgoro.  It might 
be useful for you and I just to ensure that we have the same 
understanding of a procurement process, right?   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 27 of 310 
 
 
Because the evidence of Ms Phatudi who was the CFO 
in 
that 
department 
at 
the 
time, 
was 
that 
no 
proper 
procurement process was followed in relation to this airline 
invitation.   
 
There was no bid for proposals.  There was no bid 
specification committee convened.  There was no bid 
adjudication committee convened.  There was no invitation to 
tender.   
 
What there was, was an invitation to six airlines to come 
to Sun City and to make a presentation.  Can you disagree 
10 
with her evidence in that respect? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, no, no.  I do not.  Remember, you 
are talking about a department that was different or separate 
from my department which was the office of the precinct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if the department ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  Is 
that evidence given by Ms Phatudi as summarised by Ms 
Hofmeyr consistent with what that department told Exco as 
far as you recall? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   It is not the department who respond... 
they reported to Exco, was at the end of the process that 
they alleged had happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But what I am asking is, whether 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 28 of 310 
 
when you hear that Ms Phatudi who CFO of the department 
as time, has told the Commission that there was no open 
tender process that was followed.   
 
Does that... is that consistent with what you understood 
the department to have reported to Exco?   
 
Or your reaction is that:  I do not think that is what... I 
do not think that is what the department told Exco.  My 
understanding of what the department told Exco is different 
and it is this. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Certainly, Ms Phatudi’s evidence 
10 
contradicts what the MEC reported to Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Prof Mokgoro, that is quite an important 
point and we will return to it when we will look at that 
particular submission that was made to Exco which you have 
helpfully provided to the Commission.   
 
But for where we are the moment.  Your understanding, 
and correct me if I have got it incorrectly, was that when that 
presentation was made Exco, you were satisfied that a 
proper procurement process had been followed.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I had nothing, no reason to doubt 
what the MEC was reporting to the executive council. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but what if the MEC just said they 
invited six airlines to do a presentation.  Would that have 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 29 of 310 
 
been a proper procurement process? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, I mean, that is how government 
operates on a day-to-day basis.  I mean, the director 
general, accounting officer and the officer of the premier is 
an accounting officer in the Office of the Premier and 
nowhere else.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just repeat that answer, Mr 
Mokgoro. 
PROF MOKGORO:   I am saying, an accounting officer 
sitting in the Office of the Premier, is not privy to the nitty-
10 
gritty 
processes 
of 
department, 
be 
it 
procurement 
or 
whatever.  So it is really up to the integrity of a particular 
department and especially the accounting officer to ensure 
that when public funds are expended, they are expended in 
line with the PMFA as was read earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think Ms Hofmeyr’s question is this.  
In terms of your own understanding of what... of the 
procurement processes that government departments are 
supposed to follow. 
 
Would you have understood what had happened to have 
20 
been in compliance with such procurement process if you 
had been told, all that had been done was to invite six 
airlines to come to Sun City, make a presentation and then 
one of those was picked as the one that who would be given 
the contract?   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 30 of 310 
 
 
Would that have satisfied procurement procedures as far 
as you understood them? 
PROF MOKGORO:   My understanding would be that under 
normal circumstances that would not.  And as I recall, the 
explanation that was given.  Because of the restricted 
number of airlines that would operate in the identified routes, 
that was the route the department saw appropriate to follow. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, you see Professor Mokgoro.  Ms 
Phatudi’s evidence was that, because no procurement 
process was followed, actually, there was no way of knowing 
10 
what the market was like, what could be provided.  That is 
why you go through a bid specification process, right?   
 
You try and establish what is available, what are your 
needs, how can they be met, and then you ask for proposals 
in response to a specification.   
 
Her evidence was, because none of that was followed, 
they simply invited six airlines.  Six airlines who were not 
even responding to a proposal.  So they came with various 
proposals.   
 
Some thought that there could be flights between 
20 
Mafikeng and Pilanesberg.  Others thought that there should 
be flights between Johannesburg and Cape Town and 
Mafikeng and then go on to the rest of Africa.   
 
Would you except sitting here today that that is not the 
way to run a proper process. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 31 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:   Certainly, at face value, it is not a 
normal way to approach a procurement process, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So then let us move to 
October of 2014, right?  Because it is in October of 2014 
that this provincial planning commission puts together that 
proposal which you attached to your sworn statement.  And 
you will find that commencing in DD32, that is the bundle we 
are currently in. 
PROF MOKGORO:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will find it at page 38 in DD22.  
10 
Now Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   38.  Three, eight.  I am going to ask Chair 
that we enter this as the second exhibit.  This will be Exhibit 
DD32.2.  And it is... it comprises the annexures to the sworn 
statement that is DD32.1.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It was meant to have been an annexure to 
that affidavit but was not attached and it is now comes as a 
separate document? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Exactly, exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  The... it starts at page 38? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It does not start at page 38.  It starts at 
29, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the page I am interested in looking at 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 32 of 310 
 
is page 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I must make one correction.  
Apologies.  We entered as Exhibit 32.1 the first sworn 
statement of Professor Mokgoro. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It does have attached to it theories of 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am working in one of those annexures 
10 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I see. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Those annexures, however, are in part 
incomplete.  And so we then need to go to the second sworn 
statement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...on occasion to get the completed 
annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the one I am in at the moment is 
20 
complete for our purposes.  So I do not want there to be a 
misunderstanding in relation to the record.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think it is preferable that we simple refer 
to it now as annexure to the sworn statement which has 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 33 of 310 
 
already been entered as Exhibit 32.1 if you are comfortable 
with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it... is it one of those annexures that 
did come with the affidavit? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Yes, it did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.  All of those will fall under 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Under 32.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Then I do not need to enter a 
10 
new one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am indebted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If we can then go to page 38, Professor 
Mokgoro.  Do you have that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And page 38, as I indicated previously 
from your sworn statement, is part of the proposal that the 
Provincial Planning Commission put together in October of 
20 
2014.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And this was a proposal for the Mafikeng 
Recovery and Renewal Repositioning Project, is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is right. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 34 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And this is the first time Professor 
Mokgoro that we were able to pick up a reference to the 
airports and it is here.  It is on page 38.  Can you read for us 
the second line in that table that is presented on page 38? 
PROF MOKGORO:   H’m.  A briefing of the Mafikeng Airport. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what were the milestones?  What was 
going to happen with those upgrading of the airport? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I am reading, runway of international 
status, freight and movement of logistics, establishment of a 
logistic hub, solar module course(sic). 
10 
ADV 
HOFMEYR:   Right. 
 
And 
who 
was 
to 
be 
the 
...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   Cells, rather. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, sorry.  Solar module cells.  Correct.  
And who was to be the implementing agency of this 
initiative? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I cannot recall. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you look at the next column, it is headed 
implementing agency.  Which department is reflected there? 
PROF MOKGORO:   The Department of Public Works and 
20 
Roads. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is not the Department of Community, 
Safety and Transport Development? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, it is not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And who was going to be 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 35 of 310 
 
consulted?  That is the next column. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Enterprise Development Department, 
Mafikeng Municipality.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what was the target date for this? 
PROF MOKGORO:   March 2018. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think that is actually ’16 on the best of 
copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 2016. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And... thank you.  So that was the 
upgrading of the Mafikeng Airport which according to this 
proposal was going to be undertaken by the Department of 
Public Works and Road, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I could find no reference in this proposal 
to the upgrading of the Pilanesberg Airport.  Was there any 
mention of it that you are aware of? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, not... no. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And do you agree with my understanding 
of these miles that were related to the upgrading of the 
airports?  These are things about getting the runway right, it 
is about freight and movement of logistics and solar module 
cells.  All the sorts of things you would give to the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 36 of 310 
 
Department of Public Works and Roads, are they not? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, firstly, the department referred to 
is in appropriate because it is not their mandates. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is not their mandate to upgrade 
runways? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, it is not their mandate to deal with 
matters of roads, on the roads, as well as...  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, hang on a moment.  What I 
understand is that the implementing agency here was going 
to the Department of Public Works and Roads, correct? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   As it is reflected. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   As it is reflected ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...in the proposal that was put together by 
the Planning Commission. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And amongst the things that were 
going to be done to upgrade the Mafikeng Airport was, there 
20 
was going to be an upgrade of the runways, right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that not something that would be 
handled by the Department of Public Works and Roads? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, essentially, the key department 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 37 of 310 
 
would be Committee Safety and Transport Management.  And 
as 
it 
happens, 
typically 
government 
operators 
have 
collaborative hold.  Other departments will be drawn in, 
depending on but certainly, I would designate the key 
department as Committee Safety and Transport Management. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
 
Because 
it 
fits 
more 
with 
the 
amendments. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  But that is not to the Provincial 
Planning Commission identified as the implementing agency? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, as... yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR:   They 
identified 
a 
very 
different 
department.  The Department of Public Works and Roads, 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it was matters related to the physical 
space of the airport as I understand it because they wanted 
to upgrade runways, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is it but it would not be out of the 
ordinary.  If, as I have said earlier, because Committee 
20 
Safety 
and 
Transport 
Management 
through 
in 
other 
departments. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct.  But what is ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   Such as Public Works. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Such as Public Works.  Well, and such as 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 38 of 310 
 
Committee Safety and Transport Development.  What I do 
not see listed here as the milestones for this upgrading of 
the airport, is flights.  Do you see any reference to flights? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, the flights here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  That is what was ultimately paid for 
when you authorised the payments of R 50 million in March 
of 2015. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was going to be flights. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But flights are not part of the Planning 
Commissions’ proposal. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  The next thing that happens is 
that you gave a progress report as I understand it, from your 
sworn statement on the MRRP.  And you gave to that 
20 
executive council members on the 28t h of October 2014.  Do 
you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, I recall that, from time-to-time, as 
some kind of overseer, I would be required to collect 
information from the various departments and give the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 39 of 310 
 
progress report. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Let us go to that progress report, if 
we can?  You will find it at various places.  Now Chair, this is 
one of those places where we got... Professor Mokgoro, in 
fairness to you.   
 
I think what happened is.  When your first sworn 
statement was put together the annexures were copies with 
only one side of a double-sided page because we are keep 
getting page 1, 3 and 5 but we do not get page 2 and 4, for 
example.   
10 
 
Have you managed to understand how the problem arose 
that incomplete annexures were attached to your first sworn 
statement? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, I was made aware of the problem 
and I gave instructions that that be corrected.  I am 
surprised that it never was. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was corrected in relation to the 
document we are going to go to now.  It was then corrected 
in relation to certain other documents that I will be coming 
to.  But I understand from communication from your lawyers 
20 
yesterday, the difficulty is that some of the documents have 
just not been able to be found but we will come to that in a 
moment. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So let us go to, if we may, this 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 40 of 310 
 
proposal that was put together by yourself.  And I am going 
to have to go to now to... let me see here, the second 
version that we got of this document.  And you will find 
that...  
 
Chair, now we will need to enter a new exhibit if we 
may?  What I am now entering as a new exhibit is the 
document that commences at page 112 of Exhibit DD32 and 
what I request is that that document commencing at page 
112 be entered as Exhibit DD32.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is just the letter here alone? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what follows the letter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The supplementary affidavit? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, exactly with its annexures.  So I am 
suggesting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...that we keep all in Exhibit DD32.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the letter of page 112 from Ms S L 
Mbanjwa(?) to the Commission will be admitted with its 
annexures and marked Exhibit DD32.2. 
LETTER (PAGE 112) IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
20 
DD32.2 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Now Professor 
Mokgoro, I am going to need to ask you to move between 
two parts of the file because of this issue where the 
alternate pages were missing from your first sworn statement 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 41 of 310 
 
but I do have a record of where we need to move.  So 
hopefully, we will be able to do so fairly swiftly.   
 
What I would like you to go to is at page 120 that I 
identified for you which you will find in the Exhibit DD32.2.  
This is part of the report that you gave to the executive 
council members on the 28t h of October 2014, is that 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will see that at Item 2.7 on that 
page 
there 
is 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
Mafikeng 
Airport 
10 
Development.  Do you see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now this is a document you put together 
as I understand your statement.  Is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What did you reflect at point 2.7 about 
that development? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, it says at 2.7: 
“Mafikeng Airport to establish airlift and connectivity 
to other possible countries and position gateway to 
20 
Africa, SADEC, passenger and cargo...” 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So where did you get that new description 
for the airport development from?  Because you will see that 
is quite different to the one that we saw in the Provincial 
Planning Commission’s document. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 42 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where did you come up with that new 
characterisation of the development? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, as is the nature of some of these 
policy 
items, 
you 
know, 
and 
from 
time-to-time, 
implementation 
changes, 
depending 
on 
what 
principles 
pronounced at policy level. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who are the principles you are referring to 
10 
there? 
PROF MOKGORO:   The policy making. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I beg your pardon?  It is Exco? 
PROF 
MOKGORO:   Policy 
making 
of 
any 
provincial 
government. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So between the Provincial Planning 
Commission’s proposal which also occurred in October and 
you putting this report together, which principles had you 
spoken 
to 
about 
this 
new 
characterisation 
of 
the 
development? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, I can only venture because as you 
can see, it is quite a while ago.  That it might have been as 
part of the evolution of policy.  You have a broad policy that 
says, redo the airport and there are so many project 
components that would get into that. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 43 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  In your report, you also identified 
what the financial implications were going to be of this 
MRRP. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, that is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is it fair to say that is part of your report 
that you took seriously, giving your responsibilities as 
accounting officer? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No.  As I say, I was a quali-dater, not an 
10 
accounting officer. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So you were taking information 
from others and putting it together? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is true. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So who came up with the financial 
implications section of this report? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Financial implications could only have 
come Committee Safety and Transport Management. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, but remember, this is the MRRP 
Project as a whole.  So and it is the financial implications of 
that whole project.  So that would not have just been 
Committee Safety and Transport Management, would it? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, it certainly I would have copied in 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 44 of 310 
 
to determine prices of respective departments. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So would it be fair to say, you were 
getting input from all the affected departments and putting 
the financial implication together? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Let us go to what is set out in your 
report about the financial implications.  And you have to go 
back into Exhibit DD32.1 for that and you will find it at page 
44.  Four, four. 
PROF MOKGORO:   So 32, Chair? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You must go back in the file to page 44.  
Four, four. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the file that has got your first 
affidavit.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have that page? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I have got it, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what you indicate under Clause 4.1 
on that page is: 
“An 
amount 
of 
R 132 million 
was 
allocated 
to 
20 
implement MRRP and four lead agencies were 
identified.” 
 
Do you see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I see that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Professor Mokgoro, can you just 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 45 of 310 
 
confirm that my understanding of your sworn statement is 
correct?  You made repeated reference in your sworn 
statement to this R 132 million that had been allocated for 
the MRRP Project.  Is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I understand your statement to say, 
the R 50 million that you authorised to pay out in March of 
2015, came from this R 132 million that was allocated.  Is 
that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, that is the amount that was 
10 
initially allocated. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  You say in your statement, you were 
satisfied to authorise the R 50 million because it came from 
the R 132 million that had been identified in this report, 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   It came from that budget. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Okay.  Let us look at that budget as 
you set it out at page 44.  Because what you do there is, you 
identify the projects that are going to be undertaken for 
which the R 132 million has been allocated.  Is that correct? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will see that that table appear 
and then at the bottom there is a total and you get a total of 
R 132 million, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 46 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So in your report on the 28t h of October, 
you identified what was going to make up the R 132 million 
that had been identified for the implementation of the report.  
Can you please point me in that table to where the 
refurbishment of the Mafikeng Airport appears? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I missed that question, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you show me in the table where the 
resuscitation of the Mafikeng Airport appears? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, there is no reference to the airport. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mafikeng’s beautification would not be, 
would it? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it is not there, is it Professor 
Mokgoro? 
PROF MOKGORO:   As in Mafikeng beautification was 
something else. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So the resuscitation of the Mafikeng 
Airport does not appear here, does it? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, it does not Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And the R 132 million is quite 
carefully identified as being compromised... Well, comprising 
seven projects as you indicate, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 47 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was going to be a design of a 
stadium for which there would be professional fees of 
R 10 million.  Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was going to be a design extension 
of the convention centre which was going to be take 
R 3 million of the amount that had been ring fenced in the 
Office of the Premier.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was going to be R 72 million 
10 
dedicated to what is called a Quick-Links(?) or Quick-
Winds(?) Project, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That had nothing to do with the Mafikeng 
Airport, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then there were going to be security 
points costing R 10 million.  There was going to be a BRP 
Rhino Studio for R 10 million.  Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was going to be feasibility studies, 
business 
plans 
and 
architect 
designs 
for 
R 15 million, 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And a communication strategy for 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 48 of 310 
 
R 2 million, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And finally, the item that the Chair 
identified, the Mafikeng beautification was going to take ten 
per cent of that budget.  Oh, R 10 million of that budget, 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that is how you accounted for the 
financial implications of the R 132 million that was going to 
be ring fenced in the Office of the Premier for the MRRP 
10 
Project, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the Mafikeng Airport played no part in 
that identified R 132 million? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Pilanesberg Airport did not either, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   It does not, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Now I then would like to go, if 
we may back to your sworn statement at page 14.  That is in 
Exhibit DD32.1.   
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   Page 14? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   14.  One, four.  Yes.  Then you talk about 
another presentation that was prepared by the Office of the 
Premier and you attached it as exhibit... Annexure TJM3.  
We will go to it in a moment.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 49 of 310 
 
 
You say in your statement.  This document that the 
introduction of passenger flights between Mafikeng and O.R. 
Tambo International Airport was assigned from the beginning 
to the department, right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could we go to that annexure?  You will 
find it commencing at page 47, four seven, of Exhibit 
DD32.1. 
PROF MOKGORO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You can flip through it if you need to but 
10 
what I was just not able to establish Professor Mokgoro is, 
who was responsible for putting this presentation together?  
Do you recall? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I have some idea that some of the 
senior managers in the Office of the Premier were doing 
that.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So did you have a hand in putting it 
together or was that left to other people? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, remember that this is putting 
together, firstly, I will testify... decided on by those were 
20 
responsible for all sorts of announcements and the various 
departments would make submissions based on whose 
department has competency or whatever. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  Because this is actually the first 
document that we were able to locate that talks about the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 50 of 310 
 
flights to Mafikeng Airport and that talks about the funding 
for it.  Because we have established in your evidence 
already, all the other documents do not refer to it, do they? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, that is possible. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  So let us look at what this document 
which I understand you to say was put together as a policy 
document by those responsible in the Office of the Premier.  
If we can look at what it says ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   No, no.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies. 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, by the departments to be... had 
put together by the Office of the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry.  So the input comes from various 
departments. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it is pulled together by the Office of 
the Premier.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you yourself was not responsible for 
putting this report together.  Is that correct? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, no, no. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your report was the 28 October one that 
we looked at a moment ago. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where you had that section on financial 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 51 of 310 
 
implications and nowhere does that refer to the airport as 
being part of the R 132 million that was ring fenced in the 
Office of the Premier? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us go to what is said in this document 
about the Mafikeng Airport Development.  You will find that 
at page 56, five six.  It is in the same document we were 
looking at and so we are still in Exhibit DD32.1.   
PROF MOKGORO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Professor Mokgoro, you will see there on 
10 
the left-hand side of that page... well, it is headed... let us 
start with what it is headed with.  Mafikeng Airport 
Development.  Do you see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I do Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will see that there is progress 
and challenges identified in the left-hand column. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  Could you please read for us what 
those progress and challenges are that are reflected? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
20 
“The departments to report on progress of each 
project.  No funding available for some projects under 
this programme all ...[indistinct] involved under this 
programme need to coordinate more effectively the 
Acting Director General in discussion with possible 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 52 of 310 
 
investor who is willing to invest in the airport 
development, 
reintroduction 
of 
passenger 
flight 
from Mafikeng to OR Tambo subsidy, maybe Exco 
for approval of an appointment service provider, 
projects are at different levels of execution.” 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So could I just ask, that 
reference 
to 
the 
Acting 
Director 
General 
being 
in 
discussions with a possible investor, is that a reference to 
you? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what were you involved in there? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I do not have a recollection of 
research  and who were these possible investors.  In 
government investors come from time to time, it could be 
any of them but …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did anything ever happen with that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, I do not think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then let us move over to the table that 
appears adjacent to that left hand column. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because you will see that it identifies 
the status of the programme and then there are various 
projects identified under the status of the programme.  Do 
you see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 53 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the first project was the increase of 
safety areas of runaway and upgrading.  I think that is 
supposed to day runway, I do not think it is supposed to 
say runaway. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Runway. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Am I right in that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   You are right, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will there is an estimated 
budget for that item and an available budget.  So the 
estimated 
budget 
was 
15 
million 
and 
there 
is 
an 
10 
identification that there is an available budget and you will 
see again the implementing agency there is that the 
Department of Public Works and Roads. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, which we saw previously was 
going to be looking at the upgrading of the runway.  Then 
there is a cargo logistics hub or freight, part of the project, 
that we have seen reference to previously.  It indicates 
there that the estimated budget is 1.2 billion and the 
available budget in red says no funding.  Do you see that? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So am I understanding this correctly to 
say that I understand this to mean insofar as there was a 
project for cargo logistics hub and freight being developed 
there was no funding for that when this report was put 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 54 of 310 
 
together. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and then let us go to the one that 
we are interested in for the purposes of the Commission’s 
work.  The third programme or project is the reintroduction 
of passenger flights from Mafikeng to O R Tambo subsidy.  
What is the funding position for that project? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No funding, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No funding.  Right.  So that accords with 
what is said in red on the left hand column of the page, is 
10 
it not?  That there is no funding available for some of the 
projects under the programme, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If there is no funding available for the 
project then it should not be authorised, should it? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Not necessarily so, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why is that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, as I recall, the government at 
the time saw great need for revitalization of the airport but 
I also recall that there was no funding in the Department of 
20 
Community Safety and Transport Management.  I also 
recall that the accounting officer of the department met 
with Provincial Treasury, I also recall that they made a 
recommendation that in view of the fact the departments 
were not spending in the original budget meant for MRRRP 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 55 of 310 
 
that this important element will be accommodated.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m, it would be accommodated out of 
the office of the Premier’s budget, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   There was no office of the Premier 
budget.  No office of the Premier budget in this, I think – I 
thought the model was clear, Chair.  What happened at the 
beginning, the Premier …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Professor Mokgoro, just pull 
the mic a little closer to you. 
PROF MOKGORO:   What happened was… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   What happened was, subsequent the 
State of the Province Address the Provincial Government 
that had the responsibility to give effect to the policy 
priorities contained in the State of the Province Address 
and with regard to Mafikeng as a capital town, a process 
developed where departments each had to contribute an 
amount of 10 million towards the realisation of the 
programmes in MRRRP .  So once that had been done, the 
department would in the broad policy of the Premier, 
20 
departments had to put in projects or programmes that 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
their 
mandates 
they 
would 
implement. 
 
However, with the passage of time, the pace at 
which they were doing so was disappointingly slow and in 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 56 of 310 
 
the course of this event of this process Community Safety 
and Transport Management, having identified within their 
own 
plans, 
the 
resuscitation 
and 
reinstating 
flights, 
approached Treasury and in their discussions they then 
recommended that the money that was being unused 
should then be used for purposes of resuscitation of flight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have missed the earlier part of 
your response.  So Ms Hofmeyr asked the question whether 
the position is not that if there is no funding for a project 
there should be no authorisation of payment and your 
10 
answer or part of your answer was, as I understood it, not 
necessarily.  Okay, is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   What I am saying, Chair, I say in this 
particular instance the accounting of the Department of 
Transport 
Management 
had 
been 
in 
discussion 
with 
Treasury about the need to resuscitate the flights but in 
their budget they had not made provision for that.  So in 
their discussion with Treasury a proposal was made that 
since MRRRP was being under spent, they could then 
utilise these funds to provide for this need.  That is what I 
20 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would your answer therefore be to 
that question that Ms Hofmeyr put to you as a general rule 
there should be no authorisation of payment in relation to a 
project whether there is no funding.  In this case although 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 57 of 310 
 
originally there may not have been funding available, 
special arrangements were made to ensure that there 
would be money that would be used to pay for this project.  
Would that be your answer? 
PROF MOKGORO:   My answer – yes, it will be – my 
answer, Chair, which simply means that the need identified 
in Community Safety and Transport Management was not 
inconsistent with the broad policy idea of revamping 
Mafikeng. 
 
So through PFMA, adjustment and transfer of funds, 
10 
a decision was taken that since in this area we are not 
spending as fast as we should, let us assist in this need of 
resuscitating air traffic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I guess the bottom line at least must 
be if there is no funding, you cannot authorise payment but 
if arrangements are made in terms of which maybe funds 
are moved from elsewhere to make funding available then 
you authorise and payment would be permissible. 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
 
Well, 
certainly, 
as 
I 
say, 
the 
discussion was between Community Safety and Transport 
20 
Management and between Treasury and Community and 
Safety Management about precisely the transfer of funds. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, just before the break I would like 
to ask Prof Mokgoro just to consider one issue over the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 58 of 310 
 
break, if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That comes up directly from the 
engagement you have just had with Prof Mokgoro.  Prof 
Mokgoro, despite all the efforts that you have made to put 
your statement together and the follow ups from the 
Commission about missing documents, I have not seen a 
single document that records this arrangement that you 
speak 
of 
where 
Community 
Safety 
and 
Transport 
Management went to Treasury and got an authorisation of 
10 
Treasury to take R50 million out of the office of the 
Premier and allocate it to these flight subsidies.   
So I would like to ask you, I might have missed it, 
over the break if you could look through the file that 
comprises your bundle and let us know if you can find any 
document there that actually records – because it is a 
matter of financial discipline, is it not, that you should 
have documents recording when a R50 million swing is 
taken in relation to a budget.  So please let us know after 
the break if there is a single document you can find. 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   Can I just make a correction before we 
do so, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, sure. 
PROF MOKGORO:   I think the evidence leader keeps on 
making reference to the funds of the office of the Premier 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 59 of 310 
 
and I just want to correct this.  There was no fund of the 
office of the Premier, this is money that was pulled from 
departments with the intention of revamping Mafikeng so 
that expenditure of any amount would be the responsibility 
of accounting officer that will be getting their department’s 
project implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess she is talking about the same 
money or funds, I guess, but the point you seek to 
emphasise is that the office of the Premier may have been 
the custodian of those funds but those funds were to be 
10 
used 
for 
the 
projects 
of 
the 
departments 
that 
had 
contributed to it.  Is that putting it …[intervenes] 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, every department contributed, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Everybody, yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Every department contributed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   But departments were then invited – 
given the policy statement of the Premier… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   Come up with programmes.  That is 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but once the money coming from 
different departments was in the office of the Premier, are 
you making the point that it was not – it did not constitute 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 60 of 310 
 
budget of the Premier ’s office? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, it did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It did not. 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, it did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whose budget did it remain as?  Did it 
remain as the budget of a particular department, did it 
remain as budget for different departments? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, it remained – effectively, at a 
practical level, it remained budgets of particular – of 
departments that would have come up with projects. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Contributed. 
PROF MOKGORO:   In other words, you have pooled this 
money and Department of Public Works says we have a 
responsibility to patch potholes.  They would then go 
through normal procurement processes and then make 
submissions to say we request funding for the following 
and all we had to do was to ensure that the project that 
was being submitted is consistent with the priorities 
outlined. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you can help me, I cannot 
20 
remember whether this is dealt with in your affidavit, why 
would the departments have been asked to contribute 
money that would sit in the Premier ’s office, as it were, but 
money that would be used for different departments?  In 
other words, why would the Department of Community 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 61 of 310 
 
Safety for example not rather keep let us say its 5 million 
that it may have contributed because in the end even it if 
sends this money to the Premier ’s office it can only be 
used by that department and that department only, its 
portion.  So why was it necessarily to bring this money to 
the Premier ’s office if that was the position? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, certainly, Chair, the situation 
was unusual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
PROF MOKGORO:   The situation, that arrangement was 
10 
an unusual one.  That is unusual one and the questions 
that you are raising is the same question that we asked but 
the 
fundamental 
thing 
is, 
do 
departments 
remain 
accountable for what they draw given the projects that they 
had identified that had been approved under MRRRP? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because it is strange to me.  You see 
if, for example, the Premier ’s office had wanted to push 
certain projects but it did not have enough funds but the 
Premier had identified those projects as important or as 
projects that should be given priority.  I can understand a 
20 
request 
or 
direction 
that 
gets 
sent 
to 
the 
various 
departments to say there are these special projects that 
the premier has identified that he particularly wants to be 
handled in his office.  
Each department must contribute something in 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 62 of 310 
 
order to make 50 million, for example, you know?   So 
every department sends 2 million, 1 million according to 
their ability, or 5 million or whatever, whatever but once it 
is in the Premier ’s office it is not their money, it is now the 
money of the Premier ’s office and the Premier then uses it 
for the specific projects.   
 
So but if the position, as I understand you to be 
saying, is that the – in the end each department will be 
deemed to – well spend this money that used to sit in their 
departments but has been moved to the Premier ’s office, 
10 
they must spend it but the Premier ’s office is the one that 
authorises.  It just seems strange, why do you not allow 
them to go on and spend it in the normal way if the Premier 
or the Acting DG must perform some oversight function, he 
continues to do so but the money stays with the various 
departments and if the department must account to the 
office of the Premier in terms of pace and expenditure or 
spending of that money, that is fine, that I can understand.   
 
What I do not understand is why are you taking it 
away from them if in any way – in any event it will still be 
20 
used by them?  Ja. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Can I answer that question, Chair?  
Perhaps the question that you are asking is the question 
that the whole world is asking and I will tell you why, Chair.  
There is a concept of joined up government where the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 63 of 310 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Joined…? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Joined up.  Joined up, yes, joined up.  
There is a concern increasingly and I am talking about 
governments throughout the globe where the question of 
silos 
is 
not 
effective 
in 
bringing 
about 
a 
collective 
approach to addressing matters of development.  So 
countries throughout the world, they have tried various 
mechanisms to make sure that there is one government, 
one budget with regard to programmes that have to be 
10 
carried out. 
 
So I think the puzzle is not only what you have just 
expressed but it is a global puzzle.  Some countries have 
tried to address successfully this kind of problem, others 
have not. 
 
You see, the PFMA in a sense contradicts the idea 
of government working together because what the PFMA 
describes is a vertical approach of accountability.  You 
have an accounting office, you have a political principal 
whose responsibility it is to account to the people who 
20 
have elected him or her.  You have an accounting officer 
who, amongst others, has to oversee the expenditure of 
funds in terms of the rules in the Act.   
So the minute you want to have funding in a country 
like I think – not Australia, but – I think it is Australia, 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 64 of 310 
 
probably Australia -  New Zealand, at least.  They call it 
me-tooism where government would say these are our 
priorities and we find, for instance, when we look at the 
priorities, there is virtually nothing that is given to 
agriculture and I am the Minister or the accounting officer 
for Agriculture.   
Now if the principle of collectivism, I have no 
business to complain that I want to be there too, I want to 
be there as well, and that is where the concept of me-
tooism comes. 
10 
And as I say, governments are continually grappling 
– even in our country, we have a concept called district 
development models.  The district development molecule – 
look at the documents – it talks about one district, one 
budget.  What does it mean?  It means the National 
government that implements in that particular province or 
the 
broader 
locality, 
the 
Provincial 
Government 
that 
implementing 
that 
locality, 
the 
local 
government 
that 
implements the locality must all work together to ensure 
that let us leave our parochial interest and biases but 
20 
address together this developmental need. 
So I can understand the puzzle and I am equally 
looking for solutions to find a way in which we achieve 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the tea adjournment, it 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 65 of 310 
 
is twenty five past eleven.  We will resume at twenty to 
twelve.  We adjourn. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us proceed.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Professor Mokgoro 
before the break I asked you about documents relating to 
Treasury approval but I am going to come back to that in a 
moment.  I would like to just pick up a point that you made 
10 
when you were engaged in a discussion with the Chair. 
 
You see you made the point about the need for 
joined-in 
Government 
as 
I 
understand 
it, 
and 
as 
I 
understand your sworn statement part of the idea behind 
the MRRRP Project was to do just that, was to have a big 
project that could be run and managed by the Premier ’s 
Office, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   It could be run by government with the 
coordination being done by the Office of the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and you were the accounting 
20 
officer in the Office of the Premier? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I was the accounting officer in the 
Office of the Premier, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you were then required to authorise 
any payments that were coming from funds that had been 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 66 of 310 
 
placed with the Office of the Premier.  Correct?  
PROF MOKGORO:   I was to authorise programs that the 
executive council had reflected on and satisfied itself that 
the department that is responsible for executing had 
actually done so and if you look at the minutes I am having 
there should be in the documents we submitted, that that is 
how it happened.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   We will look at the minutes in a moment 
Professor Mokgoro but I am interested in the question of 
accountability because earlier on you made a statement 
10 
that the PFMA is actually inconsistent with some of these 
joined-in Government initiatives.  Did I understand your 
evidence correctly?  
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you will accept that the PFMA is 
principally concerned with accountability for spending, is it 
not? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, and in accordance with the PFMA 
you as the accounting officer in the Office of the Premier 
20 
were accountable for any expenditure out of that office.  
Correct?  
PROF MOKGORO:   The accounting officer for community 
safety and the transport management was the accounting 
officer and that is why they had to do – the accounting 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 67 of 310 
 
officer in community safety and transport management was 
accountable, the accounting officer for the R50million 
however EXCO having satisfied itself based on the reports 
of the MEC and if you look at the reports of the MEC they 
are signed by the accounting officer in the department at 
the MEC.  It always happens in that joint, in that fashion.  I 
as a coordinator Chair I keep on emphasising the point I 
was not the accounting officer for the MRRRP Fund.   
The implementing department were the accounting 
officers and they came to EXCO and satisfied EXCO that 
10 
they had done the necessary processes and EXCO then 
would be comfortable that they had done their procurement 
in their department.      
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Professor Mokgoro the accounting 
officer 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Community 
Safety 
and 
Transport 
Development 
is 
responsible 
for 
approving 
expenditure from its budget.  Correct?  
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
 
That 
is 
correct 
under 
normal 
circumstances, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And we saw that there was no budget 
20 
whatsoever for the subsidies of these flights.  Correct?  
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is correct.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and so they had to come to the 
Office of the Premier in order to get funds from the 
R132million that had been placed in the Office of the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 68 of 310 
 
Premier in order to pay R50million to South African 
Express Airways.  Correct?  
PROF MOKGORO:   Provided that they satisfied the 
decision makers that it had gone through due process.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Professor Mokgoro somebody has to 
ultimately authorise the payment and that was you in this 
case, was that not? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, because the project was one of 
the priorities and the reports from the MEC was that that it 
actually had to go through due process.   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We will go to the report of the MEC in a 
moment but it is important that we understand who is 
accountable.  Whose ultimately on the line for saying yes 
we will pay R50million to South African Express Airways 
and what I am putting to you Professor Mokgoro is because 
the R50million did not come from community safety and 
transport 
developments 
budget 
but 
came 
from 
the 
R132million that had been placed in the Office of the 
Premier ’s budget it was you who had to authorise that 
payment.  Do you accept that?   
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   I do not Chair because there is a 
contradiction here.  I mean if I am the accounting officer 
why should I be expected to be the one who was seeing 
procurement it does not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me share with you what is going 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 69 of 310 
 
through my mind about the issue and you can comment on 
it.  What is going on in my mind is that an important 
principle of the PFMA has to be that an accounting officer 
is responsible for payments for the expenditure of the 
budget of his or her department because he or she can 
stop payments if he or she thinks this is not a proper 
payment she can stop those.  But if she or he does not 
have the power to authorise the use of certain funds or 
does not have the power to stop somebody from using 
those funds it is somebody else who has those powers then 
10 
it maybe that it makes sense to say the one who has the 
authority to say, to authorise payment or to authorise the 
use of or the expenditure of those funds maybe it makes 
sense that that is the person who for purposes of those 
funds should be regarded as the accounting officer for 
those funds.   
That is what is going on in my mind.  What do you 
say about that and that I am sorry – and therefore the HOD 
for community safety for example may well have taken the 
view that well these funds have now been taken away from 
20 
my department and have been taken to the Office of the 
Premier therefore the ultimate person who decides whether 
to authorise the use of those funds is the acting DG.  So 
that is the person who must make sure that before he or 
she, before he in this case authorises that he is satisfied 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 70 of 310 
 
that all the requirements that should be in place have been 
satisfied.  What do you say about that line of thinking? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair I thought I tried to explain that 
situation which in the context of the PFMA as it stands was 
an anomaly and I tried to explain it in the context of 
precisely what was happening in joined up-Government and 
I am saying it does not make sense and certainly these are 
the facts on the coordinator who is sitting in the Office of 
the Premier to be away from a process that starts with a 
supply chain management from A to Z.  And then through 
10 
the political head of that department actually come to 
EXCO to say we have done the necessary.  Where does the 
accounting officer who accounts nowhere but in the Office 
of the Premier?   
Where does he fit in to suddenly become the 
accounting officer there I do not think it is truth it is unfair 
to impose that responsibility of accounting on the Director 
General’s sitting in the Office of the Premier because the 
Office of the Premier would go by what the political 
principle of that department is reporting and what the 
20 
collective of government leaders are comfortable with that 
kind of report. 
Almost like the person who is overseeing who is 
coordinating is the one that says based on what the MEC 
has reported and based on the submission which is signed 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 71 of 310 
 
by the accounting officer in that implementing department 
and the political principle and they accept it as by EXCO, 
who am I to refuse.  
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the records that need to be 
examined by the AG or whoever, in terms of how for 
example those funds were used.  I am now talking about 
the funds that came to the Office of the Premier being 
contributed 
by 
different 
departments. 
 
Do 
you 
know 
whether the Auditor General regarded the acting DG in the 
Office of the Premier as being accountable for those or 
10 
regarded the HOD of community safety as being the 
accounting officer for those, what was the position?          
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair the truth of the matter is that if 
you look at the past six years the best audit outcome that 
was produced was the accounting officer in question now 
because I produced an un-qualified audit outcome which is 
the second best to a clean audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I understand that but my question is 
simply whether because now we are in 2020.  The Auditor 
General would have conducted there - they would have 
20 
prepared there reports and so on.  I am just wondering 
where they put this money, who they put this money under.  
Did they put it under the accounting officer in the Premiers 
Office or did they deal with it on the basis that it was under 
the HOD as the accounting officer or is that something that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 72 of 310 
 
you have not had a chance to check in the AG’s reports?     
PROF MOKGORO:   I have not checked that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
PROF MOKGORO:   But I would be surprised that the 
accounting officer in the Office of the Premier at the time 
would obtain an un-qualified audit outcome because that 
certainly would constitute irregular expenditure.  But as I 
said that can be verified by going back to the documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall whether you yourself in 
terms of whatever documentation you may have prepared 
10 
for purposes of the Auditor General’s work whether you put 
it under yourself as the accounting officer or whether you 
only sort of being accounted for other funds that would fall 
within the budget of the Premiers Office but not this 
particular fund because it needed to be dealt with under 
the different Heads of Department?   
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not recall.  
PROF MOKGORO:   But basic common sense would 
suggest that it could not be that the person who started the 
20 
value chain process should not be the one who accounts 
but the one who is coordinating and say based on what has 
been reported to EXCO and based on the decision of 
EXCO.  It cannot be that suddenly the accounting officer 
for that activity becomes the one in the Office of the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 73 of 310 
 
Premier and that is the point that I have been trying to 
make. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Professor Mokgoro I would 
like to remind you of what you said in your sworn statement 
because the questions I am putting to you today are 
derived directly from your statement.  So let us go to page 
20 if we may of Exhibit DD32.1.   
PROF MOKGORO:   Page 20? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   20, yes.  You see at page 20 you 
10 
explained 
to 
us 
precisely 
what 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
R132million were and you explained to us precisely why it 
was 
that 
the 
R50million 
was 
authorised 
from 
that 
R132million.  Let me take you first to paragraph 53 on 
page 20.  At paragraph 53 of your sworn statement you 
say: 
“I have already indicated that funds were placed in 
the Office of the Premier for this project amounted 
to a R132million.” 
This project – there is a reference to the MRRP, correct?      
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, right.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so here you are saying that there 
were funds placed in the Office of the Premier for a 
R132million.  Have I understood that correctly? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, as it stands.  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 74 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and then if you go down to 
paragraph 55 you say: 
“I have read the transcript containing oral evidence 
of Ms Phatudi relating to my role in the payment of 
an amount of R50million to SA Express.  From the 
outset I admit that the amount was paid from vote 1 
which belongs to the Office of the Premier to South 
African Express.”     
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you go on at paragraph 56 and 
10 
you say: 
“First I need to state that the payment of the said 
amount was made from the funds that were for the 
MRRRP project.” 
That was the amount of the R132million that I referred to 
earlier as appearing on page 5 of that submission that we 
looked at, right.  So I understand Professor Mokgoro you to 
be saying on this page first that there were funds 
contributed from various departments compromising of 
R132million placed in the Office of the Premier.  Correct?  
20 
If you will just say yes because the transcript does not pick 
up a head nod.   
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You then confirmed that the R50million 
that 
was 
paid 
to 
SA 
Express 
was 
paid 
from 
that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 75 of 310 
 
R132million.  Correct?  
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was – it was paid from what is 
called vote 1 which belongs to the Office of the Premier.  
Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were the accounting officer in the 
Office of the Premier.  Correct?  
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You had to authorise that payment of a 
10 
R50million.  Correct?   
PROF MOKGORO:   The authorisation followed a process 
of procurement in the Department of COSATMA.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
PROF MOKGORO:   And they came to the MEC and the 
accounting officer came to the executive council and 
assured the executive council that all processes had been 
complied with and in fact before they came in a previous 
meeting, they had actually been informed by EXCO go and 
do the normal process.   
20 
Now let me deal with the question of vote 1.  My 
recollection as I said here Chair is that surely the money 
has to be kept somewhere for this purpose and why should 
it be reimbursed because a purpose had been identified, a 
purpose that had a collective, a collective approach.  I 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 76 of 310 
 
insist Chair that it cannot be true that I was the accounting 
officer for this amount where procurement was happening 
elsewhere…[intervene]      
ADV HOFMEYR:   But…[intervene] 
PROF MOKGORO:   Based on what was reported.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Professor Mokgoro the HOD of the 
Department 
of 
Community 
Safety 
and 
Transport 
Development came to you to authorise the payment 
because they had no budget for it.  The budget was sitting 
in the Office of the Premier that is what the document 
10 
showed you they not.  
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair I repeat the department was 
given instructions to go and do the necessary processes 
and come back to EXCO and report and once EXCO was 
satisfied that due process had been followed the money 
had to be released.   
The money had to be kept somewhere and because 
of a collective approach to delivery and the accounting 
officer in the Office of the Premier who is doing the 
coordination cannot suddenly be the one who gets the – 
20 
who is the accounting officer for that amount.  And I want 
to insist why should we have somebody do – actually the 
entire processes which is prescribed in the PFMA other 
than the accounting officer of the Premier.  I think that is a 
question that should be raised.        
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 77 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but…[intervene] 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is the actual point I am making.  I 
was not the accounting officer otherwise I am the one who 
should have gone through the procurement processes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But should you not have said that when 
they approached you with the invoice from SA Express 
should you not have said then this is not for me to 
authorise, I know nothing about the procurement process.  
This is happened in your department; you should be 
responsible for it.     
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, Chair because all the boxes had 
been ticked the money had to be released.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well none of the boxes were ticked 
Professor Mokgoro I would like to take you to why I say 
that if I may.  Let us look at what EXCO decided on the 3 r d 
of December 2014 because you have made reference to the 
minutes of that meeting previously and I said we would 
come to it.  You will find it at page 92 of Exhibit DD32.1.   
PROF MOKGORO:   92? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Professor Mokgoro I understand 
20 
your sworn statement to say that you were – were you 
present at this meeting; I do not think you were present at 
this meeting.  Is that correct?  But you obtained the 
minutes afterwards let me just get my notes if you will give 
me a moment.  Yes, you say in your statement at 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 78 of 310 
 
paragraph 61, what was presented to EXCO – I will just 
read it to you do not need to go there but just so that we 
are clear. 
“What was presented to EXCO of which I was not in 
attendance on 3 December 2014 is reflected in the 
minutes which you then attached.” 
So can I just confirm you were not in attendance at that 
meeting, is that right?   
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair I cannot recollect but remember 
I am the secretary to EXCO even if I was not in that 
10 
meeting the minutes would be written and if there is a fact 
such as the one that is being dealt with here that this was 
presented why should I refute that simply because I was 
not in the meeting.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I am just – I tell you why it is going 
to be important Professor Mokgoro I do not understand 
what these minutes reflect at all I need to be frank with 
you.  They do not make any sense to me so if you were 
present in the meeting, I was going to ask you to assist us 
in understanding.  But do I understand the position to be 
20 
you were not present so you would not be able to assist us 
with what was being discussed?    
PROF MOKGORO:   I would have to check the records as 
to whether or not I was in that meeting and the possibility 
exist that I was not.    
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 79 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay your sworn statement says you 
were not.  Do you think you checked it before you did your 
sworn statement?   
PROF MOKGORO:    I should have; I should have yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So can we take it for today that you 
were not present? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, well as reflected in my statement.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   In your sworn statement right.  So you 
would have then just been working with the minutes that 
we are working with now.  Correct?    
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Can you repeat that question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words Ms Hofmeyr is saying if 
you were not present at that meeting as to what transpired 
at that meeting you would have based, you would have 
looked at the minutes to say this is what was decided and 
these are the reasons if there are reasons given. So 
whatever 
you 
did 
would 
have 
been 
based 
on 
your 
understanding of the minutes.    
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair I am indebted.  Okay 
let us look at what is reflected on this minutes, in the 
minutes of this meeting on the 3 r d of December 2014.  You 
will see that there is a topic new items number 3, 3.1 says: 
“Proposed 
introduction 
of 
schedule 
flights 
for 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 80 of 310 
 
Mafikeng and Pilanesberg airports.  It reflects that 
the matter was tabled by the MEC for community 
safety and transport management and during the 
discussions the following issues were raised”. 
Can I just stop there; do I understand your evidence 
correctly to be you did have sight of these minutes of the 
meeting that occurred in December 2014 before you 
authorised the payment in March of 2015.  Is that correct?     
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, that is correct.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, and do you remember reading 
10 
these minutes?  
PROF MOKGORO:   I could have read the minutes, yes.   
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Because 
previously 
you 
kept 
emphasising if I say in fairness to you Professor Mokgoro 
that you were relying on EXCO’s decision to approve this, 
is that right?   
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, having relied on the political 
head and the accounting officer of the department.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct and do you see that reflected in 
these minutes.  So let us look at what these minutes say 
20 
the minutes say that there was a discussion and then there 
is a first bullet.  It says the following: 
“This submission - now that is a reference to the 
submission from the MEC for the community safety 
and transport management.  The submission talks 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 81 of 310 
 
about making use of only one service provider.  It 
was explained that the reason is because there 
would only be one service provider rendering a 
service between Mafikeng and Johannesburg.  If 
other service providers were available, it would 
certainly 
have 
been 
against 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
Competition Commission.” 
 Let just stop there.  Can you tell me what that means? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, I would have to check what that 
means but my understanding has always been that because 
10 
of the restriction in this industry that was the reason why 
that they decided to appoint four out of those which was 
submitted.  But again, going through the minutes Chair one 
would see that one of the considerations was the fact that 
this 
would 
have 
been 
a 
government 
to 
government 
transaction and that has always been my understanding.  
That was one of the factors that made the MEC to reach 
the decision.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay we will come to the submission in 
a moment because your absolutely right in fairness to you 
20 
Professor Mokgoro the only reason that was given by the 
MEC for community safety and transport management for 
selecting South African Express that was going to require a 
subsidy in tens of millions of rand’s more than the other 
airlines was because it was a government entity and 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 82 of 310 
 
therefore not profit driven.   
So your memory is correct in that I am going to 
interrogate whether that could ever be a good reason to go 
with the most expensive presentation.  But for present 
purposes you agree with me this does not make sense what 
is reflected in bullet 1.  Is that right?   
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, it is.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is absolutely nonsensical.  
PROF MOKGORO:   Right.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It says something about you have to go 
10 
with one provider because there is a service between 
Mafikeng and Johannesburg because otherwise the rules of 
the Competition Commission will be breached.  Do you 
agree with me we cannot understand what that means?    
PROF MOKGORO:   That point to me of the Competition 
Commission does not make sense to me Chair but as he 
reported that they went through a process I think it will be 
impossible to expect more than one service provider to be 
appointed.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh indeed you go through a process in 
20 
order to select your preferred service provider do you not 
what we have uncovered in the evidence is that there was 
no process that proceeded that selection that would ever 
qualify as a proper procurement process.   
What there was were six airlines invited to Sun City 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 83 of 310 
 
to make proposals we do not know on what, we know that 
they came up with varying ideas about what to do with the 
airports and we know that the single reason given by the 
MEC for going with South African Express Airways was 
because it was a government entity that was not profit 
driven.  Correct? If you will just say yes so that we will get 
it on the record, you cannot nod.     
PROF MOKGORO:   My apologies.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Professor Mokgoro.  Okay so 
we do not understand the first bullet right.  The second 
10 
bullet says: 
“The office of the Premier MEC for community 
safety and transport management and MEC for 
finance 
economy 
and 
enterprise 
development 
should meet to address the issues raised by the 
Minister of Transport.” 
Now that is one of the areas where we do not have clarity 
Professor Mokgoro because we ask for some of the 
annexures that were attached to the submission of the 
MEC that preceded this meeting and there is a reference 
20 
there to the Minister of Transport at the time raising some 
issue and it needing it to be addressed but we have never 
been able to obtain those annexures from your office.  We 
were told yesterday they cannot be found.  Can you add 
any greater insight on what the issue was from the Minister 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 84 of 310 
 
of Transport?         
PROF MOKGORO:   Firstly Chair I do not have any 
recollection as to what the reason was nor do I know 
whether or not that meeting took place.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Let us go to then to the 
fourth bullet down.  It says: 
“The HOD should have done a thorough analysis of 
all presentations received to outline what it means 
financially to the province to subsidise the Mafikeng 
OR Tambo route 100%.  Consider all options and 
10 
propose best options for consideration by EXCO.”   
Professor Mokgoro I read that as a criticism of what the 
HOD had done and what the HOD should have done.  Do 
you read it in the same way?      
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair I am not quite sure but one 
possible implications to what is standing here is to say 
could mean yes we proceed because we assume that the 
HOD should have.  Another way you use this expression is 
to say you have not done it you should.     
ADV HOFMEYR:   “The HOD should have done a thorough 
20 
analysis because they want to understand what it 
means financially for the province to subsidise 
Mafikeng or the OR Tambo route at a 100%.” 
Are you saying that can be read to say he did do a 
thorough analysis?  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 85 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, all I am saying Chair is I do not 
have recollection however purely on an interpretation if 
reading this it could mean that we assume that this had 
been done and maybe that is why the use of should have 
or it could mean the context could be different to say he 
has not done it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am not sure whether there is room 
for the interpretation that says we assume he has done this 
or she has done this because when the sentence says: 
“The HOD should have done a thorough analysis of 
10 
all presentations of sealed.  So applying what it 
means financially for the province to subsidise the 
Mafikeng or OR Tambo 100%.”  
It seems clear to me that if this is what was said what was 
the point being made was they did not do this.  That is as I 
see it but I may be missing something.  I do not seem to – to 
think there is room for an interpretation that says they were 
under the impression that the HOD had done this exercise 
that they are talking about. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Chair perhaps the – the best way to 
20 
resolve this is to read this together with other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Perhaps the best way to resolve this is 
to read this with other documents such as the presentations 
by the MEC to EXCO. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 86 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Accepted by the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But somebody who reads the – these 
minutes without the benefit of any other document my 
impression would be that the meaning that they would attach 
to that sentence is that it was being said that the HOD did 
not do this exercise that is referred to in the sentence.  That 
is how I see it.  Would you still maintain that you think the 
other interpretation is a possible interpretation as well? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Chair I do not have any stubborn view 
10 
about that.  All I am.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Encourage the commission to do is to 
read this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Together with other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  And that is the best way to – to shed the 
light on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have a recollection as to how you 
20 
understood it when you looked at these minutes some – 
maybe at the time – the first time you – what your 
understanding was of this or is the position that you cannot 
recall what your understanding was? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Perhaps without – with respect Chair 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 87 of 310 
 
without restricting myself to what is being stated here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  There is documents that I have gone 
through actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  State that the MEC reported that they 
have gone through process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you say other documents that you 
10 
would have read … 
PROF MOKGORO:  Such as minutes of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Other meetings of EXCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Suggested that the HOD had done this 
exercise. 
PROF MOKGORO:  My – my knowledge has always been 
that the HOD had done that exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you say… 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
And 
the 
MEC 
reported 
on 
the 
20 
explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Explained on other documents that you 
were aware of. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 88 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Professor Mokgoro I – in fairness to I 
agree that it is helpful sometimes to read things in context 
and against the other documents.  Let us look at the next 
bullet because the next bullet I want to suggest to you 
confirms the interpretation that I understand both the Chair 
and I have of the bullet that we were concentrating on.  You 
see the bullet we were concentrating on says: 
“The HOD should have done a thorough 
analysis.” 
The next bullet says: 
10 
“There should also have been a marketing 
strategy in place.” 
I want to put it to you that those two together make it 
absolutely clear that what is happening in these two bullets 
is a criticism is being made of the extent to which the 
submission analysed key things and included key things.  
The first bullet we looked at says:  
“There should have been a thorough analysis 
of the financial implications of paying 100% 
subsidy for the flights between Mafikeng and 
20 
OR Tambo.” 
And the second bullet we are looking at says: 
“There should also have been a marketing 
strategy in place.” 
Do you disagree with that reading? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 89 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:  Chair what I recall is that part of the 
exercise was a quick survey that was done among public 
servants and the need to settle between Gauteng and the 
North West.  That was one of the determinants in terms 
assessing whether or not there was a need for that.  So that 
it cannot be entirely true that the marketing strategy was not 
used and that is why my suggestion Chair is this must be 
read together with other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you take issue with Ms Hofmeyr’s 
interpretation of those two bullet points on the basis that you 
10 
say you read them – you read these minutes in the context of 
other documents and therefore your understanding of these 
minutes is different because of those other documents? 
PROF MOKGORO:  At a literal and face value I do not take 
issue with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
PROF MOKGORO:  But my suggestion is that that – let us 
broaden and look at other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
Because 
it 
could 
just 
be 
an 
20 
interpretation that we have here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I guess you might be saying 
reading this alone you would have no issue with Ms 
Hofmeyr’s interpretation but reading it together with the 
other documents that you are talking about that you say you 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 90 of 310 
 
were exposed to made you – or gave you a different 
understanding. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair and that is why my reading of 
this is EXCO was probably ticking the boxes to make sure 
that things have been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  It is then what is 
resolved on that page that causes some concern to me and it 
is actually a point Chair that you took up with Ms Phatudi 
when she gave evidence because what is resolved there 
10 
seems mutually inconsistent.  Let us look at what was 
resolved.  So A says EXCO agreed that the department 
should proceed with the chosen service provider and sign 
the contract SA Express.  And then B says the submission 
should serve again on 15 December 2014 with a proper 
analysis of the presentations and options for consideration 
by EXCO.  Does that not strike you as inconsistent PROF 
MOKGORO?   You recall that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I remember. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes now I remember yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  How can you decide to go with SA Express 
and tell the department to conclude a contract if you are also 
saying to the department you need to come back to us in 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 91 of 310 
 
about two weeks’ time… 
CHAIRPERSON:  With this analysis. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And do your proper analysis. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes again one possibly interpretation 
was to say we seem to be persuaded in this particular 
direction but for us to be certain about the decision we are 
making I am not acting on behalf of EXCO I am also doing 
some interpretation here it could mean that for us to be 
absolutely sure you must come back again and clarify the 
following. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if that is the position why would EXCO 
make the decision reflected in paragraph [a] under resolved 
facts if there was still an analysis that they wanted to look 
at.   
Why not defer a decision until you have seen that 
and then make a decision?  What is going to happen if – if 
afterwards you have already said the department must 
conclude the contract then – and the analysis that came – 
comes later suggest that actually there should be no 
conclusion of a contract because of what the analysis 
20 
reveals.   
So in other words, I am saying if you as EXCO 
appreciate that you need to see a certain analysis relating to 
this matter why do you not defer your decision until you have 
seen that?   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 92 of 310 
 
Why do you say to the department you must proceed 
with your chosen service provider and sign the contract 
because after that the HOD of the department would be 
entitled the following day to sign the contract with the – with 
the service provider – chosen service provider?  But EXCO 
still says bring an analysis in two weeks’ time.  For what 
point; what purpose?   
Because if that analysis reveals that actually there 
should not have been a contract signed you have already 
signed and you have authorised the HOD you cannot – you 
10 
cannot blame the HOD because you authorised – said he 
must go ahead.  He acted in compliance with the resolution 
of EXCO.  So what – what was going on?  It is strange. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair with respect I wish EXCO was 
sitting in the seat that I am occupying now. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But Prof Mokgoro you read these minutes 
as I understand it and you relied on EXCO’s approval based 
on the MEC and HOD’s submission when you decided to 
authorise the payment, is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes and I relied on the entirety of 
20 
submissions to EXCO and ultimate EXCO’s decision and 
mine was to get out what they had decided. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you did not pick up this contradiction 
then when you read the minutes? 
PROF MOKGORO:  As I say at face value there is a 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 93 of 310 
 
contradiction and I kept on referring the commission to 
taking a totality view of – by reading all the documents that 
are here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes let us go to the only other document 
that was presented to EXCO at that meeting.  There is one 
other document it is the submission that was prepared by the 
HOD and the MEC.  Apologies it was prepared by the MEC 
and signed off by the HOD as well.  You will find that at page 
81 of DD32.1.   
So just to place this document in context Professor 
10 
Mokgoro this is the submission that you have highlighted in 
your sworn statement as having been presented to the 
Executive Council.  You will see at page 81 it is addressed to 
the Chairperson of the Executive Council the Council former 
Premier Mago Mapelo and it is from the MEC for Community, 
Safety and Transport Management and that was Mr Molopisi 
at the time.  If you go to the last page of the document which 
is page 90, 90 you will see it is also signed by Mr Mathla 
Koleng who was the HOD of that department. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Page what Chair? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  90, 90.   
CHAIRPERSON:  90? 
PROF MOKGORO:  90? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  You have that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I have got it Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 94 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So it is signed off by HOD and MEC and 
the front page indicates it is a document that the MEC places 
before EXCO as we saw in the minutes.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So in our investigations this is the 
only other document which could give context to what was 
decided on the 3 December.  We have asked for all 
documents related to this decision to procure the services of 
SA Express.  This is all that came up and this is all that you 
refer to in your sworn statement as well.   
10 
So I want to look at what this document tells us about 
a 
proper 
procurement 
process 
having 
been 
followed.  
Because your evidence has been you had been under the 
impression that proper procurement processes have been 
followed.  Professor Mokgoro I have looked in this document 
for some indication that proper procurement processes were 
followed and the only thing I found is at page 82.  Can you 
turn to page 82 please?  Page 82 under paragraph 4 there 
which is headed Process to activate the airports says the 
following: 
20 
“The department invited six potential airliners 
to submit and make presentations.  Of the six 
service providers invited only four presented 
their proposals as requested and the other 
two were advised to finalise their proposals 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 95 of 310 
 
and forward them to the department but were 
never received.” 
That is the sum total about process.  It is not a process like 
the process that Ms Phatudi went through when she was 
later asked to authorise the payment to the Management 
Company appointed under the agreement between South 
African Express Airways and the North West Government.   
I do not suggest we need to go there but Chair you 
will recall and if you want me to take you there I can 
Professor Mokgoro but she had a long departmental check 
10 
list for the procurement process.  That is a sheet where you 
tick off – you know earlier you said you need to tick off that 
the process was followed.   
And it goes through stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 
4 which ends up with budget control and all the responsible 
members have to say we went through this stage, yes we 
went through that stage, specification, adjudication etcetera.  
There is not even a mention of a check list having been 
followed here, is there? 
PROF MOKGORO:  No it is not mentioned here. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There is not a mention that there was a bid 
proposal that was submitted, is there? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Well I do not know what precedes this 
submission to EXCO.  I think it would be useful to see 
precisely what happened apart from what is stated as of. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 96 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But this is all that served before EXCO. 
PROF MOKGORO:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And this is the only document that the 
department has indicated to us exists in relation to this 
topic.  So I want to put it to you that you were also relying 
only on this document then.  And if you were only relying on 
this document Professor Mokgoro how could you have been 
satisfied that a proper procurement process had been 
followed? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Well Chair I acknowledge that this is all 
10 
that is stated here.  I do not recall seeing submission to 
EXCO with the entire detail of procurement process would be 
included in a submission to EXCO. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So there was nothing else and all that 
happens after that short paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe – maybe Ms Hofmeyr.  You see 
Premier when under paragraph 4 at page 82 the one we are 
dealing with says – the heading says Process to activate the 
airports and that seems to be the only paragraph in the 
document that has a heading saying Process.   
20 
Once you have read that would it not be fair to expect 
that it would strike somebody who expected that a normal 
open tender process would have been followed?  It would 
strike him that there was no mention of such a process under 
this paragraph and therefore that would make the reader to 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 97 of 310 
 
enquire more to say, why is there no mention of any 
procurement process under this – it did happen?   
What do you say to that thought?  That somebody 
who expect – who expected that for this kind of project there 
should be an open tender process when they come to this 
paragraph which is headed Process to activate the airports 
and finds that there is no mention of any open tender 
process that should have raised red flags to say I need to 
find out.  Why is there no mention – was it followed? 
PROF MOKGORO:  If – if Chair if I – my recollection serves 
10 
me well in my engagement with the HOD he mentioned 
something like because of the route and because of the 
profitability when you take a total list of airlines it only 
makes sense that these are the possible – these airlines 
would possibly qualify for that and I could be wrong in my 
recollection.  But certainly when one looks at this – that 
question would arise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe one should clear something that 
maybe should have been cleared earlier. Am I – am I right to 
assume that based on your knowledge of government 
20 
processes in terms of procurement and so on am I right to 
assume that your expectation for this kind of project would 
be that an open tender process should have been followed 
unless there were good grounds to deviate from it in which 
case then whatever deviation would have had to happen 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 98 of 310 
 
within the terms of the law. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Unless. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
PROF MOKGORO:  [Mumbling]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Professor Mokgoro I 
would like your comment on the following.  You see the HOD 
whom you have indicated to the Chair in answer to his 
question now who indicated to you that it made sense to just 
approach the six airlines because they were the ones who 
10 
were available in the market is the very same HOD who was 
implicated in the evidence of Ms Tlatsana as having received 
some of the funds that were paid out from the North West 
Government.  Were you aware of that evidence previously? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Well certainly I never suggested that 
what the HOD said was reasonable.  I am just saying I am 
just referring to a recollection of what he said to me and I am 
not passing any value judgment on that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see the – the reason why you would 
want check lists I put it to you the reason why you would 
20 
want processes to be followed is precisely to prevent 
situations where people for ulterior purposes are seeking to 
advance contracts with certain service providers so that they 
can enrich themselves.  Is that not so? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Chair on a daily basis the Director 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 99 of 310 
 
General in the office of the Premier does not enter into nitty 
gritty processes of departments.  And that is why in the 
course of [00:19:17] where initially you had one Accounting 
Officer 
across 
all 
government 
departments. 
 
The 
arrangement was changed where each department must have 
a – an Accounting Officer and the Director General then 
became the Accounting Officer only in the office of the 
Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you did – have said previously 
Professor Mokgoro that in order to be satisfied to authorise 
10 
this payment one of the things you would have taken into 
account is whether proper processes were followed, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I said the MEC for department as well as 
the HOD assured the Executive Council that processes had 
been followed and I want to emphasise once more.  My 
responsibility was not to get into the nitty gritty.  The MEC 
must have satisfied himself that the report that the HOD – 
his HOD gave him was authentic.  And the MEC is expected 
to have the necessary integrity that when it comes to EXCO 
and present this report this report – that it will be accepted 
20 
and indeed EXCO accepted it.  And I really think that what 
Ms Hofmeyr is asking me is probably in the [00:20:35] of the 
HOD of that department.  Who was tasked with the 
responsibility of doing precisely what she is asking with 
respect? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 100 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But Professor Mokgoro you have just given 
evidence that says that the MEC assured EXCO the 
Executive Committee that proper process has been followed.  
Did I understand your evidence correctly? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes and it is in black and white Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well this is not Professor Mokgoro with 
respect because the only paragraph dealing with process 
says nothing about a proper process having been followed.  
And the only other document you were relying on when you 
authorised the payment was the minutes that again say 
10 
absolutely nothing about process if anything the minutes 
reflect that the members of EXCO were concerned that a 
proper analysis had not been done.  Against those facts 
Professor Mokgoro how could you have been satisfied that 
EXCO was satisfied that a proper process had been 
followed? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Perhaps what we need to do Chair 
because some of the documents that I have gone through 
certainly point out that the MEC made this presentation 
assisted by the HOD and that is how the decision was taken. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying that there is a document or 
there are documents that might not be here in this bundle 
which were to the effect or was to the effect that the MEC 
had assured EXCO that there had been compliance with 
procurement processes in effect? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 101 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair I actually would have – would 
like the opportunity just to go through the bundle that I have 
been using all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh to see if you can find those documents. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes.  I think I should be able to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I – absolutely if Professor Mokgoro 
can assist us but I would just like to be clear about the fact 
that this has been an extensive investigation that the 
commission has done for more than two years.  We have 
10 
asked for all the relevant documents and nothing more than 
what is in your bundle has been produced.  But if there is 
more we happily would like to consider it certainly.  I just 
want to then go to the motivation that was given in the 
submission for selecting South African Express right because 
it is one of the things that clearly served before EXCO and 
which I understood your answer earlier to be we must 
consider what EXCO is recorded as having discussed and 
decided in the light of what was presented to it.  Right.  Now 
what this submission does is it talks about those four airlines 
20 
from whom presentations were received.  Do you recall that 
Professor Mokgoro? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I recall that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  And what it ends up – I am going to 
summarise just in the interest of time and if you disagree 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 102 of 310 
 
with any part of it please let me know.  But what ends up 
happening is SA Express is identified as the preferred 
service provider and the reader of the submission EXCO is 
told that is going to cost the North West Government R110 
million up front for the first year.  Do you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I recall that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is going to be five year contract so R110 
million is only in year one and over the successive years that 
amount will diminish to some extent but it will be a full five 
year commitment, correct? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it was being compared with for 
example Continental Aviation Solution who is the second 
airline 
whose 
presentation 
is 
considered. 
 
And 
what 
Continental Airline Solution was proposing was a sort of 
phased in approach where you would start with certain 
routes and then you would add routes and you would 
eventually get to Mauritius and Seychelles in the third phase 
apparently and do you recall what they were going to charge 
the North West Government for their proposed revamp of the 
20 
airports? 
PROF MOKGORO:  No I do not recall Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well you will find it at page 86.  They were 
going to charge the North West Government R4 397 725.00.  
You will find it at page 86.  It is sort of midway down.  It 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 103 of 310 
 
says: 
“The proposed start-up funding is estimated 
– I accept estimated – at R4 397 725.00.” 
Do you see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I have Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So the first thing that strikes me is that 
when 
the 
HOD 
and 
the 
MEC 
were 
evaluating 
these 
presentations and presenting this to EXCO; EXCO had 
before it a summary of the presentations that put R110 
million as year 1’s cost as compared with R4.7 million.  
10 
Right.  Do you agree with me that you would need some 
convincing to go with the R110 million rather than the R4.7 
million? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I agree with you.; 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And do you want to know what the only 
reason is that was given for going with SA Express rather 
than any of the providers? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I have no idea Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well let us find it.  It is at page 87.  The 
single reason that was given under paragraph 6. 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  For the proposed service provider is the 
following: 
“Based on the above proposals the SA 
Express was found to be relevant to meet the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 104 of 310 
 
Provincial Air lift strategy based on the fact 
that it is a state owned entity and not profit 
driven while SA Airlink, Continental and 
Challenger Airlines will be highly dependent 
on government for profit making.” 
Do you see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes I see that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That was the point you made earlier was it 
not that your understanding was there was a particular 
preference for SA Express because it was a government 
10 
entity, is that right? 
PROF MOKGORO:  I said I recall that that was one of the 
considerations. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Well did you give any thought to 
interrogate that reason as being the one to go for R110 
million rather than R4.7 million? 
PROF MOKGORO:  The point about you know a government 
system Chair is that you have departments and as I said 
repeatedly each department with its Accounting Officer and 
the responsibility of the Director General is to assist the 
20 
Premier in his or her constitutional responsibilities to 
coordinate administration.  And in terms of this principle the 
nitty gritty accountability responsibility lie with the HOD.  
And certainly the – every other day you would find things 
that do not make sense that happen in departments and what 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 105 of 310 
 
normally happens is that internal audit would be the one to 
pick up some of these anomalies – some of the things that 
do not make sense. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So do I have it as your evidence that it 
does not make sense? 
PROF MOKGORO:  Yes it does not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It does not make sense that you would go 
with R110 million. 
PROF MOKGORO:  It does not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Rather than R4.7.  Thank you Professor 
10 
Mokgoro.  Let us then finally move if we may… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I am sorry – of course Premier if 
you read documents and there is – there are decisions to be 
made whether to go with A or B in a situation such as this 
and you find that going with A would mean that the 
department would pay a substantially low amount than going 
to B even if something like that that might be an issue 
relating to a certain department I think that if you have 
something to do with it you would immediately say, hang on 
did you really see what is going on here?  Did you really see 
20 
that you are going to make the government pay R96 000.00 
rand more for the same service that you can get for – the 
government can get only for R4 million.  You would say, no 
but there is something not right.  HOD please tell me.  Even 
if the HOD did not report to you but if you see that because 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 106 of 310 
 
you would be concerned about why should government pay 
so much money when it can save so much money by going to 
– going that route?  That would be my thinking that it is so 
vast – the difference so vast that you would think no, no, 
there must be something wrong – there must be something 
that they did or there’s something wrong with this document.  
It cannot be that the one is 4 million, the other one is 100.  
And you would want somebody to just help you understand.  
Do you think I am expecting too much from somebody who is 
in the particular department? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Whether or not, that will change the 
situation.  I expect any response will lead to ask that 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   And I think it is one of the reasons why I 
would have had a discussion with the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   HOD.  Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   And as I have said earlier, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   When you find yourself in a situation 
20 
where you are a secretary and not a decision maker, almost 
at every meeting, there would be a matter that you differ 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   But there are decision makers that make 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 107 of 310 
 
those decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   And that is why, with respect, I said 
earlier, I wish Exco was sitting where I am sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  But of course, I would imagine 
that where it was going to be your signature that would 
authorise payment that would basically give effect to this 
choice and you saw something like this and it did not make 
sense to you, you would be entitled to refuse to authorise 
until you are satisfied.   
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not want somebody to say:  
How could you authorise it?  You should have refused in the 
light of this until you were satisfied that there was sense.  
This did not make sense.  It could not have made sense to 
you.   
 
You would not want to authorise payment because if 
somebody later on brought this document to say:  Did you 
read this document?  You say yes  Did you see this?  Yes, I 
saw it.  Does it make sense to you?  No, it does not make 
20 
sense.  Why did you authorise?  Then you do not have an 
answer.   
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, in my career, I have always 
insisted, even today, at least Treasury and a legal advisor 
would advise before I append my signature.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 108 of 310 
 
 
If you have a situation where information before you as 
involved discussions between the accounting officer and 
Treasury, you would tend to be satisfied that certain(?) 
things have been looked at.   
 
But I agree, it does not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Professor Mokgoro, I said I 
was going back to the question I posed before the break, 
which 
was, 
whether 
there 
were 
any 
documents, 
that 
evidence that confirmation that Treasury gave that the funds 
10 
could be expended.  Were you able to find any documents? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I cannot recall finding such a document. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.   
PROF MOKGORO:   But it would come as no surprise if... In 
fact, talking to Treasury recently that there was a discussion 
as to ensure that what I recall was in fact true.  That there 
was a discussion between Treasury and the accounting 
officer in department itself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice went down, Prof. 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   I recall and did recently, I did have 
discussions with Treasury as to why did we arrive at this.  
And I was reminded, once more, that it was because of under 
expenditure by other departments and then a process was 
put in place to appeal to Treasury and Treasury advised that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 109 of 310 
 
unspent funds should be utilised. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Professor Mokgoro, should you not 
have asked to be shown evidence of the alleged under 
spending?  And I ask that because you will remember, you 
put that document together on the 28 t h of October 2014. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
You 
identified 
precisely 
how 
the 
R 132 million placed in the Office of the Premier was going 
to be allocated.  And you confirmed in your evidence today 
fairly that the Mafikeng Airport subsidy, Pilanesberg Airport 
10 
subsidy played no part in that allocation, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I certainly knew myself, right from 
the outset, that the money was wilfully and for the entire 
rebuild of Mafikeng but my understanding of that was, at 
least being the process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but you took money out of a budget 
of R 132 million that was going to be spend on other 
projects, to spend it on a subsidy to SA Express for flights to 
airports. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, that was not my priority.  That 
20 
was not my decision. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, it was ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   But I have this point repeatedly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Professor Mokgoro.  In fairness to 
you.  You are the person who authorised the R 50 million 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 110 of 310 
 
being paid, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Authorise is not the same thing as what 
an accounting officer does in terms of the expenditure.  
Treasury has had discussions with transport management 
who have made submissions to Exco.  Exco has decided that 
this fund must go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   The accountability ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Premier... I think your answer is 
yes.  Because you... the question was, you confirm that you 
10 
authorised the payment.  Now we know that you did 
authorise.  So your answer to that question is:  Yes, I did 
authorise.  If she wants to ask further questions, we can take 
it from there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would like to move to the only documents 
we do have ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...about Treasury and the payment.  And 
you will find that at page 94 of Exhibit DD32.1.  Chair, I see 
we are approaching the lunch-break.  I certainly should be 
20 
able to finish in time.  I have a few more questions, just to 
give you a sense of where we are going. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you see page 94, Professor Mokgoro? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 111 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now that is what came to you as I 
understand it. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is what ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is addressed to you, the acting Director 
General. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it says: 
“Dear, Professor Mokgoro.  Attached please SAA 
Express documents for your urgent attention and 
processing of payment.” 
10 
 
And it comes from the HOD of Committee Safety and 
Transport.  Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then, if I understand your sworn 
statement, what was attached to it was the invoice from SAA 
Express.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, that is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your sworn statement says it was also 
accompanied by an unsigned copy of the agreement between 
SAA Express and the North West. 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We have asked for about a year for your 
department to provide us with that copy of the unsigned 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 112 of 310 
 
agreement.  I understand that it cannot be located.  Is that 
right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Is that the SLA or the MOU? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, the SLA.  As I understand your 
statement, you say you got this letter.  You got the invoice 
and you got the unsigned SLA.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair I got this document.  I got 
the MOU, as well as the SLA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, I was not aware that you got the MOU. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, there was an MOU. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because we have also never been able to 
locate that MOU.  Do you... have you made any efforts to 
find it? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, as I have said earlier Chair.  When 
I got word that were some missing documents, I did issue 
instructions for them to be submitted. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  I understand.  Well, the feedback 
yesterday from your lawyers was that they could not be 
located.  But I understand you... apologies.  From your 
office, was that they could not be located.  I have just been 
20 
assisted by that from my learned friends.  Right.   
 
So you get the request:  Please process for payment.  
And then you get an invoice which is over the page at 95 
which has something written at the bottom.   
 
Can you tell me whose handwriting that is at the bottom 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 113 of 310 
 
of the invoice? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, it... maybe before I respond to 
this question.  Maybe, just again a question of language.  
The letter that is addressed to me, it says: 
“Attached, please, South African Express documents 
for your attention... for your urgent attention and 
processing.” 
 
And the question that I am grabbling with is, does that 
mean the same as approve?   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just say that again? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   The letter addressed to me: 
“Attached, please, South African Express documents 
for 
your 
urgent 
attention 
and 
processing 
of 
payments.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I do want to convey to the Commission, 
the decisions that are taken there, as my role as coordinator 
was the decision makers have decided is to make funds 
available.  And this document actually confirms what I have 
been trying to argue all the time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
“Attached, please, South African Express documents 
for 
your 
urgent 
attention 
and 
processing 
of 
payments.” 
 
What is certainly says, it expects you to process 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 114 of 310 
 
payment and it seems that you are given certain SAA 
Express documents which it is considered you should have 
with regard to, and then processing of payment.  But I just 
want to understand the point you were seeking to make. 
PROF MOKGORO:   The point that I am making is and I 
thought that I had conveyed that sufficiently.  The point I 
keep on emphasising is, I hate to refer to myself as, you 
know, a boost-man.  Not say a boost-boy.   
 
There is a decision that is taken by the decision makers.  
And as part of the package, Treasury is involved, the 
10 
accounting officer is involved and the decision reaches me.   
 
This is a priority project indeed, as they certainly 
themselves have indicated.  And I have to make those funds 
available.   
 
So I then said to Treasury and the other finance people:  
Process this.  Maybe I should have gone back to Exco and 
said:  Your decision is uninformed.   
 
In retrospect, maybe I should have done so.  But it was 
not my space, you know.  Decisions and transactions take 
place in the departments and that is why there is an 
20 
accounting officer there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know what I would have expected and 
maybe somebody who has been in government for some time 
would not expect the same thing as I would.   
 
I would expect that if you were the person who had the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 115 of 310 
 
power to authorise payment in regard to a project that 
belongs to a particular department.   
 
I would imagine that your attitude would be, when your 
different departments want me to authorise payment, you 
must sent me documentation or a memo that satisfies me 
that certain things that need to be complied with before 
authorisation of payment can be made, have happened or 
have been complied with.   
 
So that there will be a memo that will say:  Acting DG, 
they are asking you to authorise payment for this and such 
10 
and such an amount.  This is about such and such a project.   
 
We assure you that the following legal requirements 
have been met, one, two, three, four.  To give you comfort 
that you can sign that.   
 
I am saying that would be my expectation of what the 
government departments should do.  And that is what I would 
have expected so that you feel covered that you are not 
going to be in a situation where you have authorised 
something only to find that there was no compliance with the 
relevant prescripts.   
20 
 
But it may be that there is not the only way in which 
things can be done and maybe that there are other ways but 
that would have been my expectation. 
PROF MOKGORO:   The expectation is correct.  And it is 
such a pity that there is no record here because I did have 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 116 of 310 
 
an engagement with the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Not because I had any authority in 
terms 
of 
the 
money 
that 
had 
been 
allocated 
to 
his 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Although, sitting in the Office of the 
Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Because again, he is the accounting 
10 
officer.  He would have provided the necessary evidence to 
the MEC that they have gone through due process.  And the 
MEC also, one would expect that would have assured himself 
that there was process before addressing Exco on these 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   And the expectation that I should have 
declared this thing with the authority meeting.  Yes, I would 
advise but certainly not refuse to have the processing of 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Professor Mokgoro, you were the 
Accounting Officer in the Office of the Premier, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  These funds came from funds placed 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 117 of 310 
 
with the Office of the Premier, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ring fenced in the Office of the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And the PFMA, we went through 
previously, requires you in that role to ensure that there is 
no unauthorised irregular expenditure, correct? 
PROF 
MOKGORO: 
 
 
Yes, 
every 
accounting 
officer 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  Because ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   ...has to do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   If you are talking about an accounting 
officer 
of 
a 
different 
department 
to 
the 
one 
whose 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, but Professor Mokgoro, we keep going 
back there.  So that is why it is important.  This was not 
coming out of the budget of Committee Safety and Transport 
Development.  It was coming out of ring fenced funds in the 
Office of the Premier for which you were the only accounting 
officer, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   It was money earmarked for the 
20 
Department of Transport Management, not for the Office of 
the Premier. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it was ring fenced funds placed in the 
Office of the Premier for the MRRP Project.  That is your 
evidence ...[intervenes]  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 118 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, for coordination purposes, it 
makes sense to say funds are going to be pulled so that this 
government ensures that the priority that has been decided 
upon are actually carried out.  But transaction, procurement 
and transactions are the responsibilities of accounting 
officers in those departments. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why then, Professor Mokgoro is it your 
signature at page 97 and not the signature of the HOD in the 
Department 
of 
Committee 
Safety 
and 
Transport 
Development?  If you go to page 97, that is the page from 
10 
the Republic of the North West...  
 
Sorry, 
the 
Republic 
of 
South 
Africa, 
North 
West 
authorising R 50 million be paid to South African Express 
Airways.  I take it that is your signature at the bottom of the 
page.  Is that correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, after all the decisions that have 
been taken, my responsibility was to communicate that and 
this is what this document reflects. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is this your signature? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I say exactly that.  It is my signature. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You know... I am sorry.  You know this 
question of who was the accounting officer for these funds, it 
is quite interesting because I suspect that if the HOD of that 
department came here... I do not think he or she has come 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 119 of 310 
 
here? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’n-‘n. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I cannot remember everybody 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   [laughing]  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the past two and a half years.  I have 
a suspicion he or she would say:  I was the accounting 
officer for funds that were within my control.  These funds 
were not within my control.   
 
They were in the control of the Office of the Premier.  
10 
Therefore, it is the acting DG who was the accounting officer 
for those funds.   
 
How can I be accounting officer of funds that are not in 
my department?  I suspect that that is what they will say.  
What do you say to that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I would ask him as to why did he give 
the responsibility to go on a process of procurement?  
Because that is normally the responsibility of an accounting 
officer of a department.  And that is normally that I keep on 
referring to.   
20 
 
It is a difficulty that would arise where in terms of the 
PFMA 
which 
talks 
about 
vertical 
accountability. 
 
You 
suddenly 
find 
yourself 
having 
to 
coordinate 
all 
the 
departments because this policy requires but especially by 
all the departments.  And I think that is really the source of 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 120 of 310 
 
the difficulty.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course in our discussion earlier, I 
think before lunch... before tea-break, part of what I could 
not understand and I understood you not being able to 
explain it properly.  And if I misunderstood you, tell me.   
 
Part of what I did not understand is, why were these 
funds removed from those departments if they would, after 
being removed and placed with the Office of the Premier.   
 
One, they would still be used for the projects of those 
10 
departments.  Why were they not allowed to remain within 
those departments?   
 
Because, otherwise, they were going to be used for 
those 
departments. 
 
Why 
were 
they 
moved? 
 
Did 
I 
understand your reaction to that issue correctly? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, I think the question related to this 
one should be raised.  Why did some departments contribute 
and never got anything in terms of projects?  And I gave... 
this is normally... I have been trying to explain how a joint of 
government body would operate.   
20 
 
Some departments would contribute but not get anything 
in terms of projects relevant to their departments because 
maybe government decided there will only be three priorities.   
 
If I am the Department of Education and there is nothing 
about education, in the interest of the province, I would have 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 121 of 310 
 
to make that contribution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But going back to my question.  Did 
I understand your evidence correctly?  So what I said, there 
is nothing... there is no misunderstanding in terms of what 
your position... what you said earlier? 
PROF MOKGORO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me rephrase it. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe... I was saying, why were these 
funds removed from the departments, you know, of each 
10 
department 
contributing? 
 
Were 
removed 
from 
the 
departments, if they were still going to be used for the 
projects of those departments.   
 
It seems to make sense that if they are going to be used 
for the projects of those departments, that they remain within 
those departments. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Exactly, Chair.  That is exactly the point 
I have just made.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
PROF MOKGORO:   The point that I have just made to 
20 
respond to that questions is, what about those departments 
who would have made contributions that no expenditure will 
take place in their department or related to the mandate of 
their departments?   
 
Simply because, when you look at the list of priorities, 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 122 of 310 
 
nothing about the other department is there but yet they 
have made a contribution.   
 
So if you were to leave departments to keep their 
R 10 million each, those departments that are not part of 
these priorities would not spend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I take it that the normal thing that 
one finds is that each department is allocated a certain 
budget for purposes of its projects for a particular financial 
year.   
 
And they are supposed to spend that money of the 
10 
projects that they undertake.  And that money remains in 
their departments.   
 
But obviously, the MEC’s of the various departments are 
supposed to lay oversight over the HOD’s as to:  Are you 
using... are we spending the money that we are supposed to 
spend and are we spending it for the purposes for which they 
are supposed to spend it?  Are we acting within the ambit of 
the law?  That kind of thing.   
 
And then the premier looks at all MEC’s, all departments 
and say to the MEC’s:  I want to know what is happening in 
20 
your department.   
 
If he or she identifies certain departments that do not 
seem to be spending money that they are supposed to spend 
or they seem to spend money on things that they are not 
supposed to spend the money on, then he would then call 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 123 of 310 
 
the MEC’s, the relevant MEC to account.   
 
Obviously, the MEC would bring the HOD, what is going 
on.  That is how the premier would make sure that every 
department performs and spends money that it is given for, 
on things that they are supposed to spend on.   
 
And when, they do not... if the relevant department is 
failing via the MEC and the MEC can, I guess, fire the DG or 
the premier fires both the MEC and the DG.   
 
And you being premier, now maybe that is the kind of 
things you also look at.  Because you say:  You are given 
10 
this money to spend.   
 
So if you are not spending this money, it means we are 
not going to be helping our people.  So somebody must be 
fired if they are not spending the money. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, taking R 10 million from each 
department was to develop a pool of money that would be 
spend on priorities.  And some of the departments that 
contributed the money, some of them would have projects 
relevant to their mandates, other would not.   
 
And as I tried to explain earlier.  We are relying on the 
20 
PFMA that operates on the basis of vertical or stove piped 
system of accountability.   
 
Virtually, every responsible government in this world are 
striving to find funding modules that would say:  We work 
together.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 124 of 310 
 
 
And I am sure the Commission would agree.  There 
would be a need from time-to-time where the department 
have to go together... come together and address a common 
need or a common priority.   
 
And the question is, now does that get funded when the 
PFMA 
operates 
in 
terms 
of 
a 
vertical 
system 
of 
accountability?   
 
And I think this is how I get trapped into something that I 
have no responsibility for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Mr Hofmeyr, I see I have 
10 
taken some... but I think we must finish with him because 
you have ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I really have only a few more questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have just been reminded that I left the 
question that I should have followed up on Professor 
Mokgoro.  It relates to page 95.  Page 95 contains the 
invoice that came to you with that letter, asking you to 
20 
process the payment. 
 
Now I asked you about the handwriting on that page.  
Can you identify whose handwriting that is? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, I have been grabbling with that 
very question and I have not been able to... I then asked, 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 125 of 310 
 
and that was only recently, for documents which I was 
struggling to get from Mr Phatudi’s department.  And I got a 
document which I still have to through to find out because I 
have been in pursuit of this signature.  I cannot tell whose 
signature it is. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you are curious about that writing and 
the date of it.  This is the only reference that we could find 
to anything about Treasury approval.  You see, it says... I do 
not even know if that t-e-i.  I do not know who it is addressed 
to but it says: 
10 
“Please process this payment for R 50 million, the 
payment agreed to with Treasury and at Exco.” 
 
Right? 
PROF MOKGORO:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You say that you relied on that 
handwriting to authorise R 50 million because you will see 
the tax invoices is not for R 50 million.  It is for a different 
amount.  It is an amount of R 53 143 564,00.  Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Again, my understanding of the word 
process, suppose that a decision had been taken earlier. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   And I was privy to that decision.  So it 
was not like this thing sprung from nowhere and I was asked 
to process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But is it usual to get invoices and then 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 126 of 310 
 
just see handwritten notes about paying less than the invoice 
and then authorising those payments? 
PROF MOKGORO:   If there is no history or background to 
this, it is not reasonable. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  And why R 50 million?  Why not the 
R 53 million?  Because the next month you had to pay 
another R 60 million.  Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I have no recollection why the fifty. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
PROF MOKGORO:   I do not ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you make any enquiries at the 
time? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I could have made that enquiry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  You see, the other strange thing 
about the invoice and I just ask... put it to you so that you 
can assist us.  The letter that was addressed to you on the 
previous page, page 94, is a letter that was signed by the 
head of the department on the 16t h of March 2015.  Do you 
see that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I do Chair.  Yes. 
20 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
See, 
the 
invoice 
is 
dated 
the 
24t h of March.  You cannot see that easily on the copy you 
have got but we did get a better copy from your office 
yesterday.  So I can assure you, Professor Mokgoro it is in 
the top left-hand corner.  It says March 24, 2015.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 127 of 310 
 
 
How could you have been provided with an invoice dated 
the 24t h of March on the 16t h of March when you got the 
request for payment?  Can you ...[intervenes]  
PROF MOKGORO:   It does not add up. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It does not add up, does it? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  So you got asked to process payment 
on the 16t h.  For some reason, an invoice dated the 24t h then 
appears with handwriting that we cannot identify that asked 
you to pay R 50 million and you ultimately authorised the 
10 
R 50 million.  Correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I did not authorise it.  I processed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when you said on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  I am sorry.  You say you did not 
authorise it, you processed it.  Is that the payment? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair because the decision had 
already been taken.  There has been... there had been 
discussions, presentations that preceded this.   
 
So it was only after Treasury had come into the picture 
20 
to assist the Department of Committee Safety and Transport 
Management that it was arrived at that R 50 million, who will 
be the one to assist the resuscitation of the air flights.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just trying to understand the fact that 
you say that you did not authorise it, you processed it.  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 128 of 310 
 
Because I thought all along that given that you authorised 
but I may have  misunderstood, was the power to authorise 
payments out of this ring fenced or these ring fenced 
funds?  Did that power not lie with you? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, again, it is a tricky question of 
accounting officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Because the accounting officer is the 
one would normally authorise payments and we are talking 
about a model that is anomaly.  It is a necessary model, I 
10 
want to submit, but it is an anomaly because somehow or 
the other it is not facilitated by the manner in which the 
PFMA exists because it identifies an accounting officer 
who then becomes answerable for all decisions that are 
taken especially expenditure. 
 
Now here you have a situation – and I know that, 
you know, I am sounding like a scratched record, here you 
have a situation and if the commission could apply its mind 
to this, why is a critical element of accounting and of 
expenditure such as procurement, whether it is legitimate 
20 
or not legitimate, why is it placed in the hands of an 
accounting officer in that other department, the department 
that is the implementer of what Exco has decided should 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the documents that government 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 129 of 310 
 
department must retain for purposes maybe of the Auditor-
General’s work would there not be a document that reflects 
who authorised payment?  In other words, if somebody 
says there is R50 million that was paid to SA Express, I 
want to find out who authorised that payment, would there 
not be documents that will reflect that so and so would 
have authorised, generally speaking? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Generally speaking, yes, there should 
be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   There should be evidence of who 
authorised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF MOKGORO:   And, if I may, Chair, perhaps the 
Auditor-General is one institution that could advise us as 
to once you go the route of joint government, how do you 
deal with the question of accountability? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in regard to this particular payment, 
is it fair to expect that somewhere there ought to be a 
document that reflects who authorised the payment? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   I can only say that the one who 
authorises payment is the one who is accountable for 
expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am saying is, it is fair to 
expect that at some stage or another, even if that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 130 of 310 
 
document is not there now, at some stage or another there 
ought to have existed a document that would reflect who 
authorised the payment. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I submit that there are legal 
questions that we are grappling with at the moment and in 
due course we will submit to you that the PFMA makes it 
perfectly clear who the head of department is and what the 
responsibilities of that head of department as accounting 
10 
officer is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In just foreshadowing we will also make 
reference to page 97 because that is the page on which 
Prof Mokgoro has confirmed his signature appears and that 
is the page on which the claim is certified as being correct 
and the payment then was made through the bank account. 
 
Chair, I would like to then just deal with one last 
aspect.  Prof Mokgoro said that there was a decision of 
Exco that he was relying on, is that correct, Prof Mokgoro? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would like to remind you that that 
decision, albeit it that those minutes are curious in a 
number of respects, does say that the contract must be 
signed, does it not?  Do you recall that? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 131 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I recall that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  You authorised this payment 
before the contract was signed though, did you not? 
PROF MOKGORO:   It is possible, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, your sworn statement confirms that 
you authorised the payment without a signed contract.  So 
you were not even implementing Exco’s decision, were 
you? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ja, I recall vaguely and I think we 
need just to check on that one.  I recall that there was a 
10 
question of launching that was given a consideration 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry, could you repeat that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   There were some timelines that 
informed the instruction to proceed with payment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, no, the timeline is as follows.  You 
received that letter plus the invoice for 53 million on which 
in handwriting it said you must process the payment for 50 
million and you were given an unsigned contract.  The only 
decision of Exco on which we can rely is the decision that 
20 
says you can proceed to sign the contract.   
 
So the chronology is, you authorised the payment 
before you had any signed contract, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   That SLA was not signed, it is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think the point – well, maybe not 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 132 of 310 
 
Ms Hofmeyr’s point, maybe it is her point, is that is the 
position not that authorising payment in relation to a 
transaction where there is supposed to be a signed 
agreement 
authorising 
payment 
without 
a 
signed 
agreement in circumstances where there is supposed to be 
a signed agreement would be irregular.  Would it not be 
irregular. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Chair, I think what we would probably 
need to check because I think that must have been a 
consideration at the time where you have transaction 
10 
between government and government.  That might have 
been a factor that weighed in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ordinarily it …[intervenes] 
PROF MOKGORO:   Ordinarily it should. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But, Prof Mokgoro, you were the one 
who was making the decisions, so did you take that into 
account?  Did you say it is okay to authorise this payment 
because it is government to government? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I am saying that because it is 
20 
government to government and because there had been 
these discussions that had taken place and unfortunately 
when this service provider was engaged with in meetings 
that I did not attend, the totality of the issues at hand was 
such that because of the pressure, rightly or wrongly, we 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 133 of 310 
 
proceed with this project and I signed the – I gave the 
instruction to process [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where was the pressure from? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, the airline had to start operating 
-   I would have to check the records - on a particular date 
and I think that must have been one [indistinct – dropping 
voice] that this thing had to be processed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, that would only have come in the 
agreement that had not been signed yet, would it not? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  In conclusion, Chair, if I 
may just put one or two to Prof Mokgoro.  We started your 
evidence today with the Premier ’s inauguration speech in 
June of 2014.  You will remember that that committed the 
province to a whole lot of initiatives over the year.  Do you 
recall that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   I recall that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then we move to the MRRRP project 
which itself had a number of initiatives identified for the 
rejuvenation of Mafikeng.  You recall that? 
20 
PROF MOKGORO:   I recall that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would just like to emphasise and 
highlight one or two of them.  There was going to be 
increased security provided in Mafikeng was there not? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 134 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was going to be water and 
sanitation infrastructure that was going to be improved, 
correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was going to be decaying 
electrification infrastructure fixed, correct? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And for all of those initiatives there was 
132 million ring fenced in the office of the Premier, is that 
correct? 
10 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What – I would like your comment on 
this, Prof Mokgoro, because what concerns me about what 
transpired is that 50 million was taken out of that ring 
fenced amount which going to facilitate things like security, 
enhanced sewerage systems, better electrification, water 
and sanitation in the province and it was put towards a 
subsidy to a government entity so that flights could come.  
Are you concerned about that? 
PROF MOKGORO:   Well, certainly I am concerned about a 
20 
long shopping list of priorities and in the end when the 
implementation takes place that that shopping list is not 
implemented and the question of privatization happens to 
be those who have been elected and when they take 
decisions about privatization, the implementers have a role 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 135 of 310 
 
to advise but ultimately they implement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, those are our 
questions.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Premier, at page 97 before your 
signature there is writing there.  You know, some – they 
way they made this copy I think some words are missing 
but I see the second line that says: 
“That the above claim is correct and that payment 
has not previously been made.” 
I suspect that it must be meaning that what is missing is 
10 
something like I certify. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think so, Chair, because the last line in 
the Afrikaans I think has gesertifiseer cut off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I also intimated that it must say 
certified, that is the above claim, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Do you – well, you would 
know this.  Is that what it is supposed to mean?  You must 
have signed quite a number of documents like this before. 
PROF MOKGORO:   What page are we on, Chair/ 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   97. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  At the bottom of the page there is 
some writing there that appears above the date.  Can you 
see that? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 136 of 310 
 
PROF MOKGORO:   Above the date? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Above the date, yes.  Can you see there 
is – I think it is three – it is one sentence translated into 
three languages. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Yes, I can see that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF MOKGORO:   That: 
“The above claim is correct and that payment has 
not previously been made.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am saying it looks like there are 
10 
some words that have been cut off but I suspect that with 
regard to the English sentence there that probably what 
has been cut off probably says I certify, so that it would 
read: 
“I certify that the above claim is correct and that 
payment has not previously been made.” 
You would now maybe how these documents used to read 
at the time you were Acting DG? 
PROF MOKGORO:   No, I would not have a recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but would you think along the same 
20 
lines as me that …[intervenes] 
PROF MOKGORO:   Probably yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And if that is so, it seems to 
me and I want you to comment on this, that this document 
contemplates that you need to make sure that you are not 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 137 of 310 
 
making a second payment in regard to – you are not paying 
– double paying, so to speak, you are not making a 
payment that has already been made before. 
PROF MOKGORO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then where it says you certify 
that the above claim is correct, I wonder whether one 
should not understand that to mean you are certifying that 
making this payment will be correct, it is proper, it is legal, 
that kind of thing.  Would that be your understanding as 
well or would you have a different understanding of what 
10 
this might mean? 
PROF MOKGORO:   My understanding is that a critical 
department had been drawn into the process or facilitating 
– they are making this amount available and that was 
Provincial Treasury apart from the department.  So with the 
involvement of Provincial Treasury I would have no reason 
at the time to doubt even their constitutional role. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I assume that there is no 
intention to re-examine the Premier? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we have just been exchanging 
20 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MOKOTE:  Yes, we have been [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Notes on the point so if I can hand over 
to my learned friend. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Yes, thank you, Chair, there is indeed a 
need to re-examine.  If I may just illustrate?  For example 
the 
Chairperson 
has 
already 
communicated 
that 
the 
impression concerning two amounts that were testified 
about.  Firstly, of the R110 million payment and compared 
to the 4 and a couple hundred thousand that we talked 
about.  When I read it I would also like to get clarify from – 
and for purpose of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MOKOTE:  Because the impression is that we could 
be talking about one and the same thing when the other is 
talking about a fund and the other is talking about an 
annual fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKOTE:  So if we leave it as this, it will create an 
impression that we are talking about apples when one 
could be a pear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You – are you saying you would like to 
re-examine, that you have one or two questions? 
20 
ADV MOKOTE:  We would definitely like to re-examine, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be something as short as that, 
one or two questions, or is it much more involved? 
ADV MOKOTE:  It is a bit more involved. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 139 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, how much time? 
ADV MOKOTE:  I have a number of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how much time do you think you 
would require?  I am trying to see – we were trying to make 
sure that we can release the Premier when we go for lunch 
so that he does not have to come back and you do not 
have to come back. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When we go to the next witness. 
ADV MOKOTE:  When we go to the next witness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but it might depend how long you are 
going to be whether I allow you to start re-examining 
before we go on lunch or we go and lunch and come back. 
ADV MOKOTE:  I will say, Chair, it is substantially long(?) 
part of the critical information that needs to be done and I 
must take the blame that I – not to be able to find the 
document.  There was a question earlier on about the 
request for proposal, whether there was a process like that 
and I can remember vaguely seeing  a document of that 
nature and it might be important that we get it – if we get it 
20 
then we bring to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKOTE:  So I do believe that a lot of – it is not 
going to be just a quick clarification process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 140 of 310 
 
ADV MOKOTE:  If an arrangement has to be made for that 
purpose, I will be in the Chair’s hands but definitely it is 
not a question of just running through the mill with this 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the re-examination in terms of the 
regulations must be for clarificatory purposes. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in the Commission. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, strictly speaking, I would not allow 
10 
questions that are not aimed at clarification. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would only allow those that are aimed 
at clarification. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there is the question of whether you 
are suggesting that we release the Premier and another 
day be arranged for you to re-examine or whether you are 
saying well, maybe let us adjourn and you would like to re-
examine him after the adjournment?  What would you like 
20 
to see happen? 
ADV MOKOTE:  Could I perhaps before I answer that also 
have a minute to just confer with the Premier insofar as his 
time availability? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to walk across and whisper 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 141 of 310 
 
to him while I am here or did you want to have – we will 
not hear, I think, what you will say.  If you able to whisper. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Let me just do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just go approach him and whisper 
and whisper and then let me know. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Prof Mokgoro, can I suggest you turn off 
your microphone, just for the purposes?  Thank you. 
ADV 
MOKOTE: 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
We 
have 
just 
10 
discussed.  I think I want to put my head on the block and 
say that my re-examination will not take 30 minutes and we 
can do that – perhaps let us do it after – let us take a 
break and do it after the break so that I can just connect 
them quickly and eliminate having to go into unnecessary 
stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr, what do you say? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can I just seek a point of clarification 
from my learned friend?  There seemed to be suggestion 
that there is a new document that we have not seen. 
20 
ADV MOKOTE:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   A request for proposal.  If that is so we 
would need to see it. We certainly cannot proceed to re-
examination in a situation where we have not seen the 
document and Prof Mokgoro has not been questioned on it.  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 142 of 310 
 
Is there indeed a document that we should see? 
ADV MOKOTE:  Prof Mokgoro has fortunately in his bundle 
has a copy of the request for proposal dated 5 August 
2014.  I know it well.   That may just be one thing.  What 
we will do with that document because it – we will send it 
to the evidence leaders, we do not need to clarify about it.  
I 
will 
clarify 
about 
other 
things 
that 
I 
think 
need 
clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MOKOTE:  Ja and this document, the evidence 
10 
leaders can consider at own time and if needs be and word 
is needed from Professor, that can be arranged.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think then we must take the 
lunch adjournment.  It is twenty nine minutes to two.  We 
come back at half past two and then there will be re-
examination and then after that we will then have the next 
witness. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, we may request an 
opportunity  just to consider the document over the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because it may be that we can deal with 
it then.  If is unfortunate that it is being presented only 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But we can do what we can to make the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 143 of 310 
 
process efficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright, we are going to adjourn 
then for lunch, we will resume at half past two.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Chair we have taken 
the lunch adjournment in the expectation that we would be 
returning for Professor Mokgoro to be re-examined, but 
10 
before the lunch break I had requested an opportunity to 
consider some of the documents which my learned friend 
had indicated they had received recently and which may be 
pertinent to the matters involving Professor Mokgoro.  I did 
take an opportunity to look through some of the documents 
over the lunch break.   
I understand there to be two separate sets of 
documents.   There’s a bundle that Professor Mokgoro 
asked his office to put together for him, that was the 
bundle that I had seen some documents in, and then 
20 
there’s another set of documents which have also been 
obtained.   
The documents that I did see and discuss with the 
investigators are documents that certainly require further 
investigation, they are documents which the Commission 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 144 of 310 
 
has 
specifically 
requested 
over 
the 
period 
of 
this 
investigation and we were led to understand did not exist.  
What I have seen suggest that those documents have been 
found and do exist and in my submission it would not 
appropriate to proceed to the re-examination in a situation 
where there might be material documents that we haven’t 
yet had an opportunity to consider, and place within the full 
matrix of the evidence related to Professor Mokgoro’s 
testimony. 
I have discussed the matter with my learned friend, 
10 
I understand him to be essentially in agreement but what 
we propose be done is that we adjourn now, insofar as 
Professor Mokgoro’s evidence is concerned.  He be 
released 
so 
that 
we 
can 
obtain 
the 
documents, 
I 
understand they will be sent through to us by Professor 
Mokgoro’s attorney in due course.  They only have one 
copy here today.  We can then consider them and then 
certainly engage with our learned friends about what we 
make of the documents and what the further process 
should be. 
20 
I can hand over to my learned friend if there is 
anything he wants to add, if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKOTE:   Thank you Chairperson, just to indicate 
that we are in agreement with the process proposed. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 145 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKOTE:   Also, because we haven’t also had an 
opportunity to have a view of the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKOTE:   So it is only fair that we all get an 
opportunity to reflect on them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay, no that is fine.   I don’t 
have a problem that we do that therefore we will postpone 
the re-examination of Professor Mokgoro to a date still to 
be fixed, particularly because his re-examination won’t 
10 
take long and even if Ms Hofmeyr after having studied the 
documents might wish to put some questions to Professor 
Mokgoro before re-examination happens, I don’t think that 
evidence will take long.  I think we may – we must all be 
ready that we might have to – Professor Mokgoro might 
have to come back for an evening session.  We do hold 
evening sessions sometimes so during the day there will be 
witnesses who give evidence and other witnesses might 
come at four o’clock or five o’clock, we hear that evidence 
depending how long it is going to be, it might be up to 
20 
seven, it might be up to eight and so on. 
 
So we might have to do that because a number of – 
most of the days are kind of filled up for the rest of the 
year so we might have to do that, but if an opening 
happens on one of the days then we can look at that as 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 146 of 310 
 
well. 
 
So therefore, Professor Mokgoro we are going to 
adjourn – postpone the hearing of your re-examination and 
another date will be arranged and time and your lawyer will 
let you know.  Is that alright? 
PROF MAKGORO:  That is okay, thank you very much 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, you are therefore excused 
for today. 
PROF MOKGORO:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair we next have the evidence of Ms 
Memela, we do need to move things around a bit to ensure 
she has the right files, could we take a brief adjournment 
to facilitate that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we ready?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I would like to just begin with 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 147 of 310 
 
orientating ourselves in relation to Ms Memela’s evidence, 
because the Commission last received evidence from Ms 
Memela in February of this year and in the course of that 
evidence you had granted her leave to be re-examined, and 
that was confined to a period of two hours, there was an 
opportunity afforded to Ms Memela to make application for 
a 
longer 
period 
if 
required 
and 
she 
declined 
that 
opportunity.  Now since those events in February the 
Commission has received the evidence of Mr Ndzeko, and 
Mr Ndzeko’s evidence took place last month, on the 26 t h of 
10 
August and that evidence implicated Ms Memela in various 
matters, which I will come to in a moment, it also 
implicated her legal representative who appears today to 
represent her, Ms Mbanjwa, who was also her legal 
representative on the last occasion that Ms Memela 
appeared.  So, after Mr Ndzeko’s evidence the legal team 
and investigators, through the Secretariat wrote, both to 
Ms Memela and Ms Mbanjwa and indicated to them that Mr 
Ndzeko’s evidence had implicated them and invited them to 
provide affidavits to the Commission in order to respond to 
20 
Mr Ndzeko’s evidence.  There were responses received, 
both from Ms Mbanjwa and Ms Memela.  Ms Mbanjwa’s 
response came in on the 9 t h of September and her attitude 
was that Mr Ndzeko had not implicated her in his evidence.  
She had concluded that the request for an affidavit from 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 148 of 310 
 
her was based, either on a misunderstanding on Mr 
Ndzeko’s testimony or on other ulterior motives and so she 
declined to furnish an affidavit to the Commission.  Ms 
Memela’s response was, initially to ask for a series of the 
documents that had been referred to in the course of Mr 
Ndzeko’s evidence and those documents were provided to 
her on the 14 t h of September, they comprised the following. 
 
There were the two affidavits from the members of 
the Police Force at Mount Frere, they were the hand-
writing expert’s affidavit and report.  There was the 
10 
affidavit of Chief Sigcau and there was Mr Ndzeko’s 
affidavit and Mr Aires affidavit. There was also a request 
for an affidavit from Mr Phiri.  Now I must just remind 
everyone who Mr Phiri was.  Mr Phiri was the acting CEO 
at the time that both the GPU sale occurred and the award 
of the tender to AAR and JM Aviation.  There was a 
reference in February, during Ms Memela’s evidence and I 
think subsequent to that for a version from Mr Phiri to be 
obtained on matters and Ms Memela was told, through her 
attorney, Ms Mbanjwa at the time that the Commission had 
20 
engaged with Mr Phiri and that it was in the process of 
obtaining an affidavit from him.  So when those first set of 
documents were provided to Ms Memela on the 14 t h the 
response 
and 
request 
for 
Mr 
Phiri’s 
affidavit 
was 
responded to on the basis that, as soon as the Commission 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 149 of 310 
 
received it, it would provide it to Ms Memela and that took 
place on the 17 t h of September.  There was a link provided 
– there might have been a little bit of a delay in her being 
able to access the link, but my understanding is that that’s 
also been received by Ms Memela. 
 
There was no affidavit forthcoming from Ms Memela, 
despite the invitation for her to address the matters raised 
in Mr Ndzeko’s evidence and as a consequence of that, on 
the 23 r d of September, we wrote again to Ms Mbanjwa and 
notified her that, because there had been no affidavit 
10 
forthcoming and because of the evidence of Mr Ndzeko and 
its implications for Ms Memela, the legal team would make 
a request today to be given the opportunity to question Ms 
Memela about those aspects before the commencement of 
her re-examination and she was advised that she should 
come prepared to be able to answer those questions.  
There was correspondence then received yesterday from 
Ms Mbanjwa on behalf of Ms Memela to say that they 
intended to object to that request.  So, what I’d like to do, 
with your leave Chair, is just explain why we make the 
20 
request and motivate for it and then if the objection is still 
persisted with, then to hand over to my learned friend Ms 
Mbanjwa to make any submissions she wishes to make, 
thank you Chair. 
 
Chair, we request an opportunity to question Ms 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 150 of 310 
 
Memela in relation to Mr Ndzeko’s evidence because what 
he covered in his evidence is pertinent to the issues that 
Ms Memela testified about previously and I’d like to just 
identify the nub of the issue. Ms Memela’s evidence 
previously, in February, before this Commission was that 
the payment of R2.5million that came from JM Aviation and 
that was used to purchase her Bedfordview property, was 
not untoward in any way, it was not a corrupt payment and 
the reason for that is because it was actually money that 
was owed to her mother pursuant to a sale agreement that 
10 
Mr Ndzeko had entered into with her mother and which her 
mother had then simply decided to donate to Ms Memela 
for the purposes of her property acquisition.  That was the 
case, explaining on the part of Ms Memela the receipt of 
the R2.5million. 
 
The evidence that has been received from Mr 
Ndzeko is evidence in which he conceded in the end that, 
that sale agreement was a fraud, that it was not entered 
into in 2015, that it was entered into or signed at least by 
him in 2019 and if that is so, Ms Memela’s entire 
20 
explanation for the receipt of that R2.5million is called into 
question.  I submit there can be no doubt that, that 
implicates Ms Memela in very serious matters and it is 
important for this Commission to be able to question her, if 
for no other reason than to give Ms Memela an opportunity 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 151 of 310 
 
to explain her side of the story in relation to the 
concession made by Mr Ndzeko.  Chair it’s the work of the 
Commission 
to 
investigate 
matters, 
this 
is 
not 
an 
adversarial proceeding, it’s a proceeding that often has 
fluidity in it, witnesses get called back often, as matters 
develop, 
the 
get 
questioned 
by 
more 
than 
one 
representative 
of 
the 
legal 
team 
because 
they 
are 
implicated or have relevant evidence to give in different 
areas and so it’s in accordance with its investigative 
function, coupled with, I submit, the importance of fairness 
10 
to witness against who implications are made to be 
afforded an opportunity to give their account of events and 
so it’s against that backdrop that we submit it would be 
appropriate to question Ms Memela on the matters arising 
from Mr Ndzeko’s evidence.  I submit that she was given 
forewarning of the fact that the request would be made 
today, she’s been provided with all the documents that she 
requested and so there could be no prejudice to her with 
the matter proceeding on that basis today and those are 
the grounds on which we submit it would be appropriate for 
20 
the request to question her to be granted.  If I may then 
hand over to my learned friend if there’s an issue to be 
taken with that request. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Mbanjwa do you – you oppose 
the request? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 152 of 310 
 
MS MBANJWA:   I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Stand closer to your mic. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, I do not know when I’m sitting, 
maybe just for procedural reasons, when I’m sitting here 
I’m raising my hand to raise an objection, I think I’m 
not…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t raise your hand, you’ll be given a 
chance to speak at some stage, don’t raise the hand. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, I thought I was invisible to the Chair, 
so basically, first thing which I want to do is just 
10 
housekeeping, I just want to exchange…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, where you are standing, it may 
be that what you are saying is not captured by the 
recording property, because it think you’re standing far 
away from the mic.  If there is difficulty – are you able to 
speak close to the mic while standing? 
MS MEMELA:   I’m not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I’ll allow you to sit down, I’ll allow 
you to sit down and address me seated, if that’s going to 
make things easier. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Thank you Chair, but first can I walk over 
to Ms Memela I just want to exchange the Bundle, I want 
the Bundle, she took the Bundle I was preparing on? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, she took your Bundle, okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair you will guide me if I am not very 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 153 of 310 
 
audible? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Firstly, this request by…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, is the first thing that the objection 
stands, continues? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, we are objecting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright, yes give me your 
submissions, reasons. 
MS MEMELA:   First Chair, we did write a letter to the 
Commission and we said in the letter to the Commission, 
10 
we are prepared to meet the Commission halfway.  If the 
Commission has certain witnesses that is, Ms Hofmeyr, 
which she wants to address to us we will answer those 
questions.  She can give them to us in writing and then we 
will also answer them in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why must that be the case? 
MS MEMELA:   No, the reason why that must happen is 
because we are of the honest view that it is going to help 
us if we go first and the reason why we are saying we 
should 
go 
first 
is 
because 
our 
understanding 
– 
I 
20 
understand what Ms Hofmeyr says about the fluidity of 
the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, is the position that your objection is 
not to the request as such but it’s to the sequence as to 
who – what should happen first? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 154 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, mainly it is – it is multi-pronged Chair.  
I was starting with the first one because remember one 
must start the being conciliatory in proceedings like these 
because we have a duty to cooperate.  So, we said, we 
want to go first and the reason why we want to go first is 
because we are of the view that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay no, I just want to make sure I 
follow.  Are you saying, you are not – you have no 
objection to me granting the request put forward by Ms 
Hofmeyr, but you would like to request that, if that request 
10 
is granted, she should question Ms Memela after you have 
finished re-examination, is that your position? 
MS MEMELA:   Let me rephrase, I see my client nodding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you client is nodding, I can see. 
MS MEMELA:   But it’s a two-pronged …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She’s giving you instructions. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes she’s giving me – yes thank you, that’s 
why I’m pointing it out Chair, I must follow her instructions 
but there is also something which may be – before I come 
to the next one, let me just start first on a one which is a 
20 
legal issue and the legal issue is, when we received this 
request it took us by surprise.  Ms Hofmeyr has made an 
address here and he reason it took us by surprise is the 
fact that we couldn’t see any basis and the reason why we 
are saying that there is no basis is because after Mr 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 155 of 310 
 
Ndzeko had given evidence…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, if I may just interject, I do 
apologise Ms Mbanjwa, I’ve just been told that the sound 
quality is particularly bad and so transcription of what Ms 
Mbanjwa is saying is not going to be ideal.  I wonder if I 
should not leave the podium, we’ll sterilise so that it’s safe 
for you to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s do that ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you can complete your 
submissions here Ms Mbanjwa. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may just mention to you, Ms Mbanjwa, 
so that you know exactly what’s in my mind.  I can mention 
to you that after I’d heard Mr Ndzeko’s evidence without 
the legal team making any request I said to myself, well it 
will be important to hear what Ms Memela has to say about 
some of the evidence that emerged during Mr Ndzeko’s 
evidence.  So with or without the legal team making the 
request, I was going to want to hear Ms Memela’s side of 
the story on some of those things. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Thank you Chair, for advising of your view 
already but I was still on the point of saying, this request 
caught us by surprise and the reason is simple, it’s 
because of what Ms Hofmeyr has said, it is said that these 
proceedings 
are 
inquisitorial. 
 
When 
a 
request 
was 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 156 of 310 
 
forwarded to us to say Mrs Memela must submit an 
affidavit, we took the view, having listened to the audio of 
Mr Ndzeko that she had not been implicated.  I won’t go 
into the reasons now, I will go into them when the time for 
re-exam comes but then after that, we received a letter 
from Ms Bridgett Tshabalala which I believe was shared 
with Ms Hofmeyr, I will just read page 8, I’m sorry 
paragraph 8, I do have the Bundle if there’s any dispute 
about this because it is a letter that was sent on the 21 s t of 
September or dated 21 s t of September and paragraph 8 
10 
provides as follows, 
“In the event of her failure to provide a version, Mr 
Ndzeko’s evidence about her involvement will be 
undisputed”. 
 
Now, if we accept that these are inquisitorial 
proceedings and if we accept that we run the risk and that 
is the risk of saying that, if we do not file an affidavit 
explaining Mr Ndzeko’s evidence, as they stated here, they 
said that here involvement will be undisputed.  Our 
understanding now is this – and it comes from purely a 
20 
question of procedure and again before I go to the 
question of procedure it goes to what Ms Hofmeyr said to 
us when we had an interview with her.  She said, I as Ms 
Hofmeyr, I am a lawyer for the public, I’m not your lawyer, 
Mrs Memela or I’m not your lawyer, whoever comes as a

witness before the Zondo Commission being an accused.  
So, which means, therefore that, these people come 
represented by people like us, their legal advisors so why 
now I am supportive of Mrs Hofmeyr when she says now, to 
examine Mrs Memela in order to protect or to assist Mrs 
Memela, we are saying, no, we know for a fact because 
she is on record as saying that she is not going to assist 
any Mrs Memela because she is a lawyer for the public. 
So, we are raising that because it is going to be important 
when we do the re-examination when we are going to 
10 
discuss evidence and documents which we are going to 
submit 
here 
which 
we 
know 
are 
already 
with 
the 
Commission and have not been put forward in the public 
hearings at least.  Now, we are now coming to the 
inquisitorial nature of these proceedings.  We are saying, if 
Mrs Hofmeyr has already made a conclusion – because she 
did make that conclusion when the evidence of Mr Ndzeko 
was led because she said that Mr Memela assisted Mr 
Ndzeko by selling the GPU’s to her daughter and then she 
again made a conclusion, she said that – she said that 
20 
there was a date of 2019 it means that it’s fraud.  So she 
has made this conclusions and now I’m saying, now that 
she has made these conclusions which obvious are going 
to fit into the report that is going to be made by the 
Commission to the SIU’s that is the Special Investigation 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 158 of 310 
 
Unit, what is the purpose now to be gained by now again 
examining Ms Memela and then, now coming, Chair, again, 
if this was an ordinary Court of Law, I know it is not, I 
know that the Commission – you as the Chair of the 
Commission has a discretion on what to allow but again – 
because at the end of the day we’re talking here time and 
for us, especially for me, time is money. Now we’ve got a 
question we ask, what is it that is going to be said by Ms 
Hofmeyr asking Mrs Memela these questions and we’re 
asking that question…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbanjwa a lot will be said by me 
getting certain clarification from Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Your Worship just to put this 
thing…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will help me a lot to hear ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Thank you, Your Worship, you having said 
that and I respecting you as the Chair of this Commission, 
I still need to put it on record and the reason why I’m 
putting it on record is because at the end of the day when 
the Commission is done and dusted a certain kind of juris 
20 
prudence will have to come from the hearings of this 
Commission which is why I’m now putting on record and 
saying that, generally in a Court of Law if a person wants 
to re-open – because that is basically what we are doing 
we are re-opening.  I know that she said because of the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 159 of 310 
 
fluidity but still there must be a basis. Now, if these things 
are going to be forwarded…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the basis is that when Ms Memela 
gave evidence previously in February, Mr Ndzeko had not 
given evidence and subsequently Mr Ndzeko gave evidence 
which raised certain issues that relate to the issue of the 
sale of land and Ms Memela had explained the payment of 
the R2.5million on the basis that there was a genuine sale 
of land. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, but Your Worship, the point is, these 
10 
issues were traversed already…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MEMELA:   These issues were traversed already with 
Ms Memela…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were not traversed in the light of 
Mr Ndzeko’s evidence. 
MS MEMELA:   But Your Worship – but Chair, it is not 
going to be the Commission that is going to make a finding 
of guilt. If this was a criminal Court there would be 
relevance because then procedurally this testimony  would 
20 
be flawed because what would be said, it would be said to 
Ms Hofmeyr, Ms Hofmeyr you did not put the version of Mr 
Ndzeko to Mrs Memela.  In this case, that difficulty does 
not arise and why I’m saying that Your Worship is that we 
would love to move to more important things because we 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 160 of 310 
 
need the time to re-examine that is that and then now 
coming now to the other issue, because you have already 
advised me, Your Worship, that you are also of the 
inclination to want questions from Mrs Memela.  If you 
should choose to do that then, Mr Chair, we want now to 
plead as follows.  We have all seen, we’ve been here with 
Ms Hofmeyr that is the problem with time.  If Ms Hofmeyr is 
allowed to go in first, what is going to happen is that these 
questions are going to be long and our two hours are going 
to 
be 
exhausted 
we 
are 
already 
at 
3 
o’clock, 
my 
10 
understanding is that the Commission finishes at 5.  We 
went to confine ourselves to the two hours and in order to 
do that, we want to go in first so that we limit ourselves to 
our two hours we do what needs to be done and then we 
are done with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the sooner we start, the better. 
MS MEMELA:   As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, so are we beginning now Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we must begin, I will grant the 
20 
request. 
MS MEMELA:   You have granted the request, so who is 
going to start first because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr must start and then re-
examination will come after. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 161 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, as it pleases, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Let’s talk about how 
much you envisage – how much time you think you might 
need to question Ms Memela, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, on the last occasion of Ms 
Memela’s questioning I anticipated a day and it ended up 
taking three and a half so I’m clearly a fairly unreliable 
estimator of time.  What I can say to you is, it’s a very 
focused set of questions, it relates to the evidence of Mr 
Ndzeko, it relates to what Ms Memela has been reported in 
10 
the media as having said about that evidence because we 
have not obtained from her, any version prior to today.  So, 
I just need to begin by getting clarity from her as to what 
her version is in response to Mr Ndzeko and then to probe 
matters around it.  We’re now at 3 o’clock, I imagine being 
able to take an hour or a little bit beyond that but Chair, I 
do know that you also have indicated that you have 
questions so …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I might not have lots of questions 
but let’s see how it goes.  Let’s see whether we are able to 
20 
– you may be able to cover everything within 45 minutes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will give it my best endeavour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there’s a challenge we can look at 
time later on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you so much. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 162 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the oath must be administered 
again because there’s been a lot of time that has lapsed.  
If there is somebody who can give ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have a spare pen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it for the witness or yourself, or for 
your witness? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can I just ask Ms Memela to sterilise it 
and then you can take my pen. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  Please 
administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   My name is Nontsasa Memela. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:    No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscious? 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence that you 
will give will be the truth the whole truth and nothing else 
but the truth, if so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 163 of 310 
 
NONTSASA MEMELA:   (duly sworn, states). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, there’s just one point 
of clarification.  I understood my learned friend, Ms 
Mbanjwa to indicate that there were certain documents she 
wanted to traverse with Ms Memela.  It would certainly be 
necessary for us to see those documents before re-
examination unless they are documents that already form 
part of the Bundle.  So, I just want to mention that as a 
procedural matter.  If Ms Mbanjwa can provide those 
10 
documents to us in due course but we will need to have 
seen 
them 
before 
the 
conclusion 
of 
Ms 
Memela’s 
questioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Memela I indicated 
earlier that there had been some media reporting after Mr 
Ndzeko’s 
evidence 
which 
appeared 
to 
indicate 
your 
response to his evidence.  I’m well aware that the media 
often gets quotations incorrect and persons positions 
incorrect so I’d like to take you to the one article that we 
20 
did come across and you’ll find that in the Bundle that’s 
been placed in front of you DD25C – oh Ms Memela they’re 
just behind you, DD25C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall we change this on the spine from 
Exhibit to Bundle? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 164 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As we did with the other one. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, this file will be Bundle DD25A? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is now C because A and B were 
already entered into the evidence when 
Ms Memela 
testified in February, so we now need…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he’s given me another one. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, this one is with A, so I just wrote 
10 
Bundle instead of…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That’s fine and now we’ll do Bundle 
DD25C which is the new one, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, this will be Bundle DD25C? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you go right to the back of that 
Bundle…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we – should it be 25 without the C on 
the basis that what’s inside may be A, B, C, D? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well what has happened is, we 
originally, in February, had Bundle 25A and B those were 
the bundles that contained the documents relevant to Ms 
Memela’s evidence in February.  Since then we’ve obtained 
the affidavit of Mr Phiri, which was not available in 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 165 of 310 
 
February, which I indicated previously, has been provided.  
So, we placed in Bundle C, Mr Phiri’s affidavit and then 
certain further documents including the one I’m going to 
take Ms Memela to now and so it was just to keep the 
sequence that we identified this file as 25C, with your 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, if we go right to the end it’s page 
1144, it’s about three pages from the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I’ve got it. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and Ms Memela I take you to 
this only because, as I stand here today, I don’t have a 
version from you on Mr Ndzeko’s evidence because the 
opportunity was offered for you to provide an affidavit and 
you declined that. So, the only reference point we have for 
…[intervenes]. 
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry Chair, it is because, unfortunately I 
have to object.  When an application was made to question 
Ms Memela, it was confined.  It was to be on the evidence 
that was given by Mr Ndzeko, surely what the media writes 
20 
cannot form part of Mr Ndzeko ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Mbanjwa, no please let’s make 
progress, continue Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, so this is the version that the 
media reports you as having given to them.  If you turn 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 166 of 310 
 
over the page at 1145 you are quoted as having told Times 
Live the following, it’s in the second paragraph, 
“The inquiries investigation team did not ask the 
correct people about the land.  The asked the 
Cholani family which is where my mother was born 
instead of asking the Manzi family where my 
grandmother was born”, 
 
Can you confirm that you gave that quotation to 
Ties Live? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair you already know my problem. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   I’m unable to directly answer the question 
without giving a background and I’ll give you the reason for 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one of – hang on one second. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One of the reasons why we took as long 
as we did last time was that there was too much 
background.  So, as I understand the question here is, a 
simple one, there is a quotation attributed to you by this 
20 
publication and the question is whether that is what you 
said or not? 
MS MEMELA:   That is what I said when I asked for my 
opportunity to state my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 167 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did say that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then later on in the page middle of the 
way down you responding to the work that was done by the 
handwriting expert and you are quoted as saying middle of 
the way down: 
“My mother had no signature instead she 
would write her initials and surname where 
10 
she was supposed to sign.  For the inquiry 
handwriting expert to compare how she wrote 
her name more than twenty years ago when 
she did an affidavit for me to get an ID 
versus her writing in 2015 can never be 
considered 
as 
a 
reasonable 
comparison.  
Even I do not write the same as I used to 
write twenty years ago.” 
Is that what you said to Times Live? 
MS MEMELA:  That is what I said. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. And then just two more 
paragraphs down you are quoted as having said: 
“The evidence leader is pushing her own 
narrative of making the public believe Mr 
Ndzeku paid me to help him with a tender.  I 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 168 of 310 
 
am still trying to understand which tender I 
gave to Mr Ndzeku.” 
Is that also something you said to the media? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So I would like to take each of 
those matters and probe them a bit further with you if I may 
Ms Memela?  So the first criticism as you relayed it to the 
media of the approaching Mr Ndzeku’s evidence was that the 
investigators of the commission had dealt with the Kholani 
family as opposed to the Monzi family is that correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  You said Kholani Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it pronounced as Kholani? 
MS MEMELA:  Kholani yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I apologise.  Kholani. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair I would expect that because last 
time I was repeatedly corrected when I said Hofmeyr instead 
of Hofmeyr so I would like the balance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  It is Kholani. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Kholani.  Thank you.  So your criticism was 
20 
that the investigators had focussed on the Kholani family and 
not the Monzi family, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now I would like to explain to you with 
reference to the documents why the Kholani family was 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 169 of 310 
 
chosen to focus on and that is because of the affidavit that 
your mother purportedly gave in September of 2015. Are you 
aware of that? 
MS MEMELA:  I am aware of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and are you aware that the affidavit 
says that I inherited the land from my mother – my parents 
Mr and Mrs Kholani? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You are aware of that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Please say yes.  Just because the record 
does not reflect a head nod. 
MS MEMELA:  I said yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So the investigators went to 
investigate the version of your mother if it was her version 
on an affidavit indicating that she had inherited the land from 
her parents the Kholani’s, is that right? 
MS 
MEMELA: 
 
Okay 
are 
you 
asking 
me 
what 
the 
investigators followed? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I am explaining to you that the reason 
20 
why they went to investigate the inheritance via the Kholani 
family is because of what your mother wrote in her alleged 
affidavit.  Do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  I accept on the affidavit but I am not sure if 
the investigators should follow just one suit. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 170 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So one source being the source of your 
mother’s alleged affidavit.  They should not have focussed 
on that? 
MS MEMELA:  No I am not saying they should not but I am 
saying they should not be limited to that Chair.  Because my 
understanding of the investigation is that you look at the 
surrounding circumstances to ensure that you get to the 
bottom of the issues that you are looking for instead of just 
that I mean taking just one document and focussing on it and 
say okay this is what I am going to follow.  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So just be clear with me.  What is the 
criticism of going to investigate the land held by your 
mother’s parents Mr and Mrs Kholani if what she said in her 
affidavit related to the sale is the land is fully owned by me 
and I inherited it from my parents Mr and Mrs Kholani.  Can 
you explain what is then problematic about focussing on 
that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay so I must explain my criticism now? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes please. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Chair you – you – my understanding is 
20 
that she also coming from the villages – her background or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I grew up in villages. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja okay.  Ja so I just wanted to understand 
that because I know Ms Hofmeyr does not.  So when – in the 
villages when you talk about land belonging to somebody 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 171 of 310 
 
you – you – it is different from talking about the land in 
Braamfontein or in Bryanston which – which have a what a 
title deed that has got the name of who and who and – ja – 
so when my grandmother and her parents moved to Belfast 
they were coming from Mpendwini being among the family 
and then he got – she got married to the Kholani family.  So 
when she – oh she got that land – my grandmother because 
– being the elder daughter of her parent.  So then it 
becomes the land of – belonging to her and her husband July 
Kholani in a sense. So that is why I am saying if maybe they 
10 
had – if it was not meant as a bad intention – if they had 
asked maybe or as they like sending questions and saying 
okay exactly which family should we talk to regarding this 
land?  Which family will be able to go and point out the land 
that you talking about?  This is the same Chair I would raise 
the issue of Chief Sigcau as well that after watching Mr 
Ndzeku’s 
testimony 
my 
understanding 
is 
that 
the 
investigators of this commission should have – I do not know 
if they have but by listening to the testimony there is nothing 
that gave me this impression that they had asked Mr Ndzeku 
20 
first have you met Mr – Chief Sigcau?  And then went to 
Chief Sigcau based on what he has provided.  Instead they 
went to Chief Sigcau and then come with an affidavit let him 
sit here without going through an affidavit and then put a 
question to him after and like I mean to confirm on the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 172 of 310 
 
affidavit that was found without actually confirming with him.  
So that is where I was going with this whole thing of – it was 
not a criticism per se it is just that I was taken aback with 
the – the way Ms Hofmeyr was actually putting her questions 
across that – saying I put it to you that this; I put it to you 
that this as if like I mean it is based on facts which is – we 
are sitting here I actually have facts that can actually justify 
what happens here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So the – your mother when 
10 
she described if this is her affidavit the land she was selling 
said that it was land fully owned by her inherited from her 
parents Mr and Mrs Kholani.  Are you aware of that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She then described it.  She said it is the 
land situated at Empendweni next to the Umzumbuvu river in 
Tabankulu, are you aware of that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I am aware of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is the land that she allegedly sold to 
Mr Ndzeku.  It is land in the area over which Chief Sigcau 
20 
administers 
and 
he 
confirmed 
in 
his 
affidavit 
to 
the 
commission that he had never met Mr Ndzeku and he was 
aware of no transfer in relation to land falling within that 
area.  Are you aware of that evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  I will not say yes or no on that question 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 173 of 310 
 
Chair.  The reason why is that after requesting certain 
documents the affidavit of Chief Sigcau was also provided to 
us and we went through that.  And what Ms Hofmeyr is 
saying now to the public is that Ms – Chief Sigcau said that 
is his area and he has never met Mr Ndzeku and my 
understanding of course Chief Sigcau would not meet Mr 
Ndzeku for demarcation of land or sale of land. Chief Sigcau 
my understanding and Ms Hofmeyr just to give you clarity.  
He is a paramount chief of AmaMpondo.  We have got two 
paramount chiefs of AmaMpondo.  Sigcau and Ndamase and 
10 
not even once Chair where you would see the paramount 
chief going and meeting people who are coming maybe to 
buy the land or the demarcation and stuff.  I will tell you now 
Chair I have land – I have a home in Sugarbush.  I have 
never met the paramount chief.  But the person who usually 
is involved there are the representative of the paramount 
chief being the headman in Xhosa we call them [African 
language] sometimes.  Those are the people that actually sit 
there and discuss the stuff.  But when it comes to selling the 
land Ms Hofmeyr in the rural areas you do not require a 
20 
permission of a paramount chief.  You do not need to see a 
paramount chief.  And I even made an example of this it is a 
pity that Ms Hofmeyr maybe or the investigators never really 
went back to my statement because they would have seen 
where I said when you sell the land you do not need 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 174 of 310 
 
anybody’s permission.  Chair my husband and I can actually 
decide now that we are selling the land in Sugarbush.  We 
will not even have to notify the body – the headman.  The 
only time that we will notify him is when the new person is 
coming now to take over and says okay now this is going to 
be the person or the owner of this.  But there is no paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you talk about selling a piece of 
land in the context of land that is administered by a chief or 
10 
Nkhosi?  Because that land is not yours in the true sense. 
You are allowed to occupy it and if you should leave the area 
the local chief or Nkhosi can allocate it to somebody else.  
At least that is how things happen in  
MS MEMELA:  In KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In KZN.  I am under the impression that it 
is the same thing elsewhere. 
MS MEMELA:  No Chair I am sorry I am not – I am not 
saying – I will not say the Judge is lying I will just say maybe 
you have limited information about the – the land in the 
20 
villages.  There are so many people that sell land at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I know that even in KZN people speak 
about selling. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 175 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my understanding is that legally if it is 
land falling under an Nkhosi or a chief that – that sale is not 
valid in law because it is not your land in the same way as in 
the urban areas.  What you can do – what you can do is you 
take this person who wants to take over your house or where 
you were allocated by the chief.  You take him or her to the 
local chief to say I am going to be leaving this area.  My 
children live in Umlazi they have said I must go and live with 
them now because I am old,  I have got – there is nobody to 
look after me here. But here is somebody that would like to 
10 
get into this land.  And if the chief approves then the person 
takes over.  But the chief could – the chief could – could 
refuse. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja Chair remember I had said to you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa what is happening now? 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  
ADV MBANJWA:  [Not speaking into the microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but leave the witness to deal with that 
20 
Ms Mbanjwa.  When you re-examine her you can try and get 
her to give whatever clarification. 
ADV MBANJWA:  [Not speaking into the microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us hear from the – from the 
witness who says she knows how these things happen in the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 176 of 310 
 
Eastern Cape. 
ADV MBANJWA:  [Not speaking into the microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine.  You will give me 
assistance when you re-examine.  Ja.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair you spoke about then it makes it 
not legal to sell and now as Ms Mbanjwa had raised an issue 
of now we talking legalities and we do not want to waste the 
commission’s time where we actually explain the Alienation 
of Lands Act and how it applies in the rural areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  But we will cover that in the re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  But when it comes to the chief as much as I 
am not the party in the deed of sale it is my mom and Mr 
Ndzeku but my understanding is there is no way that Mr 
Ndzeku – yes he said he went to Eastern Cape and met 
some people but I am sitting here I am saying there is no 
way that he met Chief Sigcau because the paramount chief 
does not sit in sale of lands and demarcation of land and all 
those kind of things. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So he may have met either the headman or 
the other people that maybe representing that area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And when I read the affidavit of Chief Sigcau 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 177 of 310 
 
he is actually explaining that that okay there are certain 
people that represent that area you know and he mentioned 
Ms Nonkubela Nhlebe who I found out that in 2015 actually 
she was not the chief by then. So you see – so that is where 
now the problem is where I say if the commission in terms of 
– because now Ms Hofmeyr talked about fairness.  If the 
commission had done these things fairly in saying okay Mr 
Ndzeku you said you went to Eastern Cape in your affidavit 
you bought the land and stuff who did you meet?  Mr Ndzeku 
is not coming from Eastern Cape Chair.  He is coming from 
10 
Johannesburg.  That is my understanding – he is not coming 
from that area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Right – so for him to be expected to 
remember people that he met between 2015 and 2016 right I 
am just – I am just – let me finish Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And then – ja I would ex – I would have 
expected the commission’s team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that when he said he 
20 
met Chief Sigcau he – he must have been mistaken because 
he did not – he could not have met Chief Sigcau. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair he could have not met Chief Sigcau but 
let me tell you because I was watching the testimony and I 
was taking notes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 178 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Because I knew that somehow maybe I will 
have to come and give clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  The question was put to him but I wanted to 
address the issue of asking him first before going to him but 
it is fine.  The question was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do this – let us do it this way. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr this question you might wish 
10 
to deal with it now or leave it later on and deal with others.  
Can I just leave it to you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I just want us to make progress. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want us to sit with what happened 
last time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Or reinterpret what happened last time.  
20 
Today is for Ms Memela to tell us what she knows about the 
events right.  So you received Chief Sigcau’s affidavit Ms 
Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You have read it have you? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 179 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  We have gone through it yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Do you disagree with any part of 
what he says there? 
MS MEMELA:  I disagree with lots of things that he had said.  
Yes and that is exactly what we had prepared Chair to cover 
in our re-examination using the Alienation or Land Act.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  So when… 
MS MEMELA:  So I do not know if you would like… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the re-examination was not going to 
cover areas that had not been covered by Ms Hofmeyr. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Of course ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see because what Chief Sigcau 
describes is exactly what the Chair has put to you. 
MS MEMELA:  Can we go back?  Can you go to – are you 
sending me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay can you go to that because you 
saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No just hang on Ms Memela she will tell 
you if she wants you to open to a particular page. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because the Chair a moment ago gave you 
an understanding of how – I am going to put “sale” because 
the point as I understood it that you made Chair was that 
sales per se did not take place.  It is permissions to occupy 
that require the authority to have been given by the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 180 of 310 
 
Traditional Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that is an aspect that Chief Sigcau 
dealt with in detail in his affidavit.  Do you recall seeing 
that? 
MS MEMELA:  I recall seeing that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And do you say that he is wrong? 
MS MEMELA:  I say if he is wrong then I will – we will prove 
that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well certainly I am familiar with 
permissions to occupy as well. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We can move from that to the issue in 
relation to the handwriting expert.  Because I understand you 
have a difference of opinion with Chief Sigcau about how 
transfers take place, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You – do you take issue with Mr Ndzeku’s 
20 
evidence which changed over the course of the day?  He first 
said he had met Chief Sigcau.  He then later admitted that 
he had not.  Which version do you say is correct?  You have 
any knowledge of it? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair as I listened to this – because when 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 181 of 310 
 
you are listening versus when Ms Hofmeyr is questioning. 
Remember I do know if she listens to her own line of 
questioning.  But I remember when she raised this question. 
She said Mr Ndzeku did you meet – when you went to 
Eastern Cape to view the land did you meet the Chief and Mr 
Ndzeku said yes I met people and I met a chief and the 
following question was, did – was the Chief Chief Sigcau. 
And the answer of Mr Ndzeku I even wrote it down he said I 
met Chief – I think so.  He said I think so.  Because I am 
sure he had not seen even the affidavit at that time.  You 
10 
understand so like it was actually put to him.  So there is – 
to say then a person has agreed as if he is the one who 
actually started to say okay I met the Chief.  I would say 
Chair the person agreed when he said I went to Eastern 
Cape viewed the land and I met Chief Sigcau.  But the Chief 
Sigcau part was put to him and he responded and he said I 
met the Chief I think so.  Then the next question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there – is there another Chief other than 
Chief Sigcau? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that area? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is the other Chief? 
MS MEMELA:  It is Mr Ndlebe with – during 2015 it was Mr 
Ndlebe and now from 2016 it was Ms Nonkubele Ndebe who 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 182 of 310 
 
is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is he a chief or is he a headman? 
MS MEMELA:  They are called chiefs but of course it is – 
they are representing certain areas like which is one of them 
is Mpendwini, Mphapha and all the other areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But it was Mpendwini land that your mother 
allegedly sold, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Chief Sigcau says that no land did – at 
Mpendwini that devolved to your mother ever came to his 
attention and he never granted any permission for it to be 
sold. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is that correct. 
MS MEMELA:  I saw that Chair in his affidavit that it never 
came – went to his attention.  So of course I cannot deny 
that.  Okay it never went to his attention but the fact that the 
sale happened, it happened. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS MEMELA:  And there is no law that says okay it should 
go to his [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you said the fact that?  You said 
the fact that and then I did not hear what you said. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 183 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I said I do not deny when he says he 
was not made aware of the sale.  You understand because I 
am not sure about that.  But all I am saying is that he – for 
him to say for the sale to go through he has to give 
permission that is the part that I am disputing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are disputing? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well he does not say he has to give 
permission to the sale.  He himself says it is not correct to 
think of it as a sale the only thing that can be granted is 
10 
permission to occupy and no permission to occupy for Mr 
Ndzeku taking over land in Mpendwini ever came to his 
attention.  Do you accept that that is what Chief Sigcau 
said? 
MS MEMELA:  That is what the affidavit says yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and can you also confirm you have no 
knowledge of who attended any meeting with Mr Ndzeku in 
the Eastern Cape because you did not attend that meeting? 
MS MEMELA:  I was not there yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The land. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was said to have been sold falls 
within the area under the jurisdiction of Chief Sigcau is that 
right? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 184 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  It falls under one of the districts under him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is – yes.  Now I assume that that 
would mean that if there was somebody else other than him 
who could do something about giving somebody that piece of 
land or whether you call it selling or granting permission to 
occupy that person would be one of the people who are 
under Chief Sigcau? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes it will be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be like a headman – maybe a 
headman – yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Headman or Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now that person could not be 
administering the giving of land to people legally in a manner 
that is not known to the – to Chief Sigcau.  If Chief Sigcau 
says under my – under the Land that falls within my 
jurisdiction you can only be granted permission to occupy.  
You cannot be granted anything stronger than that legally.  It 
must include all the areas in – under him otherwise he would 
say certain areas you can be granted permission to occupy 
but others you can get the land sold.  So as I understand his 
20 
affidavit, he seems to suggest that when you talk about land 
that falls under my authority and that means including 
Izinduna headman under him this is what we talk about when 
we give somebody land.  We talk about permission to 
occupy. That must be – he must be talking about all land 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 185 of 310 
 
under him. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair you – what you have just described 
Chair is a process that actually follows a certain registration 
process and procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am taking the process that he is 
talking about in his affidavit.  He – as I understand it and Ms 
Hofmeyr will tell me if I have misunderstood something. 
MS MEMELA:  No, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Permission to occupy is the only system he 
is talking about that in terms of which somebody can be 
10 
granted land under him.  Is that not so? 
MS MEMELA:  It is not so Chair and I can tell you now land 
gets sold in Eastern Cape several times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  Let me say. 
MS MEMELA:  And we… 
MS MEMELA:  When I say is it not so I am asking not what 
the position is as you understand it. 
MS MEMELA:  Not as I understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am asking whether that is how he 
explains it in his affidavit. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you do not agree with him? 
MS MEMELA:  It is not how – yes it is not how it works. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 186 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us then move to your 
second issue that you took up in your interview with the 
media.  That was the issue of the handwriting experts report.  
You have received that have you? 
MS MEMELA:  Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You have received the handwriting expert’s 
report? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes we – we have received in the bundle. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you notice that she was not asked to 
compare the signatures on the affidavit and the sale 
agreement with the handwriting of your mother from twenty 
years ago.  She was asked to compare it to the handwriting 
of your mother as recently as a year before the alleged 
affidavit and sale agreement was entered into.   
MS MEMELA:  Chair if I remember correctly when I looked at 
that report it is just that I do not have it now here.  But when 
I look at that report of the – ja I am not sure if I must – ja.  
When I look at the report there is a – the initials of my mom 
20 
and surname from 1997.  Now tell me if that is not more than 
twenty years ago.  So they started 1997 there is 2010.  I 
think there is 2014 I am not sure maybe I might not 
remember.  I am just trying to remember the comparison 
which is I am thinking they were comparing documents as 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 187 of 310 
 
back then.  And I remember Ms Hofmeyr saying in the public 
platform that the signatures according to the expert the 
signatures of Ms Nhlohle had been consistent way back.  
And when I saw the document I – there is no consistency 
exactly as I had said when I responded to the journalist that 
I was talking to who actually wrote something different.  I 
notice one thing that is – when sometimes she would write 
and Nhlohle sometimes she would write M G Nhlohle, 
sometimes she would write G Nhlohle.  You understand so I 
am not sure then where is the consistency there?  That is 
10 
where I was actually trying to understand that then what I 
saw here in comparison to what I said in this – it is actually 
exactly the same because that is what I was told.  There is 
no consistency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the question Ms Memela was 
whether you had noticed that the comparison included your 
mother’s signature a year before the affidavit. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes but that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You notice that? 
MS MEMELA:  But starting from twenty years back.  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but your criticism of the investigation 
was that all that Ms Buckley had done was taken the affidavit 
and compared it to a signature from twenty years ago.  Do 
you accept that that is wrong? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 188 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay ja because remember I had not have 
the document then. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I am just asking you now. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that what you said to the 
media is wrong? 
MS MEMELA:  It is not really wrong but I am just saying I 
know that you had compared from way back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No how can it not be wrong?  Your 
statement to the media was, Ms Buckley’s evidence should 
10 
be rejected because she was comparing your mother’s 
signature on the affidavit to a signature from twenty years 
ago.  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  It should be rejected did I say that?  Is that 
how I am quoted saying? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I am paraphrasing. 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you.  Like you see now when you 
changing the statement and saying something that I did not 
say that is not fair.  Chair the other thing in terms of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what is – what is clear – I am sorry 
20 
Ms Memela.  What is clear is that you were rejecting the 
conclusion of the expert witness of the handwriting witness.  
That is clear from the article. 
MS MEMELA:  That is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 189 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  And also – and also Chair after receiving the 
documents that show the report of the – of this lady there is 
a disclaimer there that Ms Hofmeyr chose not to read for the 
public to see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you are going to something else.  Let 
us go where it goes step by step. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that in the article you criticised 
the investigator – the expert – handwriting expert on the 
basis that she did not compare – she did not use recent 
10 
signatures.  She looked at signatures that were twenty years 
or more old, is that right?  You accept that that is your – that 
was your criticism? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair can you take me back there Ms 
Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is page 1145 in the middle of the page.  I 
will read it into the record just for convenience.  What you 
are quoted to have said is: 
“For 
the 
inquiry 
handwriting 
expert 
to 
compare how she wrote her name more than 
20 
twenty years ago when she did an affidavit 
for me to get an ID versus her writing in 2015 
can never be considered as a reasonable 
comparison.  Even I do not write the same as 
I used to write twenty years ago.” 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 190 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the question was, do you accept now 
that the expert did look at a more recent signature, namely, 
even the one that was a year before the affidavit. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, the expert... after I saw the document.  
Yes, looked at I think about four ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   ...different signatures of my mom.  But 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, now you accept? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, but Ms Hofmeyr said in public 
that...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Leave out what she said.   
MS MEMELA:   ...there was terms ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Leave out what she said. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you accept that now the handwriting 
had looked at more recent signatures? 
MS MEMELA:   That looked at ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MBANJWA:   Ja, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
Ms 
Hofmeyr’s 
question 
was, 
therefore, you should accept also that it was not correct to 
suggest that she had not looked at recent signatures?  She 
had only looked at ...[intervenes]  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 191 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   No, that is not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...a signature that was about 20-years-
old? 
MS MEMELA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MEMELA:   That is not what I said Chair that she has not 
looked at recent signatures.  I talked about 20-years and 
2015.  Of course, 2015, that is the last one I think I know 
that my mom, they had what referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Ja.  Ms Hofmeyr actually said this.  You 
know, you see, on public. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are not... I am not asking about that 
what she said in public.  I am just asking about what she was 
asking now.  Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   [Indistinct] [microphone not switched on.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MBANJWA:   The reason why we are objecting to this.  
20 
The witness is struggling because the concession that she is 
supposed to make is not what she said.   
 
What she said, she said, what did the expert said if her 
mother’s handwriting has been consistent throughout.   
 
And she said that consistency can never be there 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 192 of 310 
 
because even her own mother’s handwriting which was... 
when she was getting an ID and the one in 2015 was 
different.  So it is not as if she said...  
 
And now, what she is now demanded to do now is to 
make a concession that when she spoke to the media, she 
unfairly criticised the Commission.   
 
And the other reason why I object to that kind of 
questioning is because it has got nothing to do with the 
mandate of the Commission.  It has got something to do with 
the integrity of the Commission.   
10 
 
And the truth of the matter is.  These hearings are 
televised because people are going to criticise.  It is just a 
fact.  So if we are going to come here and worry 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   ...criticism ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fraud and corruption is in the Terms of 
Reference of this Commission.   
20 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Please continue Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MBANJWA:   But not ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
MS MBANJWA:   But not to the criticism of how the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 193 of 310 
 
questions are done.  This is not about fraud and Commission 
here Chair.  It has moved now.  It has become now a 
personally 
issue 
that 
either 
the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission or whatever.  So we are definitely... we refer 
that the experts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa, please sit down. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Memela, are you a 
handwriting expert? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Of course I am not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So do you have any basis to dispute the 
conclusions drawn by Ms Buckley who is a handwriting 
expert? 
MS MEMELA:   The basis that I would have to reject that is 
the fact that ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you answer the first question first?  
Do you reject the conclusions that she draw in her report? 
MS MEMELA:   I am rejecting it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you explain why? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   I reject them.  Can I explain why? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, please. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, Ms Hofmeyr did not read the 
disclaimer when she made that statement from that report.  
We were just sent the so disclaimer from the expert, the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 194 of 310 
 
handwriting expert where she said it shall be known.   
 
Of course, not word for word because I did not memorise 
that.  But she said it should be noted that.... she had made 
comparison of the copies.  We are talking about handwriting 
here, Chair.   
 
She made comparisons of the copies, not the original.  
When you are talking about where you are trying to make 
sure that is this not as handwriting and stuff.   
 
The only hundred per cent accurate result is when you 
compare originals to originals.  She even explained that 
10 
when you compare copies, especially contact(?) copies with 
different years, the font changes.   
 
She said that it is there.  But it was never read for the 
public to actually understand that part.  Because, I mean, 
the only statement that was made that okay automatically it 
must be forgery.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so that is the basis for rejection 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   That my basis of rejection, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us go to her conclusion of her report 
then.  You will find it in Exhibit DD26.B.  Chair, that will need 
to be handed to you.  It was in Mr Ndzeku’s bundles. 
MS MEMELA:   DD2016.B? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just finish with the one ...[intervenes]  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 195 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is B.  Sorry, BB26B.  And you will find 
the conclusion of Ms Buckley’s report at page 298. 
MS MEMELA:   Eight...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   298.  Two-hundred and ninety-eight. 
MS MEMELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So her conclusion appears at page 298. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, sorry, sorry.  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have not found it? 
MS MEMELA:   I am just going through it and I had a request 
Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do not go through it.  Wait for the 
question.  The question might not need you to go through it. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I do not want to go through the whole 
of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   I just want to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...all I am saying is ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Remember, I had mentioned her disclaimer 
on the report ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but she is not asking you about the 
20 
disclaimer. 
MS MEMELA:   Huh?  No, she was asking... she is asking us 
to go to the conclusion.  So I was going to request, if you 
allow, that before she goes to the conclusion.  Can her 
disclaimer, the red ...[intervenes]  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 196 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but you have already said what the 
disclaimer says. 
MS MEMELA:   No, but I have heard.  It was not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or are you not sure it says what it says? 
MS MEMELA:   It was not word for word.  Of course, I might 
not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Let her continue with that question.  If 
she wants to go through the disclaimer later, she can do so.  
If she wants to start there now, it is fine.   
10 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am happy to go to the disclaimer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Please read it through into the record.  
What page are you at? 
MS MEMELA:   I am page 295. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And what is the disclaimer? 
MS MEMELA:   Can I read, Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   [No audible reply]  
MS MEMELA:   Ja.

“Copies 
of 
the 
document 
were 
submitted 
for 
examination.  Although a clear digital phone copy 
can 
yield almost as much information 
as the 
original.  Repeated copying affects the quality of the 
writing and printing.  A first generation copy (copy 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 197 of 310 
 
from original) will display slight loss of minute detail 
and some pixilation in the lines.  A copy of a copy 
will have more loss of definition and more pixilation.  
The lines lose more definition with each subsequent 
copy and the quality of the printing and writing get 
progressively worse.  The pen pressure of writing 
cannot be assessed on the copies.  The possibility 
of electronic manipulation it is in parts and place 
and/or disguise (glossary) cannot be excluded on 
copies.  This examination is therefore based on the 
10 
aspects of the writing that can be discerned despite 
the copying.  All documentation have been examined 
with aid of microscopes and measuring instruments.” 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so that is the disclaimer.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She says for example, she cannot assess 
pen pressure because she is dealing with copies.  And she 
says that her examination is therefore based on the writing 
on copies.  And she goes to her conclusion at 298 and she 
says the following: 
20 
“Although copies were examined, the dissimilarities 
or similarities in individual writing characteristics 
are profound. 
a) It is my professional opinion that the questioned 
signatures were not made by the same writer but 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 198 of 310 
 
executed the known to be genuine signatures N G 
Hlohlela(?). 
b) All the writing on affidavit that was question 1 
and sale agreement question 2 was done by one 
and the same hand.  The individual writing 
characteristics present in the writing on the 
questioned documents are also present in the Q1 
and Q2 signatures purported to be by one, NG 
Hlohlela.” 
 
Do you see that? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela, I put it to you that that 
conclusion is entirely consistent with the disclaimer.  The 
disclaimer says there are limitations to assessing copies. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Are taking those into account, for 
example, I have not looked a pen pressure issues. 
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But despite the fact that I am dealing with 
copies, 
there 
are 
“profound 
characteristics” 
that 
are 
20 
dissimilar. 
 
And 
she 
nonetheless 
concludes, 
in 
her 
professional opinion, that the questioned signatures were not 
made by the same writer as the known to be genuine 
signatures.  Do you dispute that conclusion? 
MS MEMELA:   I dispute that conclusion. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 199 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the basis is because of the 
disclaimer.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   No, on the basis of the disclaimer, plus, on 
the basis of the fact that the handwriting of my mom kept on 
changing, whereas she signs as the year goes by. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is even reflected in the examples that 
she attaches.   
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She changed initials over time, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And despite that, in her professional 
opinion, she concluded that the signatures on the questioned 
documents, affidavit and sale agreement, were not on the 
same hand that the... all the other genuine signatures over 
time.  Do you accept that that was her conclusion? 
MS MEMELA:   You are saying that gave all the other 
genuine signatures all the time? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Over time. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Over time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The genuine signatures ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Can you read that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...remember went from 1997 ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Ja? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 200 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...to 2014. 
MS MEMELA:   Can you back?  Can you show me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   That document. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We are looking at it. 
MS MEMELA:   No, no.  The... where there is my mother’s 
initials and surname which ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you... it is over the page.  You go to 
page 300.  That is part of her report. 
MS MEMELA:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see?  The first two are the questioned 
signatures, Q1 and Q2.  And then you have ST7, ST5, ST6 
and ST2.  Those are the ones that were taken from 2014, 
2010, 2010 and 1997.   
 
And she says, in her professional opinion, Question 1 
and Question 2’s signatures were not written by the same 
hand that wrote all of those other signatures over time. 
MS MEMELA:   So are you... where we are, that is page 
300? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think so. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, it is... I may not be an expert, writing 
expert but the consistence that Ms Hofmeyr keeps on 
referring to, saying that okay it has happened from 1997 up 
to 2014.  For instance, my side, to the end it is different. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela, you have already confirmed 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 201 of 310 
 
you are not a handwriting expert. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] [microphone not switched on.] 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly.  Then I think Chair, it is either... 
after speaking to my lawyer, we will request that we also 
take this through our expert so that we can submit something 
professional from an expert.  But I am saying, I am rejecting 
it from what I see. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela, you were given this over a 
week ago.  If you wanted to contest it, it would have been 
10 
appropriate for you to have... introduced that today, would it 
not? 
MS MEMELA:   It was received ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you want me to give you the date? 
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was provided on the 14t h... sorry.  It was 
provided on the 14t h of September.  That is much more than 
a week ago.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is two weeks ago or just a little over 
two weeks ago. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Over two weeks. 
MS MEMELA:   So that means Chair, we are not allowed to 
get an expert now, since we were given this more than two 
weeks ago? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you can make the request but what 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 202 of 310 
 
Ms Hofmeyr is putting to you is that you had an opportunity 
after you were given this to seek, ask an expert, handwriting 
expert to do the same and written a report. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, let me give an explanation for that, 
hoping you understand.  The reason maybe that we did not 
act within the two weeks that we were given this document is 
that I am not party to this, to the sale and also the affidavit.   
 
Therefore, I did not know that I could be allowed then to 
be the one who confirms and go and get the expert, a writing 
expert to... so if it is allowed for me to do that, then I will 
10 
appreciate that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   I just wanted to correct Ms Hofmeyr.  Thank 
you, Chair.  Remember what happened is, when these 
documents were given to us legal representatives of Ms 
Memela, we were not told that the Commission is going to 
seek to re-examine.   
 
We only came to know that there is going to be a re-
examination on the 28t h of September.  Thank you.  So 
consequent, we did not have two weeks.  We actually had 
20 
from the 28t h of September until now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why would it make a difference 
whether you were told there would be a request to question 
here again?  Because if evidence was led that seemed to 
contradict what Ms Memela may have said, then you would 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 203 of 310 
 
be the one to see how you could challenge that evidence. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair.  Because you are using 
the word, how do we want to challenge the evidence?  We 
were going to challenge the evidence as you are going to 
challenge it now in re-examination.  Not by evoking another 
expert, another expert witness but by a different means.   
 
We are going to show them when we come in here.  She 
is now being re-examined or cross-examined on that expert.   
 
That was not our part of our strategy.  And it is for that 
reason Chair why we said, we wanted to go first because we 
10 
would have covered these issues.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue, Ms Hofmeyr.  Ms 
Mbanjwa, just remember that in terms of the regulations, re-
examination is to clarify and clarify evidence that has been 
led.  So the leading of evidence which had not yet been dealt 
with Ms Mamela might have challenges.  But let us continue.  
You will re-examine at some stage when the time comes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Let us ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   You see Chair, there is going to be another 
procedural issue.  Sorry, that I am coming in.  Because the 
20 
procedural question is.  There is now this evidence of Mr 
Ndzeku that has been put before this Commission.   
 
She is now examined on that evidence and now the 
question is, must we again apply afresh to re-examine on 
that evidence of Mr Ndzeku?   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 204 of 310 
 
 
We try to read and understand the rules of the 
Commission but we could not deal with this very fine 
balance.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Mbanjwa you... I will let you re-
examine on the evidence ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the evidence that has been led.  The 
only limitation is the time that we talked about.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  I would just like for the 
record to correct a few errors in relation to dates that my 
10 
learned friend referenced.  It was on the 14t h of September 
that Ms Memela was provided with these various affidavits 
form Mr Ndzeku’s evidence.   
 
That is because that was preceded by the invitation to 
Ms Memela to provide on affidavit her response to Mr 
Ndzeku.   
 
It was not on the 28t h of September that Ms Memela was 
alerted to the fact that we would request an opportunity to 
question.  That was the 23r d of September.  So just to get the 
chronology right. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, let me also add ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   There is first an invitation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Hang on, Ms Memela. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There is first an invitation to provide an 
affidavit in which response to which there is a request for a 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 205 of 310 
 
whole host of documents.  Those included the affidavit of Ms 
Buckley.   
 
Those were then provided on the 14t h of September and 
then when no affidavit had been produced by a week later, 
the 23rd of September, Ms Memela was alerted to the fact 
that the request would be made to question to her.   
 
So that is the chronology in relation to the exchange of 
information.  I understand Ms Mbanjwa to say that it had not 
been their strategy to attack the expert’s evidence.   
 
They are going to deal with it in some other way in 
10 
relation to the questioning.  So we will leave it at that, if we 
may Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You still want to say something? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, I just need to add something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   Remember, the... just to correct Ms Hofmeyr.  
The 
documentation 
that 
was 
sent 
to 
my 
lawyer 
was 
requested by us.  So it is not the Commission that decided 
okay you see, I think... we think this is fair but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but if you got the documentation, why 
20 
does it matter whether it was because you requested or 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   No, but Ms Hofmeyr is saying it as if we were 
given so that we can prepare.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 206 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   We had to ask for them based on what was 
putting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, please continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  In respect of Mr Ndzeku’s 
concession that the sale agreement was not entered into in 
2015 but was entered into in 2019.  Do you have any other 
basis on which to challenge his concession, than the two 
that we have traversed?   
 
We traversed the problems you had with the handwriting 
expert and the challenge that you had with the Commission 
10 
having focused the Tholane(?) family as opposed to the 
Manzi(?) family?  Are there any other grounds? 
MS MEMELA:   The basis for this Chair is that.  Remember 
when I was giving my testimony, I said there is... there are 
documents that were made in terms of the sale of land.   
 
And I remember the documents were there as back as 
between 2016 and 2016.  You know why I remember this?  It 
is because Mr Ndzeku insisted before he paid the money that 
he...  
 
Since there is no title deed, he needed some sort of a 
20 
documentation that assures him, that will satisfy him that 
okay when he start with whatever he wants to do with the 
land, he will have a documentation.   
 
And I remember he insisted in... he was told that there 
are no document in the rural areas.  And then he said:  No, 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 207 of 310 
 
but I need something signed that I will hold onto.   
 
You know, so I think then my mom gave it to me in... 
between 2016... 2015 and 2016.  I know that in 2015 she 
was here for her eye operation and then she went home.  
And then I think I went home as well.   
 
And I came back with the affidavit and gave it to Mr 
Ndzeku.  And then the deed of sale followed after that.  So 
that is why I am saying, for me, I do understand.  Because 
remember Chair, first of all ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, hang on.  I do not want us to 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   You do not understand? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Oh, you do not want me to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...have long stories of ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on simple questions.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the question was ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the light of Mr Ndzeku’s concession 
that the agreement was only signed in 2019 by him. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you have any basis for suggesting that 
the agreement was done in 2015, other the fact that you 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 208 of 310 
 
have 
challenged 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
handwriting expert and you have challenged the issue of why 
the investigators went to certain people and not to other 
people. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I am still challenging that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. so you ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   I said the basis that I knew... I know that the 
documents were done during that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   I am not sure if... when Mr Ndzeku was 
10 
talking about signing.  And I remember, the question again 
was put to him based on the evidence, expert evidence that 
he said he has not seen.  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you maintain that the agreement was 
signed by Mr Ndzeku in 2015, not 2019? 
MS MEMELA:   I am not talking on behalf of Mr Ndzeku.  I 
am talking ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, in terms of what you know. 
MS MEMELA:   No, I am saying, I am not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is it that you know in terms of 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Remember Chair, Mr Ndzeku testified on his 
behalf.  For me, I am saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he testified about a transaction 
that involves you and your mother.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 209 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   The transaction that involves my mother. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, 
but 
when 
it 
going 
from 
it 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   The documents were there Chair between 
2015 and 2016.  And these documents were made to satisfy 
Mr Ndzeku that the land is there and my mom owns the land 
and therefore he can take over when he is ready to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   So I am saying from my mother’s side, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but do you know when Mr Ndzeku 
10 
signed the sale? 
MS MEMELA:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know when it was that Mr Ndzeku 
signed the agreement? 
MS MEMELA:   No, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  He has said it was 2019.  Do you 
accept that? 
MS MEMELA:   He responded to the question that was put to 
20 
him.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether he responded to a question or 
whether he has told me without being asked but he said it 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 210 of 310 
 
was 2019 when he signed.   
MS MEMELA:   Chair, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The question to you is.  Do you accept 
that evidence as, of his, that he only signed the agreement 
in 2019? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I am not in the right position to accept 
or deny. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MEMELA:   I am not in the right position to accept.  
Because 
I 
remember, 
his 
lawyer 
even 
stood 
up 
and 
10 
challenged the issue of the year.  Because he said it would 
be based on speculation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   He said he was forced to actually answer and 
he said, based on whatever expert then and whatever, then I 
guess then, maybe it was signed in 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Even when he is responding to that 2019, he 
was still not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you do not take issue with his evidence 
20 
that he signed the agreement in 2019 or do you? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, okay ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you do not know? 
MS MEMELA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just trying to establish where we 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 211 of 310 
 
stand. 
MS MEMELA:   No, but the problem Chair of questioning is 
that.  When you say I do not take issue.  The fact remains is 
that there is... there was the deed of sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MEMELA:   The issue... the fact of the matter is that 
there was a deed of sale.  From my mother’s side, it had 
already been there.  It is in 2015 and 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   The affidavit of my mom was given to Mr 
10 
Ndzeku between 2015 and 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is true that Mr Ndzeku signed in 2019. 
MS MEMELA:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it could not... there could not have 
been a sale before he signed, is it not? 
MS MEMELA:   No, there could have been a sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   There could have been a sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say there could have been? 
MS MEMELA:   There could have been a sale before he 
20 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And an agreement.  And yet, without his 
signature. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, there could have been a sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With only one party signed... having 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 212 of 310 
 
signed? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, Chair.  Remember, we explained this but 
you said, we must not take long to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS MEMELA:   And I said, in the villages, we do not sign or 
search or deed of sale and whatever but these documents 
were done because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I understand you to dispute 
Mr Ndzeku’s concession. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   H’m? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That the affidavit was forged because you 
say you know your mother attested to it in September of 
2015.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   I said my mother gave me the affidavit 
already signed ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   ...to give it to Mr Ndzeku because Mr Ndzeku 
was insisting that ...[intervenes]   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   ...since there was not title deed, I needed 
documentation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And that is despite the fact that 
that affidavit bears of 2019.  Is that correct?  You still say, 
you got in 2015? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 213 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   The affidavit Chair bears the date of 2015 
where it was signed and commissioned.  The date of 2019 
was where, you see an error issue, where you actually say... 
because I remember, Mr Ndzeku even asked me, what about 
this?  And I said but this part is not filled in.   
 
So it does not make this affidavit invalid at all.  And my 
understanding Chair also, because these documents were 
made for him.  It would have been him who went...  
 
I think he guys ...[indistinct]  So let me go and get an 
expert because it was to satisfy him.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   So when Ms Hofmeyr is talking about forgery, 
was the affidavit forged to rob Mr Ndzeku?  Forged for who? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, please continue. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And then just again, you say 
you dispute Mr Ndzeku’s version because you know the sale 
was concluded in 2015.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   I know the land was in 2015. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  The sale agreement, was it 
20 
concluded in 2015, Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:   The sale agreement was already there in 
2015.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja.

ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it referred to a dispute resolution 
provision 
that 
anticipated 
the 
Legal 
Practice 
Council 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...who would be appointed at a time when 
it did not exist. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   It talks about the Legal Council that did not 
exist. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   But the Legal Council or Practice Council Act 
was already promulgated in 2014.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, Ms Memela it was. 
MS MEMELA:   So...  Thank you.  As much as I was not the 
drafter of that document, I can... we cannot say okay all the 
contracts Chair should be exhaustive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Ms Memela ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela, is the position not that in 
2015, there was not Legal Practise Council that was 
operational, that had been established? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes but remember Chair.  When we talk 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 215 of 310 
 
about dispute resolution, we are talking about something that 
will happen later ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   ...in making ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  But there was no Legal Practice 
Council in operation at the time in 2015.   
MS MEMELA:   But there was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not? 
MS MEMELA:   There was a Legal Council Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS MEMELA:   ...that promulgated in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Listen to me carefully. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree that in 2015, there was no 
Legal Practise Council in operation? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, the council. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, there was no Legal Practice 
Council at all because if it was still a bill and not an act, it... 
there was no such structure.  Is it not? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it not still a bill in 2015? 
MS MEMELA:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it was enacted in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 216 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it had a series of sections that would 
be brought into operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Into operation, years. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the establishment of the council 
occurred in October of 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but there was simply no Legal 
Practice Council in operation in 2015. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I agree.  There was no Legal Practice 
Council.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So now ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   But the act was already there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...how could people in 2015, when they 
look for somebody who would do their... resolve their 
disputes, say that choose a structure that is not in operation 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   But if you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when there were structures in operation 
that they could choose? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, if it is so that the other dispute 
resolution, it does not just jump to a Legal Practice Council.  
It starts, okay the parties will do... will go there first.  And if 
this fails, they go there.  And then if they...  
 
You see, now I am talking on behalf of the drafter but I 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 217 of 310 
 
do not know.  But I am just saying, there were processes that 
were listed there.  Chair, can I give an example? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MS 
MEMELA: 
 
 
Remember, 
the 
Companies Act 
was 
promulgated in 2008, right?  But it was passed in 2011.  But 
I can tell you now, most lawyers in the commercial sector, 
they were already referring to some of the sections of the 
Companies Act as far back as 2009 and 2010.   
 
So I am just saying, I am not defending because I was 
not the drafter but if I was the drafter, I would defend it by 
10 
saying that there is nothing that is stopping you from 
referring to something that you know that is going to happen 
in the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I would then like to go to why 
that R 2.5 million was paid because you earlier said it is a 
sale agreement between your mother and Mr Ndzeku, 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it referred to you benefiting from it, 
20 
did it not? 
MS MEMELA:   It referred...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   To you benefiting from the money that 
would be paid pursuant to the agreement, did it not? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  Remember, it is during my re-exam... 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 218 of 310 
 
during my testimony in Feb, Chair.  I gave the testimony that 
the plan was for me to buy the land in covert in East London.   
 
So the plan was for my mother to help me buy that land, 
which was two point eight, the one that was in East London.   
 
Then I... then in 2016, I changed my mind because 
the land in East London, it took longer for proclamation to 
come in.  And that is when we cannot sell it.  And said okay 
let me use the money for that, and then my mom gave me 
the 1.5, not the 2.5 that Ms Hofmeyr keeps on referring to.  
The deposit for my house in Bedfordview was for 1.5 and 
10 
the remainder, it was the bond. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, Ms Memela, is your evidence before 
this Commission today that you did not utilise the full R2.5 
million 
that 
was 
paid 
by 
JM 
Aviation 
to 
Mbanjwa 
Incorporated? 
MS MEMELA:   To buy…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have just said that I keep referring 
to 2.5 million. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When in fact only 1.5 million was 
20 
…[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I am saying, Chair, the way you keep 
on saying it, Ms Hofmeyr, is that it is as if this – the whole 
2.5 went to the house as a deposit and it was to benefit me 
to buy my house in Bedfordview.  She does not – she no 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 219 of 310 
 
longer wants to refer the land in Cove Ridge which is – 
that was the reason why my mom was going to help me to 
buy that land in Cove Ridge.  The Bedfordview issue came 
into account only later in 2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela, I do want to go to Cove 
Ridge very, very pertinently but I need to get your 
evidence on this correct. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that the 2.5 that JM 
Aviation paid to Mbanjwa Incorporated on the 6 May 2016 
10 
was used by you, the whole 2.5 million? 
MS MEMELA:   Not the whole 2.5 million. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How much was used by you? 
MS MEMELA:   The deposit for 1.5, Chair.  And I remember 
some I – it was used to renovate my mom’s home and help 
her because she had a heart problem and then she was 
taken to specialists and all that, so there was a lot that it 
was used for. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not remember being paid more 
than R800 000 out of the transaction had gone through on 
20 
the home. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Into your bank account which you then 
used? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I am saying – remember, you even 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 220 of 310 
 
asked, Chair, during my last examination that okay, why 
could this money not go directly to your mom and I said no, 
it went to the lawyers then the other came to me.  So when 
I say it was not used solely for me, it was used for my 
mom’s health, it was used to renovate my mom’s home as 
well. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How much was used for your mom? 
MS MEMELA:   Then I do not remember that amount but I 
renovated 
the 
whole 
house 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you accept that you received 1.5 
million to pay the deposit on the house? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you received after the transaction I 
think it was 886 000. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   My colleagues will add that up for me 
but that is very close to 2.5 million.  We will do the 
calculation now.  So there would have been a little bit of 
the 2.5 million that was not used by you directly, is that 
20 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   No, Chair, then Ms Hofmeyr is talking 
about the 1.5, right?  Plus the 800 that was left from the 
money that went to the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is 2.3. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 221 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   That went to the lawyers, yes.  So then she 
is taking the 200 thinking that okay, that is the one that 
was used for my mom.  I am saying that whatever that I did 
for my mom was coming from that 800 000 that came to 
me, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when we go to your bank statements 
you will be able to show me where you use it for your 
mother. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, so how am going – must I show that I 
bought tiles in 2015? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   And do that and stuff? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes because we have your bank 
statement. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes from the bank statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   From the moment the 886 000 came into 
your account till it was depleted.  You will be able to show 
me there where you paid for something for your mother, 
will you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa? 
20 
MS MBANJWA:   But Chair, really, are you telling me that 
now these things going to be extended to us now going to 
brought the bank statements?  Is the issue not here being 
simple, the receipt of the 2.5 million which has not been 
denied? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 222 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa, Ms Hofmeyr wants to know 
exactly how much of the 2.5 million was used for Ms 
Memela’s benefit, how much of it was not used for her 
benefit because …[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   But it is irrelevant Chair.  What is the 
relevance of that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa, I am speaking at the 
moment. 
MS MBANJWA:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr wants to establish 
10 
how much of the 2.5 million was used for the benefit of Ms 
Memela, how much of it was not used for her benefit 
because she has said that it was not the whole amount of 
2.5 that was used for her benefit. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I would like to know that as well, 
how much of it was used for her, how much of it was not 
used for her. 
MS MBANJWA:   And the question, Chair, is irrelevant 
because the issue here is it has not been contested that 
20 
she received the money …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please sit down, Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   So what is the relevance? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please sit down, carry on, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So just to return, if we 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 223 of 310 
 
looked at your bank statements after you received the 
886 000 from the transferring attorneys on the Bedfordview 
house, would we b e able to see what you paid to benefit 
our mother? 
MS MEMELA:   The problem now Chair is that I cannot 
really give a direct answer there to say okay, you will see 
that this was bought, this paid a specialist, this went to 
there and this went to that, you understand?  Because 
remember, other than this deposit and other than the 
money for the sale of the land I have always been a 
10 
breadwinner at home and I am not sure how then I am 
expected 
because 
during 
that 
time 
there 
was 
no 
expectation that one day I will come to the Commission and 
explain that okay, out of this how much then you mom has 
got this, how much was it sent to her and stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But …[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   But the bank statement, Chair, sorry, the 
bank statement, I doubt that it will say okay, you swiped 
for the tiles, you swiped for cement, you swiped for – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, Ms Memela, if the 2.5 million was 
20 
actually for your mom because my understanding from your 
evidence last time was that your mom was giving you a 
loan. 
MS MEMELA:   No, a donation, not a loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the donation, ja. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 224 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I may have I misunderstood.  
Okay.  Now – and that she was doing so to enable you to 
…[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   Buy the land. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To acquire property. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if all you needed for purposes of 
acquiring the property was 1.5 why did you not give her the 
balance and then she would decide what she does with it?  
10 
Why did you decide to be the one to buy whatever to 
renovate the house, rather then give the money to her 
because it was her money. 
MS MEMELA:   It was her money, Chair, but remember 
also in her affidavit she did say that she was going to help 
me to buy – I think it is the deed of sale – to help me buy 
the land, right?  So I do not know if the Chair was 
expecting me to take the money and then give it back to 
her [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was thinking if she – if this was her 
20 
money, 2.5, because Mr Ndzeku bought land from her. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she wanted to assist you to acquire 
property and you did not need the whole 2.5, you needed 
1.5.  I expected that she would give you 1.5 and keep the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 225 of 310 
 
balance and if for whatever practical reasons the 2.5 came 
to you. Once you had deducted the 1.5 you would then say 
Mom, here is the balance, I have taken the money that I 
need for the house. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, remember there the reason why she 
was selling the land was to help me buy the land in Cove 
Ridge which was worth 2.8..   
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was worth? 
MS MEMELA:   2.8 in Cove Ridge.  And then, as I say that 
then I changed in 2016, I decided okay, I am going to use 
10 
this money to pay the deposit of 1.5 that was needed by 
the bank for the Bedfordview.  So all I was saying to Ms 
Hofmeyr is that when she says okay, that 2.5 was put there 
it as if – I was saying it is as the whole 2.5 was put 
towards the – for part of the Bedfordview and it was 
actually that decision.  Like she does not – she no longer 
refers to Cove Ridge but she says okay, because she has 
already asked me about that the last time [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I said I would later come to it. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   She just wants to focus on Bedfordview.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So …[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   So I am saying, Chair, from the bank 
statement, I do not know if – I will ask my lawyer, I do not 
know if I should say I will then go to the bank because – 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 226 of 310 
 
but I cannot promise that okay, it will – the bank statement 
will say okay, this is what you swiped for, then it will 
explain what did I buy, what did I do, like what is it that I 
buy for my mother. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are saying that the whole R2.5 
million your mom gave it to you as a donation. 
MS MEMELA:   She was helping me with the deposit, 1.5.  
She helped me with the deposit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was it donation or was it a loan? 
MS MEMELA:   It was a donation, Chair, it was not a loan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The donation being 2.5 of the donation 
being 1.5? 
MS MEMELA:   No that I had a change of heart to buy the 
Bedfordview house it was 1.5.  Then after …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when she gave it to you initially, was 
she giving you a donation of 2.5? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, she was going to give me the donation 
of 2.5 for the Cove Ridge house – for the Cove Ridge land, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and she gave you that? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, she was going to give me that but 
remember, it was cancelled, the Cove Ridge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then later on you decided to use 
only 1.5? 
MS MEMELA:   Only 1.5. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 227 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the donation to you was the entire 
1.5 million? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, for Cove Ridge because it was 2.8, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And just back to the Chair’s question, at 
no point when you received – I made an error earlier, it 
was not 886 000 and it was 862 376.75 after the sale of 
the Bedfordview house.  You did not feel that you should 
go back to your mother and say let me give you back 
826 000 which I did not need to use because I ended up 
10 
getting the Bedfordview house and not the Cove Ridge 
transaction.  You did not do that. 
MS MEMELA:   So you are saying I did not help my mother 
out of this 800 …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I am saying you did go back to her 
and say I have only used 1.5, let me give you the 
remainder. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, Chair, I am trying to understand, that 
you are expecting me to go to …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I am asking whether you did.  Did 
20 
you go to her and say I have only used 1.5 let me give you 
back the 862 000 that remains.  You did not do that. 
MS MEMELA:   No, like if – I did not go back and say okay, 
let me give you the remainder, I just continuing paying for 
certain things that she needed like – as I always did 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 228 of 310 
 
without 2.5 or 1.5 before. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you recall that you invested 250 000 
of it? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Do you – we will go to some of the 
other things you did with the money in a moment but let us 
go to Cove Ridge because it is an important part of this, 
Chair and it is really the last part that I would like to focus 
on for the afternoon.  Because, Ms Memela, in fairness to 
you we had evidence with Mr Ndzeku in which in the end 
10 
he conceded that the sale agreement was a fraud.  You 
heard his evidence, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is what he said. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  I am going to put it you this 
afternoon that the Cove Ridge transaction was also a 
fraud. 
MS MEMELA:   I do not agree. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not agree. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let me take you through why I put that 
20 
to you. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So you entered into the Cove 
Ridge agreement, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 229 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When was that?   
MS MEMELA:   I think it was 2015.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Early 2015. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   April 2015. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us go to it.  You will find it in 
EXHIBIT DD25A at page 370.  Three seven zero, 370.  Is 
that the Cove Ridge deed of sale? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that is the one. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is the one we looked at briefly in 
your evidence previously. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were buying this property from 
Slipknot Investments, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Ms Yake Kwinana was a director of 
Slipknot Investments at the time, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I agree to that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you signed the agreement with her, 
20 
is that right? 
MS MEMELA:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it appears as though this agreement 
was signed on the 21 April 2015.  You will find that at page 
373, is that right? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 230 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you confirm that you did sign it on 
that day? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, let me check quickly?  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Your evidence previously was that 
you had signed this at the offices of Ms Mbanjwa, is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Because Ms Mbanjwa at the time 
was Ms Kwinana’s lawyer, is that correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Ms Mbanjwa put this agreement 
together, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Now do you remember what had 
happened two months before that in February of 2015 in 
relation to property acquisitions that you were entering 
into? 
MS MEMELA:   Property acquisitions? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.   
20 
MS MEMELA:   Do I remember…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   February 2015, did you purchase any 
property then?  
MS MEMELA: February 2015?  No, I do not remember.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember putting in an offer on 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 231 of 310 
 
a property is Race View? 
MS MEMELA:   Race View?  Where is Race View?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am not sure where Race View is, your 
offer to purchase just says Race View. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, where is the offer to purchase. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let me ask first, do you remember 
putting in an offer to buy a property in Race View in 
February 2015? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not remember.  Okay, let us go 
10 
to it.  You will find it in BB25C. 
MS MEMELA:   The page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The page is 1123.  You will see it is not 
an excellent copy, Chair, this is the best version of the 
copy that the Commission has been able to obtain.  The 
parties, you will see they are – sorry, it is letter Truda and 
Benjamin John – I cannot even quite read the name of the 
sellers.  Maybe it will be clearer later.  Truter, Truter.  And 
you and your husband are the purchasers, are you not? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, I see the thing, yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, where does that appear? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you see just a little bit down, it is 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 232 of 310 
 
about 
the 
fifth 
line, 
Chair, 
the 
undersigned 
it 
says 
Nontsasa A Memela, Vumile(?) Memela, of 6 Jonker 
Crescent, Elandspark, Johannesburg, 2197.  Do you see 
that, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that at page 1123? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, 1123.  You will see there is first 
line that says To, do you have that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then there is a line that starts Of… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then two lines further down it says I 
think it is supposed to be: 
“We, the undersigned…” 
And then you will see written in there is: 
“Nontsasa A Memela, Vumile Memela” 
Do you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, ja.  Yes, now I see that, yes. 
MS MEMELA:   They are the purchasers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before Jonker Crescent? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Exactly, exactly, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   so can you confirm at the time you were 
living in Jonker Crescent, Elandspark, Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and you put in this offer to 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 233 of 310 
 
purchase a property described as Freehold Stand 6 in 
Township Race View.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it is an offer to purchase for 1.4 
million.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Does this job your memory. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, it does remind me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so you were putting in an offer to 
purchase in February of 2015 with your husband to buy a 
10 
property in Race View for 1.4 million, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that is two months before you 
conclude 
the 
Slipknot 
agreement 
with 
Ms 
Kwinana, 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  What happened to this property? 
MS MEMELA:   I did not go through. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why not? 
MS MEMELA:   I explained, remember, that in 2015 there 
20 
was difficulty in terms of the bank, they were not really 
approving a hundred percent or sometimes they would 
decline based on reasons put by them.  So I kept on trying 
and kept on trying, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you had applied for a bond for this 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 234 of 310 
 
property, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it was decline by the bank, is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So they decline a bond for 1.4 million, is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And they did that the next month in 
March of 2015.  Do you recall that? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   I see the letter here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you put an offer to purchase in 
February 2015, the bank will not give you a bond of 1.4 
million in March 2015, correct?  
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then in April of 2015 you commit 
yourself to 2.8 million that you are going to pay to Ms 
Kwinana’s company Slipknot. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where were you going to get that 2.8 
million? 
MS MEMELA:   Remember the land that was sold in 
Mpindweni was going to help me with. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 235 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, the land sold in Mpindweni happens 
later in 2015. 
MS MEMELA:  No, no, remember, the – my mom was going 
to help you, as I told you – my mom was going to help with 
the purchase of the land in Cove Ridge, right, which took 
longer to be finalised because the proclamation was not in 
place by then.  So the 2.5 was going to go to that land and 
we were going to only go to the banks just for R300 000.  
So like that was the understanding back then. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, you were not going to go to the bank 
10 
for 
300 000, 
I 
think 
you 
are 
getting 
the 
property 
transactions confused.  Remember, in April 2015 you agree 
with Ms Kwinana that you are going to pay outright R2.8 
million.  There was no deposit, nothing. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There was no bond either, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   There is no bond, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you entered into that agreement 
20 
with Ms Kwinana when the month before you did not have 
1.4 million and the bank would not give you a bond for 1.4 
million, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  But I knew that my mom was going to 
sell the land. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 236 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How did you know that she was going to 
sell the land? 
MS MEMELA:   We spoke. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But she did not have a purchaser at the 
time, did she? 
MS MEMELA:   She…?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did not have a purchaser. 
MS MEMELA:   No of course she did not but she was 
looking for the purchase, she was already looking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela, Ms Memela, are you saying 
10 
that when the previous month you did not have 1.4 and the 
bank declined your bond application you made an offer for 
a property that would require 2.8 million about – that is 
about more than an extra million. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   More than an extra million. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is double actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is double. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, double.  Double, simply because you 
20 
were hoping that your mother would get somebody to buy 
the property. 
MS MEMELA:   She was already looking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you make a firm offer on the basis of 
that hope, when there was no purchaser? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 237 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   There was no purchaser yet but she was 
already looking for the purchaser, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Ms Memela, you cannot make an 
offer, a serious offer on the basis of money that you do not 
have and you have not guarantee you are going to have. 
MS MEMELA:   You can make an offer, Chair, if you know 
that you are hoping to get …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did – in the offer did you say 
10 
conditional 
upon 
my 
mother 
being 
able 
to 
sell 
the 
property? 
MS MEMELA:   No, no, there was no such condition in the 
offer and Ms Hofmeyr asked about this during my testimony 
and she went as far as saying there was no provision that 
identifies …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on a second.  Ms Mbanjwa, 
what is the story? 
MS MBANJWA:   [indistinct – off mic] and this document is 
– on page 371, that is the Cove Ridge thing, she says that 
20 
these are going to be attached because there is no 
mention of a bond.  There is nothing in that document 
saying that that was going to be cash payment(?).  I am 
just correcting that for the  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Just to be clear, I did not say cash, I 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 238 of 310 
 
said it was an outright... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...offer to purchase for 2.8 million but 
made no reference to a deposit or a bond.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   
MS MBANJWA:   Yes but I would beg, Chair, I know that 
there is a rush to finalise but what I would beg for is, if 
there is a document because that is just standard law, if 
there is a written document, that document is the evidence 
10 
of what it is supposed to be.  There is no basis for Ms 
Hofmeyr or even myself to go further and say this is what 
this document meant.  If that document does not give – 
does not say [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please sit down, Ms Mbanjwa, please sit 
down.  Let us have some progress please. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr, please continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  You were probing the 
circumstances in which …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...Ms Memela could commit to 2.8 million 
in a property transaction with Ms Kwinana when the 
previous month she did not have 1.4 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were still answering that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 239 of 310 
 
question. 
MS MEMELA:   I was still answering that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   I am surprised that this offer to purchase is 
here but others are not here just to prove as to how many 
times I kept on trying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Ms Memela, if you make an offer to 
somebody selling a property to say you are going to buy 
the property for a certain amount and you do not indicate 
in the agreement that that is dependent upon some other 
10 
transaction, you are creating the impression to the seller 
that you have got the money. 
MS MEMELA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are.  Otherwise, why should he or 
she take your offer seriously? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, I think I explained this last time but I 
will try and be as short as possible.  That land in Cove 
Ridge still had certain processes to follow so I knew it was 
going to – I was informed that it was going to take longer 
to be proclaimed or whatever processes that needed to be 
20 
followed and I can tell you now even to this date it has not.  
So not putting the condition or maybe the provision that 
says okay, I am going to go to the bank and get the bond 
or maybe I am going to get the money from here to pay, it 
was neither here nor there because it was – we knew that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 240 of 310 
 
it was going to take longer …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you …[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   That is why the seller actually allowed me 
to cancel when it took longer and commit to something 
else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, Ms Memela, are you saying to me it 
is in order for somebody to offer somebody who is selling a 
house – to make an offer to buy the house for an amount 
that they cannot afford as at that time and they are making 
that offer on the basis that they might get the money if 
10 
some other transaction happens without disclosing that 
that is the condition, you say that is proper? 
MS MEMELA:   That is proper, Chair, especially if you – 
like the buyer and the seller have the same understanding.  
And, Chair, remember, the fact that this application was 
declined in March, because this process was going to take 
longer, the proclamation and all.  So remember, the bank 
gives you six months to actually go back and approach 
them for the bond.  So there was that also possibly of 
option to approach the bank maybe after six months or so.  
20 
But the fact that it is not there that okay, we will get the 
bond, it does not mean it is not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  I just want to ask 
about this Slipknot agreement, one other factor in it.  Did 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 241 of 310 
 
you discuss it with your husband? 
MS MEMELA:   Can you back there? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The Slipknot agreement, it is at page 
371 in EXHIBIT DD25A. 
MS MEMELA:   371? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I think you might be in the wrong 
file, you need to be in DD25A, Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, I get it.  So you are asking me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am asking you whether you discussed 
this agreement with your husband. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What is your marital regime? 
MS MEMELA:   Now, Chair, that would be a personal issue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What marital regime you are married 
under? 
MS MEMELA:   That is a personal issue now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is the position not, Ms Memela, that 
depending on your marital regime you may not make a 
20 
valid offer without the consent of the other …[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   No, Chair, there are a lot of things that I 
have bought without my husband’s …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MEMELA:   There are a lot of things that I have bought 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 242 of 310 
 
without 
my 
husband’s 
consent 
including 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the Matrimonial Property Act says 
you cannot buy property without the consent of your 
husband if you are married in or community-of-property, 
does not say …[intervenes] 
MS MEMELA:   Also the car is my - is a property that I 
bought it myself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, transactions governed by the 
Alienation of Land Act.  Ms Memela, let us just get the 
10 
facts, are you married in or community-of-property with 
husband? 
MS MEMELA:   I am married according to customary law. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, my apologies, I am not aware of 
this provision, before this version is put to the witness I 
wanted to make – to get the version that says you cannot 
sign an offer to purchase property if you are married in or 
community-of-property without the other party signing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Section 15(2)(g) of the Matrimonial 
Property Act.  I will come back to it in a moment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is very logical, Ms Mbanjwa, it cannot 
be married to you in or community-of-property and you go 
and get involved in huge debts without my consent 
because it will affect me. 
MS MBANJWA:   But, Chair, I will address this as a legal 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 243 of 310 
 
issue.  The conclusion that is listed here is incorrect and 
the witness, it is a legal question.  I will address it in re-
examination.  The legal …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MBANJWA:   Because it does not make the offer 
invalid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will deal with it later on, Ms 
Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, I will deal with it, indeed, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So is your evidence that you are not 
10 
married in or community-of-property to your husband? 
MS MEMELA:   I am married in or community-of-property 
because all customary marriages fall under or community-
of-property. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so that is why when you have to 
give a FICA declaration to the transferring attorneys on 
your Bedfordview house you indicated that you were 
married in or community-of-property, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, we were buying that house together, 
remember? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you have to buy it together by law.  
That is what is unusual about the Slipknot Investment 
property acquisition. 
MS 
MEMELA: 
 
 
That 
is 
not 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 244 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because you cannot purchase that 
property legally, Ms Memela, without your husband’s 
consent.  Do you agree? 
MS MEMELA:   We will argue that later.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, what is your understanding of the 
law, can you enter into a property transaction governed by 
the Alienation of Land Act without your husband’s consent 
to whom you are married in community of property? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I am not going to – what – entertain 
that question right now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your position ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   It is a question that is looking into 
disregarding ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your understanding, let us talk about 
your understanding, is your understanding that you can 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   I have bought a property with my husband. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, with his consent. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly where we signed together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   And then we signed other pages together 
but there are certain of that pages that was signed by me 
alone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it is the – sorry Chair – the question 
is 
your 
understanding 
of 
the 
law, 
right, 
is 
it 
your 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 245 of 310 
 
understanding of the law that you could enter into the 
Slipknot investment to buy a property for R2.8million 
without your husband’s consent? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, remember the contract can be 
amended at any time Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela we went through this last 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair I don’t want to be impertinent, I 
have a copy of the Alienation of Land Act here.  There is 
10 
nothing that talks even about the community, if they are 
married in community of property, that’s why I said can Ms 
Hofmeyr please, because she is saying that can you sign 
an offer to purchase alone if you are married in community 
of property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will re-examine her ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   But this thing is going on record Your 
Worship and I wanted it to be said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Mbanjwa whatever answer the 
witness gives when you get a chance you can re-examine 
20 
her to get – to give a different picture. 
MS MBANJWA:   May I humbly ask that the witness must 
not be badgered with legal questions if those legal 
questions are not going to be correct because she is 
obliged to answer and I am also searching for the section, 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 246 of 310 
 
I cannot find this section, otherwise it is unfair cross-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Ms Hofmeyr has asked whatever 
she wanted to ask on that ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   But I need to put it on record Your 
Worship that this reference to the Alienation of Land Act is 
incorrect because there is no such provision in the 
Alienation of Land Act. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair can we refer to the Alienation of 
Land Act. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you re-examine you can raise that.   
Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   We have put it on record, we are fine, we 
are fine Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So your evidence is you 
didn’t discuss the Slipknot transaction with your husband is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   No I didn’t. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you say in your evidence that you 
20 
concluded it in April of 2015 and you signed with Ms 
Kwinana at Ms Mbanjwa’s offices, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you were the purchaser under this 
agreement, is that right? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 247 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know what the Financial 
Intelligence Centre Act requires of attorneys who are 
appointed as the conveyancers under agreements of this 
nature in terms of the information they have to get from the 
parties to the agreement. 
MS MEMELA:   Please tell me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No do you know the requirements? 
MS MEMELA:   No, that’s why I am saying tell me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You don’t know. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There are certain details of the client 
that need to be obtained, it is information like what is your 
property regime, where do you live, you need to provide a 
proof of residence etcetera, are you aware of that at all? 
MS MEMELA:   Are you talking about the ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   The FICA form, ja that is the Financial 
Intelligence Centre Act. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, no I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Are you aware of Ms Mbanjwa asking 
20 
you for that when you concluded the sale agreement at her 
offices in April of 2015? 
MS MEMELA:   No I don’t remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember ever giving her a FICA 
document containing your information? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 248 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   No I don’t remember, but she always say 
the deed of sales they differ from one to the other, 
sometimes some lawyers, not just Ms Mbanjwa, some 
lawyers will ask for those, I remember it is just the forms at 
the end of the agreement, where people fill in the details, 
but there is – I am not sure if Ms Hofmeyr is trying to say if 
those are not provided it makes the deed of sale invalid. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No I am not suggesting that at all, I am 
asking about your knowledge of the FICA requirement that 
an attorney that is regulated by FICA must get information 
10 
related to the client when she is the conveyancing attorney 
for a transaction, and you have said you don’t know about 
those requirements. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, and you told me so I have just asked 
if it makes it invalid and you said no that is not what you 
are suggesting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, so you don’t recall giving Ms 
Mbanjwa a FICA client take-on sheet in relation to the 
transactions.  
MS MEMELA:    No I don’t.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let me take you to the one that Ms 
Mbanjwa provided to the Commission which contains your 
information.  You will find it in Exhibit DD25C. 
MS MEMELA:   DD? 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair just a point of correction, I work as 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 249 of 310 
 
an attorney in an office with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa you can correct during re-
examination. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want us to make progress, you keep on 
standing up all the time, you are hampering progress. 
MS MEMELA:   Give me the page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, it is towards the end, you will find 
it starting at page 1129. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that under 25A? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   25C Chair apologies, we have to go back 
to C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is the page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   1129, it is right towards the end, 1129. 
MS MEMELA:   Which bundle Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   25C.  And so what you see at page 1129 
Ms Memela is the response from Ms Mbanjwa to a 
subpoena or a summons under the auspices of the 
commission to which she was responding, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   I see that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And she indicates what documents are 
attached. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   There is the deed of sales which is the 
Slipknot Investment agreement that we have been looking 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 250 of 310 
 
at and then at page 1135 there’s the client take-on sheet in 
relation to this, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that not a document that you recall? 
MS MEMELA:   Which page are we going to? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   1135. 
MS MEMELA:   1135.  Okay my details are here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you said you didn’t recall giving Ms 
Mbanjwa a client take-on form, do you now remember it? 
MS MEMELA:   But Chair saying I do not recall does not 
10 
mean you’re saying – you’re denying it, I just said I do not 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no Ms Hofmeyr knows that, she does 
know that. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you now remember? 
MS MEMELA:   Now I remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you fill it out, is this your 
handwriting? 
MS MEMELA:   No this is not my handwriting. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at the bottom there, there seems to 
be a signature, is that your signature? 
MS MEMELA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So have you seen this document before? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I wouldn’t remember because it is 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 251 of 310 
 
something that happened in 2015, because now I can see 
also my ID that was applicable at that time which is – it 
was the ID. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you don’t have a recollection of this? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, but these are my details. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, and what is interesting about what 
you just said is that this was something that happened in 
2015, you see that’s also what I would have thought, 
10 
because you entered into the Slipknot agreement in April of 
2015 didn’t you? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes it was signed in 2015. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, but I am just saying the ID that I was 
using in 2015/2016 I think I started having only a card in 
2017 or something, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see the FICA requirements are that 
the conveyancing attorney who is identified in the property 
agreement must get this information from the client, so 
20 
they do what is called client take-on sheets, do you see 
that at page 1135, yes.  This client take-on sheet was 
concluded in 2016 though, not in 2015 when you entered 
into the Slipknot agreement, was it? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, but is there something in that FICA that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 252 of 310 
 
you are quoting that says okay the personal client take-o 
sheet should be signed at the same date? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well it is when you take on the client, 
hence the name. 
MS MEMELA:   But what if the client was Ms Jackie 
Kwinana, she has always been her client and then I was 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No you are the purchaser.   
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you need to get the information from 
10 
both parties. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, but I am just asking again does the 
FICA Act that you are referring to say it should be signed i 
the same day.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   When you take on the client.   
MS MEMELA:   I understand that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if you were taken on as a client 
because you concluded the Slipknot agreement in April of 
2015 you would have expected there to be a client take on 
sheet i 2015 wouldn’t you? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I don’t know if I would remember 
properly, but I know that a certain, I don’t if it was the 
Bedfordview one or maybe other offer to purchase where 
you would be called in maybe later on when they wanted to 
do their filing and stuff and say okay you know what we did 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 253 of 310 
 
not fill in this, so that’s why you hear me asking Ms 
Hofmeyr if there is any legislation that says it should be 
done in the same day.   So sometimes it is done later, 
afterwards, because what is important is the deed of sale 
that has been entered into. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see what’s relevant about the date 
when it was done is it is done the day after JM Aviation 
paid the R2.5million to Ms Mbanjwa, it wasn’t done back in 
April 2015 when you concluded the agreement with Ms 
Kwinana according to your evidence.  Do you accept that? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   You are saying it was done after? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   JM Aviation paid the R2.5million to Ms 
Mbanjwa. 
MS MEMELA:    I don’t know when was it.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was paid on the 5 t h of May 2016 and 
this is dated the 6 t h of May 2016, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:    I see that, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so you don’t dispute what is 
contained on this document. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That it was only prepared on the 6 t h of 
May 2016 in circumstances where you had entered into the 
Slipknot Investment in April of 2015, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So let’s just talk about what 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 254 of 310 
 
happens, you conclude the agreement in April of 2015 with 
Ms Kwinana without talking to your husband about it, 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair I am not sure if really the 
Commission now is trying to cause a dispute between 
myself and my husband because I am really trying to 
understand.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am seeking not to create marital strife, 
I am just wanting to get the chronology right.    
MS MEMELA:   Chair, Chair not in bad manner or anything 
10 
like that I am not talking for other people but I am just 
saying certain things you don’t discuss, you just say okay 
we are going to do that, I am going to invest in that and 
whatever.  I even mentioned the last time that investment 
has always been my thing, especially in property.  When I 
bought – when we bought a home in Fourways in 2007 we 
also bought flats in Bloemfontein for the students and now 
I am going back to what Ms Hofmeyr is saying it’s okay you 
can’t buy this when you just bought that so my worry now 
is that ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we are going to get ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   ...I will get a call or my husband I will find 
my husband not talking to me because of these questions 
and then maybe I will be handed divorce papers because of 
this kind of question and that is what my understanding of 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 255 of 310 
 
the Commission were ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But the problem is that if ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:    ...and now you are cause dispute with my 
family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The problem is that we are going to 
waste time if you don’t answer a straightforward question, 
if it is relevant it has got to be answered. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see I want to put it to you I said that 
10 
I was going to deal with the Slipknot investment and put to 
you that it was not a genuine agreement and what I am 
going through are the various indicators that I will put to 
you show that it was not a genuine agreement, and that is 
why I raised the question of the marital regime under which 
you were married and your husband’s role because the 
other agreements that we have seen Ms Memela where you 
purchased property ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   All of them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The ones we have seen yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, Raceview, Bedfordview etcetera. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is you and Mr Memela who jointly 
purchased the property, right.  This stands out because it 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 256 of 310 
 
is the one where he doesn’t join you in purchasing the 
property, do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:   But did the purchase go through? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No it is about whether you can validly 
make the offer, he didn’t join you?  
MS MEMELA:   Okay we talk about ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, in making that offer did he? 
MS MEMELA:   His signature is not there ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and the second feature is that you 
didn’t fill out a client take-on form at the time that you 
10 
entered 
into 
that 
agreement, 
despite 
being 
at 
Ms 
Mbanjwa’s offices.  The only time that was filled out for 
you was a whole year later only after you got the JM 
Aviation money, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair that is what I just explained that 
many law firms, in fact many conveyancers are not a 
conveyancer but sometimes they will call you later on to 
take your details and fill in that form so I even asked Ms 
Hofmeyr if there is a regulation somewhere where it says 
okay this must be signed or filled in at the same day 
20 
otherwise it makes it invalid and she said that is not what 
she is suggesting.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   No it was slightly different.  You were 
asking me whether the fact that you didn’t fill it out 
invalidated the agreement, and I said that is not the case. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 257 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But FICA requires the person governed 
by FICA to get that information from you before a 
transaction takes place and we will argue in due course 
Chair that the conclusion of that sale agreement created 
those obligations for the conveyancing attorney, who was 
Ms Mbanjwa and that it is relevant that no client take-on 
sheet was completed then, it was only completed the day 
after the JM Aviation money came into Ms Mbanjwa’s trust 
account. 
10 
 
But let’s move on then to ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   With your permission can I make just one 
clarification.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you want to make what? 
MS MBANJWA:   Just one comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but why are you not reserving that 
comment for your re-examination? 
MS MBANJWA:   No it is because Ms Hofmeyr is arguing 
on a wrong understanding of ...[indistinct – not speaking 
into mic] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No you can deal with that later, please 
sit Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so we have moved from April of 
2015, right when you conclude the Slipknot agreement with 
Ms Kwinana and I want to now move to February of 2016, 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 258 of 310 
 
okay.   Because in February 2016 you owe Ms Kwinana 
R2.8million in accordance with the Slipknot Investments 
agreement, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t – okay I corrected this in February, I 
don’t owe because it was not transferred to me yet, we 
were still waiting for the proclamation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where does the Slipknot agreement talk 
about a proclamation? 
MS MEMELA:   It does not talk about that but I mean that’s 
what was happening and I believe that if you need those 
10 
documentation to be provided to the Commission they 
could be found. 
ADV HOFMEYR:    What proclamation was it?    
MS MEMELA:   You may explain Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are the one giving evidence, please 
tell us what proclamation was required? 
MS MEMELA:   I said like I mean there are processes 
Chair to put the land into ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   ...[Indistinct] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair if I could just request that Ms 
20 
Memela not seek an answer from her legal representative, I 
would like Ms Memela to give us the evidence about the 
proclamation.  What proclamation was required? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair the problem is that Ms Mbanjwa here 
is a conveyancer, remember I was just a buyer, not a 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 259 of 310 
 
conveyancer so she would understand those details. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
but 
you 
cannot 
ask 
for 
her 
assistance while you are giving evidence. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must give evidence on what you 
know. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
What 
did 
you 
understand 
the 
proclamation to be?   
MS MEMELA:   Okay the proclamation would be where the 
land is now measured or sized or whatever the process 
10 
that is done to make sure that the land is now ready to be 
handed over to – for sale or whatever. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it was perfectly described in the 
Slipknot agreement, it was portion 11 of farm A 925, Cove 
Ridge, 
East 
London, 
so 
what 
else 
had 
to 
happen?   
Measuring 8.5 hectares, what else had to happen? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair let me not answer something 
that I am not sure of, then my lawyer is going to cover that 
and will explain better. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No your lawyer unfortunately Ms Memela 
20 
cannot give evidence in this Commission.   Only you can.   
You have told us that this agreement was subject to some 
proclamation that was going to happen. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you are unable to tell us what that 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 260 of 310 
 
proclamation is, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   But remember the proclamation part is 
something that is an explanation that should come from the 
seller.  What was explained to me was that that was what 
is going to happen and that is why when I approached her 
with regards to okay, I think now I want to buy from 
...[indistinct], she was okay because she said this thing is 
taking longer than we expected.  Ms Kwinana and her 
husband they are developers, estate developers for quite 
some time, so I trusted her ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you are talking about zoning and 
rezoning. 
MS MEMELA:   I think it is rezoning or something ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you see Ms Memela the reason you 
raised the proclamation is because I said to you in 
February 2016 you owed Ms Kwinana R2.8million and you 
don’t because there was some proclamation that had to 
happen, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, and I am still saying it now that you 
cannot say you owe somebody if the plan has not been 
20 
transferred to you yet. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No you pay and then it is transferred Ms 
Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes I know but remember you pay and 
while you are paying they are – you pay and then the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 261 of 310 
 
money gets into the account it does not get transferred to 
the seller until all the documentation and all the procedure 
has been put in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No Ms Memela. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It doesn’t seem to make sense to say 
you don’t owe the seller until the property is transferred 
because you need to pay the purchase price before the 
property is transferred, you see, so when your answer is 
you did not owe her because the property had not been 
10 
transferred that doesn’t make sense, you understand. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes it does not make sense for you but our 
understanding and arrangement makes sense for us.  I did 
not owe her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there an arrangement between the 
two of you that you would only pay ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Yes that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you would only pay ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Once the rezoning ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   After the property has been transferred? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   No, after ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The property will be transferred first? 
MS MEMELA:   No we will only pay once that process that I 
am talking about has been finalised, which still has not 
been finalised. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 262 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The rezoning? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well I think it’s a proclamation, I don’t 
Ms Memela in fairness knows what the process was. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You don’t know? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, but in February 2018 – sorry 
2016, you nonetheless entered into the offer to purchase 
on the Bedfordview house, correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Correct. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Which 
committed 
you 
to 
paying 
R3.8million, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so in February 2016 you had 
liabilities for R2.8million and R3.8million which totalled 
R6.6million, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   No, the liability was only applicable for the 
Bedfordview house. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so because you don’t understand 
20 
the Slipknot investment creating any liability for you is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Because when discussed with the seller it 
was understood that because it is taking longer then I can 
actually move onto another option, so there were no double 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 263 of 310 
 
liability and Chair I have already addressed this in Feb 
when I was here for testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja well if clarification is sought there 
will be questions Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so that’s February 2016, did you 
speak to Ms Kwinana then about getting out of it when you 
had concluded the Bedfordview contract. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes I think we discussed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then why did you only cancel Cove 
10 
Ridge later in May. 
MS MEMELA:    Why did I only cancel later in May.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mmm. 
MS MEMELA:   Because I think that was the amount that 
was going to – as deposit towards Bedfordview happened 
in May. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
No 
you 
committed 
yourself 
to 
R3.8million in February of 2016.   Your evidence has just 
been that because of that commitment you went back to Ms 
Kwinana, correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   No, 3.8 Chair the bank did not approve the 
whole 3.8, it just stated the full amount of the house at that 
time, then the bank insisted on the deposit, so committing 
to the full 3.8 I am not sure I follow your question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela when you make an offer to 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 264 of 310 
 
purchase you accept that you commit to pay the purchase 
price. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, that’s what you did in February of 
2016, correct. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, through the bond.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at the same time you had a liability 
of 2.8 under the Slipknot agreement, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, in terms of that agreement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and you spoke to Ms Kwinana at 
10 
the time you said. 
MS MEMELA:   Correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But then why do you want till May to 
cancel the agreement with Ms Kwinana? 
MS MEMELA:   Because I wanted to make sure I guess 
that I will have the deposit that is needed by the bank for 
Bedfordview. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and where did that money come 
from?   
MS MEMELA:   The what? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   For the deposit? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay that is the one that Mr Ndzeku bought 
the land from ...[indistinct] R1.5 ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Total R2.5 of which 1.5 was used. 
MS MEMELA:   1.5 went to the deposit ja. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 265 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you see that is the timing that is 
important Ms Memela for what I am going to put to you 
today, right, because it is only upon receipt of the money 
from Ms – JM Aviation that you then two days later go and 
cancel the agreement with Ms Kwinana, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what happens in the chronology is 
the R2.5million comes into Ms Mbanjwa’s trust account and 
then the next day she obtains that client information sheet 
from you, we saw that that’s the 6 t h of May 2016 and then 
10 
the next day you go and cancel the agreement with Ms 
Kwinana is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Right, 
let 
us 
just 
look 
at 
that 
cancellation if we may, it is in DD25A at page 397. 
MS MEMELA:   What page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   397. 
MS MEMELA:   DD25A? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s talk all of us about the way 
forward.  We are at five past five, I would have liked that 
we try and finish today but I will have challenges beyond 
six, so let’s talk a little bit about that.   How much more 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 266 of 310 
 
time do you think you need before you ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have one more issue on the Slipknot 
investment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
AD HOFMEYR:   Then I will put certain matters to Ms 
Memela and then I want to deal on one aspect on the GP 
use. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe 15 minutes? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe 20.  Ms Mbanjwa I would have 
10 
liked us to continue beyond six o’clock in order to try and 
finish but I am going to – I am not going to be able to go 
beyond six o’clock.  Should we work on the basis that once 
Ms Hofmeyr has finished we just arrange for you and Ms 
Memela to come back for re-examination on another day or 
shall we use whatever time is left after Ms Hofmeyr has 
finished and then if – and then she will come back, Ms 
Memela will come back some other time anyway. 
MS MBANJWA:   Actually, Chair there will be no time, Ms 
Hofmeyr will not ...[indistinct]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MBANJWA:   There won’t be time, Ms Hofmeyr won’t 
finish because – so I am not worried, but then the second 
point which I want to address the fact that I now have to 
bring that application for the two hours to be extended and 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 267 of 310 
 
I will give the reasons in the application.  I can quickly 
enumerate them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no don’t give them now. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, so I will have and I can just say 
what also concerns me is the fact that, and this I strongly 
note, is the fact that the law is not read properly and legal 
questions which are incorrect are put to the witness so 
what we are going to do, one of the things we have to do, 
why we need that, is to just deal with the law, purely with 
the correct law and then also deal of course with the re-
10 
examination, so definitely the two hours won’t be enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright so I think we – I think what 
you are saying is for today you accept that you want to do 
re-examination another – we will have to look at another 
time.   Okay, I think Ms Hofmeyr continue, but try and 
finish within your 20 minutes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course, thank you Chair, I really am 
indebted.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS HOFMEYR:   Right we were at 397 of DD25A, that is 
20 
the cancellation letter, is that correct?  Ms Memela if you 
will just turn on your microphone, it has gone off. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, that is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it reflects the date of the 7 t h of May 
2016, is that correct? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 268 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that the date on which you agreed 
with Ms Kwinana to cancel the Slipknot sale? 
MS MEMELA:   I think Chair we agreed verbally, then in 
writing it was put later on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and there seems to be something 
written by Ms Kwinana at the bottom there, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes that is Ms Kwinana’s handwriting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what does it say? 
MS MEMELA:   Dear Mlindi, please action as per the above 
10 
letter. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And who is that Mlindi referring to?   
MS MEMELA:   Her lawyer. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So is this the instruction that was then 
given to Ms Mbanjwa in relation to the ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   I think so yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you think so or do you know, just so 
that I can be clear. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Okay yes that was the instruction.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and was it given on the 7 t h of May 
as it is indicated at the bottom there. 
MS MEMELA:   It is written 7 May but I am saying in terms 
of agreement Chair it would have been done verbally but in 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 269 of 310 
 
writing later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought that was 2 May. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think it’s 07 with a line Chair because 
of the date, is that correct Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:   It looks – remember – ja I said I am not a 
handwriting expert. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes no that is true. 
MS MEMELA:   But it looks like 07. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay and that is when the notification 
went to Ms Mbanjwa is that correct, from Ms Kwinana? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, now on the client take on sheet that 
was 
completed 
the 
day 
before 
which 
we 
looked 
at 
previously in Exhibit DD25C, page 1135, you will see right 
at the bottom there’s another detail indicated there which 
is cancelled transfer, do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Cancelled transfer, okay yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and that was completed the day 
before on the 6 t h of May. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How could Ms Mbanjwa have known 
about the cancellation if she had not yet received the 
notification that came the next day. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 270 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   Of course they talk, like I said to Chair that 
the cancellation happened through a verbal agreement but 
the 
returned 
one 
happened 
later, 
so 
they 
used 
to 
communicate. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it was anticipating getting the written 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA: Sorry?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   It anticipated getting the written 
confirmation, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:   Because the cancellation was already 
10 
discussed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So I just want to put together then 
Ms Memela what in summary I offered to you for an 
opportunity 
to 
comment 
about 
the 
slipknot 
investment 
agreement right?  You see the agreement was concluded 
without the involvement of your husband whereas the law 
requires him to be involved in order to commit you to a 
property purchase of this nature.  Your evidence is you were 
not aware of that at the time, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  No I said I was not – I am not aware because 
20 
of the law that you are quoting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  But I said also there are certain lots of things 
that I have signed without my husband. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 271 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Property purchases? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja property purchases. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  We might want to see those in due 
course. 
MS MEMELA:  I will make them .. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Governed by the Alienation of Land Act. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja I might look for them ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then his written consent was… 
ADV MBANJWA:  My apologies but can Ms Hofmeyr because 
10 
I am convinced Ms Hofmeyr does not understand the law on 
alienation on speaker. Can she please not put this question 
to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait… 
ADV MBANJWA:  After I have explained the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will… 
ADV MBANJWA:  Because that is my difficulty now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness has given an answer and let 
us move on. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes but – but Chair that she is … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will clarify whatever you want to clarify 
in re-examination. 
ADV MBANJWA:  No Chair she cannot – Chair she cannot 
respond to any correct legal questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She has responded. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 272 of 310 
 
ADV MBANJWA:  No but Chair she cannot … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will clarify it later when you re-
examine. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Chair – Chair honestly Chair I beg thee.  A 
witness cannot be asked an incorrect legal question and ask 
to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa I am saying… 
ADV MBANJWA:  Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If she has given a wrong answer when you 
re-examine you will raise all of that. 
10 
ADV MBANJWA:  Chair I cannot 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it will be clarified. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Chair these proceedings are recorded they 
are on television. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MBANJWA:  What is happening here is Ms Hofmeyr 
does not understand the FICA Act and then what she does 
she said because of what she sees here she thinks there has 
been no compliance with the FICA Act.  She is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa.  Please. 
20 
ADV MBANJWA:  As she puts that to a witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please sit down. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please sit down. 
ADV MBANJWA:  We have recorded … 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 273 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us try and finish. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you committed Ms Memela to paying 
R2.8 million to Slipknot Investments the month after you 
were not able to raise a bond for R1.4 million with the bank, 
is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I understand that yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I understand your evidence to be you 
thought at some point your mother was going to be able to 
sell land which would enable you to purchase the property, 
correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes and also I explained also that remember 
the fact that the bank had declined the previous month 
because this was going to take longer.  Remember if the 
bank declines you can still go and approach them after six 
months. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but that would have been a bond from 
the bank, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  The bond yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And your agreement did not make any 
reference to a bond, correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  It did not make reference to cash either. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No it is a commitment to pay R2.8 million. 
MS MEMELA:  Did it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That means without securing some other 
source of funds. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 274 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  It did not say that.  We have put that to Ms 
Hofmeyr Chair that the agreement did not say – did not put 
to cash nor bond. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So what does that mean? 
MS MEMELA:  It is just like… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what did it mean? 
MS MEMELA:  It could have been either way.  For instance 
like I could have gone to the bank and get the bond after six 
months.  Because remember now she is focussing on the 
fact that the bank declined March and I am saying we could 
10 
have approached the bank after six months where they 
actually relook again at your profile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You did not have the funds available to you 
in April of 2015, did you? 
MS MEMELA:  No I did have cash. . 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you nonetheless entered into an 
agreement where you did not complete any client take on 
form for Ms Mbanjwa the conveyancing attorney at the time, 
is that correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The only time that was concluded was after 
the money came in from JM Aviation, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct and I explained to you Chair 
that sometimes does not have to be done at the same time 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 275 of 310 
 
with the agreement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela we will argue in due course. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That the series of those facts make it very 
improbable that this was a genuine agreement that was 
entered into between you and Slipknot Investments in April 
of 2015.  Do you want to respond to that? 
MS MEMELA:  Remember Ms Hofmeyr Chair that is her 
version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Chair that is her version and we will give our 
own version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But I am offering you an opportunity to 
respond to it now.  That what is what I must do because I am 
going to argue that in due course I must have your comment 
on it. 
MS MEMELA:  You saying it is improbable. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That it is a genuine agreement. 
MS MEMELA:  That is your opinion. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because of all of those features.  Do you 
accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay repeat that you said? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I said it is improbable that it was a genuine 
agreement that you entered into in April of 2015? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 276 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  It was a genuine agreement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is your answer? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  It was not something that you 
devised later when the commission started to investigate this 
matter so that you could justify the R2.5 million that you had 
received from JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  Why – why would I have to justify to the 
commission about the R2.5? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because otherwise it is a corrupt payment 
10 
that you received from a supplier to SAA Technical. 
MS MEMELA:  The payment for what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The R2.5 million. 
MS MEMELA:  The payment for what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I beg your pardon? 
MS MEMELA:  You said that I received the payment from the 
supplier and what was the payment for as you are putting it 
to me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You used that as I understand your 
evidence to purchase your Bedfordview property and then to 
20 
spend R826 000.00 after that. 
MS MEMELA:  No but – I do not know Chair if I understand 
her question correctly.  Because she said the payment was – 
payment from the supplier paying me.  So I am asking 
payment for what because she has been making conclusions 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 277 of 310 
 
that was payment for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is talking about the R2.5milliion. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes for the land but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But I am asking her now payment for what 
because she has been making conclusions that it was 
payment – their payment for benefits.  So I thought that she 
was making that statement again. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just repeat your question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies.  So it is R2.5 million. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That you benefitted from that was paid by 
JM Aviation.  Do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  My – to the land of my mother. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and you asked why would you need to 
explain it and I put it to you that you need to explain it 
because you were the Head of Procurement at SAA Technical 
at the time and to receive a payment of R2.5 million from a 
20 
supplier to SAA Technical may involve corruption. 
MS MEMELA:  How? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How – how can you ask how? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 278 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  Oh she is the one who is asking me.  Okay 
Chair.  Remember Ms Hofmeyr keeps on using you were 
Head of Procurement and I thought okay you know what as 
soon as I get a chance I need to give clarity to this as much 
as I had given clarity in February.  The way Ms Hofmeyr is 
putting this – Nontsasa Head of Procurement it is as if I had 
that kind of power to walk in – let me make an example now 
like where I met Mr Ndzeku in the workshop.  To walk in the 
workshop and say, hey guys I am Head of Procurement 
therefore everybody gets a tender.  You get a tender you see 
10 
like Oprah Winfrey… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no she means it – she means it you 
are Head of Procurement. 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Procurement you have certain powers. 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are overseeing procurement. 
MS MEMELA:  Chair that is why I explained also in February 
that there are no powers that are vested onto being HOD 
Procurement.  Like I said because like there are structures 
20 
that are followed when the tender is ready.  So I – there is 
no influence coming from the Head of Procurement that says 
– that is why I am saying being a Head of Procurement does 
not mean you are Head -  like I mean dishing out tenders.  If 
that was the case then it means I would use that power to 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 279 of 310 
 
dish out tenders to everybody including my family that is 
standard.  There is a structure that is followed in each and 
every SOE’s including SAAT that okay I even explained to 
you Chair the role of the CFST Close Functional Sourcing 
Team that they are the ones with power to evaluate, to 
adjudicate, to score the suppliers.  I do not sit on that 
evaluation.  So to say… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 Are 
there 
people 
who 
sit 
in 
these 
structures you talking about people who – who fall under 
you? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the people who sit in those structures – 
are those people – do those people fall under you? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay the – the DFST teacher is consists of 
people from different departments being the experts that 
have to talk about certain component or whatever that you 
guys are going to go out on a tender.  So they sit there and 
come up with a specification, come up with a tender 
documentation, come up – and then they do all that 
independently from me.  And then at a later stage when they 
20 
have done the short listing and scored the highest scoring 
bidder they come then to recommend to EXCO through me.  
Remember Chair you even said okay like then you are – 
actually used as I said – that is what I said.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you were the person responsible for 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 280 of 310 
 
deciding to sell the GPU’s to JM Aviation at R3.2 million 
were you not? 
MS MEMELA:  I was not the person who was responsible for 
– to decide to sell the GPU’s 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No at R3.2 million was my question Chair. 
MS MEMELA:  Even at R3.2 million I was not a person who 
was – Chair the determination of the price when it comes to 
disposal process at SAAT and it is in the SAM policy.  I 
remember I actually explained this to Ms Hofmeyr and get 
him during our interview.  That is how it works.  It does not 
10 
fall under Nontsasa to determine the price.  I even read 
Chair if you still remember but I am going to still repeat that 
during the re-examination.  I even read to you a proposal 
that was made by Jules Aire the owner of JM Aviation 
International made to the acting CEO of SAAT before even 
the board decided. So when Ms Hofmeyr puts it like that you 
decided that the GPU’s must be sold it sounds like that was 
a decision to be made by me.  A decision to sell the GPU’s 
firstly it was made at SAA and I have been consistent about 
this because there is what – evidence that proves this and – 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS MEMELA:  And then – ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair just so I am not misunderstood.  I am 
not putting it to Ms Memela that she took the decision to sell 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 281 of 310 
 
the GPU’s.  So Ms Memela we must not be misunderstood.  
What I put to you is you were the person who decided to sell 
them at the price of R3.2 million and I want to explain to you 
why I put that to you.  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes you can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second. 
ADV HOFMEYR:    Because in your evidence… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair there is here 
before court – the commission this is a document that has 
10 
been furnished to us by the commission and this document is 
the affidavit of Julian Aires.  It states expressly who decided 
the price.  What puzzles us is that throughout Ms Hofmeyr is 
ignoring this document.  It is one of the documents which 
specifically asked to be given to us in order to prepare for 
this re-examination. If I can give you a page reference of 
that it is DD32… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr – Ms Mbanjwa even that when 
you re-examine you can get it clarified.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make a note of all these things that you 
might want to be clarified and then you can clarify them 
during re-examination. 
ADV MBANJWA:  The difficulty Chair is that this is not a 
clarification.  If I may be bold to say it is suppression of 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 282 of 310 
 
evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV MBANJWA:  It is there.  This Julian Aires said exactly 
what is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sit down. 
ADV MBANJWA:  And it gets then put to this witness that it 
is her indeed.  That is the reason why I just could not 
contain myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness will say what she knows.  If 
she knows that to be true she will say so; if she knows that 
10 
to be different, she will say no it is not like that.  If she does 
not know she will say she does not know.  When you re-
examine you will revisit the issue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your evidence in – sorry Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja you – Ms Hofmeyr you said I am the 
person who decided to sell the GPU’s for R3.4 right? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Decided. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And Chair I am explaining this that… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the price.  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  That price determination that as you and I 
understand because I do not know if Ms Hofmeyr has worked 
for a corporate sector before.  She is just – she has just 
been practicing but I will try and explain as simply as I can 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 283 of 310 
 
and hoping the public will understand this because this thing 
of GPU’s keep on coming back to me.  Now there is a 
difference Chair between the disposal process versus a 
procurement process.  The procurement process you procure 
and then through that evaluation team they go out and make 
sure that people are competing in terms of price.  The 
disposal I even wanted to say you know I think maybe one 
day I must make it – make an example to the Chair that you 
– I will make an example of the office.  I do not know if you 
have been – I do not think you have been to the office for the 
10 
card. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do not make an example with the … 
MS MEMELA:  But yes but I am talking about disposal.  I am 
trying to explain disposal Chair.  The disposal – the buyer 
will be the one who makes the proposal offer to purchase to 
something that has been disposed of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Ms Memela… 
MS MEMELA:  Right and then I read… 
MS MEMELA:  Did you decide the price or not that is the 
question. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Who decide the price or not? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you decide the price or not? 
MS MEMELA:  I did not decide the price Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who decided the price? 
MS MEMELA:  The price – the price definitely was decided 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 284 of 310 
 
by the person whom Jules Aire made a proposal to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is that person? 
MS MEMELA:  They said it was the acting CEO of SAAT at 
that time Mr Asimalola Phiri. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see that is all you needed to say 
in response to the questions. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So that is why we went to Mr 
Phiri and Mr Phiri says he did not approve the price.  You 
know that because you have seen his affidavit correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I have seen the affidavit and because I know 
10 
Chair that this commission’s team have got the evidence that 
actually proves how much Asim has changed whatever that 
he was responsible for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no let us continue Ms… 
MS MEMELA:  And – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You have answered the question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Mr Phiri’s affidavit sets out that he did 
not have a discussion with you about the price.  Remember 
we have got to go back to the 21 June 2016 because it is on 
the 21 June 2016 that you have the meeting with Ms Sekulu 
20 
and Mr Aires do you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay let us go back.  Let us go back Ms – 
Chair remember I told you about the proposal that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr just repeat your 
question because… 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 285 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes I want to go to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I want to… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sure.  There is a meeting that Ms Memela 
had on the 21 June 2106 with Ms Sekulu and Mr Aires.  At 
that meeting they discussed the sale price of the GPU’s.  Do 
you accept that Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I was asked by the acting CEO to go 
ask the people that sent the proposal to him how did they 
reach the price that they put in their proposal. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But I just want to know if you had a 
10 
meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela just respond to the question.  
Do you remember? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I had the meeting and I explained also 
Chair in February that I had that meeting and it was a 
professional meeting with the JM people after getting that 
instruction from Asim and there was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on with the explanation. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The long and short is you remember what 
20 
you talked about? 
MS MEMELA:  I remember the – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  There is even a – what the… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  An email. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 286 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:  Meeting invite yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There is a meeting invite that went to Mr 
Makaleng who said he did not attend the meeting with you 
and Mr Vosloo who said he did not attend the meeting with 
you.  Your evidence in February is that they are lying they 
were with you. 
MS MEMELA:  They did, they did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then you said you accepted that you 
could not on your own decide on that price. 
MS MEMELA:  No ways. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You had to speak to Mr Phiri about it, 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair the problem now is that Ms Hofmeyr is 
only focussing on that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she is asking the particular question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there is no way that I would have 
decided on the pricing because it was not under my 
department.  And I am – since she is referring to Mr Assin – 
Mr Asimalola Phiri’s affidavit the recent one that was only 
received in September 2020 where he says he did not… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on Ms Memela.  
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat your question Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your evidence in February was that you 
accepted you needed to get Mr Phiri’s agreement to the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 287 of 310 
 
price.  Do you remember that? 
MS MEMELA:  I needed to get his agreement? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes on the price because you accepted 
you did not have the authority to agree with JM Aviation to 
sell it at R3.5. 
MS MEMELA:  No, no. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You had to get the acting CEO’s agreement 
that it could be sold at that price.  Do you remember giving 
that evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  No Chair I mean – I think these are the – one 
10 
of the – some of the things that I am supposed to come back 
and clarify which is the reason why I applied for a re-
examination.  Assin gave me instruction after he received the 
proposal from Jules Aire. Right that okay this is what their 
proposing for the GPU’s and asked me to arrange a meeting 
and sit with these people and then [00:18:26] was going to 
be there as well being the owner of the GPU’s.  I invited 
Leon who was the senior manager Logistics and Inventory 
that time but Leon could not make it.  The only person that I 
know that was not going to make was Leon because he was 
20 
not in.  Then Stan Vosloo because he is reporting to Leon is 
the one that came in because he is under sales and 
materials as well.  So… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We have traversed that previously.  They 
said on affidavit they were not there you dispute that.  That 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 288 of 310 
 
is not what I am interested in. 
MS MEMELA:  I dispute that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela.  What I am interested in is 
your previous testimony which is that you accepted you 
 had to get Ms Phiri’s agreement on the sale price.  Do you 
remember giving that evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  When you say agreement do you mean a 
written agreement? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No just he had to agree with you because 
your evidence was you had a discussion with him.  Do you 
10 
remember that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I had a discussion because I had to give 
feedback after he instructed me to go and sit with the people 
and get and understand how did they reach the price. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela.   
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela did you need Mr Phiri’s 
agreement on the price or did you not need it? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair Mr Phiri asked me to sit with the people 
20 
and ask because remember they put a certain price there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms Memela did you need Mr Phiri’s 
agreement on the price or you could do without his 
agreement on what the price should be? 
MS MEMELA:  It was not under my - what delegation of 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 289 of 310 
 
authority Chair to agree on the price. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Do 
you 
remember 
giving 
evidence 
previously. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you needed Mr Phiri’s agreement or 
do you not remember? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair I said Mr Phiri even signed the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I am not talking about the 
invoice.  I am saying do you remember giving evidence to 
the effect that you needed Mr Phiri’s agreement or you do 
10 
not remember giving such agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  No I do not remember Chair.  I think I 
explained… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  But to be specifically exact and say okay I 
needed an agreement and stuff because what I did not 
understand is that a person would give you an instruction 
and then say okay go and [00:20:34] these people.  These – 
this is the proposal that they gave me.  Here is the board 
resolution.  Ask them how did they reach this amount to – for 
20 
their proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And then I go back to him tell him that they 
came back to me and say okay this is how they reached the 
amount. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 290 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but – that is fine Ms Memela that is not 
about… 
MS MEMELA:  And there is evidence which… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The price.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you remember giving evidence that you 
had a discussion with Mr Phiri and you and he agreed on the 
sale price? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You do remember that evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  I did give him a feedback because remember 
10 
whatever he gives you… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No your evidence was that you discussed it 
with him and you and he agreed on the price. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I did.  Exactly remember when you give 
back the feedback is that not – does that not mean that you 
are discussing with him? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No the important point is that you had a 
discussion with him. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you agreed with him about the price. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  I did.  I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correctly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that happened somewhere between 
your meeting on the 21 July and your communication to JM 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 291 of 310 
 
Aviation that the reviewed price had been approved.  Do you 
recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  The – when you say the communication you 
talking about the letter of our writing? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct well it was the letter that confirmed 
the price. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and that happened on the 22 July.  Do 
you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  It is not the letter that confirms the price.  It 
10 
is the letter that confirms the approval by the board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Of the price.  Because remember the 
approval of the board had already been given. 
MS MEMELA:  Approval of the proposal by the board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We will look at it in a moment.  That 
happened between the 21s t and the 22n d is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa I will let – I will let you know 
when I want to hear from – let Ms Hofmeyr finish. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Chair [inaudible].  We have an affidavit of 
Julian Aires it has stated exactly how the price was 
20 
determined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa please sit down.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Thank you.  So between the 
meeting on the 21 s t June… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know Ms Mbanjwa.  Ms Mbanjwa I 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 292 of 310 
 
have had many lawyers coming to the commission when their 
clients are giving evidence.  I do not – I have never had 
somebody who objects so frequently.  It hampers progress.  
Continue Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you had the meeting on the 21 June 
and then the letter confirming the review priced was 
accepted was the 22n d June. Do you remember that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:    22 n d June the next day. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay is it written that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that for present purposes or 
do you want me to take you to it? 
MS MEMELA:  You can take me there because I do not want 
to – for you to [talking over one another]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  DD25A at page 354.   
MS MEMELA:  At page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  354.   
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you see it?  Is that the letter that we 
20 
are discussing? 
MS MEMELA:  That is the letter yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what is its date? 
MS MEMELA:  Must I – the date is the 22 June 2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is why I said somewhere between 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 293 of 310 
 
your meeting on the 21 June with Ms Sekulu and Mr Aires 
and the sending of this letter on the 22 June you had to have 
had a discussion with Mr Phiri. 
MS MEMELA:  Of course. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  At which you agreed, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Of course yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  His affidavit said he did not have that 
discussion with you.  You have seen that, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Did he send the proof other than saying he 
was on EXCO? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is not my question.  My question is 
have you seen his affidavit where he denies having had that 
discussion with you? 
MS MEMELA:  Is he denying that but I have evidence to 
prove. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You have evidence to prove? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That he did have the discussion with you? 
MS MEMELA:  No I have … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Please tell us. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Evidence to prove that he is actually the price 
determiner and he actually is the one who is responsible for 
that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is not the question Ms Memela.  It is 
not about who is responsible in terms of the regulations.  It 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 294 of 310 
 
is about what happened between the 21s t and the 22n d June. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You say you had a discussion and he says 
you did not, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I said I had a discussion. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and his version is you did not.  Have 
you seen that version? 
MS MEMELA:  My version is I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He explains why you could not have had a 
discussion.  He says on the 21 June he was in an EXCO 
meeting the entire day and he includes the 
MS MEMELA:  21 s t. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  21s t sorry did I say 22 n d I apologise. 
MS MEMELA:  No you said the 21s t yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  On the 21s t he says I was in an EXCO 
meeting the entire day.  He attaches the minutes they are 
lengthy and voluminous.  Are you saying despite the fact that 
he was in that EXCO meeting the entire day you had a 
20 
discussion with him on the 21 s t? 
MS MEMELA:  I had a discussion with him on the 21 s t? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I mean attending a meeting Ms Hofmeyr 
you do understand whether it takes the whole day or not 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 295 of 310 
 
there are breaks and a person – and in SAAT and SAA just 
opposite like the [00:25:17] it is just opposite each other. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So do you have a specific memory… 
MS MEMELA:  So the fact that he was – the fact that he was 
attending that meeting does not mean I did not discuss it 
with him.. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So did you discuss it with him on the 21s t 
or might you have done it on the 22 nd? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember but I am saying I gave him 
back 
the 
feedback 
from 
the 
instruction 
because 
the 
10 
instruction was I received this proposal before I went to the 
board which was the reason Chair he went to the board – 
Asim proposing to the board to get – to get the GPU’s sold.  
And then he said okay these are the – this is a proposal by 
Jules Aire that was tabled please arrange a meeting with 
these people and Chila being the owner and also whoever is 
there from the sales which was Leon at that time but Leon 
did not make it.  So go and ask how did they reach the 
amount that they had put in the proposal.  So that is exactly 
what we asked in the meeting.  And then we gave – I gave 
20 
the feedback to him.  So that is why I am trying to show Ms 
Hofmeyr that when she says discussing the discussion 
happened when I was giving him feedback. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But the problem is Mr Phiri denies having 
had that discussion with you.  So I need to offer you an 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 296 of 310 
 
opportunity to explain to the Chair why your version rather 
than his should be accepted right.  Mr Phiri says you did not 
have the discussion on the 21s t because he was in an EXCO 
meeting the whole day.  Right.  I accept that it might have 
happened on the 22 nd because he does not say anything 
about the 22 nd.  Do you have a clear recollection as to 
whether you were speaking to him on the 21s t or the 22n d? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes remember that was the question that you 
put to me that did I give – what – did I discuss this with him.  
So for me I am not talking about which date and stuff I just 
10 
saw that date there.  But I am just explaining Chair that the 
fact that he was at a – attending EXCO does not necessarily 
mean that he will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say you are not sure on which date… 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure which date that he was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It could be… 
MS MEMELA:  Yes it could be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The day of the meeting or the day before? 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly but what I know is that the feedback 
was given to him based on instruction that he gave to me. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you had to get his agreement right? 
MS MEMELA:  Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Not just feedback you had to get his 
agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  Of course you give feedback because 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 297 of 310 
 
remember he is the person who motivated to the board that 
these things must be sold. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I want to explain to you why I suggest to 
you it could not have happened on the 22 nd June. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  And that is because when you sent 
that letter of confirming the review price to Ms Sikulu you 
sent it very early in the morning. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So early that I would suggest you would 
10 
not have had a conversation with Mr Phiri before that. 
MS MEMELA:  When you say early what time was it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that?  6:43 in the morning. 
MS MEMELA:  5:43 in the morning and then you saying I did 
not give him instruction between 21 and 22? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I am saying it is unlikely that you would 
have done it on the morning of the 22n d June before 5:43 am, 
do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay that is why I explained about the EXCO 
issue that the fact that he was attending EXCO does not 
20 
mean that …. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you accept you did not do it on the 
22n d? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You would have had to have done it on the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 298 of 310 
 
23rd – 21s t somewhere between the meeting and the end of 
the day, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That could have happened. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No but I am trying to work out the 
probabilities.  You have accepted that you would not have 
had a conversation with him before 5:43 am in the morning? 
MS MEMELA:  Of course it is too early in the morning. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So it had to happen on the 21s t and the 
10 
21s t was the day that he was in the EXCO meeting. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But your evidence is you spoke to him at 
some point. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair that was to clarify the 
role that Ms Memela played in the review price. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And its approval.  We do not have any 
further questions at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No that is fine.  We are at 
twenty to six.  We will then have to adjourn and then another 
date will be determined when the re-examination can 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 299 of 310 
 
happen.  It may be that we might have to do it on an evening 
– in an evening session which might start at four or five 
going into the evening because it is difficult to find days that 
are not already occupied for the rest of – of the balance of 
the year.  Ms Memela you want to say something before your 
attorney says something? 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, in case maybe you wanted something 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   No, Chair.  Maybe, she should speak first 
10 
because I was going to read out ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  She says, speak first. 
MS MEMELA:   Alright, Chair.  The affidavit of miss... Mr 
Asimalola appearing.  I have been asking for it since 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Whose affidavit? 
MS MEMELA:   The then acting CEO of SAAD(?).  Mr 
Asimalola appearing.  I have been asking for it as far back 
as 2020, January.  2020, February.  After... during... yes, 
during that time ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MEMELA:   Of my testimony and nothing was coming 
forward and I kept on asking because I had a lot of 
documents Chair that was written by Mr Asimalola Phiri 
where he was stating exactly what happened towards the 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 300 of 310 
 
sale of CPU’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MEMELA:   And I was only given this... his affidavit 
which out of the blue now it changes.  He is denying 
everything, contradictory to the document that I have sent to 
the Commission.  I said okay this is I am going to use during 
my re-examination.   
 
So since Ms Hofmeyr is relying on Mr Asim’s affidavit 
where he actually denies certain things.  My understanding 
was that I should have been given a Rule 3.2 where...  
10 
as much as I have asked for it because remember the rule of 
the Commission is that if somebody says something that 
implicates you, you should be given a Rule 3.2. 
 
So 
that 
you 
are 
able 
to 
actually 
address 
those 
implication by that other person and put evidence.  So that 
by the time myself and the attorney come here and then set 
the record straight. 
 
We have actually already submitted my own affidavit 
contradicting exactly what Mr Asimalola has written.  So you 
see now for Ms Hofmeyr to rely on it now, yet I was not given 
20 
that Rule 3.2 to respond.   
 
So that like when she asks me all these questions, she 
is able to say:  Okay you are saying here as... Now I am only 
expected to answer according to what Asim had said versus 
what I have said.  And that is giving me difficult...   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 301 of 310 
 
 
I am not sure then Chair, how are you going to handle 
that?  Am I still going to be given Rule 3.2 where I will be 
responding to Mr Asimalola appearing, where I will prove 
with evidence that he was the determiner of the price for the 
CPU’s.   
 
He was the person that the delegation of authority to 
dispose of those CPU’s, fall under his shoulder and all those 
kinds of...  
 
And then I can then make an application to cross-
examine him because I have so much to prove that he lied 
10 
deliberately.  I am not sure because knowing Asim.   
 
Asim is a person that I have worked with since I joined 
SAAT even before I went to procurement.  He is the person 
with a backbone who stands for the truth.   
 
But after reading that, the lies that are there and stuff, 
they left me asking myself:  Okay is this the same Asim that I 
knew?  Is this the same person that wrote this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
MS 
MEMELA: 
 
 
...document 
that 
I 
can 
prove 
that 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   I want to prove ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I... hang on, hang on. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, any... what do you say about 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 302 of 310 
 
that issue of the affidavit? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, the first thing I just want to get clear 
is Ms Memela says that she provided the Commission with 
some document that she wanted to use in her re-examination 
relates to ...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have no knowledge of that.  What 
document is that? 
MS MEMELA:   You can then ask Ms Tshabalala.  Is it 
...[indistinct] the secretary?  Yes.   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What document was that? 
MS MEMELA:   That document was sent in March 2020 after 
my re-examination.   
MS MBANJWA:   If I may correct, Chair?  It was sent on the 
3rd of April. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh, April?  Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   It was never addressed to Ms Hofmeyr.  It 
was addressed to the secretariat. 
MS MEMELA:   To... yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Ms Ratsikana(?). 
20 
MS MEMELA:   On, Ratsikana. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I cannot say I have any knowledge of it as 
I stand here. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I would want to see that, certainly.  I 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 303 of 310 
 
have not seen it to my recollection before today.  So that is 
why it came as a surprise to me. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you just tell me what the document 
was? 
MS MEMELA:   The document Chair... because remember, 
this, as I have said, this ...[indistinct] a few things 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, Chair.  Because Chair wants to 
leave.  We have a copy of the document.  We will furnish 
...[intervenes]  
MS MEMELA:   No.  Ja. 
MS MBANJWA:   We had actually made a bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
MS MBANJWA:   Because we were ready to re-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   That really has not come to my attention.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I would like to see it.  The reason why 
I am asking you about it now.  It is relevant to process, 
right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 304 of 310 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is very important if Ms Mamela has 
documents that she believes we need to see, we must see 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is why I made the point earlier that what 
I am concerned about is a situation where we move to re-
examination 
and 
the 
documents 
that 
we 
should 
have 
10 
considered beforehand and we have not had an opportunity 
to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So we would certainly want to see them.  
We would also have no difficulty with an affidavit from Ms 
Mamela, setting out her version.  That is why she was invited 
after Mr Ndzeku’s evidence, to give an affidavit.  She 
requested Mr Phiri’s affidavit. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She was given it. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   H’m. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
There 
was 
no 
affidavit 
from 
her 
forthcoming until today.  So what we would very much 
appreciate if any documents that Ms Memela wants to place 
before the Commission be placed before us.   
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 305 of 310 
 
 
Any affidavit that she would like to put before the 
Commission, setting out her version, she should provide.   
 
But the problem is, we should get that before her re-
examination starts because there might be matters that we 
need to traverse.  That would be our proposal Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But is there an affidavit that... Ms 
Memela, you say you have been waiting for and you have not 
received it? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  This is the similar affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have not received it? 
10 
MS 
MEMELA: 
 
 
I 
have 
only 
received 
it 
on 
the 
17t h of September 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you have got it now? 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly.  So that is why I am saying.  Since 
Ms Hofmeyr is relying on it and it appears he is saying 
something ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MEMELA:   ...implicating him and whatever.  So I am 
saying, is it allowed now?  Because my understanding is that 
I should have been given 3.2 Rule so that I am able to 
20 
respond to that.  And then I can also apply for cross-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Because I feel the public deserves to know 
the truth. 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 306 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Because ...[indistinct] sits here.  She keeps 
on getting asked all these questions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  That is alright. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  So I really need that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that could be arranged. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa and Ms Hofmeyr will talk 
about that.  That will be arranged and discussed. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should not be a problem. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So you have raised what 
you wanted to raise and the way forward about that is 
sorted. 
MS MEMELA:   You have not answered me Chair.  The cross-
examination, am I going to be given a chance to reply? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you 
are 
paying that lawyer.  
Remember?  She must work for these fees.  [laughing]  She 
must give you advice.  Ms Mbanjwa, you wanted to say 
20 
something before we adjourn? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, actually Chair.  Actually, Chair I am so 
happy that you are saying I am paid.  Therefore, I must give 
legal advice because then Chair you will accept that I object 
all... not because I am ...[intervenes]  
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 307 of 310 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MS MBANJWA:   Bu because I am paid.  There is a late 
update.  He said when he was asked by a judge he said:  
Judge, I am paid to courageous. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MS MBANJWA:   So I am indebted to Chair.  Thank you 
Chair for being patient with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   But what we are going to say Chair.  I was 
going to suggest that, instead of us requesting the Rule 3.2, 
10 
I can see the time constraints and we really appreciate the 
fact that Chair is prepared to meet us on our equal.   
 
We really appreciate it and we are grateful for that.  So 
what we are going to do.  We are going to bring an 
application.   
 
That is a formal application under oath where we are 
going to ask to cross-examine this person, this Asim.  And 
then the other thing which we are going to ask for Chair 
because that is going to take time.   
 
Because without maybe casting suspicion(?) on the 
20 
investigating team and Ms Hofmeyr.  But we have looked at 
the manner in which the evidence that was entered.   
 
We feel that it is presented in a negative light.  So 
consequently, what we are going to do.  There is a certain 
affidavit which are already within the Commission which we 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 308 of 310 
 
are going to ask the Commission to read into the record.   
 
But it is very important that they get read into the 
record.  And then when the Chair makes his whole 
conclusion, then you could be having all that.   
 
And then lastly Chair.  There is the issue of this legal... 
we should just believe that the evidence leader, as he has 
said, does not understand some of the legal provisions.  
 
So we will just then have to do an explanation of what 
each of those legal provisions are and then we will submit it.  
Thank you, Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we are speaking from the legal 
team’s perspective.  Anything that Ms Memela wishes to 
place before us, we would welcome. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Her version or whatever she wants to say 
about Mr Phiri, application to cross-examine.  If she wants to 
do a document in which she sets out where she thinks we 
got the law wrong, we invite that.  We would want to 
consider it.  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MEMELA:   Can I be...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MEMELA:   Can I add just one thing? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
01 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 274 
 
Page 309 of 310 
 
MS MEMELA:   You see, it is not... it is just one... something 
that I read out of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what is that? 
MS MEMELA:   ...out of many books that I read.  I do not 
know if you are aware of the 48 Rules of Law?  And I came
