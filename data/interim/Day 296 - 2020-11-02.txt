PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 02 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Hofmeyr, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YES. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair this week marks the culmination of 
10 
the aviation work streams investigation barring a few loose 
ends that still need to be wrapped up with certain 
witnesses.   
This week is the week where really two years of 
investigative work will come to a conclusion.  And Chair 
that might – the files behind me might be some indicator of 
the extent of those investigations.  We have to have the 
files installed with us this week because the two witnesses 
who will be appearing this week are first Ms Yakhe 
Kwinana who was a non-executive board member of SAA 
20 
for some many years; the Chair of the SAA Technical board 
and also the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee at a 
point during her tenure at SAA.  
 Also this week the commission will receive the 
evidence of Ms Duduzile Myeni.  Again who served for a 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 4 of 257 
 
considerable period on the SAA board and for many years 
as its Chairperson? 
And much of the evidence that has been received 
by this commission prior to this week has involved Ms 
Kwinana or Ms Myeni in various ways and so there is a 
need to the course of their evidence this week to take them 
to other evidence that has been received in order to give 
them an opportunity to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair the commission has received over 
10 
the 
course 
of 
the 
aviation 
work 
streams 
evidence 
presentation.  Considerable evidence that points to state 
capture, corruption and fraud having taken hold in the 
state owned enterprises in respect of which Ms Kwinana 
and Ms Myeni served on the boards. 
 
And 
Ms 
Kwinana 
who 
will 
testify 
today 
and 
tomorrow herself has been implicated in corrupt acts and in 
creating a climate of fear and intimidation against those 
SAA 
employees 
and 
managers 
who 
sought 
to 
resist 
unlawful acts. 
20 
 
And 
so 
today 
and 
tomorrow 
really 
offers 
Ms 
Kwinana an opportunity to tell her side of the story so that 
this commission is in a position in due course to make 
findings, having weighed all the evidence that has been 
presented to it. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 5 of 257 
 
 
Chair Ms Kwinana is represented by Ms Mbanjwa 
whom you have met before.  I would like to ask that Ms 
Mbanjwa just places herself on record if we could? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Good morning Ms Mbanjwa.  Switch 
on your microphone. Oh I think that might be a wrong one.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you might have to sit… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Mbanjwa the ones that are active are 
the ones in the row behind.  So if you could take up a 
position there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well maybe what – maybe what we 
will 
say 
because 
I 
do 
hear 
you, 
you 
confirm 
your 
appearance for Ms Kwinana, is that right?  Maybe I will just 
place it on record for you.  You do not have to go and do 
that.  Okay.  Okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I was going to request that the 
witness be sworn in so if there is something Ms Mbanjwa 
would like to address you on now would be an appropriate 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes sure ja.  Is your microphone working 
20 
Ms Mbanjwa?  Yes, Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Sorry Chair.  Chair there has already 
been a remark by Ms Hofmeyr concerning Ms Kwinana who 
is a witness here today.  There is a small address that Ms 
Kwinana wants to make.  I am just asking permission for 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 6 of 257 
 
her to make it.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When she starts her evidence? 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes. Before she starts – before Ms 
Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the questioning? 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the questioning?  No that is fine. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes Ms Hofmeyr are you 
done? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I am done and we – if we can swear Ms 
Kwinana in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS KWINANA:  Yakhe Kwinana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MS KWINANA:  No. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 7 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you consider the oath to biding on 
your conscience? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated Ms 
10 
Kwinana.  I understand from your attorney that you would 
like to say something before the questioning starts.  Is that 
right? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time are you asking for? 
MS KWINANA:  Maybe less than two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair may I suggest that Ms Kwinana just 
brings the microphone a bit closer to her because the 
recording will require that to be amplified. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes thank you.  You may proceed 
then Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you may have to raise your voice 
or come closer to the microphone.  Only that one seems to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 8 of 257 
 
be the right on, only that microphone. 
MS KWINANA:  This one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair before Ms Hofmeyr 
with her questions I would like to put on record the 
following: 
 
On two separate occasions Ms Hofmeyr stated that I 
was in a corrupt relationship whilst I was a director at SAA 
and a Chairperson of SAAT.  In that I received kickbacks 
and bribes. She also said that I received an amount of 
10 
R4.3 million.   
I instructed my attorney to write a letter to the 
commission requesting Ms Hofmeyr to name the basis of 
those allegations.  No reply was received to the first letter 
nor to the second letter which we also wrote. 
I was advised by my attorney of record that I would 
apply for recusal of Ms Hofmeyr on the grounds that she is 
biased against me because basically she said on more than 
one occasion she puts it to the witness that I am involved 
in corrupt activities without even being interviewed; without 
20 
even being given an opportunity to sit here.  I am happy 
Chair today that I am sitting here.  
I however decided that I should come to the 
commission so that I put the record straight and in putting 
the record straight I would like to state the following facts 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 9 of 257 
 
which were brought to the attention of the investigators of 
the commission and also contained in Open Water Report 
which is with the commission that for some unknown 
reason are not being dealt with in the proceedings of the 
commission. 
Chair I would first like to talk generally about the 
financials of SAA.  I had an opportunity of looking at the 
financials for eighteen years from 2000 up to 2017.  I 
wanted to go further to 2018/19/20 March and I requested 
those financials but they – I understand they are not yet 
10 
available. 
But I want to bring it to the attention of the South 
Africans that since 2000 the year that I started to review 
the financial statements there is not a single year from 
2000 up to 2017 there is not a single year that SAA 
incurred operating profits. 
What I mean by operating profits I mean where the 
revenue of SAA is enough to cover the expenses of SAA 
without selling any other item.  We all know that in 
2000/2001 all the fleet of SAA was sold to finance 
20 
operating activities.   
We know – we all know the story of Colman 
Andrews that he went away with R250 million in golden 
handshake despite the fact that SAA never incurred any 
profits from 2000 up to 2017 and I am sure even the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 10 of 257 
 
financials of 2018 that are not yet out will also show 
exactly the same thing. 
Now let me go to the specifics Chair.  In June 2016 
SAAT under my leadership as a Chairperson instituted 
investigations into spare parts that were bought and sold 
immediately some of them at zero rands.  They were be 
purchased at a higher rate and sold at the companies that 
are known to the SAAT employees.  We know that.  It is in 
the newspapers. 
And in fact Chair because I arrived early here I had 
10 
an opportunity of looking at all these files.  None of these 
names that I am going to mention here as are here they 
were never investigated.  Nothing like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why did you not give the names to 
the commission?  We – I have been telling – asking the 
public from 2018 to say anyone who is aware of corruption 
or acts of state capture must please bring that information 
to the commission? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair the reason why I am going to 
mention them today is because all these names are in the 
20 
Open Water Reports and they are all Open Water Reports 
are here with the state commission.  Yes so now if the 
Open Water Report is here and in fact the reason why I am 
here is because of the Open Water Report I do not 
understand why … 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 11 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know about you being here 
because of the Open Water Report because I believe you 
are here because there have been a number of witnesses 
who have mentioned your name in certain contexts in 
regard to the work of the commission. 
MS KWINANA:  Okay alright thank you Chair.  So what I 
am saying Chair is that the names that are in the Open 
Water Report the report that the commission has.  You are 
Chair investigating the state capture, the corruption, 
allegations of fraud and bribery, all those things and all 
10 
that information Chair is in the those reports that you have. 
 
I will just mention for – that the report has got a lot 
of people Chair and the reason why I mention it is because 
they are in the report that you have.   
 
I will start Chair with Leon Roberts.  Leon Roberts 
was the Chairperson of FST – PSFT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if you want to mention other 
people should you not have prepared an affidavit and 
20 
submitted it to the commission mentioning those people so 
that they could be given Rule 3.3 Notices and be warned 
that you intend mentioning them in the commission? 
MS KWINANA:  As I said Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that they – they could protect their 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 12 of 257 
 
rights as well. 
MS KWINANA:  As I said Chair I will then – then I will not 
mention the name but I will mention the positions.  But as I 
said the names including the positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but sometimes you – if you do not 
mention my name but you say the Chairperson of the 
commission everybody knows who the Chairperson of the 
commission is.  If you say the President of South Africa in 
2020 everybody knows who that is. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I do not – I do not intend to write an 
10 
affidavit here.  What I intend – What I would do is to say to 
Andrew you investigator why are you ignoring this report 
that you already have?  That is what I would say because 
all these names are in that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if you – if you want to say – if 
you want to write to the commission and say there is 
evidence that so and so and so and so was – or was 
involved or is involved in acts of corruption and state 
capture and here is that evidence or that evidence is to 
found in a certain document you may do so and the 
20 
commission would look – look at that.   
 
The one thing which I want to mention to you is that 
when you have failed to do that over the past two and a 
half years that this commission has been working and you 
mention it now which when we are at the tail end of the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 13 of 257 
 
work of the commission we might not be able to – to look 
into that because we are at a stage now having this 
commission has been sitting and hearing oral evidence 
from August 2018. 
 
We are at a stage where even some of the 
investigators have left because in terms of the work that 
we have got to do they have done – they have done their 
part and we are working on what we have received in the 
past. 
 
So when we receive something new that has not 
10 
been there there may be those challenges.  It may be that 
it is something that we regard as so important that we can 
see what plan we can make to pursue it.  But generally 
speaking we are in November 2020 the aim was to 
complete oral evidence by end this year so that January, 
February and March next year which would be the only 
other months when the commission is allowed to continue. 
 
It is not for not the hearing of oral evidence.  So I 
am alerting you to this so that you can understand if you 
give us something at this late stage and we are not able to 
20 
do anything it might be because of the timing.  If you had 
brought to our attention much earlier there might have 
been time to pursue it. 
MS KWINANA:  Thank you for that Chair.  Your investigator 
Andrew Kirkland was told about these and in fact he was 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 14 of 257 
 
told that all that is in the Open Water.  And what he said – 
he said no, we are looking for specific people.  In fact that 
is what he also confirmed in the Zoom interview that was 
held on 28 September that they focussed on two issues.  
The GPU’s and components because they were looking for 
specific people. 
 
So which means therefore that your investigation 
team was told about these people that are in the report but 
they did not do anything about that because they were 
looking at specific people which means therefore that your 
10 
investigation team was told about these people that are in 
the report but they did not do anything about that because 
they were looking at specific people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see – well I do not know the 
context in which he may have said that but what I can tell 
you that we cannot look everybody in South Africa who 
against whom there are allegations of corruption. We 
cannot because we do not have enough time for that.  To 
do that you would need years and years and years okay.  
And if you have – if you have been following the work of 
20 
the commission you will know that already when the 
commission applied at the end of last year to the high 
court for the extension of its lifespan it was reported that I 
had said that we would narrow our focus even more in 
order to finish within the time that we have.   
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 15 of 257 
 
 
There are many people that may be transactions 
that we – maybe we should have investigated – we may 
have – that may have deserved to be investigated.  We 
have not gone into municipalities you know.  We have not 
gone into all government departments.  There is just not 
enough time and not enough capacity. 
 
So 
those 
who 
responded 
to 
the 
call 
of 
the 
commission early when we said please South Africans if 
you know of somebody who has been involved in acts of 
state capture or corruption here get give – get us – give us 
10 
the information. 
 
Those who responded early and if what they told us 
appeared 
credible 
and 
appeared 
important 
that 
was 
identified and followed.  We could not follow everything.  
You understand? 
MS KWINANA:  I understand Chair but I have a challenge 
when a report with so much damning evidence that the 
commission has and the commission decides to pick and 
choose so to say.  And Chair if there is no time for the 
people who are already mentioned in the reports that you 
20 
have then I really do have a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well some of the matters that we are not 
able to follow because of time constraints and you know 
will be handed over to Law Enforcement Agencies to 
investigate further. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 16 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:  Thank you Chair.  So what I am going to do 
because I really feel strongly – strongly about this and in 
fact the reason why I feel strongly about this is when I 
instituted this investigation my aim which basically I did 
not know that basically I am more or less acting against 
the tide of looting at SAA Technical.   
And on the other hand the evidence is there and in 
fact there is not a single decision Chair that I regret I 
made when I was the Chairperson of South African 
Technical – when I was the Chairperson of the Audit 
10 
Committee and when I was a board member of SAA I can 
stand with all the decisions that I made.   
I tried by all means in respect of this investigation 
we even found out that an asset of about R175 million was 
given away for free.  To whom was it given for free?  It was 
given to the entities that are linked to SAA Technical.  I 
mean really why would your investigators not look into 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you give us an affidavit with that 
information? 
20 
MS KWINANA:  Chair – Chair as I said this information is 
with the commission.  So I did not see a reason for me to 
see – to give evidence – or to give an affidavit on the 
information that your investigators have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no Ms Kwinana we are not going to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 17 of 257 
 
talk in circles now.  We have had this engagement.  It has 
been more than ten minutes.  Please wrap up. 
MS KWINANA:  Thank you Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair there were a few aspects that I just 
need to address in response to what Ms Kwinana has said.  
If you will just give me a moment to hand a note to my… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So Chair as I have it Mr Kwinana 
10 
began by stating that on two previous occasions here 
attorney Ms Mbanjwa had asked for details about the 
allegedly corrupt relationship she was in, the kickbacks 
she received and the R4.3 million that was referenced in 
Mr Ndzeku’s evidence.  And she said clearly that has been 
no response to that when that request was made. 
 
Chair that is false.  There was a detailed response 
sent to her attorney on the 28 October – sorry earlier than 
that – let me find the right one.  On the 30 September and 
Chair that letter is quite an important letter because Ms 
20 
Kwinana’s already… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to either read it into the 
record. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I will read it into the record if I may 
Chair. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 18 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the relevant parts yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is just correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I cannot for some reason she 
might not be aware of it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS KWINANA:  I am aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
It 
did 
not 
address 
what 
we 
were 
addressing Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right so… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What happened is Monday the 28 
September this year there was a Zoom meeting held with 
Ms Kwinana and Ms Mbanjwa.  That was the first meeting 
that the commission was able to secure with Ms Kwinana 
despite inviting her as far back as the 28 November 2019 
to meet with the commission.   
She 
was 
repeatedly 
requested 
to 
provide 
an 
affidavit to the commission.  Neither of that took place until 
Monday the 28 September this year when a Zoom meeting 
20 
was 
conducted 
with 
Ms 
Kwinana, 
Ms 
Mbanjwa 
and 
members of the legal team and investigation team of the 
commission. 
 
That meeting I can only say deteriorated quite 
rapidly.  It was a meeting that was really to vent a series of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 19 of 257 
 
attacks from Ms Kwinana and Ms Mbanjwa at me; at the 
investigators etcetera. 
 
Luckily we have a transcript of that meeting which 
we will make available if necessary because since that 
meeting there have been repeated claims made about what 
was said at that meeting which again are just false.
 
But what Ms Kwinana and Ms Mbanjwa got on the 
30 September was a response to this very issue.  We 
began with the Open Waters Reports in the response 
because as Ms Kwinana has done today reference was 
10 
made to other Open Waters Reports.  And repeated 
statements were made… 
ADV MBANJWA:  Chair today I really do not want to object 
therefore what I will do is to simply place on record the 
manner of presenting evidence.  And I would beg Ms 
Hofmeyr to please deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, Ms Mbanjwa Ms Hofmeyr is still 
addressing me.  I will give you a chance after she has 
finished. 
ADV MBANJWA:  But Chair he led us again with that… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will respond after she has finished.  
She allowed your client at your request – we allowed your 
client to address me. She addressed – Ms Hofmeyr never 
interrupted her when she was addressing me.  Ms Hofmeyr 
never interrupted you when you made a request.  Why are 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 20 of 257 
 
you interrupting her when she is addressing me?  Ms 
Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair the issue of the Open 
Waters Report came up in that Zoom meeting.  There was 
an allegation that the Open Waters Report was the – the 
everything to the commission.  That is was the beginning 
and end of our investigations.   
 
We made it repeatedly clear in that meeting that we 
look at whatever comes to us, we assess it but it does not 
dictate 
our 
investigative 
methods. 
 The 
role 
of 
the 
10 
commission is to take what previous forensic investigators 
and others have done and probe further and that is what 
we have done. 
 
And then what happened was we clarified that the 
day after in the 30 September letter and then there was 
also the response to the request about well where was Ms 
Kwinana implicated and how? 
 
And this is what was said Chair and I think it is 
important just to read this part into the record.  And Chair I 
do not want to delay time in this commission. We have so 
20 
little. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But Chair there are just repeated 
allegations both that I behave inappropriately and should 
be recused.  I will come to that in a moment.  That the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 21 of 257 
 
investigators act in a biased and unprincipled manner.  
Last week the Secretariat of the commission got told by Ms 
Mbanjwa that it acts with bad faith.  So it a litany of 
attacks 
on 
this 
commission, 
its 
Secretariat, 
its 
investigators and its legal team and there comes a point I 
submit Chair where it actually needs to be put to bed so 
that we can proceed with matters of great importance to 
this country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  This is what was said. 
10 
“In correspondence prior to the meeting” 
That is a reference to the Zoom meeting. 
“You asked the commission to indicate the 
respects in which Zano Spark Pty Limited 
had 
been 
implicated 
in 
the 
evidence 
presented before the commission.” 
Chair you will recall the R4.3 million comes from JM 
Aviation Ms Hendricks into Zano Spark’s account. 
“In response to this request the commission 
sent you a link of the transcript of the 
20 
evidence 
of 
Mr 
Vuyisile 
Ndzeku 
who 
testified before the commission on the 26 
August.  Mr Ndzeku’s testimony about that 
Zano 
Spark 
is 
clearly 
reflected 
in 
the 
transcript. 
 
At 
Monday’s 
meeting 
you 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296

demanded that the commission point out the 
specific parts of the transcript where Zano 
Spark was implicated.  This is not the role 
of 
the 
legal 
team 
of 
the 
commission 
particularly where a party against whom a 
summons 
has 
been 
issued 
is 
legally 
represented.  Nonetheless we draw your 
attention 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
evidence 
pertaining Zano Spark appears from pages” 
And 
then 
we 
give 
all 
the 
pages 
referenced 
in 
the 
10 
transcripts.  We then go on; 
“These passages from Mr Ndzeku’s testimony dealt 
with the fact that after JM Aviation made a R6 million 
profit on the sale of GPU’s to Swiss Port South Africa 
an aggregate amount of R4.3 million was paid by Mr 
Ndzeku to JM Aviation and his wife Ms Hendricks to 
Zano Spark.  This money was then paid out to Ms 
Kwinana’s personal account.  While Mr Ndzeku claimed 
that this money had been paid in order for Zano Spark 
to invest money in forex trading on his behalf the bank 
20 
statements show that the money was instead paid 
directly to Ms Kwinana.  In fact Zano Spark did not 
have any licence to trade in forex or any licenced 
financial service provider, which it would have required 
if it were to have been legally investing money on Mr 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 23 of 257 
 
Ndzeku’s behalf.   
Zano Spark, therefore, appeared to have been used to 
direct funds from JM Aviation to Ms Kwinana shortly 
after she seized to be a member of both SAA and SAA 
Technical. 
This implicates Zano Spark as a potential congruent for 
kickback payments from one of SAAT’s suppliers to its 
former chairperson, Ms Kwinana.” 
Chair, nothing could be clearer, I submit to you today, than 
precisely 
what 
the 
implication 
was. 
 
Precisely 
what 
10 
Ms Kwinana is going to be asked about in her question 
today. 
 
So the suggestion that we are playing cat and mouse in 
some way by not being upfront with Ms Kwinana about the 
allegations against her is again simply false. 
 
Chair, Ms Kwinana then just made reference in the 
passing to the fact that she has been advised that there will 
be an application for my recusal today.  Well, there is no 
application before you. 
 
And Chair, because of the repeated attacks on me 
20 
throughout our interactions in the correspondence with 
Ms Mbanjwa, what the secretariat eventually did on the 
28t h of October, which was last week, was made it very clear, 
that if there was to be a recusal application it would need to 
be brought timeously and appropriately.   
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 24 of 257 
 
 
Let me just read that letter into the record.  It is the 
letter of the 28t h of October at paragraph 7.  It says: 
“Finally, your letters contain numerous allegations of 
bias and improper conduct on the part of the 
Commission’s evidence leader, Ms Hofmeyr.   
If 
you 
regard 
her 
conduct 
as 
in 
any 
way 
compromising Ms Kwinana’s rights, you are invited 
to make any application you deem necessary to the 
Chairperson of the Commission. 
Please ensure that such application complies with 
10 
the rules of the Commission and is made out notice 
of motion supported by an affidavit.” 
 
The response to that came, I think it was the next...  No, 
even on the same day.  And the response from Ms Mbanjwa 
on the same day was: 
“Thank you for the legal advice on how to handle 
Ms Hofmeyr.  Please advise us what we should do 
about your prejudicial conduct.” 
 
This is writing to the secretariat towards Ms Kwinana i.e. 
withholding of the evidence bundle.  There was an issue of 
20 
an evidence bundle.  I take it to be resolved because 
Ms Kwinana did not raise it today. 
 
So Chair in summary.  Ms Kwinana was invited to 
engage this Commission as far back as November of 2019.  
She provided no affidavit nor did not meet with the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 25 of 257 
 
Commission 
until 
the 
28t h 
of 
September 
this 
year.  
Thereafter, she still failed to provide an affidavit despite 
being requested to do so and invited to do so.   
 
And eventually when no affidavit was forthcoming Chair, 
you issued a Regulation 10(6) directive to Ms Kwinana to ask 
her to please finally gives this Commission her account on 
various aspects.  That affidavit was furnished.  I will deal 
with it today.  It is brief. 
 
Subsequent 
to 
that, 
there 
was 
a 
request 
from 
Ms Kwinana to provide her with all of the Open Water’s 
10 
reports.  We did so and we asked her in preparation for 
today to draw the Commission’s particular attention to any 
parts of those reports to which she wanted to make specific 
reference today. 
 
She was invited to produce her own evidence bundle 
from the hundreds of documents, pages of documents that 
she requested and was provided with an no evidence bundle 
has to this moment been received by Ms Kwinana. 
 
So Chair with that background in place, there is no 
recusal application in respect of me before you today and so 
20 
my submission is that we get on with the work of this 
Commission.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Mbanjwa, Ms Hofmeyr was 
responding to Ms Kwinana’s address.  If you want to say 
something, not both of you can talk, namely Ms Kwinana and 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 26 of 257 
 
yourself.  Only one will respond.  You must decide whether it 
will be Ms Kwinana who responds or you will respond but 
only one of you will be allowed to respond. 
MS MBANJWA:   With your permission Chair, it will be me 
who will respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MBANJWA:   And if I can begin responding now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   You see Chair, the unfortunate part about 
this is.  There has been a statement that the allegation that 
there was no response to the specific letters in support.  You 
did point out Chair that, that letter which was in response 
should that it has been shown to Ms Kwinana and to myself.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
She 
says 
she 
knows 
the 
letter.  
Ms Kwinana said she knows the letter. 
MS MBANJWA:   If I recall well Chair.  What was 
Ms Kwinana said.  She said:  You are referring to an 
incorrect letter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   Be that as it may be.  And this is what I 
was objecting to in the beginning and I was saying.  I am 
placing the objection so that it covers all objections.  
Whenever a person is referred...  Whenever a document is 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 27 of 257 
 
placed in evidence, and I am saying this, well-aware that the 
Commission is not a Court of Law but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me...  Ms Mbanjwa, let me just 
tabulate to me first what the points are you want to respond 
to so that I can weight them and see whether there is really 
a need for us to delay the commencement of Ms Kwinana’s 
evidence. 
MS MBANJWA:   That is also our difficulty Chair.  When 
Ms Hofmeyr talks, she is free to floor.  And when we place 
something – and I think we are ...[indistinct]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   ...as legal representative ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Kwinana was ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   [Indistinct] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  No, no.  Ms Kwinana was 
allowed to talk.  You are allowed to talk.  You have 
previously been allowed to talk ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   No, Chair I was not allowed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not want you to take too long. 
MS MBANJWA:   Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to know and advance the points. 
MS MBANJWA:   Let us put it on record now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MBANJWA:   I have not been allowed to talk because 
what I am here to do is to represent Ms Kwinana.  And the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 28 of 257 
 
first thing I asked is not even ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa...  Ms Mbanjwa, I am not 
going to actually allow you to waste this Commission’s time.  
Tell me the points on which you want to respond. 
MS MBANJWA:   It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then I can assess whether it is necessary 
for me to give you time to respond on those points. 
MS MBANJWA:   It is the letters Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What about the letters?  What is the point 
about the letters? 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   We did not receive a response to the 
letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  You did not receive the...  
Ja, that is fine.  It is on record.  You have now said it.  What 
else?   
MS MBANJWA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What other point you want to address me 
on? 
MS MBANJWA:   It is the fact that it is not correct to say we 
received the response to this letter.  That is what I was 
20 
addressing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  If you say you did not 
receive the letters.  As far as I am concerned, at this stage, I 
am not even sure what is important about those letters for 
purposes of today.  If you say you did not receive those 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 29 of 257 
 
letters and Ms Hofmeyr says you received the letters 
...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   Can I address to say on the important 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   For purposes of today, what is the 
importance of that – of your response to that? 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair.  Thank you, Chair.  The 
importance of these letters and the reasons why they were 
written and the reason why a direct answer was needed is 
because we are taking the view that, what Ms Hofmeyr does 
10 
is to make conclusions on evidence that has not been tested 
and sometimes even incorrect.   
 
It is for that reason why we even provided the page on 
the letter to say this is what we say.  Please find the source 
of the argument.   
 
But in any event, what we are going to do Chair.  The 
reason why we needed to put this thing on record is because 
we are going to ask for your assistance that whenever a 
conclusion is made. 
 
And that conclusion is not based on evidence but it is 
20 
based on speculation or on the opinion of Ms Hofmeyr, we be 
allowed to object to that evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you see Ms Mbanjwa.  Ms Hofmeyr is 
not the Chairperson of the Commission.  Ms Hofmeyr is an 
entitled to put certain propositions to a witness and give the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 30 of 257 
 
witness an opportunity to respond to that.   
 
The witness is entitled to say:  But your proposition has 
got no foundation, no factual foundation because of A, B, C, 
D.  The witness gets that opportunity.   
 
Later on when you get an opportunity to either present 
argument or make written submissions with regard to client’s 
evidence, you be able to say:  The following propositions 
made by – put to my client to the witness by Ms Hofmeyr 
were incorrect.  Blah-blah-blah.   
 
And when you re-examine your client, you are entitled to 
10 
go to re-examine her on those propositions.  So there is 
really, most of the time, no need to interrupt the proceedings 
because I will give you a chance to re-examine.   
 
And the purpose of re-examination is, is to clarify things 
that might not have been clarified during the questioning.  
So you will get that chance. 
MS MBANJWA:   One last response Chair.  This is the 
second witness I am coming with to the Commission.  You 
will recall that we have a witness who testified Chair in 
February.  Up until today, we have not even received the 
20 
date for the re-examination.  That is number one.   
 
And secondly, the other prejudice which we suffer is 
this.  When Ms Hofmeyr makes these depositions which we 
are of the respectful view that they are unfounded and we 
are not allowed to respond.  Let us say for argument sake, 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 31 of 257 
 
because with the last witness, she took five days.   
 
And then when we ask for a chance to re-examine, we 
were told that we will only re-examine for two days.  Now if 
Ms Kwinana is going to be here for two days, using basic 
mathematical whatever, I think that we will only be given 50-
minutes to re-examine.   
 
It is for that reason why we are asking.  Chair, please.  
When a document is given to the witness, can she first 
before 
a 
conclusion 
is 
made 
about 
the 
document 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Ms Mbanjwa, you are not 
going to dictate to the evidence leader how to do her job.  I 
now you stop you addressing me.  I have asked you on what 
issues you want to address.  I now stop you from addressing 
me on those issues.  I have heard enough of you.  We need 
to move on.  Ms Hofmeyr, go ahead and start questioning 
Ms Kwinana. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kwinana, I would 
like to...  Oh, just before we begin.  Ms Kwinana’s evidence 
bundle Chair.  If we could enter it into the record as Bundle 
20 
BD33?  And as we have done previously.  When I go to 
specifics documents, we will identify them as the BD33 
exhibits and we will enter them individually with your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the file that we are going to use of 
the evidence of Ms Kwinana will refer to as BUNDLE BD33. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 32 of 257 
 
REFERENCE BUNDLE USED IN MS YAKHE KWINANA’S 
EVIDENCE IS MARKED AS BUNDLE BD33 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  And the first of those 
documents in the bundle is in fact the affidavit that 
Ms Kwinana did provide to the Commission in response to 
your Regulation 10(6) directive and it commences at page 1 
and it runs to page 10 with a single annexures, a 
memorandum of understanding annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if so if that can be Item 1 and Item 2? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It goes up to – the affidavit goes up to 
page... 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I see that this bundle appears to have 
only red numbers. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or my one, at least. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And there should ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Does yours also have only red 
pagination? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mine was printed at my computer at home 
which does not have colour printing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I have lost any colour but I suspect 
everyone else’s bundles have the red ...[intervenes]  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 33 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, the bundle in front of you.  
The page numbers at the top, have you got both written in 
red and those written in black or they have got only one 
colour? 
MS KWINANA:   Only red Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Only red? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the same with you Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   Thanks, Chair.  Thank you.  And we 
understand the numbering.  There was a gentleman here who 
10 
explained the numbering to us before we commenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, it is just that for quite some time 
now the bundles have been coming with two paginations, 
black and white. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we have been using black. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, right.  For us it will be red. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   As I have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So...  Anyway, that is the...  We will use 
20 
the only pagination that there is. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So it goes to...  The 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 34 of 257 
 
affidavit goes up to...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Page ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...page ten. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Kwinana, if I can then just 
commence with a bit about your background?  As I 
understand it you are an auditor.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what qualifications do you hold? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   I am a qualified Chartered Accountant. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I think you just need to move 
a bit closer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, please face this side and do not speak 
too far from the microphone so that I can hear you properly. 
MS KWINANA:   I am a Chartered Accountant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are a Chartered Accountant.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And are you registered with any 
professional bodies? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And which are they? 
MS KWINANA:   SAICA and IIA.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   IIA.  Thank you.  Just for the record.  And 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just for the record also.  Just 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 35 of 257 
 
give the full name of SAICA and IIA? 
MS KWINANA:   South African Institute of Chartered 
Accountants (SAICA) and Institute of Internal Auditors(IIA). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And...  Sorry, I did not just catch your 
degree, is which degree? 
MS KWINANA:   Bcom  Accounting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Bcom Accounting.  And where did you 
obtain it? 
MS KWINANA:   UNISA. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   UNISA.  And when ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   No, I obtained my Bcom at UNITRA(?) and 
Bcom Honours at UNISA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in what year was that? 
MS KWINANA:   Bcom 1985.  Bcom Honours 1990.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you joined the Board of SAA in 
December of 2009.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And do you recall how long the 
appointment was for? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you recall how long that first 
appointment was for? 
MS KWINANA:   The appointments are normally for three 
years subject to renewal. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 36 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you were reappointed on the 
19t h of September 2012.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not remember the dates Chair.  The 
reason 
being 
that 
there 
have 
been 
resignations 
and 
appointments and so on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you did serve a second three-year 
term, did you not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I did.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that would have been from 2012 if 
your first appointment was 2009, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you will just say yes into the microphone 
so that the transcribers can pick it up. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then in October of 2014 – so that is 
just short of the end of your second three-year term – you 
were retained on the Board of SAA when a number of 
members of the Board of SAA were not retained.  Do you 
recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  The six members who were not 
retained were six members who had for many months been 
trying to engage the minister about their concerns regarding 
Ms Myeni’s leadership of the board.  Do you have knowledge 
of those events? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 37 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Did 
you 
attend 
a 
meeting 
with 
Ms Lynne Brown shortly after she was appointed as the 
Minister of Public Enterprises to replace former Minister 
Gigaba in the middle of 2014 about these issues that the six 
board 
members 
were 
raising, 
concerning 
Ms 
Myeni’s 
conduct? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you have no recollection of Ms Myeni 
responding to the board members who were criticising her 
management and leadership-style in the early part of 2014? 
MS KWINANA:   In the meeting with the minister? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, you have confirmed for me, you were 
not at the meetings.  So then I would like to move to the fact 
that there was a letter of complaint with the minister and 
Ms Myeni in January of 2014.  And then there was a 
response to that by Ms Myeni sent to all the board members, 
which I assume would have included you.  Were you not 
20 
aware of that issue and her response? 
MS KWINANA:   If you can show me Chair, I would be able 
to say yes or no, I was in that meeting or I did receive it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  But as you sit here now, you do not 
have any independent recollection that six members of the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 38 of 257 
 
Board of SAA in early 2014 were very concerned about the 
leadership of Ms Myeni as the chairperson of the board? 
MS KWINANA:   I know that there has been some complaints 
but I would not say when was that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And when did you – when 
were you appointed to the Board of SAA Technical? 
MS KWINANA:   I will not have the date Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have a year? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe 2014 or 2015. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And do you recall when you were 
10 
appointed 
as 
the 
chairperson 
of 
the Audit 
and 
Risk 
Committee at SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   No, but I think the company secretary would 
be in a position to give you all those dates.  I really do not 
have that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is fine.  We will go to pertinent 
documents when it becomes relevant. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m.  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I was just getting a sense of the 
landscape of your background at SAA at this point. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I would then like to move to your 
relationship with Mr Vuyisile Ndzeku.  Now this is something 
that you did address in your affidavit in response to the 
Chairperson’s Regulation 10(6) directive and we can pick 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 39 of 257 
 
that up at page 8 of Exhibit BD33 in front of you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Ms Hofmeyr.  Unless I did not hear 
you.  It looks like you may have forgotten to ask Ms Kwinana 
to confirm that this is her affidavit and to ask me to admit it 
as an exhibit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We did admit it as an exhibit DCJ but that 
then I missed actually asking her to confirm her signature.  
So we issued it as the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...Exhibit 1, pages 1 to 10.  I think. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may have asked me and I did not 
hear.  Because I did not mark it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Normally, when I admit it, I mark it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, let us do that.  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But has she confirmed?  Or she has not 
confirmed that...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
let 
us 
get 
her 
to 
confirm 
it 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   That is my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and her signature.  Then I can admit it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if we turn to page 10.  Can you confirm 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 40 of 257 
 
that that is our signature, the first signature at page 10 at 
the top of the page? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that this is your affidavit that you 
deposed to on the 14t h of October? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you confirm the correctness and 
truths of the averments in that affidavit? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then Chair, if we could enter it as 
10 
Exhibit 1 in Bundle BD33? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   Thank you, Chair.  Apologies for missing 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure whether...  Maybe we should 
not just Exhibit 1 even if it is in this bundle. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what one would try do is, so that, if 
possible, every exhibit is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and the different number.  No matter 
which bundle it falls under. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe, we might say Exhibit BD33.1? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 41 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Chair, actually, if you go to the index, 
that is precisely how it has been arranged on the index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the document managers(?) were very 
helpful in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it will always be BD33 point something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And this will be BD33.1.  So the index will 
10 
cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so this – will this be 33, ja? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   33. 
CHAIRPERSON:   33. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  Point 1.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   33.1. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I might have said B1.  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Yakhe Kwinana starting 
at page 1 is admitted as Exhibit BD33.1. 
AFFIDAVIT OF MS YAKHE KWINANA IS ADMITTED AND 
20 
MARKED AS EXHIBIT BD33.1 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And we will follow that approach for the 
remainder. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 42 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then we were going to go to page 8 of 
that bundle and Exhibit BD33.1 Ms Kwinana because then 
you were asked by the Chairperson of the Commission to 
explain your relationship and interactions with Mr Ndzeku 
before, during and after your period on the board.  Can you 
tell us what the nature of your relationship was at various 
stages? 
MS KWINANA:   We have a professional relationship. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Not a personal one? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  And a professional relationship 
arising out of SAA and SAA Technical?  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Let me phrase it differently.  As I said in my 
affidavit.  I did not know Mr Ndzeku before I joined SAA.  
And I got to know him during the road shows when we were 
doing the BEE(?) road shows at SAA.  And my relationship, 
professional relationship continued after I left SAA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it started with Mr Ndzeku at SAA 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...pursuant to the road shows. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And those road shows occurred in 2015.  
Correct? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 43 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it persisted while you were at SAA 
Technical and SAA and then it continued afterwards.  Is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And prior to road shows, you had no other 
relationship with him? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it only remained a professional 
relationship, correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Even while you were at SAA and SAA 
Technical? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You had dealings with him around the 
Swissport Ground Handling Contract, did you not? 
MS KWINANA:   Not really. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, is...  Explain not really.  Did you or 
did you not? 
MS KWINANA:   I will not say yes or no but let me explain. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
MS KWINANA:   The only time that I met with him in respect 
of Swissport was when they wanted some like...  The 
Swissport Contract basically was – had a problem.  It was 
irregular.  And it had been extended for multiple periods of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 44 of 257 
 
time.  And the extension resulted in that contract being more 
expensive for SAA.  It was expensive, firstly.   
 
And secondly, it was tedious because after six months, 
there was the submission from management.  After every six 
months, 
submission 
from 
management 
and 
it 
became 
expensive.   
 
And therefore, when we wanted to regularise it because 
also again, if you are paying a contract a service without the 
roper contract, then that is an audit query.   
 
So during those meetings, there were also these road 
10 
shows that I was talking about where basically we were 
saying SAA is open for business to get people.   
 
And then I remember him in one meeting with the CEO 
of Swissport.  And in fact, that meeting did not even take five 
minutes.   
 
So basically that was the only time.  In fact, that was the 
only time that I met him and the CEO of Swissport. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And did you have any other 
interactions with him, telephonically or otherwise? 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, yes.  We had many telephone calls.  
20 
Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why? 
MS KWINANA:   You see, the BEE issue at SAA has been a 
problem and people do not know and did not know how to 
implement it.  We also did not know exactly how to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 45 of 257 
 
implement it.   
 
Hence, 
at 
some 
stage, 
we 
sought 
guidance 
from 
National Treasury to say:  How do we implement this BEE?  
So also in the road shows that we were doing, we were 
getting a lot of questions as to how do we intend doing this?   
 
Because basically, no one knew exactly what is it that 
needed to be done.  And therefore, many people wanted 
guidance including him. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at that meeting that you refer you 
where the CEO of Swissport was present and Mr Ndzeku was 
10 
present.  Who was the Swissport representative that you 
were dealing with namely? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I was not dealing with the Swissport 
person.  We were in that meeting trying to tell them that we 
are going to go out to tender because the contract is 
irregular and therefore we need to make sure that – because 
Swissport is also an important service provider of SAA.   
 
And therefore, there is no way that we would just not 
have a formal meeting to tell them.  But I do not remember 
why – did the meeting take such a short period of time.   
20 
 
And I have been trying to find out why did it happen like 
that.  I really cannot remember why did it happen like that.  
And as a result, if the CEO of Swissport can come to identify 
then.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So why were you then dealing with Mr 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 46 of 257 
 
Ndzeku?  I thought that he had been present at that 
meeting because he was a Swissport representative. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   He was a Swissport representative.  
However, when we talked on the phone we would talk about 
not necessarily Swissport, we would talk about BEE in 
general.  Yes.  So – and I understand Mr Ndzeku is 
responsible for many companies and therefore he would 
not say I am phoning on behalf of Swissport but he would 
10 
say tell me, how does this BEE work?  What is it that we 
should do for this BEE to work?  Give us the direction.  So 
basically, that is more or less what we would …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you give him direction? 
MS KWINANA:   As to the extent that I knew.  Remember 
that this BEE 30% set aside, we did not know exactly how 
to implement it, much as it was our desire to do it but we 
did not know.  So basically I would say let me go and 
consult and find out how do we do this thing because no 
one knew exactly how to implement the 30% set aside.  
20 
Hence there was a whole lot of media hype from Bidvest 
who was complaining and we – they reported us to National 
Treasury and they reported us to DTI that we are 
implementing the 30% set aside and in fact this 30% set 
aside, you know, much as we did not implement it, that is 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 47 of 257 
 
one of the things that I feel sad about them because I 
strongly feel that 30% set aside for the black people who 
represent 
70% 
of 
South Africa 
is 
still 
not 
enough.  
However, that pronouncement was made at the State of the 
Nation at the time but we did not know how to implement it 
and no one knew how to implement it but because of the 
will to want to empower black people, we had to make sure 
that we do start and unfortunately, it did not happen until I 
left. 
 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
30% 
set 
aside 
was 
not 
implemented during my time, unfortunately. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Ms Mbanjwa, please switch off 
your mic.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mbanjwa, my 
question was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies, Ms Mbanjwa just turned off 
her microphone.  Ms Kwinana, my question was about your 
conversations with Mr Ndzeku and you said he was seeking 
BEE guidance and then you said to him you did not know 
all that much because it was difficult to know how you were 
20 
going to implement the 30% set aside and so you said to 
him you would go and consult with others and come back to 
him.  Do I have your evidence correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then did you go back to him? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 48 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I would go back him.  I go back to 
everyone.  When I said I will go back, I do go back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what did you tell him when you went 
back? 
MS KWINANA:   I would tell him the information that I 
have, one person who would know some bit here and the 
other person would know some bit, the other person would 
know  – or say I do not know about this portion.  So 
basically …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you were advising him on bids. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   On? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Bids, did you say bids? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I am saying …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies. 
MS KWINANA:   Bits and bits of information. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh sorry.  Bits, I see.  Sorry, I did not 
hear that correctly.  So you gave him a bit of information 
here and a bit of information there about BEE suppliers 
and SAA and SAA Technical, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   No necessarily at SAA and SAA Technical.  
20 
As I am saying, he would not say how do you apply it at 
SAA?  He would say tell me about this BEE, not 
necessarily – he would not specifically say at SAA. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
But 
I 
thought 
you 
had 
only 
a 
professional relationship with him. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 49 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, we had a professional relationship, 
remember that …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Arising from SAA and SAA Technical? 
MS KWINANA:   Remember that I was not only a board 
member of SAA and he was not only servicing SAA.  So 
basically – and therefore, I would assume that when he 
wants the information on BEE and when I give him the 
information on BEE, I would not give him the information 
that I got at SAA, I would get the information from DTI, I 
would get the information from National Treasury, I would 
10 
get the information from our other clients how do you 
implement BEE and therefore I would say as far as I know, 
this is what is happening where, this is what is happening 
is where, this is where we are at SAA.  So basically I do 
not want you to limit what you are saying to SAA because 
he is a business person who is responsible for other 
companies other than SAA and I am also a business person 
responsible for other companies other than SAA.  So 
basically when you say the BEE at SAA, that does not 
correctly reflect our conversation. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So your professional relationship 
extended – ah, Chair, I see we are at the tea adjournment 
time.  Should we take the break now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we can take right now unless you 
particularly wanted to ask that [inaudible – speaking 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 50 of 257 
 
simultaneously] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no, there is going to be a bit more to 
explore.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So we can take the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea break.  I am going to 
take 
a 
longer 
tea 
break 
than 
normal 
to 
attend 
to 
something, we will try and make up for our late start this 
morning and this extended tea break in the afternoon.  I 
am available to sit beyond four and beyond five.  I can sit 
10 
up to six if we need to.  Let me check now.  Ms Mbanjwa, 
would that be fine with you?  Okay.  Ms Kwinana, would 
that be fine with you? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you very much.  We will 
take the tea adjournment now and we will resume at 
quarter to twelve.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us proceed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair and Ms 
Kwinana, I have just been notified by the sound people that 
it is sometimes to pick up your speaking, Ms Kwinana, so if 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 51 of 257 
 
you will just make sure that you move as close to the 
microphone 
as 
possible 
and 
feel 
free 
to 
leave 
the 
microphone on at all times. 
 
Ms Kwinana, just before the break we were just 
talking about your interactions with Mr Ndzeku and I 
understood you to say you had been to one meeting with 
him and that was the meeting with the Swissport CEO, is 
that correct?  
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you will just say yes for the record. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And that, was that the 
meeting on the 10 February 2016? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And there were no other 
meetings with Mr Ndzeku. 
MS KWINANA:   No that I remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But could there have been? 
MS KWINANA:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at the …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us check whether that is better 
for the sound people. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Oh, it seems to be better, I think I 
see a thumbs up, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 52 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Good. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I think, Ms Kwinana, your 
voice seems to be naturally soft or low so do try to raise it.  
Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And at that meeting on the 
10 February 2016, I understand you to say Mr Ndzeku was 
there and Mr Kohl, the CEO of Swissport, was there.  Were 
there any other representatives from any other entities 
there? 
MS KWINANA:   I think there were also people from 
10 
Bidvest. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS KWINANA:   And then there was also the CFO of SAA, 
Rolf Meyer. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  And Mr Daluxolo Peter, was he 
there? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I would not confirm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know Mr Daluxolo Peter? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And how do you know him? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   From the road shows. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   From the road shows as well.  What 
company did he represent? 
MS KWINANA:   He was going with Swissport people. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 53 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not know.  Do you know what 
company he was representing? 
MS KWINANA:   No.  My understanding was that he was 
part of Swissport. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Part of Swissport?  
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
So 
somewhere 
in 
the 
Swissport 
structure, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Not somebody outside of Swissport. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then just your conversations with Mr 
Ndzeku.  You said – we were sort of probing quite what 
they involved and you said you would speak to him quite 
regularly on the phone, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it was not confined to his role at 
Swissport, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You mentioned other companies in which 
he was involved, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I know that he is involved in other 
companies, so I said when we spoke he would not say now 
I speak on behalf of Swissport. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 54 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, certainly. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But he had other companies like JM 
Aviation, is that correct?  
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And any other companies that he would 
ever mention?  
MS KWINANA:   I do not know of any other companies. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, so if you were speaking at all 
about his business dealings it was likely to be Swissport or 
10 
JM Aviation, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I said, Chair, he would not say I am now 
speaking for Swissport and I am now speaking for JM. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you knew him only as affiliated with 
those two companies, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would he have had any reason to 
phone you and speak to you in the context of any other 
company 
other 
than 
SAA 
or 
SAAT 
in 
terms 
of 
his 
20 
interaction with you?  Could he approach you to talk about 
some other company of which you were not a board 
member? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair, sometimes he would phone 
and ask some financial advice, that he is buying something 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 55 of 257 
 
or maybe he is a buying a business somewhere and so on 
and so on.  So basically that would not be Swissport or... 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he would call you sometimes in 
regard to either his – in regard to his other personal 
matters or other business dealings in which he was 
involved that had nothing to do with SAA or such. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Would that have been in 
your capacity as a chartered accountant, auditor, or what 
was your understanding of why he would be talking to you 
10 
about such matters? 
MS KWINANA:   I would say in my capacity as a chartered 
accountant because like for instance he would say I am in 
the process of buying this business, I want you to advise 
me on - basically that would be financial matters because 
he knew that I am a chartered accountant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Were there only a few of such 
requests or which had nothing to do with SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   There would be, there would be a few. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There would be a few. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it on the basis that you would 
charge him fees or was it on the basis of just doing him a 
favour? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I would not charge him fees because 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 56 of 257 
 
maybe he would speak briefly, like say maybe one minute 
or two minutes and therefore I really would not – I would 
not charge fees.  I did not charge him anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  And, as I understand 
it, you indicated earlier that you do not have a very good 
recollection of that 10 February 2016 meeting, is that 
right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And – but you did say it was over in 
10 
about five minutes, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Ja, I think it was a very short meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Mr Kohl, the CEO of Swissport, 
has provided an affidavit to the Commission.  That was 
dealt within the previous evidence of Ms Memela.  I would 
like to take you to what he says about meeting and for that 
purpose I am going to ask you to be assisted and Zwelihle, 
the Chair ’s registrar, if he would not mind assisting the 
Chair.  We are going to need EXHIBIT DD25A.  Thank you. 
MS KWINANA:   May I ask, Chair, why is that not included 
20 
in my bundle? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because, Ms Kwinana, you were referred 
to the fact that you would be in addition to your bundle 
referred to the evidence of other witnesses.  Your lawyer 
was given a list of all of those witnesses.  She was told the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 57 of 257 
 
exact days on which they testified and she was told where 
their bundles could be obtained.  So you were given 
forewarning that I would take you to other bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the page number? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, we will turn to page 300, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   300.  And just before we go further, Ms 
Kwinana, I would just like to get a sense of how much of 
the Commission’s proceedings you have watched.  Did you 
watch Mr Nzeko’s evidence? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And how you watched Ms Memela’s 
evidence before the Commission? 
MS KWINANA:   Some of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Some of it.  She gave evidence both in 
February and then more recently on the 1 October.  Which 
of those did you watch? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I would not be able to say I watched 
this one.  No, I definitely will not be able to do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, but you have seen some of Ms 
20 
Memela’s evidence, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And you have confirmed you 
did see Mr Ndzeku’s.  Right, so let us go to page 300.  
Now, Chair, we have already dealt with this email because 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 58 of 257 
 
it was an email that we dealt with – well, let me go back a 
bit.  Mr Kohl’s affidavit was dealt with both in Mr Ndzeku’s 
evidence and in Ms Memela’s evidence.  It appears in Ms 
Memela’s bundle, DD25, which is why we have it in front of 
us at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what this is, is this is an email that 
Mr Kohl writes on the 12 February 2016 which is two days 
after the meeting on the 10 February 2016.  You can 
confirm, Ms Kwinana, that the meeting took place on the 10 
10 
February 2016, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   You know, I do not even think that I would 
call it a meeting. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Oh, 
right. 
 
Yes, 
five 
minutes 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Encounter. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Encounter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does encounter make it appropriate? 
MS KWINANA:   Okay.  Well, Mr Kohl thought that it was a 
meeting.  So let us go to paragraph 5 on page 300 of his 
20 
email 
of 
the 
12 
February 
and 
he 
is 
sending 
the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, so just to – let us record just 
who this email is from. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly, thank you.

CHAIRPERSON:   Who it is to and what the subject matter 
was. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this is an email from Mr Peter Kohl 
dated the 12 February 2016 sent at 6.58 in the morning 
and it is send to Andres Alvez, Johan Joose or Josse, 
probably, Ibrahim@waterfall.co.za, Yahya@waterfall.co.za, 
what appears to be Eric Bourne, Vuyo Ndzeku and also 
Werner@waterfall.co.za and the subject is 
10 
“SAA:  Critical situation”  
And it is recorded as having high importance and it is 
addressed to: 
“Dear Board Members of Swissport South Africa.” 
And then in that fifth paragraph he indicates – I said he 
thought it was meeting, well that is based on what he says 
in paragraph 5 and I would like to read that into the record.  
He records there: 
“Yakhe Kwinana chaired the meeting and declared 
that the purpose of the meeting is to finalise all 
20 
contractual matters and that no one will leave the 
room before an agreement has been reached and 
signed.  What sounded like a promising start quickly 
turned 
into 
calamity 
when 
both 
the 
head 
of 
procurement and Yakhe insisted that prior to the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 60 of 257 
 
parties finalising and signed contracts Swissport 
would 
be 
required 
to 
sign 
supplementary 
agreements 
emailed 
by 
SAA 
to 
Swissport 
in 
December 2015.  Yakhe informed the meeting 
attendees that if Swissport does not sign these 
agreements any deal is off the table and SAA would 
make a decision on whether it gives notice to 
Swissport and retenders the business.  Yakhe 
further informed that Swissport is to ignore the 
2012 tender award and that the new award of 
10 
December ’15 shall apply which contains additional 
requirements and two additional agreements.” 
And then he goes on to articulate: 
“SAA’s demand essentially boiled down to this:” 
Chair, I will just read the following two paragraphs also for 
Ms Kwinana’s benefit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He says: 
“SAA’s demand essentially boiled down to this:  
Swissport is to sign agreement …[intervenes] 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, where are you reading from now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 300. 
MS KWINANA:   Page 300? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am continuing after the fifth paragraph, 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 61 of 257 
 
I am now at the seventh paragraph.   
“Swissport is to sign…” 
Do you have it Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   7 is on the other side on 201. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you see the one she was reading 
that starts with: 
“Yakhe Kwinana chaired the meeting..” 
Can you see that one at page 300? 
MS KWINANA:   Ja, Kwinana’s demand.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then she was reading the paragraph – 
no, she was reading the paragraph that starts with: 
“Yakhe 
Kwinana 
chaired 
the 
meeting 
and 
declared…” 
Can you see that paragraph? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja.  She finished reading that.  She now 
wants to read the next one and she will tell you which one. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So then it goes on, after 
that first paragraph identifying you as having chaired the 
meeting and then it says: 
“SAA’s demand essentially boiled down to this:” 
And then it says the following. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 62 of 257 
 
“Swissport is to sign agreements which foresee 30% 
of the SAA revenues due to Swissport to be 
withheld by SAA.  SAA would subsequently divert 
these 30% to a BEE company of their choice which 
essentially equates to 30% of Swissport SAA’s 
revenues being diverted to charity.  Swissport would 
further commit to train staff of such company on 
how to run SAA ground handling operation so that 
the BEE company can eventually take over the job.  
In other words, of annual SAA revenues of 300 
10 
million, Swissport would need to part with 90 million 
in favour of a BEE company of SAA’s choice.  Apart 
from 
being 
illegal 
and 
entirely 
outside 
the 
provisions of the South African BBBEE Act, SAA’s 
demands 
would 
bankrupt 
Swissport’s 
ground 
handling business because the demand equates to 
more than twice the EBIT.” 
Could you just help us, what does EBIT stand for? 
MS KWINANA:   Earnings before interest and taxes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, please look this side and 
repeat? 
MS KWINANA:   Earnings before interest and taxes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So just to go back: 
“The demand equates to more than twice the EBIT 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 63 of 257 
 
Swissport generates with the entire ground handling 
activities in South Africa (not only SAA but all 
customers and business combined) hence Yakhe’s 
demand fell nothing short of demanding that the 
CEO of Swissport South Africa must sign on the 
spot that he accepts the bankruptcy of Swissport’s 
ground handling division or else SAA will sever the 
relationship with Swissport.” 
I think he says severe but he actually means to say sever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, does that refresh your 
memory about what transpired at that meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   Definitely no, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It does not? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why does it not? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember?  You do not 
remember the meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   There was a meeting, Chair, that is why I 
am saying it was an encounter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  So basically I do not remember us 
discussing this. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have no memory of that being 
discussed? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 64 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So is he just making up a very detailed 
account of a meeting two days after it occurred? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Kwinana, are you sure that it 
what you want to say?  Are you sure that you want to say 
he is making it up or do you want to say he might not be 
making it up but you might genuinely not be remembering 
because he decides to address this email to board 
members of Swissport South Africa and when you read 
10 
even just what Ms Hofmeyr was reading you can see it is 
something quite serious, that he takes very seriously.  Do 
you want to say he is fabricating all of that? 
MS KWINANA:   He is fabricating it, Chair.  There is no 
way that we would say – basically, how I understand him to 
say is that we are imposing 30% set aside on his company, 
that means we are now getting into the boardroom of his 
company which basically we cannot do that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So he has fabricated this, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  There was another attendee at 
that meeting also from Swissport who did notes of the 
meeting that bear a startling resemblance to Mr Kohl’s 
account two days later.  I would like to take you to his 
notes 
of 
the 
meeting 
you 
will 
find 
that 
at 
page 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 65 of 257 
 
…[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   Where are the minutes of the meeting 
because I will not agree to the notes that are taken outside 
the meeting.  Can you show me where are the minutes of 
this meeting? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Ms Kwinana, I am just going to put 
to 
you 
the 
notes 
taken 
by 
another 
Swissport 
representative. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair, but I need the minutes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
There 
were 
no 
minutes 
taken 
10 
unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, Ms Kwinana …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying you, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, answer the questions that 
will be put to you.  If you want to say I do not accept that 
this email or this note is a correct reflection of what was 
said because it is not the minutes of the meeting, you 
make that point.  Okay?  So let Ms Hofmeyr take you to the 
document that she wants to take you to.  She will then put 
the question to you, you respond to the question.  If you 
20 
want to say since that is not a minute of that meeting I am 
not accepting what is said there, you may make that point. 
MS KWINANA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, let us go to page 309 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 66 of 257 
 
of the same bundle.  That is DD25, for the record.  So 
…[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, I am not objecting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MBANJWA:   I just want a – initially Mrs Hofmeyr had 
said that she is taking Mrs Kwinana to the affidavit that 
was submitted by Peter Kohl.  I do not know, can I 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, I think you are right, she 
had said she was going to take us to the affidavit. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, apologies, these are exhibits to the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the affidavit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I just failed to give the reference to the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The affidavit commences at page 229. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and these are annexures to the 
affidavit. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  Apologies, I did move quickly 
ahead but Ms Mbanjwa is absolutely correct, the affidavit 
commences at 229, these are the exhibits to the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We have looked previously at EXHIBIT 6 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 67 of 257 
 
which was Mr Peter Kohl’s notes about the meeting two 
days after it occurred and then I am taking Ms Kwinana to 
page 309 which were meeting notes prepared by a Mr Bob 
Gurr, who was Swissport South Africa commercial director 
at the time and you will see these are meeting notes and 
under attendees, the attendees include Mr Kohl and Mr 
Gurr.  They also – Mr Peter, Mr Dulaxolo Peter was at that 
meeting.  Does that refresh your memory? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so you can confirm he was there. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you understood him to be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, Chair, I know that there is a 
pressure here about time but there is also a problem.  
Like, for instance, who Ms Hofmeyr has said this is the 
affidavit and this is an annexure to the affidavit, so 
personally I cannot relate this to the affidavit, I have to 
page and see if this EXHIBIT 6 is mentioned there.   Is it 
possible for you to guide us to your document [inaudible – 
20 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Mbanjwa …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   Then why do we not start with the affidavit 
so that it can also make sense for …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, please, will both of you just 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 68 of 257 
 
wait for your turn, okay?  Ms Mbanjwa… 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr says this is one of the 
annexures to Mr Kohl’s affidavit.  Mr Kohl’s affidavit and 
he has indicated – she has indicated on what page Mr 
Kohl’s affidavit starts.  Now she has no interest in going to 
the affidavit where the annexure is mentioned, you are 
supposed to have read the affidavit in advance if it is one 
of the documents that you were warned would be used and 
then you would know what the context is.  We cannot now 
10 
go there if Ms Hofmeyr …[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   If I can answer, Chair?  Generally if a 
person makes an affidavit and I know that Chair and Ms 
Hofmeyr will agree with me, if you have annexures to that 
affidavit, 
normally 
the 
annexures 
will 
be 
numbered 
annexure this and that.  So the difficulty I have is that save 
for the ipse dixit of Ms Hofmeyr to say that this is an 
annexure to this affidavit there is nothing [indistinct] 23.30 
the alleged annexure that links that annexure to the 
affidavit.  So that is all I was asking to say …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   How can I see [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But have you checked whether it is not 
referred to? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 69 of 257 
 
MS MBANJWA:   That is the first thing.  And then the 
second thing which I want answered chair, concerning this 
statement that I should have read this.  If you look at the 
letters which we had a problem with, one of the things that 
we asked in the letters, we have said we want the evidence 
bundle that is going to be given to Ms Kwinana and we 
were given documents and these documents were not part 
of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she said you were given the link to 
show – that told you where the find other evidence that will 
10 
be used. 
MS MBANJWA:   Which means then, Chair – it is like, for 
instance, this affidavit of Mr Kohl, which is here, because 
the way I understand it, if there is a document in terms of 
the rules of the Commission, if there is a document that 
implicates a party then a party is supposed to answer to 
that document.  I know that there is a problem of time.  It 
is like, for instance, when Mrs Kwinana wanted to mention 
those names she was told that she cannot yet she was not 
given a 3.2 for Mr Ndzeku. So if [inaudible – speaking 
20 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you are warned that the 
following documents will be or may be used during Ms 
Kwinana’s questioning, you are supposed to go through all 
of them because you have now been warned so that – well, 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 70 of 257 
 
go through them and she should - Ms Kwinana should also 
go through them so that you are ready – she is ready to be 
asked any questions in regard to that. 
MS MBANJWA:   If I can be directed to where, Chair, I was 
warned that there would be this affidavit of Peter Kohl I 
would appreciate. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly, Chair, just so that there is no 
suggestion of prejudice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   On the 28 October a letter went to Ms 
10 
Mbanjwa from the secretariat of the Commission making 
various proposals about how to deal with her evidence.  
Paragraph 5 the following is said: 
“In addition to the documents in Ms Kwinana’s 
bundle she will be referred to the evidence of the 
following witnesses who have testified before the 
Commission on aviation-related matters.  Below we 
have set out the relevant witness and the date on 
which they testified for your convenience.” 
That is followed by the table listing all of the witnesses 
20 
including Ms Memela.  The letter then goes on: 
“The 
transcripts 
of 
the 
evidence 
and 
witness 
bundles are uploaded on the Commission’s website.  
If you have any difficulties in accessing these 
documents on the website please let us now.” 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 71 of 257 
 
Let me also read into the record what the response from 
Ms Mbanjwa was to that paragraph of the letter on the 
same day: 
“We see the irrelevant list of witnesses furnished to 
us and note it for record purposes.  I must confess I 
always find it terribly irritating when things are done 
merely for show and without a true desire to assist.  
Please 
read 
paragraph 
3.3, 
Rules 
Governing 
Proceedings of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry 
into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and 
10 
Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of 
State.  You will see what ought to have been given 
to a witness and compare it to what has been given 
to us.” 
MS MBANJWA:   Can I respond, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, I wrote that letter and the reason 
why I wrote that letter is because for three weeks we had 
been asking for this evidence bundle and everybody knows 
that I am in private practice.  We wanted the evidence 
20 
bundle early.  We were giving the evidence bundle 
deliberately – I say it, Chair – at the very last minute.  I 
think we received it on Thursday.  
 
And the other thing, I want Ms Hofmeyr – because 
that I what I wanted her to do, I wanted her to refer there 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 72 of 257 
 
to something that said that Peter Kohl’s affidavit will be 
included because this affidavit of Peter Kohl was not even 
given to us, it was even requested by Ms Memela.  So if 
she can on that list refer me to something that says the 
evidence of Peter Kohl will be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought she said that letter is also 
in Ms Memela’s …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is in her bundle. 
MS MBANJWA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the bundle. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, that is why we wanted this 
correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   The affidavit of Peter Kohl was not part of 
Ms Memela’s bundle. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was. 
MS MBANJWA:   No – to a point where – we can maybe 
stand down and see because if I recall well, Mrs Memela, 
two affidavits that she wanted to be given to her was the 
affidavit of Peter Kohl and the affidavit of this other person 
20 
who spoke of GPUs.  You will remember, Chair, I even said 
that there has been suppression of evidence because that 
is 
the 
affidavit 
that 
explains 
clearly 
how 
the 
price 
determination of GPUs was made and Ms Memela’s name 
was not mentioned.  So she did not testify this question 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 73 of 257 
 
about these things, it was never put to Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me hear Ms Hofmeyr about whether 
Mr Kohl’s affidavit was one of the affidavits referred to. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it was, Chair.  It is in Ms Memela’s 
bundle.  The bundle that we all have before us at the 
moment is EXHIBIT DD25A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which is the first of three of Ms 
Memela’s bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Ms Mbanjwa was told last week that 
amongst the evidence and bundles that would be referred 
to in Ms Kwinana’s evidence was that of Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you have bundle DD25A, Ms 
Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, I am going to say this thing for the 
last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, just answer my questions, do 
you have that bundle? 
MS MBANJWA:   I have bundle what? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is Mr Kohl’s affidavit, Ms 
Hofmeyr? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 229. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It starts at page 229, correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got Mr Kohl’s affidavit 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 74 of 257 
 
…[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Starting at page 229? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have got that.  Are you now saying 
that you were not told that Mr Kohl’s affidavit is one of the 
affidavits that will be referred to? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, I was not told. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr, do you want to say 
something on that? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, Ms Mbanjwa was alerted to every 
single witness’s bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who was going to be referred to in Ms 
Kwinana’s evidence.  The bundles were - she was told are 
available and she was even invited to come back if there 
was any difficulty ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If there were any difficulties. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...on her part in accessing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And I guess ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair all that Ms Hofmeyr needs to do is 
to read the letter alerting you that’s all or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   ...that is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are going to move ahead now, I am 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 75 of 257 
 
satisfied that you were given the affidavit, you were alerted 
...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   No I wasn’t given Chair, we made 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us move ahead.  I do not want any 
wasting of the Commission’s time Ms Mbanjwa.   I do not 
want any wasting of the Commission’s time. 
MS MBANJWA:  And we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We don’t have time. 
MS MBANJWA:   Can we move ahead Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us proceed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We were going to look at page 309 
because that is the notes made by another attendee at the 
meeting on the 10 t h of February and they are meeting 
notes compiled by Mr Bob Gurr who is the commercial VP 
at Swissport and you will see their Ms Kwinana that Mr 
Gurr gives a very similar account of the meeting to the one 
that we looked at Mr Peter Kohl.  If you go down to the 
meeting notes you will see the first bullet on that page 
says: 
20 
“That the meeting commenced at 8 o’clock YK that 
is an indication that it is a reference to you from the 
code above opened the meeting by expressing the 
concern that SWPSA that also is a short hand for 
Swissport South Africa was delaying the process by 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 76 of 257 
 
introducing 
a 
non-standard 
agreement 
and 
not 
agreeing to the BBBEE terms as stipulated in SAA’s 
correspondence 
forwarded 
to 
Swissport 
in 
December 2015.” 
It goes on: 
“Yakhe Kwinana expectation was that feedback 
would be received from Swissport South Africa.” 
LP, who is that? Oh that is Lester Peter: 
“Advise no response received to date. PK – that is 
Mr Peter Kohl – advised that Swissport South Africa 
10 
had not proposed any changes to SAA’s original 
agreement template and had in fact responded to 
SAA’s correspondence of December.” 
And then Mr Gurr records: 
“Yakhe Kwinana indicated that the participants 
would be – and he puts in quotations “locked in the 
room until an agreement had been reached although 
she was required to attend a board meeting and 
may have to excuse herself.” 
And then it goes on you advise him that there were two 
20 
documents and there had been no agreement regarding the 
letter of intent and Mr Peter Kohl advised that Swissport 
could not take part in that 30% set aside arrangement.  Ms 
Kwinana again is this a false reporting of the meeting?           
MS KWINANA:   It is definitely a false reporting.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 77 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure about that?  
MS KWINANA:   100%, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, this is what Mr Gurr recorded.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, Mr Gurr. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   He was the commercial vice president of 
Swissport at the time and his exhibits referenced just for 
record purposes Chair if you go to Mr Kohl’s affidavit he 
introduces it at DD25 page 247 at paragraph 14.13.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So is my understanding correct that 
10 
these are two different people who have said something 
about what transpired at this meeting.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   One is what is called meeting notes and 
the other one in an email.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And certainly both of whom referred to 
Ms Kwinana having said something along the lines that 
they would be locked in the room until there was an 
agreement.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say both of them are fabricating 
the story.   
MS KWINANA:   Chair it is two different people from the 
same company and I am confident that they are fabricating 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 78 of 257 
 
it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Ms Hofmeyr.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember what that agreement 
was that they have been sent…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry maybe let me ask this 
question Ms Kwinana.  Do you know why they would find it 
necessary to fabricate a story about you in terms of what 
they say you said at that meeting.  Do you know of a 
reason why they would do that?  
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know anything.  
MS KWINANA:   But reading this it looks like there has 
been a previous meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   From reading this it looks there has been 
a previous meeting which I am not sure of which I may not 
have been part of because when they are saying Swissport 
was delaying the process of introducing a non-standard 
agreement which means that there may have been a 
meeting where this standard agreement was required and I 
20 
also do not know that.  So basically to me it seems as if 
this is a follow up meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that is you evidence of why it is 
fabricated, correct? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 79 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know why it is fabricated.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And they keep referring to an agreement 
that they got sent in December of 2015 in these accounts.  
Do you remember that they were sent the draft agreement 
in 2015 in December?  
MS KWINANA:   Was the agreement sent to me Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will ask you a different question.  Are 
you aware that they were sent a draft agreement in 
December of 2015? 
MS KWINANA:   No.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I continue to be concerned about the 
softness of your voice so please do not move away from 
the mic it is important I should hear what you have to say.  
Yes Ms Hofmeyr.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you did not make any reference to 
that at the meeting, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I also want to find out are they saying 
that that agreement was sent to me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair if we could just indicate to Ms 
Kwinana that I do not actually answer questions in these 
20 
proceedings I ask the questions.  So I am going to 
continue to sorry I do not answer questions I ask questions 
and I will happily direct you to the document.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if you seek clarification Ms Kwinana 
feel 
free 
to 
ask 
if 
you 
seek 
clarification 
and 
the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 80 of 257 
 
clarification would be required but otherwise the Evidence 
Leader will ask questions and you give answers.      
MS KWINANA:   Thank you Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see both recordable of the meeting 
say that the point of this December 2015 agreement that 
had been circulated and not signed was taken up by you.  
But I understand your evidence to be you do not know of a 
December 2015 agreement that was circulated to them.  Is 
that correct?  
MS KWINANA:   What meeting Chair.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not know? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and if I then show you that 
agreement that was circulated to them by Mr Lester Peter 
the Head of Procurement I just want to be sure whether 
you have ever seen it before.  You will find that earlier in 
the bundle at page 291.   
MS KWINANA:   Chair can I ask for some guidance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MBANJWA:   So that I do not necessarily object.  If 
20 
one goes to page 309 those meetings those of SAA and 
Swissport which Ms Kwinana is being examined on by the 
Evidence Leader.  If you turn to page 310 it is just written 
Bob, I cannot pronounce that name BP Commercial that 
document is not even signed.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 81 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you can raise that in your re-
examination. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, I just want to finalise because it is 
for that reason why we appear to be difficult because 
generally if anybody puts forward a document which a 
person is going to asked to question on at least the 
document should be authenticated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:  And we know the manner of authenticating 
documents in the Commission is that the person who has 
10 
the document who’s that document or affidavit for.  Which 
is now why my question is why is this witness being asked 
on a document that is not authenticated.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa I allow that she be asked 
on that I have allowed other witnesses to be asked 
questions where there is no affidavit on documents but 
when you re-examine you are free to take that issue up in 
re-examination.      
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair just for Ms Mbanjwa’s benefit this 
is not a document that actually is not supported by an 
20 
affidavit that is why I referenced page 247 paragraph 
14.13.  that is where Mr Kohl introduces both his notes of 
the meeting and the meeting notes and he makes it clear 
who the author was and that they are the records of the 
meeting on the Swissport’s side.  So they do actually enter 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 82 of 257 
 
this Commission attested to an affidavit, authentication of 
documents is not the point quite frankly.  
MS MBANJWA:   No I do not think you understand Ms 
Hofmeyr 
evidence. 
 
This 
documents 
come 
as 
an 
independent document remember what you are presenting 
to me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa even if it is an independent 
document I will allow it to be used to…[intervene] 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, but I was just saying that she is 
wrong Chair she does not understand this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No Ms Mbanjwa when I am speaking you 
do not speak.  I will allow her to ask questions to the 
witness.  The witness will be able to say yes I have an 
answer or you do not have an answer when you re-examine 
you can take the issue up at that stage. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair this agreement at page 291 is the 
agreement that Mr Lester Peter sent to amongst others to 
Mr Kohl on the 15 t h of December 2015 and I just wanted 
20 
you to take a look at it and tell us if you have any 
recollection of seeing this agreement previously?   
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I never saw this document 
before.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if none of what Mr Kohl and Mr Gurr 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 83 of 257 
 
record of what has happened at that meeting actually 
occurred on your version what did occur?  What happened 
at that meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   There was a short meeting and I do not 
know why was it a short meeting and I do not even 
remember that is why I was saying I would not even call it 
a meeting and in fact I do not know if you have got the 
minutes of the meeting that could remind me what was 
being discussed what was in the meeting.  But this 
agreement in front of me is my first time to see it Chair as 
10 
I am sitting here.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your evidence earlier was that it was a 
short meeting. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that you decided to go out to tender 
afterwards, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know if we said that we are going 
to go out to tender or we did go out to tender or maybe I 
would say maybe they went out to tender after I left.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Ms Kwinana your evidence earlier 
20 
was it was a short meeting. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you cancelled, those might not be 
your exact words but as I understood it and you will correct 
me if I am wrong you terminated the ongoing negotiations 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 84 of 257 
 
with Swissport so that you would go out and tender.  Did I 
have your evidence wrong?  
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I am saying what was going to 
be discussed in the meeting was going to see a contract 
your contract…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Kwinana first tell her whether her 
understanding of your earlier evidence is right or wrong 
that is her question.  
MS KWINANA:   What was your earlier evidence Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I understood your evidence earlier to be 
10 
it was a short meeting first…[intervene] 
MS KWINANA:   Wherein I would not even call it a 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on I know you have said 
encounter one but let her know your understanding of what 
you said and then you can say whether she understood 
your evidence correctly.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that it was communicated to 
Swissport at that meeting that negotiations with Swissport 
were going to seize and you were going to go out to 
20 
tender.  Did I understand your evidence correctly? 
MS KWINANA:   No.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   What did happen at the meeting? 
MS KWINANA:   The purpose of the meeting was to 
communicate that their contract has been irregular and 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 85 of 257 
 
therefore – because now I think now they were on a month 
to month basis and therefore if it is irregular and they are 
on a month to month basis then it requires that it goes out 
to tender.  That was the purpose of the meeting.  What was 
discussed in the five minutes or ten minutes or two minutes 
that I call an encounter.  I do not know if we said the 
purpose of the meeting is what because I do not even think 
that we sat down but I do not remember what transpired 
that made the meeting not to happen.   
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Ms 
Kwinana 
I 
am 
struggling 
to 
10 
understand that answer so let me just break it down a bit.  
You say the purpose of the meeting was to communicate to 
them that their contract was irregular.  Correct?  
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was that communicated to them? 
MS KWINANA:   That is what I do not remember because 
the meeting was short and in fact I do not know if you do 
have the minutes of that meeting where I would say of 
course SAA is big and we do take minutes when we do get 
to the meetings.  So now if in this bundle you have the 
20 
minutes of the meeting, the official minutes of the meeting 
please show me so that you can remind me what was 
discussed in that meeting.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana as I understand your 
evidence it was not even a meeting it was an encounter so 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 86 of 257 
 
why would there be minutes? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, then if it is then where are we going 
to with the minutes that you have just showed me of 
whoever.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana I just want to know what you 
remember.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana do you remember or do you 
not remember whether the purpose of the meeting was 
communicated to them?  
MS KWINANA:   I do not remember Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you the Chair of the encounter or 
meeting?  
MS KWINANA:   I was supposed to – what the Board asked 
me to do they asked me to go and support the CFO.  So 
which means therefore that the Chairperson of that meeting 
was supposed to be Wolff Meyer because my brief to the 
Board was to go and support and therefore if I go and 
support the person who would Chair the meeting would be 
Wolff Meyer.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not understand that Ms Kwinana 
20 
I thought that if there is a Board member it would be a 
Board member rather than an executive who would Chair 
meetings.  My own understanding would be that an 
executive cannot and would not Chair a meeting when 
there is a Board member because of seniority.    
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 87 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair it would depend on the status of 
the meeting.  If it is an operational meeting that would be 
chaired by an operational person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why would a Board member go to an 
operational meeting?   
MS KWINANA:   To give support. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For what because Board members are 
not supposed to be involved in operational matters is it 
not.   
MS KWINANA:   I was required Chair to go and give 
10 
support.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But why must a Board member go to a 
meeting which is supposed to deal with operational matters 
go there are there not other executives to give support to 
that executive? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair when this matter is discussed and 
any matter that is discussed there maybe strategic issues 
which needed to be taken up to the Board.  It does not 
necessarily mean that when a Board member is in a 
meeting we do attend the executive meetings which are 
20 
chaired by the executive members.  We go there either by 
invitation or to give support or to give guidance or to give 
direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you get yourself involved in 
operational matters as Board members?    
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 88 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Chair the operational people are guided 
by the Board.  They are given the support by the Board and 
they are directed by the Board and therefore I do not see 
anything wrong with that and we till this day still do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying Ms Kwinana there is 
nothing wrong in Board members getting involved in 
meetings 
where 
management 
and 
executives 
discuss 
operational matters, is that what you are telling me?   
MS KWINANA:   We do go Chair by invitation, we really go 
their Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say it is in order for a Board 
member to do that?  
MS KWINANA:   It is in order Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sjoe, ja Ms Hofmeyr.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  So Ms Kwinana I 
cannot recall what was actually said at the meeting but you 
have been clear about its purpose.   
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Its purpose was to communicate that the 
Swissport agreement was irregular and that it needed to go 
20 
out on tender.  Is that correct?  
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why did it not go out on tender? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe it is because of the processes 
Chair.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 89 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MS KWINANA:   We needed to follow the processes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But no processes at all were followed, 
why were they not followed? 
MS KWINANA:   You say no processes were followed.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   None.  
MS KWINANA:   And as I am sitting here I am saying there 
is no way that SAA will not follow the processes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well by the 15 t h of March remember this 
meeting was in the 10 t h of February 2016 by the 15 t h of 
10 
March SAA signed the ground handling agreement with 
Swissport for five years and there was no tender process 
between the 10 t h of February and the 15 t h of March.  Are 
you aware of that?   
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But then why were you not concerned 
that no tender process had been followed? 
MS KWINANA:   You know as a Board member you would 
sit here and say in fact it’s like 30% satisfied that I was 
talking about.  I would come here and say this must 
20 
happen, this must happen and you will find out that it has 
not happened because it is not practical for that to happen 
not because – like for instance me remember that the 
Board members still are supposed to be in the meeting 
three or four times a year.  Now when we come and say 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 90 of 257 
 
management needs to do A, B, C and D we do not know 
how practical that is and in fact it has been clear in the 
30% set aside.  Where we wanted to implement the 30% 
set aside and say management implement the 30% set 
aside and you find that it is not implementable.  So we may 
say this contract is irregular because we have been 
reading in the audit reports that this contract is irregular.  
For you to regularise this what you should do A, B, C, D 
and E and you will find out that A, B, C, D and E is not 
implementable maybe A, C and E is implementable but now 
10 
for you as a Board member you were think that A to D will 
be implementable.  So that could be what happened there.           
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana so let me just get clear.  So 
your evidence that at no point were you motivating for a 
BEE partner to be brought in with Swissport to obtain 30% 
of the Swissport ground handling agreement?  
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair what we were saying about the 
30% set aside was that the companies need to comply with 
BEE so which means therefore if Swissport and in fact that 
is the reason why Swissport did not have the BEE because 
20 
they were complying in terms of the scoring.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry I do not understand that as an 
answer to my question.  Did you at any point require 
Swissport to partner with a BEE partner on their ground 
handling agreement to the value of 30%? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 91 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  
MS KWINANA:   We said to them they must comply; we did 
not say partner with a BEE.  We said comply with BEE 
requirements.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when they were sent that draft 
agreement that required then to give 30% away that was 
done without your authority, is that correct?   
MS KWINANA:   Definitely.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Definitely and when Mr Darwa was 
10 
required to put letters of award together in order to 
facilitate the 30% to set aside and he resisted doing so 
that was not coming from you.  
MS KWINANA:   Definitely not.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what you were concerned about I 
understand your evidence to be is that proper processes 
were followed, is that right?  
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you wanted to make sure that the 
Swissport agreement was proper, you did.   
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And when you met with them on the 10 t h 
of February and your intention was to communicate to them 
that they needed to go on a tender process what would you 
then do to ensure that the tender process was followed?  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 92 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Chair I gave the direction to say this is 
what should happen the implementation is not mine.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   No because operational matters are not 
yours, are they? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you were at an operational meeting, 
encounter apologies your intention was to communicate 
that process had to be followed and you gave direction 
afterwards that process must be followed.  Is that correct?    
MS KWINANA:   To give support.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No you were at the meeting for support 
but you gave direction afterwards as I understand it that 
process must be followed.  
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not give direction you know SAA 
staff is highly qualified and SAA staff if you talking about 
the executive at SAA you are talking about – in fact 
including the manager at SAA it has highly qualified 
people. So basically when we say – in fact in each and 
every meeting, when we say regularise we do not tell them 
how because we really do not have to tell them how 
20 
because of the calibre of the people who are there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is also what I expected, I do 
not know what their qualifications were but anybody who is 
an executive at SAA I thought would not need you know a 
Board members support to deal with operational matters.  I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 93 of 257 
 
mean those people get paid a lot of money they are 
supposed to know what to do that is why I did not 
understand why you would have gone to a meeting to deal 
with operational matters to give support to the CEO or 
whoever or CFO or whoever the person was of SAA 
because those people should be able to handle those 
things without a Board member coming to give them any 
support.         
MS KWINANA:   Chair the issue of a BEE is a strategic 
issue and therefore that is why I was required to go and 
10 
give support and report to the Board.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But the CEO is supposed to give 
strategic direction leadership to the whole organisation as 
well.  He knows those things, he knows he is supposed to 
know what the priorities of the organisations are, he is 
supposed to know what the objectives of the organisations 
are, he is supposed to know what legislation must be 
complied with and if he does not know he can seek legal 
advice.   
MS KWINANA:   Chair that means your argument is saying 
20 
that there must not be a Board at all because the CEO is 
able to be strategic therefore there is no need for the 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the Board might give the overall 
strategy but in terms of who sees to the implementation is 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 94 of 257 
 
the executive, is it not and the CEO is at the top of that. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair I was required to go and give 
support …[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS KWINANA:   And in fact I did give the support and I 
reported it to the Board.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What form of support did you give in 
practical terms in that meeting?  
MS KWINANA:   Also Chairperson to make sure that I am 
there and whatever be it information that they would ask I 
10 
would also give direction and I would state how far are we 
with the implementation of that and what is National 
Treasury saying and what is DTI saying.  So basically that 
is the support that I would give. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I just wanted to pick up on one or two 
things you said that South African Airways has highly 
qualified people, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Oh yes, 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Does that include their lawyers? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In the legal department?    
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You would rely on them regularly, is that 
correct? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 95 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And another thing I just wanted to pick 
up on you said your view as that the Swissport agreement 
was irregular and that needed to go out on tender, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when in March a contract was 
concluded with Swissport without having gone out on 
tender, did you raise concerns about that? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair the contract was not concluded on 
the 26 t h of March. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I did not say the 26 t h of March I said in 
March. 
MS KWINANA:   In March, the contract was not concluded 
in March. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of 2016? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, the contract was not concluded and 
in fact for the reason that I have been saying in that we as 
the Board we would say do this and you will find out that to 
correct that does not necessarily mean that management 
do what the Board says but as long as they correct it to 
20 
make sure that we are not exposed.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why do you say the contract was not 
concluded in March 2016? 
MS KWINANA:   It was definitely it was not concluded. 
MS MBANJWA:   I got a concern. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 96 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MBANJWA:   Apologies Chair I think this is a document 
which we consulted on if you could just have sight of this 
contract that was concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, wait Ms Mbanjwa there is a question 
that has been put to the witness, the witness needs to deal 
with that question.  That is - why do you say the contract 
was not concluded 2016? 
MS KWINANA:  It is because I am not aware Chair of the 
contract that was concluded in March 2016. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you aware of a contract that was 
concluded some other time? 
MS KWINANA:  I am aware of the Swiss Port contract that 
was concluded in 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not aware of a contract that was 
concluded sometime in 2016 at any time? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And are you not aware of the contract in 
terms of which GPU’s from SAA Technical was required to be 
20 
purchased by Swiss Port? 
MS KWINANA:  I am aware of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is the same contract. 
MS KWINANA:  Where is this contract?  Is it here in this 
bundle? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 97 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You are aware of the contract that required 
Swiss Port to buy GPU’s from SAAT is that your evidence? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you not aware of a contract that was 
concluded for them to provide ground handling services for 
five years. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  From the 1 April 2016? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay they are the same contract.  I will 
10 
take you to them.  It is in the same – no, no sorry which 
bundle?  Oh I now need to go to Exhibit DD19 – 19.   
MS KWINANA:  DD25? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You were in DD25 we are now going to 
DD19 – 19 you will be assisted with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody will give it to you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  19 and it will be [a] sorry, DD19[a] thank 
you.   
MS KWINANA:  Are we done with this one? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We are done with DD25 for now.   
20 
MS KWINANA:  DD25 you want us to put it away? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We will not need it immediately no so you 
can just have DD19[a] in front of you.  And Chair we will be 
picking it up at page 132.44, 132.44. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes I have got it. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 98 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  132.44.  If I may just take a moment. 
MS KWINANA:  Is this the IATA Standard Ground Handling 
Agreement?  
CHAIRPERSON:  She will tell you just now. 
MS KWINANA:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies was there a question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was asking whether it is the document 
headed IATA Standard Ground Handling Agreement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana this agreement just before we 
go further on it.  So it is your evidence today before this 
commission that when you were a board member of SAA in 
March of 2016 you were not aware that this agreement had 
been concluded, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And – but you were aware of the 
requirement that Swiss Port buy GPU’s from SAAT, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Where did that obligation come from? 
MS KWINANA:  It came from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look this side Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  It came… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know a lot of people like looking at the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 99 of 257 
 
evidence leader. 
MS KWINANA:  It came from the fact that I think there was 
going to be some extension of what Swiss Port was currently 
doing where basically I think SAAT had bought with the 
previous contract I think it was 2015 SAAT was supposed to 
do the in-house of in-source other things that they were 
doing which required the ground power units.   
And then now they required licence from ACSA and 
then there seemed to be some challenges in respect of this 
licence and therefore they – Swiss Port ended up with those 
10 
month to month or six month renewal ended up doing the 
work that was supposed to be done by the in-house people.  
So now to give – because now SAA Technical would not be in 
a position to do what they did and then now in fact I was 
think – like we would pushed in a corner as SAA because of 
the licence and therefore in the circumstances especially 
with Swiss Port maybe and other companies we would not be 
able to perform the functions if for instance they said tools 
down, we are putting – we are doing tools down now.  
Because they are the ones who would be having the licence 
20 
to carry on ground handling.   
So it is for this reason that Swiss Port had to 
continue with the contract that they had but now regularise 
it.  That means you do whatever was supposed to have been 
done in 2012 then that needed to be done then because 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 100 of 257 
 
there was no way that we would say, go because that is the 
job that they have the licence for and SAA Technical did not 
have the licence for.   
So basically my understanding from where I am 
sitting is that we were regularising the contract that 
happened in 2012.  That is my understanding. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana what was the question I asked 
you? 
MS KWINANA:  I cannot remember Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The question was where did the obligation 
10 
for Swiss Port to buy GPU’s come from if not the agreement 
between Swiss Port and SAA? 
MS KWINANA:  I will not say it came from the agreement.  It 
came from the board meeting.  I do not know if the 
agreement followed the board meeting but it came from a 
board meeting where it was noted that SAA Technical cannot 
do this work and this work requires the licence which Swiss 
Port had the licence and therefore the agreement to buy 
GPU’s came from the meeting.   
I do not know about the agreement between Swiss 
20 
Port and SAA in respect of the contract like the bidder 
contract.  But now in respect of the GPU’s I know that it 
came from a meeting whether then from a meeting it 
translated into an agreement I do not know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why did you not know about the SAA Swiss 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 101 of 257 
 
Port ground handling agreement for five years if you as a 
board member approved it? 
MS KWINANA:  The agreement in 2012 I know about it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No the agreement in March 2016 was 
approved by the board as it had to be because it is an 
agreement worth more than R1 billion. 
MS KWINANA:  The agreement Chair is not handled by the 
board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No it had to be approved by the board. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes which … 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So how could you not know about an 
agreement that you approved? 
MS KWINANA:  Which has to be approved.  It has to be 
approved the board.  The agreement has to be approved by 
the board but I do not remember approving the agreement in 
2016.  However I remember approving the agreement in 
2012.  And in 2016 I remember us discussing the sale of 
GPU’s – the GPU’s to be sold to Swiss Port because now 
Swiss Port needs to continue with the agreement that they 
have. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So how then did you give your assent to 
the approval of a contract that you did not know had been 
entered into? 
MS KWINANA:  Which contract?  The GPU’s? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The Swiss Port ground handling contract of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 102 of 257 
 
March 2016? 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying I approved the ground handling. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No you approved the SAA Swiss Port 
ground handling contract. 
MS KWINANA:  No, no.  I did not approve the contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well let us go to the agreement that you do 
not recall as at page 132.44.  You will see on the last page 
of it which is at 132.52 that it was concluded on the 15 
March 2016. 
MS KWINANA:  You know… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the last – I am sorry. 
MS KWINANA:  I think what will work for me is the – is the 
board resolution that results from this because I am not 
responsible for the agreement but I am responsible for the 
decision of the board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Chair I have just begun by directing Ms 
Kwinana to the agreement that was concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you see that Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you see that it was concluded in March 
of 2016? 
MS KWINANA:  Ja it does not matter which year because as 
I said I am responsible – you need to show me the board 
resolution. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 103 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
MS KWINANA:  That results from this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana hang on.  Just answer the 
question she is asking you.  Do not answer questions she 
has not asked because then it will waste time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Then I would like to take you to a 
particular clause in this agreement because it is the clause 
that required Swiss Port to buy the SAAT GPU’s.  That is the 
one that you do remember, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Sorry Chair I am not going to answer 
10 
anything on this agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second. 
MS KWINANA:  I will answer something on the board 
resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana hang on one second.  Your 
attorney’s drawing my attention to her. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MBANJWA:  I actually wanted to refresh that board 
resolution and we are not being obstructive here.  The 
20 
witness has said many times that she was a board member 
so what she would approve would be contained in the 
board resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why should that not wait until you re-
examine Ms Mbanjwa? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 104 of 257 
 
ADV MBANJWA:  No the witness Chair is wanting the 
board resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the evidence leader  
[SPEAKING OVER ONE ANOTHER] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The evidence leader is directing what she 
is doing and you are here to look after the interest of the 
witness.   You will pick up what the witness wants and 
when you re-examine you will go there. 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair with all due respects.  The 
witness is saying please give me the board resolution 
10 
where I [Chair speaking over Ms Mbanjwa] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let the evidence leader handle that. 
ADV MBANJWA:  How is she going to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are overruled Ms Mbanjwa.  Ms 
Hofmeyr continue.  I really do not want any wasting of time 
this time Ms Mbanjwa.  Please let us go ahead. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let us – thank you Chair.  So I am going 
to take you to the clause of this agreement which is the 
very clause… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Ms Mbanjwa.  I am sorry Ms 
20 
Hofmeyr.  The more you – you interrupt Ms Hofmeyr while 
she is questioning Ms Kwinana the more the impression is 
you are trying to assist Ms Kwinana when she might not be 
needing your assistance.  She is able to deal with the 
questions on her own. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 105 of 257 
 
ADV MBANJWA:  No Chair I disagree.  What is Ms 
Kwinana… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is the end of – that is the end 
of – of that issue now. 
ADV MBANJWA:  She is not – she is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the end of that issue now.  Go 
ahead Ms Hofmeyr.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So Ms Kwinana your 
evidence is that you did recall that Swiss Port had an 
obligation to buy SAAT GUP’s, is that correct? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that obligation arises from this very 
agreement and that is why I want to take you to it.  You will 
find it at page 132.49. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair as I said before I am not going to 
refer to this agreement.  I am going to refer to the board 
resolution that results in this agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at 132.49 Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So Chair at that page and Ms 
Kwinana you will see under Clause 8 it says: 
20 
“Equipment and Enterprise Development.” 
And then there is Clause 8.1 which talks about continuing 
improvement of its BEEE and promoting the government’s 
developmental agenda.  It say: 
“The handling company will sub-contract 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 106 of 257 
 
some 
of 
its 
services 
or 
enter 
into 
agreements 
with 
51% 
black 
owned 
companies that have the representation of 
all 
either 
of 
women, 
youths, 
disabled 
persons 
and 
military 
veterans 
for 
the 
purchase of equipment required as part of 
its investments to this agreement.” 
That is the BEEE aspect that you were concerned about on 
your evidence.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair as I said I am definitely not going to 
10 
refer to this agreement.  If you show me the board 
resolution that talks to that then I will say, yes Chair you 
are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you know about this 51% black 
owned companies referred to here and agreements that 
were to be entered into with 51% black owned companies 
that are mentioned here even if you do not know the 
agreement? 
MS KWINANA:  Where are they mentioned? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is page – it is para – it is page 132.49. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The page that we were…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if you do not – in other words even 
if you do not know the agreement but you know the issue 
that is covered there? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it is Clause 8.1 that I read out. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 107 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:  I heard of continuous improvement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed.  I stopped there because 
that is the point that you have been testifying about.  That 
you were there for your support at the Swiss Port meeting 
because of your guidance on BEEE matters, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair – Chair we were talking about the 
30% set aside basically that is what we have been talking 
about.  Now we tried the 30% set aside and it was hugely 
rejected 
and 
we 
ended 
up 
not 
implementing 
it 
and 
10 
therefore even if it was talking about the 30% set aside 
there the 30% set aside was never implemented because of 
the 
resistance 
from 
companies 
like 
[00:16:33], 
like 
National Treasury, like DTI.  So basically the 51% that is 
being said there I am not aware of. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana do you remember … 
MS KWINANA:  However I do support the 51% as I said 
before 30% is small. 51% is small it would be better if it 
was 70% so that it is represents the demographics of South 
Africa. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you remember what my question was? 
MS KWINANA:  I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The question was I understood your 
evidence to be that you were at the meeting with Swiss 
Port in February. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 108 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In order to offer guidance of BEEE 
matters, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Support? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Support. 
MS KWINANA:  On BEEE matters. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now Clause 8.3 the one I 
was about to get to is the clause that requires Swiss Port 
to the SAAT GPU’s.  The one that you do have recollection 
of. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It reads: 
“The handing company – that is Swiss Port 
agrees 
to 
purchase 
and 
or 
arrange 
purchase of all recently acquired surplus 
SAAT GPU’s at current book value fair 
market value or other such valuation as 
mutually agreed.” 
Do you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:  Let me read it.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is the clause that was referred to at 
the SAAT board meeting. 
MS KWINANA:  
“The handling company agrees to purchase 
and or arrange purchase of all recently 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 109 of 257 
 
acquired” 
Basically this would be the implementation which basically 
does not have anything to do with the board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But this is the very clause that was dealt 
with at the SAAT board meeting when you discussed the 
sale of the GPU’s to Swiss Port.  So how could you not 
know about this agreement if this is the clause that 
required Swiss Port to buy the GPU’s? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I do not know the agreement 
however is you show me the board resolution then I will 
10 
know the board resolution.  I am not part of the agreement.  
I am part of the board resolutions. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let us go to the board resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – oh okay.  Alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Page 132.43 it is a few pages back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  13? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  132.43.   
CHAIRPERSON:  132.43. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  3 – yes Chair.  And let me read it into the 
record because it is of some importance to Ms Kwinana. 
20 
“This is the SAA Board of Directors written 
resolution Number 2016/B05.  Request for 
SAA 
board 
to 
approve 
the 
Terms 
and 
Conditions of the Swiss Port SA Contract 
and 
note 
the 
contract 
duration 
period 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 110 of 257 
 
effective from 1 April 2016 until 31 March 
2021 for ground handling 
services and 
cargo services to be rendered at South 
Africa – Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, 
Port Elizabeth and East London.” 
And then the document records: 
“The board by Round Robin Resolution – by 
Round Robin 2016/B05 as of 14 March 2016 
resolved to  
1. Approve the contract to be entered into with 
10 
Swiss Port South African for the duration of 
five years commencing on 1 April 2016 to 
31 March 2021 covering ramp handling, 
PAU’s, wheel chairs, GPU’s and air side 
crew 
transport 
to 
be 
rendered 
at 
Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port 
Elizabeth 
and 
East 
London 
with 
the 
following conditions. 
a. Swiss Port South Africa to acquire all 
GPU equipment that has been purchased 
20 
by SAAT. 
b. Swiss Port South Africa to enter into a 
contract with a BEEE company that has 
representation of black women, youth, 
military veterans and disabled person 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 111 of 257 
 
from which Swiss Port will purchase all 
their equipment required for the SAA 
contract. 
2. Note the feedback of the negotiations and 
approve executing of the contract with 
Swiss Port South Africa.” 
So Ms Kwinana you did approve the contract, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  This is an approval of the Terms and 
Conditions and note the contract duration.  That is 
basically what we approved yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but until this moment you have no 
knowledge of this contract, correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Maybe I would say to me that is not a 
contract because the contract because the contract was 
entered into in 2012. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No the contract was entered into in 
March of 2016. 
MS KWINANA:  This contract… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And as a board member you were 
required to approve its Terms and Conditions.  How could 
20 
you approve its Terms and Conditions if you had no 
knowledge of the contract? 
MS KWINANA:  That is what I am saying.  I had the 
knowledge of the contract that was entered into in 2012. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right so your approved… 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 112 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Ms Kwinana you know that Ms 
Hofmeyr is not talking about the 2012 contract.  She has 
told you that quite a few times.  We are talking about the 
contract of March 2016.  This resolution is about that. 
MS KWINANA:  This resolution Chair maybe it is because I 
am not a lawyer.  This resolution basically for me it is 
noting the contract duration and approving the Terms and 
Conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes now did you not approve the contract 
the Terms and Conditions of the contract then? 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Yes we approved it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did approve them. 
MS KWINANA:  Conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how could you approve a contract that 
you did not know?  Because you have said you do not know 
that contract.  I have just stopped you from going back to 
the 2012 contract now to remind you that Ms Hofmeyr is 
talking about the March 2016 contract.  Now she has 
shown you a resolution, you agree that you approved so 
how could you have approved a contract without knowing 
20 
it? 
MS KWINANA:  Considering that it is stated like this Chair 
if you say then I approved here that is fine let us continue 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but the question remains, how could 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 113 of 257 
 
you have approved a contract you did not know? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I did not think that this is a contract.  
I thought we were approving only the Terms and Conditions 
not the whole contract.  The whole contract would have the 
whole lot of things… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana 
MS KWINANA:  Including the price and everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  And then the Terms of Conditions… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are a chartered accountant. You are 
a chartered accountant.  You have said you have approved 
this contract.  Initially you said you did not know about this 
contract.  You were shown a resolution, you accept that 
you – you approved the contract now what are you saying? 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You saying you do not know the contract.  
You know the Terms and Conditions. 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying Chair my knowledge of the 
20 
contract … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying Chair my knowledge of the 
contract when Ms Hofmeyr is saying I am approving the 
contract the contract will start from page 1 up to the last 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 114 of 257 
 
page.  However the Terms and Conditions would be part of 
the contract not the whole contract and therefore Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Precisely 
because 
the 
Terms 
and 
Conditions of a contract are part of the contract.  It is 
precisely because of that that you know the contract if you 
say you approved the Terms and Conditions.  What is 
perplexing is that you say you do not know the contract but 
you know the Terms? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair.  I am saying my understanding is 
that as I was saying the Terms and Conditions would be 
10 
included as part of a bigger document.  That is what I 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  That is number 1.  Number 2 these Terms 
and Conditions of this contract my understanding was that 
they were the Terms and Conditions of the contract that 
was entered many years ago.   
So now when you are saying therefore the contract 
was entered into in March 2016 that means therefore here 
you 
are 
saying 
we 
were 
approving 
the 
Terms 
and 
20 
Conditions of the contract that was entered into in March 
2016.   
But now my question would be why would we 
approve 
only 
the 
Terms 
and 
Conditions 
instead 
of 
approving the whole contract? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 115 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean you cannot – Ms Kwinana you 
cannot know the Terms and Conditions of a contract 
without knowing the contract.   
MS KWINANA:  Of course you can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the Terms and Conditions are 
the contract.  A contract has got Terms and Conditions and 
if you know the Terms and Conditions you know the 
contract.  Is it not? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I think we should continue. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Chair if I might interrupt you? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana do you accept what I am 
saying that a contract consists of Terms and Conditions. 
MS KWINANA:  And other information. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
if 
you 
know 
the 
Terms 
and 
Conditions it means you know the contract.  Do you accept 
that? 
MS KWINANA:  And other information Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS KWINANA:  And other information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we are not talking about other 
20 
information. 
MS KWINANA:  And not only the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are talking about the Terms and 
Conditions.  I am not talking about what is the address of 
the parties or the addresses of the parties to the contract.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 116 of 257 
 
We are talking about the Terms and Conditions.  Do you 
accept that if you know the Terms and Conditions you 
therefore know the contract? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Ms Mbanjwa what did you 
want to say? 
ADV MBANJWA:  What I wanted to say Chair is I am – I do 
not know if this is not one of those issues we should write 
down for re-examination.  Because I also got a [00:27:12].  
Because in the beginning and we have consulted with – in 
10 
the beginning what the witness was saying later on was the 
fact that Swiss Port without a tender was awarded a 
contract so I think we will need time.  I do not want to 
waste your time now to bring in that clarification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Because where it suddenly jumped from 
if they had tenders for this of ground handling services to 
this specific contract and got [00:27:42] with the disposal 
of GPU’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  Just make a note so 
20 
when you re-examine if necessary you can raise that for 
clarification. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
We 
– 
we 
should 
take 
the 
lunch 
adjournment Ms Hofmeyr. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 117 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless you wanted to… 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
No, 
no 
it 
is 
appropriate 
on 
my 
questioning to do so now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right we will take the lunch 
adjournment and we will resume at quarter past two 
because it is about fourteen minutes past one now. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kwinana, do you 
know Mr Nick Linnell? 
MS KWINANA:   [microphone on mute] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you will just turn on your microphone.  
Sorry.  So if you will just give the answer again just for the 
20 
recording. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you have ...[intervenes]  
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, colleague.  Chair, my apologies.  I 
think Chair allowed us that we can give one clarification on 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 118 of 257 
 
the confusing question.  If...  She can just answer now where 
we said if we could just be given clarification if going – if 
Ms Kwinana was going to talk, 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think I said there you can raise 
it in re-examination. 
MS MBANJWA:   Oh, not now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, not now. 
MS MBANJWA:   That is correct, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  What dealings did you 
10 
have with him while you were at SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   He used to attend our – some meetings. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which meetings were those? 
MS KWINANA:   Mainly board meetings or committee 
meetings.  I do not remember exactly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why would he attend board and committee 
meetings? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not know why he was there? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you not ask about an outside, a third 
party being present at your board and committee meetings? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you not ask?  I mean, a board 
meeting is supposed to be for board members.  And if you 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 119 of 257 
 
see there is an outside, how can you keep quiet?  An outside 
is being – is hearing what the board is discussing or a 
committee of the board may be discussing, which might 
include sensitive matters that should not be matters for 
outsiders. 
MS KWINANA:   In some meetings Chair we would have 
outsiders by invitation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   In some meetings Chair we would have 
outsiders by invitation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  So I would not know who has invited 
him, in what capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   And in fact, Chair.  In the meetings that we 
would attend, I do not think there is any board member who 
questioned what his role is there.  So basically, it was not 
only me who did not question it.  No one questioned his 
existence at the board.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see.  It might be bad enough if 
20 
one board member anticipates in discussions of SAA matters 
that are supposed to be discussed by the board, some of 
which may be sensitive matters.  In the presence of an 
outside without satisfying herself that there is a good reason 
for an outsider to be present but once...   
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 120 of 257 
 
 
It is a number of members of the board who behaves like 
that, then it may be worse because if a matter is supposed to 
be discussed by a board – unless there is a good reason for 
somebody who is not a member of the board – no one of the 
board who is not a member should be privy to the 
discussions.   
MS KWINANA:   Chair, as I said.  People who are not 
members of the board would be invited from time to time to 
attend the board meetings.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that does not answer the 
10 
question.  Nobody should attend board meetings who is not a 
board member unless there is a good reason.  And every 
board member who sees an outside should seek to know why 
is this outside here.  What is the reason?  So as to evaluate 
whether there is a good reason for this outside to be in a 
board meeting when he or she is not a board member.  You 
understand? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not understand Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not understand? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your view that anybody who is not – or 
was your view at the time that anybody could attend a board 
meeting of the Board of SAA even if there was no good 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 121 of 257 
 
reason?  If they just wanted to listen what you are talking 
about? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the board members would, when 
necessary, invite members from outside who are not board 
members to attend the board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When necessary ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   That is how it stands.  Yes, when necessary.  
Like for instance, at SAA Technical we had ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you do not have to give examples.  
When you say when necessary ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I am happy to accept that. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But does that not mean that board 
members must be satisfied that it is necessary for this 
person to be here? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise, any member of the board could 
object if he or she does not think it is necessary for that 
particular person to attend the board meeting, is it not? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I understood you to say you 
did not know why he was attending.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not know say I did not know why.  I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 122 of 257 
 
was saying, as and when necessary, some outsiders would 
be invited to the board meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I was asking in particular to 
Mr Linnell.  Why was he at those board meetings and 
committee meetings, and your answer was you did not know.  
Do you recall giving that evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Which evidence? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You testified a moment ago when I said to 
you:  Why was he at the board and committee meetings?  
And your answer was:  I do not know.   
10 
MS KWINANA:   I may not know Chair but the person who 
would invite him would know why is he in the meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So at any point in those meetings that he 
attended, did it ever get revealed to you why it was 
necessary for him to be there? 
MS KWINANA:   Sometimes Chair they would make the 
presentations.  Sometimes they would offer an opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Kwinana.  The question is not 
what he did.   
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether it was never 
disclosed to you why he had been invited or why he was 
there. 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 123 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you, other than those board and 
committee meetings that he may have attended from time to 
time, have other interactions with him? 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, can you repeat your question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sure.  Other than the time that he 
attended those board and committee meetings, did you 
yourself had other interactions with him? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  And those board meetings – I think 
you have indicated earlier happened about four times a 
years.  Is that right?  The scheduled ones. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And can you give me a sense?  So in an 
average year, how many of those meetings might he have 
attended? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I would not say on average how many 
times. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was he always there or only sometimes? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Only sometimes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you ever seek advice from him? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you did have interactions outside of 
the board meetings and committee meetings? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 124 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Also in the meetings.  Like for instance, our 
understanding of Nick Linnell is that he is a legal person.  So 
basically, if there is some legal matters like something that 
when he is limiting(?), the board would require like a quick 
legal opinion that does not require maybe a research or 
something.  He is in a meeting and then we would say for 
instance:  What do you think about this? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Ms Kwinana, what about all the highly 
qualified lawyers within SAA?  Why did you not ask them 
those questions? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   No, those would not be the structured 
previous questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those would not be what? 
MS KWINANA:   Those would not pre-prepared questions.  
Like for instance, we know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the question is.  Instead of favouring 
Mr Linnell at meetings of the board or some committees and 
get legal advice, quickly legal advice from him. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you not have one of those highly 
20 
qualified legal people from the Legal Department of SAA?  
That is the question? 
MS KWINANA:   The board meetings of SAA would not be 
attended by the head of legal because she was not a board 
member.  However ...[intervenes]  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 125 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Linnell was not a board member either. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  I am still saying.  She would not 
be a...  she would not be invited as a board member, the 
head of legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, she should not be a invited as a board 
member because she is not a board member but do you not – 
did you not say people who are not board members were 
invited sometimes when it was necessary.? 
MS KWINANA:   I am still saying Chair.  The board members 
would attend the meeting and then sometimes Nick Linnell 
10 
would be there.  And then when there is a discussion, 
sometimes you would say:  Nick, what is your opinion about 
this?  Not because that legal opinion was pre-determined.  
Because he is already there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you see Ms Kwinana.  He was 
there because he was a legal person or a lawyer or 
somebody with a legal background. 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not say that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not say that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what did you say about him?  Why 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   I said Chair.  He would be there without me 
knowing why he is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 126 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   But I knew that he has a legal background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS KWINANA:   So what it means, therefore, is that, if we 
are discussing here and there is some quick legal reference 
guide that is needed, considering that we know him that he 
has got a legal background, we would not go and ask for 
Ms Figelepe, for instance, who is the Head of Legal because 
she is not in that meeting.   
 
However, the things that pre-planned and in fact when 
Mr Linnell is not there and we required the legal advice.  So 
10 
basically, we would know that the legal advice is required 
from the head of legal but now for instance...  In fact, it is 
the same thing as if we are having a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I summarise it for you as I understand 
what you want to say?  Namely, Mr Linnell would be in a 
board meeting or a committee meeting for whatever purpose 
he has called to attend. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And if in the meeting a legal question 
arose that board members that wanted an answer on, they 
20 
would then ask him and that is how you would make use of 
his legal background? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you say, you are saying? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 127 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so just so that I can be clear.  He was 
not there to fill the role of the lawyer? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You would just ask him a quick legal 
question every now and then. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And outside of that – because I asked you 
10 
if you sought advice from him beyond those meetings.  I 
understand your evidence to be you did not. 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Right. 
 
Do 
you 
know 
whether 
Mr Nick Linnell was paid for his services attending those 
meetings and giving that quick legal advice? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not know? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not remember having received 
20 
invoices from him regularly in 2015 and 2016? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  From what you 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 128 of 257 
 
have said, it appears that your understanding is that it was 
not Mr Linnell’s legal background that the board really 
needed him for. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The legal background just came in handy 
whenever there were questions and he was at the meeting. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your understanding of what 
actually the board needed him for in these meetings?  Did 
you have an understanding of that or did you not have?  
10 
What services, what skills did the board need him at these 
meetings for? 
MS KWINANA:   The board did not need a skill from him 
Chair because there was the head of legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   But as you have correctly put it.  If he is 
there and we need quick legal advice:  What do you think 
Nick?  Then that – that type of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say the board did not any particular 
skills from him? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  But then the questions arises.  
Why was he brought in?  Are you able to share light on that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  I am not the one who can 
...[intervenes]  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 129 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not able to? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you gain an understanding of who did 
invite him? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you never asked? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said he came to some meetings and 
not all.  Are you able to say, most meetings or you just say 
10 
some? 
MS KWINANA:   Some meetings Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some meetings? 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you able to say, when you say 
some, is it some like two, three, four or maybe five meetings 
over a certain period or is that something you cannot 
remember? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but certainly, it was not once? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And was it more than five? 
MS KWINANA:   I really do not know Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you set out a limit from what you can 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 130 of 257 
 
recall, not more than ten or something like that to help us? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I cannot answer that question.  I 
really do not know because I may say he was in a meeting 
and maybe I found him in the passage or something like that.  
So basically, I just would not know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  But you did not engaged him 
beyond his presence at meetings.  I have that evidence 
correct.  Is that right? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know if any other of the board 
members engaged him beyond the confines of meetings? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not think so Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then I was asking you.  Were you 
aware that he was paid for his services to SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   I am not aware Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you have a recollection of what 
types of presentations he made to the board at some times 
because you did say he made some presentations. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   No, I would not remember.  Those would be 
like ad-hoc.  Ad-hoc presentations Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 131 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I have your evidence to be.  You did 
not really need him for anything there.  So can I understand 
your attitude then to him being paid.  Would it surprise you 
then to learn that he was paid by SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, of course any person...  I would have 
expect a person to be paid for services rendered.  They may 
have been rendering some services.  I do not know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, indeed.  I am talking about the ones 
that you do know about.  You said he attended some board 
meetings and some committee meetings  Your evidence a 
10 
few moments ago was that:  We did not need him for 
anything.  And what if I told you he was being paid for that 
for which you did not need him?  Would that concern you? 
MS KWINANA:   But Chair if the other members of the board 
needed him?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think when Ms Hofmeyr talked about you 
not needing him, based on your evidence, her understanding 
was and that would be my understanding, was that you were 
talking about the board that, in your view, the board did not 
20 
need him.  That you are not talking about you yourself 
personally that you did not need him.  Because obviously, he 
was not there for you.  He was there for the board. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the understanding was, that your 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 132 of 257 
 
evidence was, in effect, that the board did not actually need 
any services from him.  That is why Ms Hofmeyr is asking 
whether it would concern you if somebody was being paid for 
being admitting when actually of the board when the board 
actually did not need him to be there? 
MS KWINANA:   As much I did not feel the need for him to 
be there, I did not sit in all committees Chair.  I only sat in 
the Audit Committee.  So the other committees may see the 
need for him to be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the Risk and Audit Committee of 
10 
which you were the chairperson, is it not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He could only come there if you approve 
that he should come there, is it not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   As he the person. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  And he never attended the 
Audit Committee meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did he ever attend meetings of the 
Audit and Risk Committee with your approval? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry.  And I do just need to return to my 
question because the question is focussed in on the board 
meetings that you were present at and he was present at.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 133 of 257 
 
Let us put – let us forget the other meetings.   
 
What I am interested in Ms Kwinana is your response to 
the following.  Your evidence is that he attended some of 
those meetings and the board did not need him for anything 
at those meetings.   
 
And then I say to you:  Well, if that is so, would it 
concern you to learn that he was being paid to be at board 
meetings where he was not needed? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know.  I cannot say with certainty 
that if he was not needed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Maybe the other ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Look this side Ms Kwinana.  Just repeat 
your answer. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I was still saying.  I cannot say the 
other board members did not need him.  Maybe the other 
board members did need him because also, SAA does allow 
for some extra specialised resource if it is going to add value 
to the company.  It does allow for that.   
 
Like for instance, the outsourcing.  But what I am 
20 
saying.  As for me, I did not think the need for him to...  I did 
not see him adding value in my activities as the board 
member.   
 
However, I am not saying other board members did not 
see the value because the other board member may come 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 134 of 257 
 
here and say Nick added a lot of value for the board.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  We wanted you to answer 
based on your observations and your experiences and what 
was discussed.  Was there any meeting of the board where 
there was a discussion about what value he was adding or 
why – whether anybody needed him? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if he was being used for his services 
because there was a sense from some members of the board 
that his services would be useful to the company.  Then I 
assume they would need to go through the proper processes 
to procure those services, would they not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So a procurement process should be 
followed in accordance with the constitution and the PFMA 
before somebody whose services are required for SAA.  Is 
that correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And are you aware of any procurement 
process ever having been followed before Mr Nick Linnell 
appeared at board meetings? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know Chair.  The document process 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 135 of 257 
 
is done at Operations.  The only time it comes to the board 
is when the delegation requires it to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you...  A short answer is, you are not 
aware? 
MS KWINANA:   I am not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are saying, as far as you are 
concerned, 
that 
does 
not 
necessarily 
mean 
that 
no 
processes were followed ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   That procurement processes were not 
followed.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not aware? 
MS KWINANA:   They may be followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the board generally does not involve 
itself in those procurement process.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so a board member going to a 
meeting with suppliers about finalising contracts would 
20 
unusual.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if a board member went on her own 
and met with suppliers to SAA without any member of 
management, that would also be unusual, would it not? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 136 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, when did you resign from 
SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   The 23 August 2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice is low Ms Kwinana.  Just 
repeat that answer and face this side. 
MS KWINANA:   23rd of August 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And why did you resign? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   I think Minister Gordan...  I think there was 
issue with funding where basically, Minister Gordan wanted 
the new board members.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am not sure I understand.  Could you 
just elaborate?  Minister Gordan had an issue with funding 
and wanted new board members.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So did he communicate that to you? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not remember, Ma’am.  I think what you 
need to do.  I did write the resignation letter.  And my reason 
20 
for resigning, I stated in that letter.  And nothing has 
changed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So do you remember those reasons 
now or would you like to go to the letter? 
MS KWINANA:   I would like to go to the letter. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296

ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  You will find that in your bundle 
which is BD33 at Tab 10.  So Chair, this will be Exhibit 
BD33.10.  If we may enter it into the record? 
MS KWINANA:   33.10? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is under the flag...  Sorry, Tab 10 and it 
is at page 84.  So if you just go to page 84, that might be 
easier. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m.  You want me to read it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not want you to read it and...  You 
said...  Maybe take a moment so that it can refresh your 
10 
memory about why you resigned.  And then you can tell us in 
your own words why you resigned. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, yes Chair, I remember.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So what were your reasons 
for resigning? 
MS KWINANA:   The main reason, basically, was that the 
National Treasury was not issuing the guarantee which 
resulted in the audited financial statements not to be 
finalised.  And so basically my understanding was that the 
20 
minister want the board that he himself has elected. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But how did you know he would not select 
you? 
MS KWINANA:   If he would select me..  At least he would 
start from scratch and...  He would start from scratch after I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 138 of 257 
 
have resigned.  And then when he appoints new board 
members, if he wants to selected me then he would do so.  
So I think it was going to be easy for me to resign because if 
he wanted me, he would still select me.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So let me just understand this because I 
have to say, I did read your letter of resignation a few times 
and there were parts of it that just were not clear to me.  So 
I would like to give you an opportunity to assist me.  I 
understand 
you 
to 
be 
saying 
that 
you 
had 
some 
understanding that the government guarantee that SAA 
10 
needed was not going to be forthcoming unless the board, 
the current board resigned.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Now imagine..  Oh, sorry.  Let me 
ask this.  How was that communicated to you, that issue? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, you know, no one does not see that 
there are some disagreements between the shareholder for 
instance and the chairperson or maybe and the board or 
chairperson of the board reporting(?) can see if they are 
correct. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you understanding was he was not 
issuing the guarantee until this board resigned, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair, that was my thinking. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And imagine the whole board has 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 139 of 257 
 
resigned, what then would have happened? 
MS KWINANA:   Then the shareholder would appoint new 
board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know that it is quite an important 
principle of corporate governance that there be continuity 
on boards but – or any company but particularly state 
owned enterprises. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if the whole board had resigned in 
order to release this government guarantee there would no 
10 
continuity on that board, would there? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did that concern you at all, that you 
might be putting this letter of resignation in with all your 
fellow board members? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, one would have to weigh the 
options and look at what would be best of the company.  
Would it be best for me to resign so that the minister can 
appoint the new people or would I sit here and then the 
guarantee is not forthcoming and then the company goes 
20 
into liquidation.  So I had to weight the options. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I have just been told, if you 
could just try and raise your voice a bit more and just do 
remember, if you could, to direct your answers to the 
Chair.  You mentioned in particular that you were all aware 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 140 of 257 
 
at the time of some let us call it conflict between Minister 
Gordan and the then Chairperson of SAA, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know when Minister Gordan 
made the next appointment for the new board? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So would it surprise you to learn he did 
it just more than a week after you resigned? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I was not aware. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And would it surprise you to learn that 
10 
he kept on Ms Myeni? 
MS KWINANA:   I know that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what happened to that you were 
aware of and that underscored your reason for resignation? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe I was the undesirable element. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was that communicated to you because I 
understood you to say that what was at issue at the time 
was Minister Gordan and Chairperson, Ms Myeni.  Did you 
receive indications that you were undesirable on the 
board? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it was not that. 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you have any other reason for 
resigning, Ms Kwinana? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 141 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Everything – all the reasons are in this 
letter, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And none over and above what is in the 
letter? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I take it that the minister, Mr 
Gordan, never said – never told you that the guarantee 
would not be provided until the board had resigned, did not 
say that himself to you, or did he? 
MS KWINANA:   I cannot remember, Chair, but it was a 
10 
well-known fact that basically …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember whether he told 
you? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He might have? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  If he did, would this have been in 
a board meeting of SAA or would it have been a separate 
meeting encounter with him between the two of you? 
MS KWINANA:   No, definitely not between the two of us.  
20 
Definitely not at SAA.  Maybe a Department of Finance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe at the Department of Finance? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair, but I am not sure but it was a 
well-known thing that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it something that was conveyed to you 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 142 of 257 
 
as a board member or to the board members by somebody 
such as the Chairperson of the board saying this is the 
position of the minister or can you not remember? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not remember, Chair, how it was 
communicated but, as I said, everybody knew about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you cannot remember whether it 
was communicated in writing by way of a letter or email? 
MS KWINANA:   No, definition it cannot – it definitely was 
not in writing, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And, Ms Kwinana, are you 
aware of the evidence of Mr Mothibe, the previous PwC 
auditor before the Commission? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you did look at that evidence as well, 
is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now Mr Mothibe is somebody you would 
have had quite a few interactions being the chair of audit 
and risk  while PwC and Nkonki were auditing SAA, is that 
20 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you regard him as a good auditor? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you trust his judgment? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 143 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you interact quite frequently 
with him in that role? 
MS KWINANA:   Not frequently because remember that the 
external auditors come once a year, so I would not say 
frequently. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you would engage him at audit and 
risk committee meetings that they attended, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And how many of those are there a 
10 
year? 
MS KWINANA:   Four. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I would just like to get a few 
background issues about obligations of board members out 
of the way with you.  Is it your understanding that board 
members of SOEs are required to comply with obligations 
under the PFMA? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And are you aware of the obligations 
that the PFMA places on board members? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And can I ask one question, in Ms 
Memela’s evidence – I think it was in February this year – 
she said that it was against procurement rules for a bidder 
while a tender is still open to meet with somebody who is a 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 144 of 257 
 
decision-maker from the state owned entity concerned.  Do 
you agree with her on that? 
MS KWINANA:   Not entirely, Chair.  The reason why I am 
saying not entirely is that you would meet with a person 
not knowing that there is a tender going on and also, even 
that person not knowing that there is a tender going on and 
if you are not involved in any tender you would really not 
know that there is a tender now that is going on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But if you did know that a tender was 
going on then would it be against procurement rules? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   I would also depend what is your 
involvement in that tender. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, she believed that if you just met with 
somebody.  So you have got a tender that is open and you 
have got a decision-maker in the state owned entity who 
has gone out on tender and that person meets with 
somebody who is a bidder, she said that would be against 
procurement rules.  Do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I do not accept it.  It would also 
depend, as I said, it would depend on the involvement of 
20 
that person in that tender. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why? 
MS KWINANA:   Like, for instance, you cannot expect a 
person - like you meet a person in town and you do not 
know what is happening in the tendering process but it 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 145 of 257 
 
happens that the person is working in this place where 
there is a tender going on.  No, it cannot be taken like 
that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if you do know that …[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   I do not know what Ms Hofmeyr is saying 
was said by Mrs Memela …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Ms Mbanjwa, I have not said 
you may speak.  What do you want to talk about? 
MS MBANJWA:   Oh, I must apologise, Chair, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   What I wanted, Chair, is if Ms Hofmeyr 
can refer us to that evidence that Ms Memela [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I am just going to have to find it, 
it is in her affidavit, I did not take a reference, I did not 
actually think it would contentious but if you could give me 
a moment, I would appreciate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  It looks like you do not 
20 
have any junior helping you today, Ms Hofmeyr.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I do have her helping me but she is 
not present in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She is available to me on Whatsapp 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 146 of 257 
 
communication, so she can certainly be looking for it too.  
Chair, my challenge at the moment is – we explored it – I 
am looking for it in the affidavit, we explored it further in 
evidence.  I do have a reference on my computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if I could come back to it, that would 
be preferable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, later on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not want to delay things too long in 
finding it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I understood you, Ms Kwinana, to say 
that it really depends on the circumstances.  Is that right?  
If you happen to encounter somebody out one evening and 
you do not make the association that they are a bidder and 
you are decision-maker, then you could communicate.  Is 
that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But if you knew that you were the 
decision-maker and you knew that they were a tenderer 
20 
and they knew that they were a tenderer, then you should 
not have communication, should you. 
MS KWINANA:   Still, Chair, that would depend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are away from the mic.  Your 
previous answer was yes, is that right, to the question that 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 147 of 257 
 
was asked earlier on. 
MS KWINANA:   Can you repeat that question, Ms 
Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I was saying if everyone knows that 
you are a decision-maker and that they are a tenderer and 
the tender is still open you should not be communicating 
and 
I 
understand 
you 
to 
say 
no, 
you 
could 
still 
communicate, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   You could still communicate.  It would 
depend what is the role of the person at the time and that 
10 
is one.  Secondly, you know the issue of conflict of 
interest, the issue of conflict of interest is a serious 
challenge in the sense that the procurement process would 
say you cannot meet with the person or you cannot 
communicate with the person.   What if you are meeting 
and you are communicating on something else? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, if the procurement rule is you 
cannot communicate, it does not matter, does it? 
MS KWINANA:   So that is why I am saying it depends on 
the circumstances. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so if the procurement rule says you 
cannot communicate and you were a decision-maker and 
they were a tenderer – and let me add, the person you are 
dealing with is a director of the company who is tendering, 
then do you accept it would not be in compliance with 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 148 of 257 
 
procurement rules to communicate with that tenderer? 
MS KWINANA:   That would need to be specified, Chair, 
that would need to be specified because, as I said, if I am 
not involved in this tender …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, remember, she is talking now – Ms 
Hofmeyr is talking about a person who is a decision-maker 
in the tender, is not talking about somebody who is not a 
decision-maker.  So this whole question about whether you 
may meet …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   You talk with a person who is a decision-
10 
maker …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, 
this whole question about whether you may meet or you 
may not meet somebody whose company has put in a bid 
and the tender is still open, relates the context of you 
being a decision-maker in that tender, not some secretary 
or somebody. 
MS KWINANA:   A decision-making in this tender and then 
the other person is also a bidder …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   And the person knows that there is a bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes and he says both of you know. 
MS KWINANA:   And there is no room to disclose because 
again, the tender processes allow for a disclosure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Ms Hofmeyr seeks to test with you 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 149 of 257 
 
is your understanding of what the rules at SAA were in 
regard to such communication between a decision-maker in 
regard to a certain tender that is still open and somebody 
who is a bidder in that tender.  So you said, as I 
understood what you are saying, what you said, you said 
that a communication between the decision-maker and that 
tender and somebody who has tendered or whose company 
has tendered may be acceptable or permitted in certain 
circumstances and she seeks to establish what those 
circumstances are and she says let us say you know that 
10 
this person is a director of a company that has put in a bid, 
so you know that this person that you are communicating 
with is a director in a company that has put in a bid which 
you will decide and she asked the question are you saying 
that your understanding was that there would be nothing 
wrong with communication between a decision-maker and 
such a person while the tender was open at SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   It may happen, Chair, that I am a 
decision-maker this side and the bidder on that other side 
is a company and this person I am talking to does not even 
20 
know his company has bidded for this.  So that it is why I 
am saying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us say he knows.   Ms Hofmeyr said 
everybody concerned – you know what your role is in the 
tender, namely decision-making.  He knows also or she 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 150 of 257 
 
knows – that person knows that you are a decision-maker 
in this tender where his company has put in a bid.  You 
know that he is a director or she is a director of that 
company.  Everybody knows everyone’s role. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, it still depends again.  It depends 
on a whole lot of things.  That would also include, as I 
said, the disclosure because the tender processes, even 
the government tender processes – I do tenders every day.  
I went to submit a tender today.  It does not say if you 
know a person you must not tender.  It says if you think 
10 
that your decision will be impaired and you need to 
disclose that, it does not say you must not tender and it 
does 
not 
say 
you 
must 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, let us talk about the decision-
maker.  Let us talk about the decision-maker, not the 
bidder.  Can you, on your understanding, if you were a 
decision-maker in a particular tender, which has not 
closed, could you – would you have been permitted to 
communicate with a director of company that had put in a 
20 
bid and you were to make a decision on the bid in terms of 
procurement rules applicable at SAA? 
MS KWINANA:   No, that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or in general. 
MS KWINANA:   No, that would not be right, Chair. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 151 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not be right. 
MS KWINANA:   If I am a decision-maker this side and the 
person is a decision-maker responsible for this tender, 
then that would not be right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I did find the reference, Chair, and I 
have been able assisted in that.  So the first place you find 
it in, it is in Ms Memela’s own affidavit.  I am going to read 
it in.  Certainly Ms Mbanjwa can take a look at it if she 
wants to but I do not suggest anyone else needs to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is DD25A page 10, paragraph – it is 
very difficult, Ms Memela’s paragraphs were not numbered 
but it is the third paragraph on page 10.  She says there: 
“This is also the time…” 
Because she is – page 10.  She says in the third paragraph 
there: 
“This is also the time when Air France went and met 
with the then Acting CEO, Mr Nico Bezuidenhout 
and Mr Barry Parsons…” 
20 
And this is the part that is important: 
“…against the rule of the tender that does not allow 
the bidders to meet with anyone who is a decision-
maker from the company whilst the tender is still 
running.” 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 152 of 257 
 
So that is the basis for my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is why I put it – it was elaborated 
on in evidence but that is sufficient for present purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What position did Ms Memela hold at 
SAAT? 
MS KWINANA:   Head of procurement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the head of procurement at SAAT 
actually goes further – I did not remember this – she goes 
10 
further.  I talked about communication, she says you 
cannot meet anyone who is a decision-maker from the 
company while the tender is still open and do I understand 
your evidence to be you disagree with her? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
You 
can 
still 
have 
those 
communications? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if you are a decision-making and 
they are a bidder? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   As I elaborated, Chair, if I am a decision-
maker this side and bidder, assuming that a bidder is a 
company. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   And I meet – and the Chairperson went 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 153 of 257 
 
further to say if I am a decision-maker here and I am going 
to decide on this tender and the person on the other side is 
involved in this tender. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Then 
you 
accept 
you 
cannot 
communicate, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, exactly and we both know that this is 
the tender, then that is not right.  However, if a person in 
that company does not know about this tender, is not 
involved in this tender, then what would make that person 
not to communicate with the person who is a decision-
10 
maker here because that person is not involved and I was 
– and as I was saying, he may not even know that there is 
a tender that is going on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but, Ms Kwinana, with fairness and 
again as the Chair redirected you previously, you keep 
answering the question from the standpoint of the tenderer.  
We are interested in your answer because you are the 
decision-maker and you have now clarified for us, if you 
are the decision-maker and you are dealing with somebody 
who is responsible within the company and has put in a 
20 
bid, you agree you cannot communicate, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now you change it and you say but what 
if it is somebody else in the company who you are dealing 
with who does not know …[intervenes] 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 154 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, that is why – that is why the 
Chairperson – the Chairperson was specific to say this 
person this side is a decision-maker on this tender and 
then the person on the other side is preparing this tender 
and therefore I know that this person I am talking to is 
preparing this tender, then that is not right, provided we 
talk about this tender because …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Ms Kwinana, the question is whether 
you can communicate at all.  It is not about what you 
communicate about.  It is can you communicate at all.  
10 
What is your answer to that? 
MS KWINANA:   I do not see anything wrong because we 
are not talking about this tender. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, how could it possibly be fair to the 
other tenderers that somebody they are competing with has 
access to a decision-maker to communicate with them and 
they do not?  How would that be fair? 
MS KWINANA:   What would make them not to be able to 
communicate with me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What would make them not be able to 
20 
communicate with you is that if you ever got approached 
you would say I cannot deal with you because there is an 
open tender and it would be in defiance of procurement law 
that I engage with you now while the tender is open.  That 
is what would stop them. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 155 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   But when you are saying that you are 
communicating 
with 
that 
person, 
you 
have 
already 
breached that rule if it is anything to go by. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, hang on a second?  Ms 
Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   Please Chair, I am not saying Ms Hofmeyr 
did not read this line because I was still battling to get – 
but from that paragraph that was red  in page 10 of Ms 
Memela’s affidavit, it is said at the end: 
“But as France was not disqualified because Mr 
10 
Bezuidenhout and Mr Parsons were not part of the 
evaluation not adjudications.” 
And the reason why I am reading this penultimate and this 
very 
last 
line 
is 
because 
my 
understanding 
of 
my 
instructions are, Ms Kwinana, when she was a director at 
SAA and the Chairperson of SAAT was never part of the 
evaluation and adjudication team, that is one.   
 
Then the very last one.  The second thing, I did not 
know if it is me who missed it but if there is a conflict of 
interest policy at SAAT and SAA, if Ms Hofmeyr can kindly 
20 
refer me to that.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, okay.  Let us continue.  It is 
matters you can deal with in re-examination.  The other 
questions, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, thank you, Chair.  Right, I think I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 156 of 257 
 
have an understanding about where you regard the limits 
of communications in procurement …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But hang on before you proceed, Ms 
Hofmeyr, I just want to understand what your evidence is, 
Ms Kwinana.  I think you latest answer seems, as I 
understand it, to be saying that in the situation that Ms 
Hofmeyr is putting to you where the decision-maker from 
SAA communicates with somebody from a bidding company 
who is involved in the bid or tender, I understood you to be 
saying now the decision-maker can communicate with that 
10 
person, it depends what they communicate about whereas I 
understood you earlier on to say no, no, no, in that case it 
would not be right for the decision-maker to communicate 
with that person and I thought you said that without any 
qualification.  Did I misunderstand you?  
MS KWINANA:   A decision-maker, Chair.  We talked about 
a decision-maker in this tender, for example and then the 
decision-maker in the other company who is submitting this 
tender …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, somebody involved in the tender in 
20 
the company, that is [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS KWINANA:   Somebody involved in the tender in the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   And both of them know that there is this 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 157 of 257 
 
tender and then they come together and talk about this 
tender, then that is not allowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now you have said they come 
together. 
 
At 
that 
stage 
we 
just 
talked 
about 
communicating.  How they communicate, we did not talk 
about that.  So are you saying what you say would not be 
right is for them to come together and communicate about 
the tender but if they phone each other without coming 
together it would be fine or …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   But still, even if they phone each other, 
10 
Chair.  But if they phone each other on this tender then 
that is also not right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But am I right to say your evidence 
earlier when you say it would not be right, your evidence 
did not put any qualification, it was simply that it would not 
be right for the decision-maker to communicate with such a 
person while the tender was open.  Am I right that is what 
you said? 
MS KWINANA:   If that is what I said, Chair.  Let us take 
this one that I am saying now. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying if I am the decision-maker, I 
am going to decide on this tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   And my decision is going to be impaired 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 158 of 257 
 
on this tender and the person on the other side, I am 
communicating with him or her with regards to this tender 
and the person was involved in this tender, then that is not 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying it is not right if you 
communicate with that person about the tender but it is – 
there is nothing wrong if you communicate with that person 
about other matters? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Hofmeyr. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I understood you, just to clarify again, to 
say it matters whether you are going to be influenced by 
what you are discussing.  Is that part of your qualification? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes because now you are talking about 
this tender and now your decision, by you talking about 
this tender, will be influenced.  Also, the influence will play 
a big role.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, can I say – Ms Mbanjwa might be 
interested to hear me say this, but this is the part of Ms 
Memela’s evidence that I completely agreed with and I 
20 
think we were on common ground.  She was quite clear, as 
we have seen, that it is meeting anyone, right, at the time 
when the bid is open.  I understand you to say no, it 
depends on whether what you discuss influences the 
decision-maker, correct? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 159 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then I am wanting to put to you how 
extraordinarily difficult that would be to be a procurement 
rule.  Let me explain to you why I say that.  So imagine 
now state owned entities around the country can go out on 
tender and the decision-makers can communicate with 
tenderers, some when they want to, others when they don’t 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And go and tender. [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed, and all of that is fine, just 
10 
provided in their own minds they are not being influenced, 
is that what you say proper procurement is? 
MS KWINANA:   What is your question? 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
My 
question 
is, 
is 
that 
proper 
procurement, that it would leave it to the decision or the 
feeling of the decision maker whether they had been 
influenced or not by that communication? 
MS KWINANA:   This clause that Ms Mbanjwa was talking 
about states exactly what is happening practically.  Ms 
Memela was saying people at Air France each communicate 
20 
with decision makers and they were not disqualified. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana that was not actually my 
question about Air France I’m just trying to get a grip on 
your 
understanding 
of 
procurement, 
because 
as 
I 
understand your evidence you don’t agree with Ms Memela 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 160 of 257 
 
who was the head of procurement at SAAT.  You are now 
designing a new rule, a rule, not the one that she agrees 
with, 
a 
new 
rule 
that 
says, 
decision 
makers 
can 
communicate with tenderers while the tender is open 
provided the decision maker doesn’t feel influenced and 
I’m putting to you that would be a very risky procurement 
rule to be in place, do you accept that? 
MS KWINANA:   As Ms Mbanjwa has pointed out, she made 
example, exactly in respect of what you are saying.  The 
example 
that 
much 
as 
the 
policy 
is 
saying 
10 
that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look this…[intervenes]. 
MS KWINANA:   Much as the policy is saying that what is 
happening on the ground…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Leave out what is happening on the 
ground, let’s talk about the rule or your understanding of 
what the rule was. 
MS KWINANA:   My understanding of the policy, of the 
procurement policy – my understanding of the procurement 
policy in a nutshell, is that you cannot communicate – 
20 
when you say you cannot communicate with the bidder, if 
you look at big companies, take, maybe Steinhoff if it’s the 
good example, anyway, if you look at big companies like 
Steinhoff there would be a person who is doing the tender 
and there will be the person who is putting together 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 161 of 257 
 
everything up to the submission.  Now there is another 
person on the other side, let’s say SAA, maybe SAA is 
small compared to Steinhoff but let’s talk about -  if we say 
SAA, if the person at Steinhoff has been doing the tender 
and then that person meets with a person at SAA who is 
not involved in any way…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no we said decision maker Ms 
Kwinana we’re not talking about somebody – we’re not 
talking about a secretary, we’re talking about a decision 
maker at SAA and somebody in the other company called 
10 
Steinhoff or whatever who is involved in the tender, those 
are the people we are talking about. 
MS KWINANA:   But Chair, what would – of course I know, 
I’m not supposed to ask questions but maybe that is a 
rhetorical question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the question is, we want your 
understanding of what the rule was at SAA or what the rule 
is, but we talk about that particular time when you were a 
Board member. We are saying, if you were a decision 
maker at SAA in regard to a certain tender that has not 
20 
closed, were you permitted to communicate with somebody 
who comes from a company that has put in a bid in regard 
to that tender and that somebody is somebody who has 
been involved in that tender on the side of that company. 
MS KWINANA:   And then I went further to say, if they 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 162 of 257 
 
meet, 
what 
are 
they 
talking 
about 
if 
they 
are 
not 
talking…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is – are you reaffirming that your 
answer is, they were permitted – they would have been 
permitted to communicate, a decision maker would have 
been permitted, entitled to communicate with that person, 
as long as they did not talk about the tender? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so if some Executive from SAA, 
while 
you 
were 
Chairperson 
of 
the Audit 
and 
Risk 
10 
Committee 
approached 
you 
and 
said, 
you 
know 
the 
Managing Director of this company that has put in a bid 
here has asked me if we can go and have lunch or dinner 
while the tender was open, your answer would be, yes you 
can go as long as you don’t talk about the tender? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if somebody – if another bidder saw 
them sitting at a restaurant and then complained and say, 
you know, the MD of that company which is bidding here, I 
saw them – I saw him or her sitting with the decision maker 
20 
at a restaurant it would – you would say, what were they 
talking about, is that what you would say? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the bidders complain all the time, 
even the people who have not bidded like Ms Sambu do 
complain. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 163 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I’m asking is whether your 
concern would be whether that person has got proof that 
they were talking about the bid, the tender? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how would he know? 
MS KWINANA:   How would he know Chair if we are not 
talking about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he was not with them, he just saw 
them. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously if he joined them, they would 
not talk about it. 
MS KWINANA:   No, but Chair,  whether they were talking 
about it or they were not talking about it, the other person 
would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, which is why the rule may well be, I 
haven’t looked at the rule, but I would understand if the 
rule prohibits communication absolutely because those who 
drafted the rule, would have known how difficult  it would 
be for somebody else to prove that they were talking about 
20 
the tender and so the best way, if you want to ensure that 
there are no complaints, you say, no communication until 
after a certain period because if you say there can be 
communication but not on the tender, it’s going to be 
difficult to prove that and then in terms of transparency, in 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 164 of 257 
 
terms of fairness there are going to be a lot of complaints. 
MS KWINANA:   As I said, Chair, in theory that is how it’s 
supposed to be. The people that I was going to mention 
here, listening, that you said, they need Rule 3.2 is still at 
SAA and he has been communicating with the suppliers 
and he has been communicating with the tenderers. So, 
basically, much is that is said in the procurement policy, 
but it’s difficult.  One of the reasons why it is difficult and 
in fact, almost impracticable to apply it is because some of 
the bidders may be doing work with the company at the 
10 
time and therefore they may be coming in and going out of 
the office because they are doing work whilst there is also 
another bid that is going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you understand what I was putting to 
you, how difficult it would be…[intervenes]. 
MS KWINANA:   It would be difficult Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and then just to close it off.  
So, if one of the bidders wined and dined decision makers 
and took them on planes and drove the around in 
20 
limousines while a tender was open, that would all be okay, 
provided they never spoke about the tender, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, if you are talking about AAR there 
was no tender when we went to Chicago. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I’m talking now…[intervenes]. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 165 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no she’s putting a certain 
question to you, in general in order to confirm her 
understanding of what you’re saying in terms of your 
understanding of the rule. So, just answer that, if and when 
she wants to talk about whatever you have in mind you will 
deal with that at that time, she’s just talking in general. 
MS KWINANA:   As I said to Chair, in terms of practicality 
of it, if for instance, we assume that we were taken to Air 
France and Air France was doing the work there, then – 
and Air France was doing the tender and Air France is not 
10 
taking us because of this tender but is taking us because 
we are the current clients – that’s why I’m saying, it’s 
difficult to deal with the procurement policy as it is. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you cannot apply the procurement 
policy when it’s difficult to do so, is that your evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Not when it is difficult, when it is 
impracticable to do it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you as a member of the Board of 
SAA Technical may not apply the procurement policy of 
SAA Technical, when it’s impractical to do so? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Of course, if it is impractical how are you 
going to apply it, you can’t apply it if it is impractical. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I’d like to move on Chair if we may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I’d like to now focus, Ms Kwinana on 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 166 of 257 
 
a – what I’m going to call quite a fateful week in the life of 
SAA and it’s the week that started on Monday the 28 t h of 
September 2015 and ended on Friday the 2 n d of October 
2015.  Okay, let’s start at the beginning of that week.  At 
the beginning of that week, Monday the 28 t h of September 
2015 the Board of South African Airways, including you, 
decided to cancel a tender that had already been awarded 
to LSG Sky Chefs and instead to award it to Air Chefs, do 
you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, Chair, I like that one and in fact, even 
10 
before 
you 
go 
further, 
that 
is 
the 
decision 
– 
the 
cancellation of that tender…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hand on, Ms Kwinana, she has 
only asked you whether you remember that. 
MS KWINANA:   No, I’m saying Chair, I’m saying Chair that 
decision 
– 
I’m 
saying 
Chair, 
that 
decision 
of 
us…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, she will get – she will ask you about 
the decision. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, maybe, let me first…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no we are going to waste 
time…[intervenes]. 
MS KWINANA:   No Chair, I want to say this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no you will get a chance to 
say…[intervenes]. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 167 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   No but Chair, let me say it now before we 
go anywhere…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Kwinana, I control what happens 
here, I’m saying you are not going to answer that now, you 
may answer it when she asks you about it, okay? 
MS KWINANA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember or do you not 
remember that…[intervenes]. 
MS KWINANA:   There is no way that I would not 
remember, that was one of the best decisions that I made 
10 
at SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   One of the best decisions you made, is 
that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you did address this in your affidavit 
in response to the Chair ’s questions, do you recall that? 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You addressed this issue in your 
affidavit? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I’d like to take you there because it 
seems to be a decision that you are resolute of being 
proud of. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 168 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Excellent, so let’s go to it, pick it up at 
page 4 in your affidavit, Chair that’s Exhibit DD33 at page 
4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And again, your affidavit is also 
differently numbered.  You have to go to the bottom, it’s 
tab C, because you’re responding to paragraph C of the 
10(6) directive and the heading is, “SAA Board’s decision 
on 28 September 2015 to cancel the tender awarded to 
LSG Sky Chefs” and then what I understand follows is – 
10 
well first of all you say, you point out that you are 
“flabbergasted”. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   By the question by the Commission. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I am very flabbergasted. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And, maybe explain to us, why are you 
flabbergasted by the question? 
MS KWINANA:   I am flabbergasted by this question, the 
reason being that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, Ms Hofmeyr, just so that the 
20 
public who are listening can follow, start with what the 
question is and then we can hear why she is flabbergasted. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, what the Directive required is 
that Ms Kwinana would tell us everything she knew about a 
series – and her involvement in a series of topics, right. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 169 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so, she actually records the topic, 
the topic is the SAA Board’s decision on 28 September 
2015 to cancel the tender awarded to LSG Sky Chefs 
and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, C was…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was a replica. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was a question requiring her to share 
with the Commission, whatever she knows about the 
Board’s decision of 28 September 2015 to cancel the 
10 
tender award to LSG Sky Chefs. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s the question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now when you say you were 
flabbergasted, 
then 
the 
public 
can 
understand 
what 
question flabbergasted you. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair when Mr Mothibe was asked 
about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I think, Ms Hofmeyr ’s question 
20 
was, why were you flabbergasted by this question? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
That’s 
what 
I’m 
explaining 
Chair, 
that’s…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that’s where you were going okay? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I’m saying, Chair, the reason why I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 170 of 257 
 
am flabbergasted by this question is that I really would not 
even think that it would be part of the Inquiry here in view 
of the fact that Air Chefs was going to retrench people and 
Air Chefs is 100% subsidiary of SAA and therefore it is a 
Government entity and the reason why Air Chefs was 
formed is mainly to service SAA. So, which means, 
therefore that, if they were no longer going to service SAA, 
there would be job losses, that’s why I even said, whoever 
made this decision is causing a sabotage, that’s why I 
said, that is how strongly I feel and that is how strongly I 
10 
still feel about it as I am sitting here.  Our decision, as the 
Board, to cancel that award against Sky Chefs and take it 
back to Air Chefs, Air Chefs employs or employed 1500 
people at the time and those 1500 people would lose their 
jobs and then now, look at the other suppliers of Air Chefs, 
some of the smaller suppliers of Air Chefs would lose their 
jobs for a Lufthansa Company, oh really, Chairperson, no. 
That’s why I am saying, I am flabbergasted and in fact the 
evidence leader, even forced Mr Pula Mothibe to say, this 
cancellation should have been reported to IRBA as a 
20 
reportable irregularity because we cancelled this tender 
irregularly 
and 
my 
understanding 
of 
the 
reportable 
irregularity is that an act must be done at Management and 
it must cause financial loss.  Now what does Advocate say 
about the financial loss that will be incurred by Air Chefs.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 171 of 257 
 
So that’s why I’m saying…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying it was not going to be 
a reportable irregularity? 
MS KWINANA:   No Chair, I don’t see any – in fact, it 
would be a reportable irregularity if this tender had 
continued to be given to the Sky Chefs.  The reason being 
that there would be job losses and in fact, this was 
supposed to go to tender and this was supposed to go to 
the shareholder in terms of Section 54 of the PFM ACT. 
The reason being that this would be the discontinuation of 
10 
the bigger portion of SAA Group and therefore that would 
be the reportable irregularity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I’ll understand the flabbergasted 
part later, but I think you must continue, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, thank you Chair.  So, Ms 
Kwinana I understand you to say, your main concern were 
the job losses that were going to result at Air Chefs if you 
retained the award with LSG Sky Chefs, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Not to retain because that tender – or let 
me not say that tender, SAA was being supplied by Air 
20 
Chefs, which is 100% owned subsidiary and in fact, I heard 
Ms Mpshe supressing the fact that Air Chefs was a 100% 
owned subsidiary of SAA and thanks to the Judge and – 
the Deputy Chief or the Chairperson because you asked a 
question, whether Air Chefs was not a 100% subsidiary of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 172 of 257 
 
SAA because she was supressing it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You think, Ms 
Mpshe supressed 
evidence before this Commission, is that your evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She supressed it? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, she did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did she supress it to you at the time 
when she was advising you on this award? 
MS KWINANA:   You know, if I can talk about Ms Mpshe 
and her disregard of the Board decisions, this one was one 
10 
of them…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please, it’s in your interest and it’s in 
the interest of all of us, that as the evidence leader asks 
questions, you listen carefully to what the question is and 
answer that question because that way we’ll make progress 
much more easier.  I think your last answer didn’t answer 
her question it was – it dealt with something else. I’m 
going to ask her to repeat her question, listen carefully and 
20 
answer that question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your testimony today is that Ms Mpshe 
supressed 
evidence 
before 
this 
Commission, 
is 
that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 173 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I asked you, do you regard her as 
having supressed evidence when she was engaging you 
about this award at the time that it was made? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair, she did supress it because, as 
I said, although the amount itself did not require the Board 
decision but the nature of the transaction required that it 
needed to go to the Board because Air Chefs was going to 
close down and in fact,  it did not even need to go to the 
Board, it needed to go to the shareholder in terms of 
Section 54 and she supressed all of that. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you read any of the emails that Ms 
Mpshe was circulating to the Board after that fateful day in 
Parliament where Ms Myeni was criticised for this award?  
MS KWINANA:   Ms Myeni was criticised of this award, 
who criticised her? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Members – when she addressed the 
Portfolio Committee, I think it was on the 1 s t of September, 
I always get this wrong, the 2 n d of September she was 
asked a quite inflammatory question about the award of 
this tender to LSG Sky Chefs and she was asked whether 
20 
that was done because she took it that quote, “black 
people can’t cook”, do you remember being aware of that 
at the time? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I’m aware of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You’re aware of that, so that happened 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 174 of 257 
 
on the 1 s t of September and then in Ms Mpshe’s evidence 
she explained in graphic detail how distressed Ms Myeni 
was by that encounter, how she berated Ms Mpshe outside 
the meeting room in front of Ms Mpshe’s other colleagues 
and subsequent to that Ms Mpshe was called to account for 
what had happened. In that process, she sent numerous 
emails to all the Board members and I’m trying to establish 
now whether you read any of those emails of Ms Mpshe at 
the time? 
MS KWINANA:   I may have read them Chair, but 
10 
regardless of what those emails were saying they would 
not change how I felt at that time and they would not 
change how I am feeling at this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Kwinana, the answer was 
whether you read any of those emails, I think your answer 
should be, you may have read them, you may not have 
read them, you can’t remember, I think that’s what you’re 
saying…[intervenes]. 
MS KWINANA:   I may have read them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, when you are referred to a 
20 
particular email you might see when you look at it whether 
you remember reading it or not. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I think I understand you to say, 
whatever Ms Mpshe was saying, you took the view that it 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 175 of 257 
 
would cause job losses if it remained with LSG Sky Chefs, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that Air Chefs would close down its 
business, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and then you hesitated when I 
said, to cancel the award, to LSG Sky Chefs because an 
entire tender process had been run prior to this, were you 
aware of that? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Irregularly so because…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why was it irregular? 
MS KWINANA:   This tender was irregular for the reason 
that I am saying, why would – in fact when I make this 
example of this LSG Sky Chefs is, if my daughter is selling 
fat cakes here at home, why would I go and buy fat cakes 
next door and then if I decide to go and buy fat cakes next 
door as a parent am I not supposed to tell the child that I 
don’t like your fat cakes this is how you should do the fat 
cakes the please correct here and there and so on.  So, 
20 
the reason why I’m saying it was irregular is because that 
tender should not even have happened.  Why would – in 
fact, had that tender went on, also that would be the same 
with SAA Technical we would see some aeroplanes being 
repaired elsewhere because we would have created a 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 176 of 257 
 
precedent for that. That’s why I’m saying that’s one of the 
best decisions that we made. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
when 
you 
say 
it 
was 
irregular…[intervenes]. 
MS KWINANA:   It was irregular…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Ms Kwinana, everybody allows 
you to speak. 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry Chair. 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say it was irregular, you don’t 
10 
mean there was a process that was supposed to be 
followed but was not followed, you only mean that, 
substantively you disagreed with the decision to award it to 
this company, that’s what you mean? 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 
 
Plus, 
the 
process 
Chair 
because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was wrong with the process? 
MS KWINANA:   Because the process – the discontinuance 
of the major component of the business requires a Board 
decision and it also requires a certain 54 application. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were told by Ms Mpshe why the 
decision had been taken, to go out on tender and that had 
to do with the fact that Air Chefs had, previously been 
providing the service and was doing so to great customer 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 177 of 257 
 
dissatisfaction, were you aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:  That’s why, Chair, I was saying I was 
aware of that, that’s why I was saying the responsibility of 
the parent is to guide the child, to say, you’re not doing 
right here, then do like this and this and this, not to do 
what Ms Mpshe was doing.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because prior to Ms Myeni appearing in 
Parliament and being questioned about this, there was a 
detailed memorandum sent to the SAA Board of Directors 
explaining the whole process.  Explaining why the decision 
10 
had been made to go out on tender, I’d like to take you to 
it if I may, you’ll find it in Mr Mothibe’s Bundle, Chair that 
will be DD19A and you’ll pick it up at page 132.3.1, you’ll 
be assisted now Ms Kwinana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s go to the page first. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, it’s Exhibit DD19A and when we’re 
looking for the page, we’ll be looking for page 132.3.1. 
MS KWINANA:   Which one, is it this one? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, we’re going to have to find 132.3.2 
in that please – oh sorry it starts at 132.3.1, apologies. If 
20 
you bring it to me, I could possibly assist.  So, this is a 
memorandum that Ms Mpshe, as the acting Chief Executive 
Officer prepared for the SAA Board of Directors dated the 
2th of August 2015 and you’ll recall that precedes the 
meeting at the Portfolio Committee and what she says in 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 178 of 257 
 
the background section, that’s midway down the page, Ms 
Kwinana, is she says there, 
“SAA’s lounge customer value proposition, product 
and service has to date been provided by SAA’s 
subsidiary, Air Chefs. The food and beverages on 
offer are specified in line with customer needs, 
preferences, and expectations. Over time SAA has 
experienced a severe deterioration in the quality 
and 
standard 
of 
product 
and 
the 
food 
and 
beverages 
on 
offer 
are 
specified 
in 
line 
with 
10 
customer 
needs, 
preferences 
and 
expectations, 
over 
time 
SAA 
has 
experienced 
a 
severe 
deterioration in the quality and standard of product 
offered by Air Chefs based on Premium customer 
complaints 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
customer 
value 
proposition at ORTIA’s lounges which are ranked as 
high value customer touch points.  The negative 
customer experience has not only detrimentally 
affected SAA from a reputational and commercial 
perspective but has also resulted in SAA’s Premium 
20 
customers 
beginning 
to 
use 
the 
slow 
lounge,  
British Airways customer value proposition, which is 
SAA’s competitor.”  
And then she goes on and she explains because of that 
challenge with the service delivery, the impact it was 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 179 of 257 
 
having on SAA both reputationally and commercially there 
was then this decision to go out on tender. 
 
Were you aware of that at the time Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair I was not aware about the decision 
to go out to tender.  We became aware of this when we 
were asked in Parliament. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So why did you not become aware of it a 
week or so earlier when the memo was prepared? 
MS KWINANA:   I am not sure if this memo was prepared 
before they went out to tender, or it was prepared for the 
10 
Zondo Commission. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no, no it is an historical document, it 
is a document dated the 20 t h of August, so they have gone 
out on tender, they have run the whole process and now 
she is alerting the Board about the process ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   I see, oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   ...before you went to Parliament. 
MS KWINANA:   Oh, they have gone out to tender, that is 
the problem, that is the problem Chair, they were not 
supposed to have gone out to tender. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but she is not asking you about that, 
she is saying this memo from Ms Mpshe is dated 20 August 
2015. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting at Parliament appears to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 180 of 257 
 
have been on the 1 s t of September 2015, she is asking why 
you would not have been aware about a week or ten days 
before the meeting in Parliament, since this memo from Ms 
Mpshe was addressed to Board members. 
MS KWINANA:   It would be good if other board members 
would confirm this memo because I really do not trust it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You really don’t? 
MS KWINANA:   I don’t trust it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t trust? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Trust? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, I don’t trust this memo Chair because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t trust that it is on ethic? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, the reason why I do not trust it Chair 
is because we were all surprised by this revelation in 
Parliament, so it may happen that she may have prepared 
it and did not send it to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could it also have been like in the case 
20 
of the Swissport Ground Handling contract that you got it 
and you just did not read it. 
MS KWINANA:   The contract no Chair I did not get the 
contract, we do not get the contract in the meeting, we get 
the submission and then if there is an agreement then 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 181 of 257 
 
management goes back to write the contract so in the 
meeting we do get the submission, not the contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but that could not ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   That is why I am saying, that is why I was 
saying I do not want to read that contract because I am not 
party to it, the only thing that I would do is to – if it is 
available is to read the Board resolution and see if it has 
been translated correctly in the contract, but remember 
that the contract is the management document, it is not my 
document. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Ms Kwinana I am – it is a pity you 
are taking us back to the thing, as  Board member if 
certain contracts required Board approval you would want 
to see the contract before you approve it because why 
would you agree to approve a contract you have not seen? 
MS KWINANA:   No Chair, this is how the process, the 
approval process happen, you come to the meeting with a 
proposal and then now there is an agreement to say now 
you can go and enter into a contract and then management 
goes back and enter into a contract, and they file it, they 
20 
don’t bring it back unless there is something that requires 
that in the next board meeting the contracts is brought 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if the requirement is that you must 
approve the contract you have to see the contract, you are 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 182 of 257 
 
not – you can’t approve it until it exists, and you can’t 
approve it unless you see it, because otherwise you are 
going to approve a contract whose terms you don’t know. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair that is the misunderstanding that we 
had before lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm? 
MS KWINANA:   That is the misunderstanding that we had 
before lunch, what comes to the Board is a submission with 
the terms and conditions to be approved and then when 
those terms and conditions are approved then that’s when 
10 
management goes back and put it in a contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never as the Board want to see the 
actual contract to see whether the terms that found its way, 
found their way into the contract are the terms that you 
approved? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair there is – there are so many 
assurance bodies in an organisation, there is internal 
audit, there is external audit, there is risk management 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No but I am talking about ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS KWINANA:   There are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana if the policy or the 
regulations or the law says this type of contract must be 
approved by the Board I am saying how could you approve 
a proposal and end there, a proposal to enter into a 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 183 of 257 
 
contract on the following terms and never say we want to 
see the actual contract that you entered into when you say 
to management, we want to see the actual contract so that 
we can see whether you actually carried out what we 
approved, we want to see whether the actual terms in 
which you entered are the terms that we approved, or you 
did your own thing. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair the contract, the contract document 
does not come to the Board, what comes to the Board is 
the submission ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Ms Mbanjwa – I am sorry Ms 
Kwinana, please carry on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  We were dealing with 
the memorandum that I understand Ms Kwinana’s evidence 
to be she does not trust, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr just the last thing 
and I just want to raise this because this kind of horrifies 
me.  So does mean that during your time when you were a 
board member at SAA there may have been a lot of 
contracts 
where 
the 
Board 
made 
approved 
that 
the 
20 
management must negotiate and enter into without the 
Board ever seeing once the contracts had been signed 
whether the management did its own thing or whether the 
management entered into the contracts on the terms 
approved by the Board. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 184 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Not the actual contracts Chair but the 
terms and conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no but I am saying does it mean 
that there would have been many ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...contracts where you never saw the 
ultimate contract whether it was in accordance with the 
Board’s terms and conditions, you just said go and enter 
into a contract along the following terms and conditions 
and you left it at that? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair, and in fact that is also part of 
our trust in the calibre of management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well you did not have any trust in the 
calibre of management, did you, in August of 2015? 
MS KWINANA:   Ms Mpshe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Just Ms Mpshe, you didn’t have any trust 
in her calibre? 
MS KWINANA:   Not in everything but in the decision of 
LSG, in the decision of LSG then no. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So we were just establishing whether 
you knew before you attended Parliament that there had 
been consideration given to why they wanted to go out to 
tender and we saw here what that motivation was, but 
because of the sub-standard performance of Air Chefs it 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 185 of 257 
 
was having a reputational and commercially negative 
impact on SAA, were you aware of that before you attended 
Parliament? 
MS KWINANA:   As I said Chair I made an example, a very 
easy example of the fat cakes.  I would not go next door 
and buy fat cakes and leave my child’s fat cakes here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Even if I had a challenge with them, if I 
have a challenge with them I would say reduce the baking 
powder, add this and this and this, so that it can be to the 
10 
customer ’s satisfaction. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana what was my question? 
MS KWINANA:   Forgotten about it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is because you repeatedly, with 
respect Ms Kwinana do not answer the question, it was 
simply a question about what you knew.  Did you know 
when you attended Parliament that the reason why SAA’s 
management had decided to go out on tender was because 
...[indistinct]  
MS KWINANA:   I said, I said ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   That is why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   I only knew about the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana when I call you please keep 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 186 of 257 
 
quiet. 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr has not even finished 
asking you the question and yet the previous question you 
admitted you could not remember what the question was.  
The reason why she has to repeat the question now is 
because you did not listen to the question and answer the 
question, and now when she is repeating the question for 
your benefit, because you did not listen before, you start 
talking before she can finish.  We are going to waste time 
10 
if we do it like that.  I said to you before please it is in 
your interest and in the interest of everybody that when 
she asks you questions you keep quiet and listen carefully 
and then answer that question.   
 
I am going to ask Ms Hofmeyr to repeat the 
question, this time just listen carefully.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Were you aware when you attended 
Parliament on the 2 n d of September that the reason why 
SAA’s management had decided to go out on tender for 
these lounge catering services was because Air Chefs the 
20 
prior provider, was providing sub-standard performance, 
which was having a reputational and commercially negative 
impact on SAA.  Were you aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you become aware of it after 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 187 of 257 
 
attending Parliament? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and I take you to disagree with 
that, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now your reasons for disagreeing – 
sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at four, we have agreed we will 
all go beyond four o’clock but maybe we should take a 
break. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you have a question that you want 
to ask ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  No, we can take the break now, I am very 
comfortable with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take a break and resume at 
quarter past four.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  We were dealing with 
the memorandum that Ms Kwinana does not trust dated the 
20 August 2015.  And Ms Kwinana I reference two paragraph 
where the background to why the decision had been taken to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 188 of 257 
 
go out on tender was recorded.  But what is noteworthy I 
want to suggest to you what else Ms Mpshe says in this 
memorandum is that she actually takes up your very point.  
The point about should the parent not be assisting the child. 
Are you aware that she addressed that very issue? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And as you sit here today you do not have 
a recollection of ever reading this memorandum, is that 
right? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well what she did say addressing the 
board is that and I now Chair just for record DD19[a] at page 
132.3.1 the same page we were on previously.  But I am now 
going to read from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That last passage. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  From the last paragraph sort of half of the 
way down because what she records there is she says: 
“Several interactions were held between SAA 
and Air Chefs to find means to improve the 
level of service delivery achieved.  However 
20 
and 
notwithstanding 
these 
efforts 
no 
improved results were recorded.  SAA was 
accordingly faced with no option but to take 
a decision to go out on a confined tender to 
achieve 
the 
desired 
commercial 
value 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 189 of 257 
 
proposition 
expected 
for 
this 
premium 
customer segment.” 
So you were not aware that there actually had been efforts 
between SAA and Air Chefs to do the very thing that I think 
your vetkoek example is supposed to convey.  Correct? 
MS KWINANA:  I was not aware Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now you are so are you satisfied that they 
did take steps to do the very thing you were concerned 
about? 
MS KWINANA:  I am not satisfied Chair because I – as I said 
10 
I do not believe this memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it is true that they take those 
measures to try and get Air Chefs to improve its level of 
service delivery but those efforts did not succeed would you 
accept that in that case then if that is true then it would be 
understandable and justifiable for them to look elsewhere for 
service of the right quality at the right level? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair I would not understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I would not understand it.  Of course if 
20 
your child does not listen to what you are saying – let us say 
your child does not want to go to school; she bunks school 
you hand hold that child and take him to school.  So 
basically I just would not understand – I still do not 
understand Chair. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 190 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you – are you saying that there could 
never be a point where they say, look we have tried 
everything with Air Chefs to get them to improve their 
service and their efforts are you saying that such a point 
would – could not be reached? 
MS KWINANA:  They would not have tried enough Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying therefore that they should 
just go on and on and on even if they can – they could see 
that their efforts were not bearing fruit? 
MS KWINANA:  No.  Not going on and on and on Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  But I am saying you hand hold your child.  
You do not throw you child in the dustbin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well leave out the child example now. 
MS KWINANA:  You going to hold [Chairperson speaking 
over Ms Kwinana] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Leave out the child example let us talk 
about this.  This is a business now. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not at home.  This is a business.  SAA 
20 
must be run like a business. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now they are saying – Ms Mpshe is saying 
in this memorandum telling the board over the years or over 
whatever period when Air Chefs was providing the service 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 191 of 257 
 
there had been complaints about the quality of the service.  
They as management had made a number of efforts to try 
and get Air Chefs to improve their – the quality of their 
service and these efforts had not borne any fruit.  It was only 
after that that they decided look we must go to open tender.  
So are you saying that the – no matter how unsuccessful 
their efforts were they should have gone on and on trying to 
get Air Chefs to improve their service even if they realised 
that it simply was not working? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I am saying if they tried they did not 
10 
try hard enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but they say they have tried enough. 
MS KWINANA:  Of course it is their word against mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but … 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying they did not try hard enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you do not know whether they – 
what they say to you we have tried hard enough.  Is there a 
point which you accept? 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At which they could say we have tried 
20 
enough. 
MS KWINANA:  I am saying Chair I was a board member of 
SAA and I did not feel their efforts so that is why I am saying 
if they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How could you feel their efforts they were 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 192 of 257 
 
not talking to you they were talking to Air Chefs. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair the Air Chefs is the subsidiary of SAA 
they could not close Air Chefs without informing SAA; 
without informing the shareholder.  They could have even 
gone up to the shareholder to say, we have given up on Air 
Chefs.  We have done a,b,c,d and e. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS KWINANA:  So that is why I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please continue. 
MS KWINANA:  They did not try hard enough. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Kwinana I want to try and get some 
common ground because you have said repeatedly you do 
not trust that memorandum so I want to actually go to an 
email that Ms Mpshe sent directly to you amongst other 
people because maybe we can work with the content of what 
she said there.  So let us go to her actual email to you.  You 
will find that a few pages on in the bundle you are busy with 
DD19[a] and it is at page 132.11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what is the page number? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  132.11. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now Ms Kwinana you will see that starts 
with an email from Ms Mpshe copied to Ms Myeni, yourself, 
Mr Dickson and Dr Thambi cc’d to many people and it says in 
quite big green – sorry blue lettering there. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 193 of 257 
 
“Dear board members and colleagues please 
note the trailing emails in respect of the 
lounge discussion today.  Please familiarise 
yourself 
with 
the 
contents 
thereof 
in 
particular the legal implication and risks 
associated with the decision.” 
So now we have jumped – well that is an email dated the 28 
September but the trailing email that I want to focus on is 
the one just below it midway down the page which is an 
email that Ms Mpshe send to amongst other you.  It is dated 
10 
the 8 September 2015.  Do you recall receiving that at the 
time? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You do.  And did you read it? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  And did you read the trail of 
emails?  You can go through to page 15 because that is the 
end of this trail?  You are copied on all of the relevant as I 
can see it.   
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So you read it at the time and I 
understand what – one thing you were really concerned 
about is that this decision would close down Air Chefs, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair.

ADV HOFMEYR:  Now Ms Mpshe told you that it would not, 
you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:  How would it not go down Air Chefs? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well because – no well why do you not tell 
me how it would? 
MS KWINANA:  SAA … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Closer – closer to the microphone. 
MS KWINANA:  Air Chefs was mainly formed to service SAA 
and therefore SAA is a bigger customer – is the major 
customer of Air Chefs.  And therefore in any business if you 
10 
take out the major client that business is going to close 
down. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but… 
MS KWINANA:  And again let me finish Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
MS 
KWINANA: 
 And 
again 
if 
for 
instance 
SAA 
the 
shareholder the 100% shareholder of Air Chefs has lost 
confidence in Air Chefs what about the other airlines and 
other customers that they even serviced by Air Chefs.  So 
she was also not telling the truth to say Air Chefs was not 
20 
going to close.  In fact if you could interview the employees 
of Air Chefs they were being retrenched already. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You were worried about that were you not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She also told you they were not going to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 195 of 257 
 
be retrenched, do you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:  Where would they work? No man Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you know where they were going to 
work?  They were going to work for LSG Sky Chefs.  It was a 
requirement that they be taken over Ms Kwinana.  Were you 
aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:  You know Chair we have heard that before.  
We have heard that before.  As Air Chefs was going through 
the retrenchment process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No the tender itself and the contract that 
10 
was going to be concluded required the employees of Air 
Chefs to be taken over by LSG Sky Chefs.  There was not 
going to be a single retrenchment.  That is what Ms Mpshe 
told you on the 8 September 2015.  Do you not remember 
that? 
MS KWINANA:  I told Ms Mpshe that Ms Mpshe is 
suppressing evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  And that is another – I said we can start she 
is suppressing because Air Chefs. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  Was going through to – retrenchments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please listen to me.  You are not 
answering her question.  You are responding to a question 
she did not ask.  Please stick to answering her questions.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 196 of 257 
 
Ms Hofmeyr do you want to repeat your question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well I understand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Each time a question has to be repeated 
we are wasting time. 
MS KWINANA:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I asked you whether you were aware that 
Ms Mpshe told you in her email of the 8 September that 
there would be no retrenchments because it was a condition 
of the tender and the to be  concluded contract that the Air 
10 
Chefs employees would be taken over by LSG Sky Chefs.  
What is your answer to that? 
MS KWINANA:  She was not telling the truth. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh.  So if I can show you the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well okay.  Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr is saying to 
you Ms Kwinana the contract that was going to be signed by 
Sky Chefs was going to include a clause or did include a 
clause to say they must take over the employees of Air 
Chefs.  Now I can tell you this and Ms Hofmeyr knows it as 
well, maybe Ms Mbanjwa knows it as well when this type of 
20 
thing happens Section 197 of the Labour Relations Act 
obliges the new company to take over the employees of the 
company which has lost the tender – which is no longer 
going to do the job.  So to the extent that the contract to 
which Ms Hofmeyr is referring you may have had a clause to 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 197 of 257 
 
that effect that would have been in line with the law.  But 
even if that clause was not there the law – the Labour 
Relations Act would have obliged the new company to take 
them over.  You understand that? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know you are not a lawyer but I am now 
telling you what – at least a statute says. 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I am not a lawyer but what I know is 
that 
Air 
Chefs 
was 
going 
through 
the 
retrenchments 
processes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I am sorry.  Ms Mbanjwa you 
wanted to say something at some stage or has it fallen off – 
fallen away? 
ADV MBANJWA:  No Chair what I thought Ms Hofmeyr 
would refer us to is the tender document that had these 
conditions that oblige … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think in due course she will.  Okay 
alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like to take you to the contract 
itself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let us find it.  That is in your bundle Ms 
Kwinana at DD – so that is Exhibit DD33.  Chair it is under 
Tab 15 and so that starts at page 154.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 198 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You will see that that was the contract 
that was to be entered into.  Is this a contract you saw at 
the time Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:  Are we still on Air Chefs Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KWINANA:  In DD33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I cannot hear you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  DD33 page 154 under Tab 15.Do you 
have that Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that is the contract that SAA was 
going to enter into with LSG Sky Chefs.  Did you see that 
at the time? 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair.  As I said the board was not 
responsible to see the contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh yes. 
MS KWINANA:  So I did not see the contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I remember that.  But what Ms Mpshe 
said to you in that email of the 8 September is exactly what 
the Chair has highlighted and then I will take you to the 
20 
contract and where it references Section 187.  Let me just 
tell you what she said in that email of the 8 September.  
Ms Kwinana you can go there if you want to but otherwise I 
will just read it into the record.  It is where we were back 
in DD19[a] at 132.12.  She says: 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 199 of 257 
 
“There are not job losses emanating…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is paragraph 7 hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Paragraph 7 thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 132.12. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Point 12.  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   
“There are no job losses emanating from 
the award of services to LSG Sky Chefs as 
any impacted Air Chefs employees will be 
10 
transferred to the successful bidder as per 
the 
conditions 
set 
out 
in 
the 
tender 
document in accordance with Section 197 of 
the Labour Relations Act 1995.” 
And then just for good measure so that we could see it in 
the anticipated contract I wanted to take you to the 
contract which I have done at DD33 page 154.  If you go 
right to the end of that contract at page 179 you will see 
detailed clause 25 imposes this contractual obligation over 
and above the legal obligation under Section 197.  So Ms 
20 
Kwinana is it still your evidence before this commission 
that Ms Mpshe was quoted lying to the board of directors 
at SAA when she said in her email to you on the 8 
September 2016- 15 – what year are we in – 15 that there 
were going to be no job losses? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 200 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:  Chair what I am saying is there were – Air 
Chefs was going through retrenchment process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But not related Ms Kwinana to this 
contract.  This was lounge catering services.  Every 
employee of Air Chefs who was ever involved in lounge 
catering services was going to move over to the new 
supplier.  How could that possibly then be a reason for you 
to reject management’s decision? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I am saying Air Chefs was going 
through retrenchments. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your voice Ms Kwinana. 
MS KWINANA:  Air Chefs.  Chair I am saying Air Chefs was 
going through retrenchments.  And in fact this contract … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Ms Hofmeyr is saying to you 
whatever retrenchments Air Chefs may have been going 
through if there was any could not have arisen out of this 
because there was proper provision for the employees 
under this contract to be taken over by the new contractor.  
So 
if 
there 
were 
some 
retrenchments 
or 
letters 
of 
retrenchments that may have been given to employees they 
20 
probably did not relate to this.  That is what she is saying.  
Now do you know whether to the extent that Air Chefs may 
have been in the process of retrenching some employees 
do you know whether it was connected with this or it could 
have been connected with something else? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 201 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:  It was connected with this Chair because 
when we subsequently reversed this award of course the 
contract was not yet signed.  But when we eventually 
reversed this award the retrenchments did stop so which 
means therefore that the retrenchments were as a result of 
this award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so that was your – your inference 
from what happened? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But nobody ever said to you that those 
10 
retrenchments were connected or – to this award? 
MS KWINANA:  It was – it was – it was a known fact Chair 
because Air Chefs was closing down and therefore the 
retrenchments were related to Air Chefs being closing 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it does not follow – it does not follow.  
You may have thought at that time it followed because you 
might not have known what Section 197 of the Labour 
Relations Act says.   
You might have thought so at that time.  You see 
20 
the – Section 197 does not allow that to happen.  Even if 
an employer does not include it in the contract – in the 
agreement employees are supposed to be taken over by 
the new contractor.   
That is part of what the Labour Relations Act has 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 202 of 257 
 
put in place in order to protect jobs for workers.  To say 
when there is a new company coming to do a job that your 
employer has been doing or you have been doing for your 
employer the workers must not suffer.  That is the 
protection that is there.  Ms Mbanjwa you wanted to say – 
ask something? 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes Chair I am not arguing the issue of 
Section 197 I am not a labour expert I will freely admit that 
and I know you are from that is.  But what I just want to 
point out is that if one reads in page D33 page 179 in 
10 
paragraph 25.1 the way that paragraph is cast is not in the 
terms that has been read here.  I will read it for the record 
it says: 
CHAIRPERSON:  No do not read it we can see it. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Oh okay thank you.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says the agreement is subject to the 
provisions of Section 197. 
ADV MBANJWA:  Yes.  And it does not say – and this is 
very important for a board member.  It did not say that it is 
a condition of the award of this tender that all employees 
20 
of Sky Chefs will be taken over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MBANJWA:  If I may be allowed to finish Chair.  And 
the second most important thing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms … 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 203 of 257 
 
ADV MBANJWA:  It is drafted to create… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Mbanjwa.  That is something 
you can raise in re-examination or argument.  It says 
subject to Section 197.  If you go and read Section 197 you 
will know that – you will know that it will cover all 
employees who were doing the job that will now be taking 
over by a new company.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV 
MBANJWA: 
 
I 
just 
wanted 
to 
point 
out 
the 
indemnification that if it was so tight then there would be 
no need to put in an indemnification... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue Ms Hofmeyr.  Please 
continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I just want to do the 
last deal with the last point. You said you were concerned 
about the retrenchments and you were concerned about the 
fact that Air Chefs was going to close down if this business 
went to LSG Sky Chefs, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well Ms Mpshe told you that it was not 
going to close down and you I think I raised that with you 
20 
earlier and you said how could it not because SAA is it 
main customer.  Did I have your evidence correctly? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you see what Ms Mpshe went into 
some detail to tell you in those emails we were looking at 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 204 of 257 
 
previously is how small a percentage of Air Chefs revenue 
this lounge services contract actually took up.  Do you 
remember what that percentage was? 
MS KWINANA:  No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see at page 132.14 which is in the 
email trail that we were looking at at DD19 she makes it 
clear and I am reading under point 1 on that page on the 
email on which you were copied on the 3 September 2015 
now.  She says: 
“The award of the lounge catering contract 
10 
to LSG does not in way affect the current…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. I am sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 132.13? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  14 sorry Chair the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  14? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So this is Ms Mpshe writing to amongst 
others you Ms Kwinana on the 3 September 2015 and it is 
20 
addressed to the Chairperson but you are copied on it.  
And she deals under point 1 there with the following.  She 
says: 
“The award of the lounge catering contract 
to LSG does not in any way affect the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 205 of 257 
 
current process being undertaken to divest 
Air Chefs.  The lounge service contract 
represents 4.265% of the Air Chefs total 
annual 
revenue. 
 As 
per 
the 
attached 
notification 
to 
the 
board 
there 
will 
be 
negligible revenue loss for Air Chefs with 
an estimate of R1.8 million net per annum 
to Air Chefs as per the current CVP and 
rates related thereto.” 
So she is communicating there to as I understand the stat 
10 
it comprises less than 4.3% of the Air Chefs total revenue.  
It was a negligible on all accounts part of the Air Chefs 
revenue and only it was going to go to a third party 
suppliers.  So it was not going to close down because this 
contract was going to LSG Sky Chefs, was it? 
MS KWINANA:  I also do not trust that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You do not trust that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS KWINANA:  Yes.  I also do not trust that – that is Ms 
Mpshe’s submission which I do not trust Chair 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not accept what she says namely 
that the revenue that Air Chefs would lose by reason of the 
fact that this service would be given to somebody else was 
less than 4.3%.  Do you not accept that? 
MS KWINANA:  I would have to audit Chair whatever Ms 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 206 of 257 
 
Mpshe is saying I do not trust that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  You – as we – as you sit 
there you do not know whether it is true or not? 
MS KWINANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you have a reason not to accept 
it? 
MS KWINANA:  It is because Chair as I have said she has 
suppressed a lot of evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But she would have written this 
email to you at a certain time. I would have imagined that 
10 
if you saw this and you did not trust it you would have 
checked to see whether her figure was correct?  Did you do 
that? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair that email was inconsequential the 
reason being that a tender had gone out and we had 
already heard about this thing in Parliament and I think we 
already had got them to cancel it.  So basically that email 
was inconsequential to me. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
No 
it 
could 
not 
have 
been 
inconsequential it preceded your decision to cancel the 
20 
award.  It is your acting Chief Executive Officer writing to 
the board of SAA because she was drawn over the coals on 
her evidence after that address in Parliament and told she 
had to account.  And she gave this detailed account on the 
3 September preceding the board’s decision which comes 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 207 of 257 
 
on the 28 September 2015. So I put it to you Ms Kwinana it 
was nothing less of critical for you to understand it, 
interrogate it and make an informed decision on it.  What is 
your response to that? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair Ms Mpshe had already gone out to 
tender irregularly so and therefore… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no Ms Kwinana please, please, 
please you said – you said this email was inconsequential 
because you had already as the board taken the decision 
that the award should be cancelled. 
10 
MS KWINANA:  Cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Ms Hofmeyr tells you that that is 
factually not true.  This email was before the board made 
the decision.  The question now is we go back to my 
question.  You got this, you saw this email, you saw that 
Ms Mpshe was saying the revenue that Air Chefs were 
going to lose by virtue of this decision to award the 
contract to somebody else was less than 4.3%.  If you did 
not agree with that did you check whether that figure was 
correct or not and if it was not what was the correct figure?  
20 
Did you check that? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair Ms Mpshe had already gone out to 
tende… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No answer – my question is did you 
check whether what the correct figure was if you did not 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 208 of 257 
 
trust this figure?  That is my question. 
MS KWINANA:  No Chair I did not check it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you not if you did not trust it? 
MS KWINANA:  It was because – it is because I do not 
even trust whatever he said after she awarded the contract 
to a foreign company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is precisely the reason why you 
should check if you do not trust her.  If you trusted her you 
did not have to check.  But if you did not trust her as you 
say you did not that is all the more reason why you should 
10 
check whether she has got the figure right? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair she had already awarded the tender 
irregularly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are about to reverse that if you 
were not satisfied with her motivation.  Now why did you 
not check if you did not trust this figure? 
MS KWINANA:  Chair I did not see any reason for me to 
check.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position that it did not matter what 
she said? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Actually ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not interested.  You are simply 
going to reverse to say – the decision.  Is that what you are 
saying? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, what I said is.  The fact that 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 209 of 257 
 
Ms Mpshe preferred a foreign company at the expense of the 
local company.  At the expense of a hundred percent 
subsidiary company.  I lost confidence in her, unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For that reason, you were not interested 
in whatever motivation she put before you.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I have seen Ms Mpshe suppressing 
evidence in this important ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, I am asking you a very 
simple question.  Did you not care whatever motivation 
Ms Mpshe placed before you in order before you could take 
10 
the decision whether to reverse the decision or not?  Did you 
not care whatever she said? 
MS KWINANA:   She would write Chair a motivation 
according to her.  She would write a motivation according to 
her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is the fact ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   The fact that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana.  Ms Kwinana, I think it is the 
third time I am asking you this question.  I am going to ask 
you for the fourth time and it is the last time.  Is the position 
20 
that you did not care whatever motivation Ms Mpshe placed 
before you?  You were not interested in her motivation? 
MS KWINANA:   Not after I felt that she had betrayed the 
contract the way she did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay the answer is, you were not 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 210 of 257 
 
interested.  Ms Hofmeyr, continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your evidence was, you did not trust her 
after 
she 
preferred 
a 
foreign 
company 
over 
a 
local 
subsidiary.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She did not prefer a foreign company over 
a local subsidiary.  An entire tender process was run in 
which Air Chefs was a competing tenderer.  Did you know 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   That was even wrong Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, the question is.  Did you see know 
that Air Chefs competed in the tender? 
MS KWINANA:   That was not even supposed to happen like 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Kwinana.  The questions is.  Did 
you know that or not? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I am not going to answer yes or not.  
But I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you either knew or you did not know.  
Or is the position that you do not know whether you knew? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, that tender did not go to the board 
and therefore I did not know that there was a tender going 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, she told you in her notes in 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 211 of 257 
 
September and back in August that ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Chair, in September that tender was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, wait until the question is 
complete, please.  Wait until the question is complete. 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The reason why you are end up answering 
questions that have not been asked is because you do not 
listen when a question is being asked or you interrupt 
Ms Hofmeyr before she completes her question.  Just listen 
10 
carefully, let her finish her question and then you can 
answer.  
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, Ms Kwinana.  You are absolutely 
right.  The board was not notified before the process.  That 
is because it fell within the delegated authority of structures 
below the board.  What happened is, you attend the 
parliament on the 2n d of September.   
 
This issue was raised and then the CEO was called to 
account for what had happened because there was an 
20 
allegation that this was somehow irregular because it had 
gone to a foreign company.  Right.   
 
What she does and she then respond to you and she 
tells you about the tender process that was run.  You 
confirmed having read her emails.  Is that correct? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 212 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what she said there is the following.  I 
am now back at page 132.12, paragraph 6.  She says: 
“As per the board notification of 20 August 2015... 
 
I understand you were – you did not trust that document.  
I mean, she repeatedly refers to the memorandum that she 
has already provided in these emails. 
“I suggested to her if there was any ambiguity about 
that, somebody would have picked it up.  I do not 
see that in these emails.  Nonetheless...” 
10 
 
She says.   
“As per the board notification on 20 August 2015, 
responses to the RFP were received from Air Chefs, 
LSD Sky Chefs and Newrest.  A lawful and duly 
constituted procurement process was followed in 
respect 
of 
which 
all 
received 
responses 
were 
properly evaluated. 
In this regard, it must be noted that Air Chefs failed 
to the meet the minimum threshold for evaluation in 
the 
tender 
and 
was 
lawfully 
precluded 
from 
20 
proceeding to further stages of evaluation.” 
 
Ms Kwinana, I draw that to your attention because you 
said it is Ms Mpshe who preferred the foreign company.  And 
I put it to you, it was not Ms Mpshe who preferred the foreign 
company.  Air Chefs failed to move passed the first stage of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 213 of 257 
 
a lawfully and procedurally fair process.  What is your 
response to that? 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying Chair.  That tender was 
irregular for the reasons I have just mentioned.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   It was not - it was supposed to go to that 
stage.  It was not even ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, you are being asked a 
10 
question about what is written here in paragraph 6, namely 
the reason why Air Chefs did not get the tender even though 
it was one of the tenderers.   
 
It was that it failed to meet a lawful requirement, certain 
lawful requirements.  Minimum, basic minimum.  That is what 
is being said to you.  
 
Do you accept that that is why Air Chefs did not get the 
tender as opposed to saying it was Ms Mpshe who just 
preferred to give the tender to another company?  You 
accept that? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not accept that Air Chefs failed to 
meet a basic requirement? 
MS KWINANA:   Not even that Chair.  Even before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but let us talk about this one 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 214 of 257 
 
...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   ...was supposed to have been arrived at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about this one.  Do you not 
accept that ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair.  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...Air 
Chefs 
failed 
to 
meet 
this 
requirement? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Chair I do not accept it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you checked whether they did or 
they did not? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, that tender to be where it is, was not 
even supposed to be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  I am talking ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   It was not even supposed to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This requirement ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Why would I check Chair something that 
was irregular, that was not even supposed to happen? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am talking about this requirement.  Have 
you checked whether – when Ms Mpshe says Air Chefs failed 
to meet a basic requirement, whether that is factually true?  
20 
Did you check that at the time?  Have you checked that 
subsequently?   
MS KWINANA:   Chair, my answer is still.  Why would I 
check if the process was not even supposed to happen? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, I am going to try the best I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 215 of 257 
 
can to be fair to you as a witness because I try to be fair to 
all witnesses.  When I evaluate evidence, I need to evaluate, 
among other things, what type of a witness you were.   
 
And if I make a finding that is very adverse to you as a 
witness, that might have far-reaching implications for you 
professionally.   
 
Please, take my guidance.  Listen to questions.  Answer 
those questions.  I go back to my question.  When Ms Mpshe 
says, Air Chefs did not meet a basic requirement.  Do you 
know whether she is right or not right or do you not know? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Ms Kwinana, why do you keep 
saying LSD Sky Chefs is a foreign company? 
MS KWINANA:   It is because our understanding is that LSD 
Sky Chefs is a subsidiary of Lufthansa.  Lufthansa, our 
understanding, is a German company.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And – but were you aware at the time that 
LSD Sky Chefs is a locally incorporated company, paying tax 
here and purchasing its product and do its servicing here 
20 
with local suppliers? 
MS KWINANA:   My understanding Chair of LSD Sky Chefs 
is that it is a Lufthansa subsidiary company. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, that was not my question.  I said, 
were you aware that it is a locally incorporated company that 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 216 of 257 
 
pays tax here and that was deriving its services and 
products locally?  Were you aware of those facts? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, my question – my answer is.  What I 
knew is that LSD Sky Chefs ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Look this side Ms Kwinana so 
I can hear your answer. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair.  No, I am saying Chair.  What I knew 
is that LSD Sky Chefs is a hundred percent owned subsidiary 
of Lufthansa.  And Lufthansa is a competitor of SAA.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, you did not – you were not 
10 
aware of what she has just put to you? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the question is whether you were 
aware of that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  I was not aware.  I am now 
aware.  However, my awareness now has not changed what I 
was thinking then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   It has not changed at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So on your reasoning, Swissport South 
Africa is also a foreign company, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   [No audible reply]  
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Mbanjwa. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 217 of 257 
 
MS MBANJWA:   I do not want to waste time.  But if 
Ms Hofmeyr is going to make these statements like saying it 
is paying tax here and there is no evidence of that.  How are 
we supposed to treat that evidence? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Asking whether Ms Kwinana was aware of 
certain facts.  That is the basis of the question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [microphone on mute] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will ask the question.  On your reasoning 
then, Swissport South Africa is a foreign company, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And you approved more than one 
billion rand going from SAA going to a foreign company then, 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I did not approve that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did in the resolution of the 
14t h of March 2016 when you approved the contract for five 
years to Swissport to provide ground handling services which 
were going to be to the value of more than a billion rand. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, let me explain and try to explain 
maybe for the third time now how this contract happened.  I 
20 
know that you are saying I must not refer to 2012 but I need 
to refer to it because the award was made in 2012.   
 
And 
in 
2016, 
we 
were 
approving 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions.  The award was done and it followed a proper 
process.  That is number one.   
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 218 of 257 
 
 
And number two.  You cannot compare Swissport and Air 
Chefs.  With Swissport, I did talk about a license and I did 
talk about the fact that the reason why SAA Technical would 
not perform the function that they wanted to perform.  It is 
because they did not have a licence.   
 
And therefore, you just cannot compare Swissport and 
LSD Sky Chefs.  You are comparing two different things.  
That is number one.   
 
Number two.  I did not award the contract.  I was part of 
the board that approved the terms and conditions.   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana, I am just pushing, you know, 
your analyses of LSD Sky Chefs being a foreign company 
and putting to you, is it not putting Swissport South Africa in 
the same position?   
 
I do not really want to go back to Swissport because we 
have felt with that.  But you did say something a moment ago 
is inconsistent with your evidence earlier.   
 
And so in fairness to you, I must put it to you.  You tried 
to justify the award in 2016 ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   There was no award Chair in 2016 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Wait Ms Kwinana.  Ms Hofmeyr has not 
finished to put her question to you.  Just wait. 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If I understand your evidence.  You 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 219 of 257 
 
justified the contract that was given to Swissport in March of 
2016 on the basis that a tender process had already been 
followed in 2012 that was regular.  Is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  You see the problem with that 
answer Ms Kwinana is that, earlier today you told us that 
your recollection of the 10t h of February 2016 meeting with 
Swissport was that you were going there to tell them that a 
proper tender process had to be followed. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember giving that evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is entirely inconsistent with the 
version you had just given which is that the tender process 
had already been taken care of way back in 2012.  Do you 
have a response to that contradiction? 
MS KWINANA:   The circumstances Chair are different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   The circumstances are different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS KWINANA:   You cannot ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, this is what Ms Hofmeyr is saying to 
you.  She is saying, you said earlier that you went to that 
meeting to tell Swissport that an open tender would have to 
be followed. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 220 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
MS KWINANA:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she says when you say now the 
contract had been awarded in 2012, that would mean a 
tender process had already been followed.  Therefore, you 
could not talk about having to follow a tender process when 
it had already been followed.  That is what she is putting to 
you.  She is saying, there is a conflict, a contradiction 
between these two things that you are saying.  What do you 
10 
say to that? 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying Chair, Air Chefs is a hundred 
percent subsidiary of SAA.  And the Swissport is not a 
subsidiary of SAA.  So basically, that is why I am saying that 
tender should not even have happened, the tender of Air 
Chefs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us take it step by step because I 
do not understand what you are saying as being an answer 
to Ms Hofmeyr’s question.  Do you accept that there is a 
contradiction between the two things you have said?  Maybe 
20 
you say there is an explanation for the contradiction but you 
accept that there is a contradiction? 
MS KWINANA:   There must be contradictions Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 221 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   ...because the circumstances are different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so you say there is justification for 
the contradiction.  And what are the circumstances that make 
it different? 
MS KWINANA:   Air Chefs, Chair is a hundred percent owned 
subsidiary of SAA and Air Chefs was phoned to cater for 
SAA.  And therefore, if there is something wrong with Air 
Chefs that needed to be corrected by SAA.  That is point 
number one.  And point ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Corrected in what way? 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Like as Ms Mpshe was saying there were 
complaints in respect of their services.  So SAA as the 
holding company of Air Chefs was supposed to correct that 
instead of going out to tender because the reason for the 
formation of Air Chefs is the same as the reason for the 
formation of SAA Technical.  So that means ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   So that means, the services of Air Chefs 
were mainly made for SAA.  So basically, the relationship 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to interrupt you Ms Kwinana 
because I do not want us to take too long on something that 
I do not understand.  You accept that if the tender process 
had been followed in 2012, there would have been no basis 
in 2015 for you to say there is going to be an open tender 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 222 of 257 
 
process on the same thing?   
MS KWINANA:   That is why Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Do you accept that there would 
have been no basis for it to say that? 
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, what is it that I accept? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If a tender process had been followed in 
2012. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept that in 2015 and if it was 
the same thing, there would have been no basis for you to 
10 
say this must go to an open tender in 2015 because open 
tender had already been followed. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  There would no basis for it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KWINANA:   ...to place on open tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why did you say that? 
MS KWINANA:   That would depend Chair when that 2012 
tender would expire.  And therefore, if that tender would 
expire.  Now then that would have to go out to tender. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But in this case – so why did you 
say it would have to go to open tender?  Is it because it had 
expired? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  When we looked at 2012 and 
we are now in 2016, I think it was a five year tender, then it 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 223 of 257 
 
would have to go out to tender.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, from 2012 to 2015 is not five years 
Ms Kwinana.   
MS KWINANA:   To 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even to 2016. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, but remember Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you know the numbers.  We are a 
chartered accountant.   
MS KWINANA:   Remember Chair, the tender process takes 
long and therefore, if the 2012, 13/14/15/16 then the other 
10 
six months of the year would have to be used for the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I think it is important just to record 
at this point that we would likely argue in due course that 
Ms Kwinana’s evidence today is evasive.  There have been 
numerous occasions on which simple questions have been 
put to her and the answers not short of evasive.   
 
Ms Kwinana, this question has nothing to do with Air 
Chefs.  It is about a contradiction in the evidence you have 
given today, explaining the Swissport agreement.  So I do 
20 
need to say that.   
 
Do you have anything in response to the submission that 
your evidence today is evasive? 
MS KWINANA:   Well, Chair it is evasive to you but I do not 
see it as being evasive to you. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 224 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, maybe I need to respond to that kind 
of argument that Ms Hofmeyr wants to put. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you do not respond to argument now.  
You can deal with the argument later.  The reason why she 
has to put to her is to be fair to her.  But you can later on 
present argument that says Ms Hofmeyr’s submission in this 
regard is wrong and has no basis and is not justified by the 
answers that Ms Kwinana has given.  But that is for later, not 
10 
now. 
MS MBANJWA:   No, thank you Chair.  I am not responding 
to the argument.  I am just responding to something.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes.  I think Chair, you will recall that just 
before we took the break, there was a confusion about a 
question.  And then I said if we can seek clarification.  Chair, 
you agree that we can seek clarification.  What is confusing 
this witness – and I am just advising Ms Hofmeyr that in 
future she can be careful.  What she does, she takes one 
20 
line of questioning and then she jumps.   
 
Like for instance, there was a time here when we were 
referred to an affidavit.  I battle to find the affidavit.  There 
was no affidavit.  It was actually an email.   
 
And then secondly, she moved to the issue of the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 225 of 257 
 
auditor.  I think it is Mr Mutule.  And then when we were 
listening to what is going to happen to this auditor, she 
jumps.   
 
So what I am trying to say is.  The witness is not being 
evasive but she is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are presenting argument on 
whether she is being evasive or not Ms Mbanjwa.  I said the 
time is not now for that.  It is for later.  Okay.  Let us 
proceed Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  We would just like to 
10 
conclude the Air Chefs aspect.  We have been looking at 
those, that chain of emails Ms Kwinana.  And we were at the 
point where the Chair was questioning whether you had ever 
taken up the issues that you regarded as lies in Ms Mpshe’s 
submission.  And I understand you to have said, you did not, 
for example, go and check the 4.265%.  Is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   No, Ms Mpshe lies.  They ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Look this side Ms Kwinana so I can hear.   
MS KWINANA:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look this side so that I can hear what you 
20 
are saying. 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying Chair.  Ms Mpshe lies start from 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   ...issuing of the tender. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 226 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not about... that is not the answer 
to the question.  Ms Hofmeyr is asking you to confirm 
whether her recollection of what you said is correct.  So you 
need to say yes your recollection is correct or no it is not 
correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the question was.  You did not go and 
check the 4.265%? 
MS KWINANA:   I did not have to. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  You did respond to Ms Kwinana(sic) 
though.  Oh, sorry.  To Ms Mpshe’s email in which she 
10 
referenced the 4.265%.  In which she told you that the 
company was a local South African company.  In which she 
told you that people were going to be retained.  And you did 
that on the basis that she committed treason.  Do you 
remember that?   
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m.  And you wanted her to be 
investigated by the SIU.  Do you remember that? 
MS KWINANA:   I still do Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You still do? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  I guess consistency is a virtue.  
Ms Kwinana, this must have been a very difficult time at the 
board?  You had no trust in your acting CEO.  Is that 
correct? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 227 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You believe that she was lying to you.  Is 
that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you go back to her and say:  Give me 
the nuts and bolts of the 4.265% that you put in your email. 
MS KWINANA:   She did not even have to start there Chair.  
She ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, my question is Ms Kwinana is, did you 
go back to her and say:  Give me evidence of the 4.265%. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, she would have to start from the 
evidence that Air Chefs was producing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, the question is, did you ask 
her to give you evidence supporting the figure that she put 
in?  Yes or no?  Did you ask her for the evidence or 
substantiation? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the answer cannot be yes or no.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it has to be.  Or if it is not yes or no, it 
can be:  I do not...  I cannot remember whether I asked her 
or not. 
MS KWINANA:   No but still it cannot be that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why it cannot be? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 228 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   The reason Chair why it cannot be any of 
those? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why? 
MS KWINANA:   Is because, I said from the beginning that 
this was not even suppose to go out to tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is not ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   ...for any ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   ...proof after that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, that is not what the evidence 
10 
leader wants to know.  Please stop trying to give the 
evidence leader, trying to give me what I – what she has not 
asked.  She is asking you a very simple question.   
 
When you read the memo from Ms Mpshe where she said 
the revenue that Air Chefs were going to lose if this contract 
was – this business was given to somebody else, was less 
than 4.3%.  Did you ask her, either to give you evidence to 
prove that or any substantiation? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I am not going to say yes or no.  I am 
going to say the process was flawed from the beginning.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you...  Do you know whether you did 
ask her or not? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, the process was flawed from the 
beginning.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana, I am...  I do not know how I 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 229 of 257 
 
can explain this to you.  You are not doing a service to 
yourself.  You are not doing justice to yourself.  You are a 
professional.  You are chartered accountant.  Clients out 
there trust that you can do your work as a chartered 
accountant properly.   
 
I do not know how many times I have explained simple 
things and tried in order to be fair to you, to say:  Please, 
just answer the questions that are being asked.   
 
Now you cannot tell me whether you know or you do not 
know whether you asked Ms Mpshe to substantiate her figure 
10 
or to give you evidence.   
 
You keep on wanting to tell me something I did not ask.  
It is not going to be good for you as a witness.  And if I am 
going – if I make an adverse finding against you as a witness 
it could have far-reaching implications for you professionally.   
 
So I am asking you again.  Please, just listen to the 
questions.  Try and answer the question.  If you do not know 
say:  I do not know.  It is okay.  If Ms Hofmeyr accepts that 
you are genuinely saying you do not know, she will not 
bother you to challenge that.  But if she thinks you are not 
20 
being genuine, she will ask you further.   
 
But for your own sake, please just listen to questions 
and try and answer the questions that are being asked.  Do 
not tell me something that you think I want to know which 
has not been asked.   
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 230 of 257 
 
 
When I want to know that, I will ask you.  Ms Hofmeyr 
will ask you.  Okay Ms Hofmeyr continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Kwinana, did you 
consider the advice that had been put together by the highly 
qualified lawyers in the legal department of SAA about this 
award? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did.  Did you notice in that advice that 
you were warned that if you were to reverse the award of the 
tender that would likely be invalid and not in compliance 
10 
with the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, from Cape Town I asked Ms 
Fikelepe if the award letter has been sent to Sky Chefs and 
she said no that has not been sent to Sky Chefs.  So that 
was also – that also gave me some comfort that SAA is not 
going to incur unnecessary or be exposed to unnecessary 
litigation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So can I just be clear?  Your evidence 
now is that Ms Fikelepe told you the letter of award had 
not been sent, is that right? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why did you then refer to cancelling the 
award in your own email? 
MS KWINANA:   Cancelling the decision to award.   The 
letter – the award was already made, the letter was not yet 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 231 of 257 
 
sent. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, that is not true factually.  We will 
get the letter shortly.  But I would just like to focus on the 
lawyer ’s advice, right?  Because the lawyer ’s advice that 
came through and you said you read says this process was 
lawful and procedurally fair and if the board now concludes 
to cancel it then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Sorry, 
is 
there 
something 
saying 
anything? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That there will be possible legal action 
and financial exposure …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, sorry, Chair. 
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, Chair, Ms Hofmeyr has just made a 
statement that it is not true that the award letter, according 
to the testimony of Ms Kwinana, had gone out.  Can she 
please give that evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Wait, Ms Mbanjwa, she has not finished.  
You interrupt while she is busy with her question.  Just 
20 
wait. 
MS MBANJWA:   Chair, I do not want to offend you, she 
had left that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please – you know, she had not finished, 
give her time, it might not be now, it might be later, just 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 232 of 257 
 
give her time to handle – to deal with the – to question 
your client they way she sees fit and at a certain stage if 
she has not referred to that and it is important you can 
raise that but …[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was still in the middle of her 
question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the legal advice from the highly 
qualified lawyers in the SAA legal department was that if 
you were to cancel the award to LSG Sky Chefs that would 
10 
likely result in possible legal action and financial exposure 
to SAA.  Were you aware of that at the time? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and why were you not persuaded by 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   As I said, Chair, I asked Ms Fikelepe if the 
award letter has been given and the answer was no and in 
terms of litigation and financial loss, I think I did address 
that before because also if Air Chefs was going to close, 
as I understand, that would also result in financial losses 
20 
anyway. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair – or let me ask first, sorry.  Ms 
Kwinana, do you know that LSG Sky Chefs did sue SAA 
arising from this cancellation? 
MS KWINANA:   Assisted by Ms Mpshe. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 233 of 257 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, that is not the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether they sued or not, 
Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   The time I left SAA they had not yet sued. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
do 
you 
know 
whether 
they 
…[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   That is why I am saying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether they …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   Or maybe let me say most probably. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether they sued whether 
10 
before you left SAA or after? 
MS KWINANA:   They did not sue when I was at SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know as you sit there? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether they sued or not? 
MS KWINANA:   No, I do not know, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And so you said you called her from 
Cape Town.  Is that a reference to when you were at 
parliament? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was on the 2 September 2015. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, the letter of award was signed on 
the 21 August 2015.  So Ms Fikelepe was just lying to you 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 234 of 257 
 
that an award had – a letter had gone out, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   It may have been signed, Chair, but not 
submitted to LSG. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is interesting because LSG Sky 
Chefs’ own particulars in the claim that they brought 
against SAA refers to that letter on the 21 August 2015.  
How do you know, Ms Kwinana, that it was not sent to 
them?  
MS KWINANA:   I am saying it may have been signed but 
not yet sent to them. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it is attached to their own particulars 
of claim. 
MS KWINANA:   What is attached to the particulars of 
claim?  I have …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The letter of the 21 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, Ms Hofmeyr, just to be sure that 
Ms Kwinana is on the same page. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Explain the particulars of claim to her. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So when LSG Sky Chefs sued 
20 
SAA – I accept after you left SAA, arising from the 
cancellation of this very award to it, they sue by preparing 
a document called the particulars of claim.  So they 
prepare it, right?  And one of the documents attached to 
their particulars of claim is the award letter itself dated the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 235 of 257 
 
21 August 2015.  So I cannot understand in the light of that 
your evidence that they had not received it. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, it may happen and I was saying 
most probably that letter may have been hand delivered by 
either Ms Mpshe or Dr Darwa to LSG Sky Chefs and 
assisted LSG Sky Chef to sue Air Chefs. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not know that as a fact, that is 
your speculation, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   It is most probable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not testifying about something 
10 
you have personal knowledge of, of how the letter may 
have reached them, is that correct?  You are just 
speculating, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   I am just speculating, Chair, and I am 
saying – and I have carefully selected the word most 
probable rather than saying possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa, do you…? 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes, Chair.  There is also an element of 
difficulty in the manner the question is posed because what 
Ms Hofmeyr is saying, she is saying that this letter 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you not – why can that not be dealt 
in re-examination, Ms Mbanjwa? 
MS MBANJWA:   No, Chair, it is to assist in the phrasing 
of the question because the fact that something is attached 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 236 of 257 
 
to the papers does not mean that [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but you can deal with that either in 
argument or in re-examination. 
MS MBANJWA:   But it in a confusion, Chair, this is what 
defeats me because [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, there is no confusion. 
MS MBANJWA:   Well, there is to me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no confusion.  Let us go ahead. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the problem I have with your 
10 
most recent answer, Ms Kwinana, is in the advice from the 
lawyers of SAA that you have confirmed in your evidence 
moment ago you did receive and read.  You are told that 
the letter was communicated to LSG Sky Chefs. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I called Ms Fikelepe and Ms 
Fikelepe said the award letter had not yet been sent. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, Ms Kwinana, a few days later on 
the 
7 
September 
– 
because 
remember, 
this 
alleged 
conversation took place on the 2 n d …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Ms Hofmeyr – I am sorry, Ms 
20 
Hofmeyr.  What of course would be true is if Ms Kwinana 
says I do not know as a fact whether the letter had been 
sent out or not but I was told by Ms Fikelepe that it had not 
been sent out and I acted on the belief that that was 
factually true.  Is that what you are saying? 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 237 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   Thank you, Chair, hundred percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   Thank you, Chair, hundred percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please, Ms Mbanjwa, hang on.  That is 
what you are saying? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you do not know whether it had 
gone out or not but Ms Fikelepe had said to you it had not 
gone out and you believed her. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But five days later in the submission to 
the board by the legal department of SAA you were told it 
had gone out.  Did you not – well, you told us you did read 
this document, so how could you hold onto what you were 
told on a conversation five days previously when the 
written document that is submitted to the board tells you it 
was communicated to LSG Sky Chefs? 
MS KWINANA:   2 September, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   2 September, Chair, Ms Fikelepe is telling 
me that the letter has not been sent and then five days 
later. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   On the 7 t h she tells you it has, it has 
gone out and the 7 September is before you make your 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 238 of 257 
 
decision.  Remember, we got into this debate, Ms Kwinana, 
because you said you were not worried about lawyers – 
you were not worried about LSG Sky Chefs suing South 
African Airways because you were satisfied that the award 
letter had not gone out.  Do you remember giving that 
evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, 2 September Ms Fikelepe is saying 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on, start by 
saying – confirming do you remember giving that evidence?  
10 
Start by saying yes I do remember or no, I do not 
remember. 
MS KWINANA:   I do remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, then let us take it from 
there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  So on …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   But now, Chair – but now Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KWINANA:   2 September Ms Fikelepe is saying the 
award letter has not gone out.  5 September the award 
20 
letter has gone out, so it may have gone out between the 2 
September and the 5 September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but Ms Hofmeyr ’s question to you is 
if you had – if you made your decision as the board on the 
basis of what Ms Fikelepe told you on the 2 September 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 239 of 257 
 
without having been given something in writing, which you 
were given on the 5 September, saying no, actually the 
letter did go out, maybe one could understand but her 
question is, now you have something even in writing after 
the 2 September confirming that the letter awarding the 
contract has gone out.  So how can you still cling to what 
you were told telephonically on the 2 n d when there was 
something – there is now something in writing, black and 
white, saying that letter had gone out.  That is the question 
she put to you. 
10 
MS KWINANA:   You know, Chair, if the information on the 
2 September is saying the letter has not gone out and then 
on the 7 September the letter has gone out, that means 
Thuli has fast-tracked that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, that means? 
MS KWINANA:   That means Ms Mpshe made sure that that 
letter is sent out to LSG Sky Chefs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are not answering my question, 
Ms Kwinana, which is Ms Hofmeyr ’s question.  She says to 
you when you take the decision that you took, as a board, 
20 
you had the benefit of this email or letter of the 5 
September which in black and white was telling you that 
the letter had been sent out, how do you explain your 
conduct in clinging to a telephonic advice that was given 
on the 2 September because one would have expected that 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 240 of 257 
 
now that you have been given something in writing you 
would attach more weight to that. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, this contract, as I was saying, as I 
have been putting it maybe for the past three hours 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, do not tell me what you have told me 
for the past three hours.  Do you have an explanation or do 
not have an explanation of why you would prefer to cling to 
a verbal advice that you were given on the 2 September 
when on the 5 September you are given something in 
10 
writing that says that letter did go out?  Do you have an 
explanation for that or do you not have? 
MS KWINANA:   I have an explanation, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the explanation? 
MS KWINANA:   The award in fact, as I said, starting from 
the fact that there was a tender competing against Air 
Chefs was irregular on its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so it is back to what you said 
earlier.  
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Just so that we do have it 
for record purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not think it is necessary to go there.  
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 241 of 257 
 
The paragraph in the legal submission that you indicated 
you did read at the time is at the DD19, the bundle we 
have been in, at page 132.5  Chair, it is one of those 
unfortunate situations where the numbering goes to the 
other side of the page because it is printed in landscape 
rather than portrait.  But you will see there at paragraph 
2.5 on page 132.5.  We are at page 132.5 in EXHIBIT 
DD19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, will you tell them to please do 
another one because you cannot see these numbers. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I know, it is terrible, Chair.  We will do 
so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, 132.5. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and if you just go there to 
paragraph 2.5, this is the legal department confirming that: 
“LSG 
emerged 
the 
preferred 
bidder 
and 
were 
recommended 
for 
appointment 
by 
the 
CFST, 
annexure 
C. 
 
On 
14 
August 
2015 
the 
BAC 
adjudicated on the CFST’s recommendation and 
supported 
it 
and 
further 
recommended 
LSG’s 
20 
appointment to the Acting CEO, annex D.  On 19 
August 2015 the CEO approved the appointment of 
LSG as per her DOA, annexure E.  Pursuant to the 
CEO’s approval a letter of award dated 21 August 
2015 was communicated to LSG, annex F.” 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 242 of 257 
 
I do not actually have that annexure attached here, it might 
have just been left off but we can certainly source it if 
necessary 
but 
the 
point 
of 
the 
matter 
is 
the 
legal 
department tells you, Ms Kwinana, as a member of the 
board, that the letter of award has gone out, they 
confirmed that on the 7 September.  They warn you that 
there are likely litigation risks if this award is cancelled, 
they indicate that the cancellation would likely be unlawful 
and nonetheless you decide to cancel it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they say in this paragraph 2.5 that 
10 
she has just read, that letter that went out to LSG was 
dated 21 August 2015 and on the 26 August 2015 there 
was what they refer to as a kick-off meeting where a 
project firm – a kick-off meeting was held with LSG where 
a project plan was developed and adopted by SAA and LSG 
to ensure a successful opening of the lounge on 29 
September 2015 which suggests that about a week before 
you went to parliament they are saying LSG had already 
been given the letter.  Not only that but a meeting had 
been held with them to say let us talk about a project plan 
20 
because the lounge must be opened on the 29 September 
2015.  That is what that paragraph says. 
MS KWINANA:   Chair, I am not aware of that.  What I 
knew was that the award letter had not yet been given and 
what I knew – they are talking about the [inaudible – 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 243 of 257 
 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were told rather than what you 
knew, is it not? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you were told. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, what I was told.  And they are talking 
about the delegation of authority and, as I said, Air Chefs 
is a major component – is an important component of SAA 
that was supposed to be approved …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but the delegation of authority is a 
10 
side issue for purposes of Ms Hofmeyr ’s question.   
MS KWINANA:   It is not a side …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is important for her question is 
whether LSG had received the notification that they had 
been awarded. 
MS KWINANA:   I was told, Chair, that the notification has 
not yet been …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But your evidence was you received this 
memorandum and you did read it, correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how did you miss this? 
MS KWINANA:   How did I miss what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The fact that you were now been told 
that it had been sent out. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 244 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   On 2 September …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no, how did you miss it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please – okay, let me assist.  Ms 
Kwinana… 
MS KWINANA:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand the position, you have 
confirmed that the memorandum, paragraph 2.5 of which 
we read a few minutes ago …[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, what page is that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   132.5. 
10 
MS MBANJWA:   Sorry, Chair, to interrupt, I do not know if 
I am at the correct place because on DD19, 132.4, is that 
what has been read out? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   132.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   132.5. 
MS MBANJWA:   Yes but that document is addressed to 
the Acting Chief Executive Officer and to the Chief 
Procurement – is that the document that is supposed to 
have been seen by Ms Kwinana? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, she has confirmed she saw it and 
20 
read it, Ms Mbanjwa, that is her evidence. 
MS MBANJWA:   No, I think she must be taken back to that 
document because it not addressed …[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   132.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Ms …[intervenes] 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 245 of 257 
 
MS KWINANA:   This document that starts with 2.3. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct.  This is the – I submit 
…[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   Where does this document start? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It starts at page 132.4. 
MS KWINANA:   So this document mos does not go to the 
board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but you confirmed that you received 
it because you said that you had read it a moment ago. 
MS KWINANA:   No, this document. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, the submission from the legal 
department. 
 
I 
have 
your 
evidence 
to 
be 
that 
you 
…[intervenes] 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
MS MBANJWA:   And, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa, just hold on, allow the 
evidence leader and the witness to deal with this and let us 
see.   
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not read this document.  I did not 
even get it. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are sure about that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
MS MBANJWA:   But, Chair, with your permission.  This is 
what I complain about.  Mrs Hofmeyr takes a document - 
Ms Hofmeyr, sorry, take a document – I have never seen 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 246 of 257 
 
evidence being led like this …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa …[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   A witness must be taken to identify the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa, not all the time.  Please 
…[intervenes] 
MS MBANJWA:   But this is what is causing confusion, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Allow – allow Ms Hofmeyr to do her job 
the way she believes it should be done.  The witness will 
10 
indicate where she may have I misunderstood her question 
and give a certain answer and if Ms Hofmeyr accepts that 
maybe there was a I misunderstanding she will say so. 
MS MBANJWA:   But please, Chair, let us be taken to the 
document.  It is standard in all litigation …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not – you are not going to dictate to 
her how to do her job, Ms Mbanjwa.  She is not going to 
dictate to you how to do your job when you re-examine.  
MS MBANJWA:   But, Chair, it is not her job, there is a 
witness I am representing.  She is not being taken to the 
20 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please keep quiet, Ms Mbanjwa. 
MS MBANJWA:   And this is what is causing confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please keep quiet, let us make progress. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what memorandum from the legal 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 247 of 257 
 
department did you read then? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe what you can do to assist me, 
Chair, is to take me to the minutes of the board meeting 
that talk about this. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I want to ask a question before.  Your 
evidence earlier was that you read the memorandum from 
the legal department.  If it is not this memorandum, what 
memorandum did you read? 
MS KWINANA:   Maybe I did not read the memorandum, 
the legal document but …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS KWINANA:   But let us say I did not read the 
memorandum from the legal document  - legal department 
because …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but that is a different piece of 
evidence.  Are you saying that you did or you did not?  
Your previous evidence was you did. 
MS KWINANA:   No, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not.  You are now sure about 
that? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You – when you previously said you did, 
you were wrong, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you wanted to go to that board 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 248 of 257 
 
resolution.  I am just going to have to find it, if I may.  How 
will that assist you, Ms Kwinana? 
MS KWINANA:   The reason is because this document is 
not addressed to the board and as I said previously 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think she says she – if it is suggested 
that this document was sent to the board there would be a 
resolution of the board which refers to this document. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the resolution she would like 
10 
to be referred to. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I can take you to the resolution at 
which the decision was made to cancel it.  There is no 
reference to all the documents that preceded it but I will 
take you to it.  It is at the same bundle, you have to go 
now I think back a bit in the paging.  You have to go to 
132.16.3.1. 
MS KWINANA:   DD19? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
20 
MS KWINANA:   1.16? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Point 16.3.1.5. 
MS KWINANA:   Can you please repeat?  DD132? 
CHAIRPERSON:   DD19. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   132.16.3.1.  Those are the minutes of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 249 of 257 
 
the meeting on the 28 September 2015. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair.  So which paragraph? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The resolution you will see at page 15.  
So it is 132.16.3.15.  Ja, you will see it at page 15 of 17. 
MS MBANJWA:   Ms Hofmeyr, I am at page 132.16.3.1. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, that is where it starts and then I 
was taking Ms Kwinana to where the resolution is recorded 
and that is at page 15.  So it is 132.16.3.15. 
MS KWINANA:   Point 15.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You attended this meeting, is that 
10 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And your evidence is you may not – are 
you clear you did not receive the legal department’s 
memo?  Is that your evidence? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And so you were relying on what 
Ms Fikelepe has said to you on the 2 September about the 
status of the letter of award, correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you had no reason to doubt what 
she told you on the 2 n d, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you took the decision to cancel the 
award because you were satisfied if a letter of award had 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 250 of 257 
 
not yet gone out you would not be as in as much risk as if 
it had, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Let us look at the 
discussion that took place at that meeting because – sorry 
and you saw the resolution, you saw that at page 15: 
“It was resolved that the SAA domestic lounge’s 
tender to be retracted and the catering contract to 
be awarded to Air Chefs without going through the 
bidding process.” 
10 
Do you see that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What happens before that in these 
minutes is the lengthy discussion that took place between 
the members of the board is recounted and let us go back 
a page to page 14 then, 132.16.3.14 and let us go to H at 
that page.  He says: 
“The GM LRC…” 
What is the GM LRC? 
MS KWINANA:   Legal and Risk. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Legal and Risk.  So who would that be? 
MS KWINANA:   Ms Fikelepe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Fikelepe, the same person who on 
the 2 September when you were at parliament told you that 
a letter of award had not gone out.  What she told the 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 251 of 257 
 
meeting on the 28 September, consistent with what is in 
the memorandum that you now say you did not see, is she 
reports the following: 
“At that stage only a letter of award had been 
issued and there was no contract in place.  She 
stated that the legal opinion…” 
That is the one we have just been looking at. 
“…provided that where a state owned entity went 
out on tender it was considered administrative 
action.  Therefore, should it want to cancel the 
10 
tender it should give the other party an opportunity 
to be heard and the reasons for the cancellation 
should 
be 
transparent, 
competitive 
and 
cost-
effective.” 
So, Ms Kwinana, I put it to you that it was quite clear at 
that meeting that the letter of award had gone out. 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What is your response to that? 
MS KWINANA:   This meeting was on the 28 September 
and we were in parliament on the 2 September.  So that 
20 
means by this 28 September this letter of award may have 
gone out but on the 2 September the letter may not have 
gone out.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but that is exactly why I was very 
careful before we went to this to get clear your thought 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 252 of 257 
 
process.   Your thought process was you were accepting 
cancelling the tender, despite the reservations of the legal 
team, because you were satisfied that the letter of award 
had not gone out, and I am putting to you Ms Kwinana that 
that cannot be so, because you were attending a meeting 
at which you were told before the decision was made that 
the letter of award had gone out, what is your response to 
that? 
MS KWINANA:   I still don’t understand Chair because I am 
saying on the 2 n d of September I am told that the letter of 
10 
award ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me try and clarify it to you.   You 
remember that you said that in effect, I am not quoting you, 
that Ms Fikelepe told you on the 2 n d of September that the 
letter of award had not gone out. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember that.  My understanding 
of what you were saying was that you were saying that 
gave you a certain level of comfort to say the decision can 
be reversed because at least the letter had not gone out – 
20 
did I – was my impression correct of what you said, of what 
– why you were making that point? 
MS KWINANA:   The decision may be reversed without 
much damage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, what you are saying is it was 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 253 of 257 
 
giving you a certain level of comfort. 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now Ms Hofmeyr is saying to you 
when you made the decision as a Board that that award 
should be retracted you knew, because in that meeting 
before the final decision or resolution was made Ms 
Fikelepe did say the letter of award had gone out, what she 
said had not happened was the conclusion of the contract, 
she is then saying, that is Ms Hofmeyr, it could not be true 
that when you make the decision on the date on which it 
10 
was made you were influenced by the fact that by what Ms 
Fikelepe had told you on the 2 n d of September, because 
that had changed and you knew that.  That is what she is 
saying, what do you say to that? 
MS KWINANA:   That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is true? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, so you weren’t then – well 
tell me were you worried then about the litigation risk 
20 
flowing from the fact that an award letter had gone out? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were, but you still decided to cancel 
it and despite the fact that the CFO at that meeting had 
recorded that he was very worried about the exposure of 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 254 of 257 
 
R85million that SAA could face if the contract – the award 
was cancelled, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Chair I was worried about the whole lot of 
things as I have articulated here.  So litigation was one of 
them, I was worried there were going to be risks if this is 
cancelled there were going to be risks if we did go ahead, 
so basically whichever decision that you would have made 
would have some element of risk.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the risk that we have looked at, that 
informed your decision, related to the retrenchment of 
10 
employees and the loss of the Air Chefs business, is that 
correct? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And Ms Mpshe addressed both of those 
points but you say you did not take what she said to be 
correct, is that right? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And you have subsequently 
learnt that LSG Sky Chefs did sue SAA in relation to this 
award, is that correct? 
20 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Chair I would then like to 
move on if we may ...[intervenes]  
MS KWINANA:   I just said by Ms Mpshe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Kwinana you keep making references 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 255 of 257 
 
to the fact that they were assisted by Mr Mpshe, do you 
have actual knowledge of that? 
MS KWINANA:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You don’t, but you feel free in this 
Commission to make claims about which you have no 
knowledge, is that correct? 
MS KWINANA:   A lot of things have been made about me 
Chair here, a lot of names have been made about me here 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS KWINANA:   It was a huge ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana when you say assisted by 
Ms Mpshe you realise that what you would be saying is that 
Ms Mpshe may have acted in a manner that might be seen 
as unacceptable, because she was the acting CEO of SAA, 
you are saying she was assisting somebody to sue SAA, 
you realise that? 
MS KWINANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now why would you say such a thing 
when you have no facts to base that on.  Why would you 
20 
say such a thing about somebody when you do not have 
facts.  Is that the type of person you are?    You can just 
say somebody assisted somebody, put them in a bad light 
when you don’t have facts in a public platform? 
MS KWINANA:   I am saying most probably Chair. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 256 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but have you got facts on which to 
base what you are saying, even if you say probably, have 
you got facts?   You see Ms Kwinana you are a Chartered 
Accountant, you are a professional, there are certain 
things that even if you suspect you cannot say about 
people, particularly in a public platform like this unless you 
have got facts.  It is not responsible to do that.  One would 
expect a professional like you to know that and to act in a 
responsible manner.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Chair I am moving 
10 
now to a new topic and we are very close to six, so it may 
be appropriate for us to adjourn now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that is fine, I think we must 
adjourn till tomorrow. 
MS HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should start a little earlier 
than normal tomorrow. 
MS HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Half past nine? 
MS HOFMEYR:   That will be ideal, thank you Chair, if it is 
20 
convenient for Ms Mbanjwa and Ms Kwinana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa will that be fine? 
MS MBANJWA:  Thank you Chair, yes it is convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be fine with you? 
MS KWINANA:   That will be fine Chair. 
02 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 296 
 
Page 257 of 257 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so we will adjourn now 
and then tomorrow we will start at half past nine.    
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 3 NOVEMBER 2020
