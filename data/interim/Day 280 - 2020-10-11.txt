PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 09 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us start. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Set down for this morning Chair is 
an application to authorise the issue of summons in respect 
of the former President Mr Zuma. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Long heads have been prepared 
and they have been delivered to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have prepared a note for oral 
argument which summarises the major points to be made 
and if I could take a few minutes to put those before you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Notice of this application was given 
by email to Mr Zuma’s attorneys on Friday 18 September 
20 
2020.  That appears at page 781 of the bundle that you 
have.  
 
The 
application 
its 
time 
and 
date 
was 
also 
announced publicly on the 21 September 2020 that appears 
at page 790 of the bundle. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 4 of 167 
 
 
In response to those notices Mr Zuma’s attorneys 
addressed a letter to the Chair giving notice of application 
for the Chair ’s recusal.  That is at page 791 of the bundle. 
 
Paragraph 12 of that letter at page 794 says the 
following: 
“Until this application for your recusal is 
finally determined President Zuma will take 
no further part in this commission and the 
Chairperson is entitled to take any such 
step as he deems lawful and appropriate.  
10 
We 
reiterate 
that 
President 
Zuma 
has 
questioned 
the 
lawfulness 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
this 
commission; 
he 
persists with this issue and reserves all his 
rights in this regard.” 
 
That is clear notice that this application will not be 
opposed at least through any attendance before you Chair. 
 
Chair this application was originally brought in 
January 2020.  It was postponed.  It has now been brought 
and the facts supporting the application have been updated 
20 
to the present time and there is an amended notice of 
application to cater for the new dates. 
 
All these papers have been served on Mr Zuma’s 
attorneys. 
 
At page 715 this may become controversial at a 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 5 of 167 
 
later stage Chair of the bundle before you the terms of the 
postponement of the application in January 2020 appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  715. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see there is a handwritten pagination as 
well as a red pagination with the right numbers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we looking at the red numbers 
today Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 715 I have got.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where you stated as follows from 
10 
line 10. 
“The commission’s legal team will deliver a 
replying affidavit on or before close of 
business Friday 24 January.  That is 1. 
With regard to what is going to happen in 
regard 
to 
this 
application 
that 
is 
the 
application for a summons in January 2020 
Chair and the further appearance before the 
commission of the former President what 
has been agreed in the discussion involving 
20 
myself and counsel on both sides is that 
this application is to be adjourned to a date 
to be arranged and I hasten to say arranged 
does not mean agreed.”   
 
So 
by 
your 
directive 
Chair 
you 
recorded 
an 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 6 of 167 
 
agreement between the legal representatives of both 
parties that the application for a summons would be 
adjourned to a date to be arranged and this is the date so 
arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I must just say also that that 
emphasis there where I say:  
“I hasten to say arranged does not mean 
agreed.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has a context. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the context is that I think on the 
same day if I am not mistaken but at some stage early this 
year when there was appearance for Mr Zuma his counsel 
argued that previously it had been said that dates – he 
would appear – that is Mr Zuma on dates to be arranged 
and they had construed that to mean it would be days that 
would be agreed with them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I made it clear on that occasion when 
20 
they were they appearing that that is not what was meant. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was meant was the dates would be 
arranged within the commission and that I – I decide dates. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 7 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have occasion to look at the transcript 
of that – of that date and counsel for Mr Zuma accepted 
and understood that explanation and had no problem with 
it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He just said that previously they had 
understood 
it 
differently. 
 
So 
the 
question 
of 
this 
commission not agreeing dates with the lawyers and 
witnesses was dealt with at that time.  And it was accepted 
that the commission will fix dates and obviously if Mr Zuma 
10 
has a problem with the particular dates that have been 
fixed he could bring an application and show that he has 
got good reasons not to be available and then if I am 
satisfied obviously I would change the dates.  So that is 
the context. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair and that – that position is 
confirmed in the Rules of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where the rules and the consistent 
practice I might add is that you as Chair determine the 
20 
dates, the order of appearance and in fact who will or will 
not give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So Chair the rules, the record as 
well as the consistent practice are all confirmed by the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 8 of 167 
 
arrangement now that you determine the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the power of the commission 
lest there be any doubt certainly in the public mind to issue 
summons is set out in Section 31 of the Commission’s Act 
which states very clearly that you as the commission have 
the power of a court of law to compel attendance by way of 
summons.  
 
So that is a statutory power that you have and it is 
a power equivalent to that of the High Court.  That section 
10 
is quoted in the long heads before you Chair at Footnote 2. 
 
Chair insofar as there may be any dispute as to 
whether this application for the authorisation for the issue 
of summons can and should be granted it can be resolved 
by reference to legal principle and by reference to what are 
incontrovertible facts. 
 
There are in our submission grounds to issue the 
summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think it is important for you 
to read that section that gives me that power. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the benefit of everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Section 3 of the Commission’s Act 
deals with the commission’s powers as to witnesses.  
Section 3.1 reads: 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 9 of 167 
 
“For the purpose of ascertaining any matter 
relating to the subject of its investigations” 
That is quite a wide remit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“A commission shall in the union now the 
republic have the powers which a Provincial 
Division of the Supreme Court of South 
Africa has within its Province to summons – 
to summon witnesses. To cause an oath or 
10 
affirmation to be administered to them.  To 
examine them and to call for the production 
of books, documents and objects.” 
Section 3.2 reads: 
“A summons for the attendance of a witness 
or the production of any book, document or 
object before a commission shall be signed 
and 
issued 
by 
the 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Commission in a form prescribed by the 
Chairman of the Commission and shall be 
20 
served in the same manner as a summons 
for the attendance of a witness at a criminal 
trial in a Superior Court at the place where 
the attendance or production is to take 
place.” 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 10 of 167 
 
Two points Chair the – that arise out of that for 
present purposes at least is that the issue of a summons 
may in terms of that section be affected for the purpose of 
ascertaining any matter relating to the subject of its 
investigations. 
And that is a matter within your discretion in terms 
of the Act and our submission will be at the end of our 
short address Chair that the issue of summons in this 
matter is a reasonable exercise of that discretion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On – on the wording of that section it 
10 
seems quite clear that as long as a summons – as long as 
there is a summons is issued for the purposes – for the 
purpose of ascertaining a matter relating to the subject of 
the commission’s investigations.  That is enough. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is the qualifying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the only requirement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Requirement yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For example it does not have to be shown 
that the person who is being summoned does not cooperate 
or cooperates.  It is enough if… 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a matter that the commission 
seeks 
to 
ascertain 
that 
relates 
to 
a 
subject 
of 
its 
investigation.  Obviously if a person is not cooperating 
there is even stronger ground. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 11 of 167 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For that.  But it seems that even without 
knowing whether somebody will cooperate or will not 
cooperate if the commission is satisfied that that person 
has information that relates to a matter that is the subject 
of its investigations the commission may summon that 
person. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If there is any issue to be raised. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Or if on a particular date which the 
summons authorises for the appearance a person who is 
subject to such a summons has every right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To deal with those matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Either before you or in a court of 
law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So there is no question of any legal 
infringement of anybody’s rights here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Quite simply Chair you exercise 
your discretion on the qualifying requirements. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 12 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that then authorises the lawful 
issue of a summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS 
SC:  Chair I might add 
that the 
procedural device under Section 3 of the Act is not an 
uncommon recourse for commissions and especially this 
commission.  So this commission has issued over 2500 
summonses and those are summonses 
which include 
summonses 
to 
appear 
and 
summonses 
to 
produce 
10 
documents.  99 summonses have been issued for witnesses 
to appear. 
 
So 
Chair 
it 
is 
not 
an 
uncommon 
procedural 
mechanism. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And in fact it is a necessary 
mechanism for this commission to do its work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Of course if one says, is there 
a matter that this commission seeks to ascertain from Mr 
Zuma that relates to the subject of its investigation we 
20 
have got to deal with that as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Because 
– 
to 
show 
whether 
this 
requirement of the statute is complied with – is present.  
And one way of doing so I guess would be to go to the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 13 of 167 
 
Terms of Reference. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The – we can read the Terms of 
Reference if you wish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have them here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think we should – we should do 
that – you should do that at least those that may appear 
relevant. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  There are two points there 
Chair.  The first is that insofar as Mr Zuma’s evidence is 
subject to the investigation of the commission one could 
have reference to the Terms of Reference themselves but 
also 
to 
the 
witnesses 
who 
have 
come 
before 
the 
commission.  34 witnesses have implicated Mr Zuma. 
 
Now over and above the requirement of the Section 
3.1 and the requirements of the Terms of Reference which 
delineates the mandate on your Chair for your investigation 
there is a duty at common law and it is being emphasised 
20 
in 
a 
number 
of 
recent 
judgments 
that 
obliges 
the 
commission to call Mr Zuma to answer those allegations. 
 
If I may just read one passage of a judgment in the 
matter of Msiza versus Advocate Motau and the Prudential 
Authority of the South African Reserve Bank.  Paragraph 55 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 14 of 167 
 
of that judgment reads: 
“In 
my 
view 
where 
an 
investigator 
of 
forturea a commission knows or is expected 
to foresee that his findings, remarks and 
conclusions will have consequences for the 
party on whose behalf an investigation is 
conducted and for the party against whom 
findings will be made he is obliged to listen 
to both sides and the party who is likely to 
be affected by adverse findings is entitled 
10 
to demand the right to be heard before an 
adverse remark or finding conclusion or 
decision is made against him or her.” 
 
So quite apart from the mandate contained in your 
Terms of Reference Chair and quite apart from the 
Provisions of Section 3 of the Commission’s Act the 
qualifying provisions there is a duty in law to hear the 
other side.  
 
It is not a choice Chair that you have.  You have a 
duty to do so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well of course the passage that you read 
relates to the observance of the Audi Alteram Partum Rule. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one should not take that part too far 
because the Audi Alteram Partum Rule is there for the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 15 of 167 
 
benefit to – for the benefit of the person who may be 
adversely affected by my decision.  He has a right to wave 
that right to say well I do not want to be heard.  That he 
has a right to do and I cannot force him for purposes of 
observing that right but where I can force him as I 
understand the law is where I believe that he has 
information 
that 
may 
assist 
the 
commission 
in 
its 
investigation but then in that case I am forcing him not for 
purposes of hearing his side of the story I am forcing him 
in order to do my work to investigate the issues that I am 
10 
supposed to investigate.  
 
So as I understand the position  
1. I need to observe the Audi Alteram Partum Rule until 
such time that I am satisfied that he is not interested 
in being afforded that opportunity.  But the fact that 
he is not interested in being afforded that opportunity 
does not preclude me from saying come I want to 
know certain issues that you are appear to have 
knowledge about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is in regard to that certain part it 
seems to me where he cannot say leave me alone I am not 
interested in being heard by you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair the – that in our view is 
accurate subject to one qualification which I will come to in 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 16 of 167 
 
a moment.   
 
Of course there is distinction between the duty on 
the commission to give every opportunity to an implicated 
person who states his or her side of the case.  And the 
implicated person then has an election whether to exercise 
that right to speak or not to speak. 
 
The duty of the Chair to investigate arising out of 
the Terms of Reference and that is a duty in respect of 
which the Chair has no discretion.  You must investigate 
and we will come to the grounds upon which we submit 
10 
Chair and you have said that there is a duty on this 
commission to explore those to investigate those issues 
where the former President has evidence or can give 
evidence to inform your findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean there can be no doubt that if on 
information available to me or evidence submitted to the 
commission by other witnesses there can be no doubt that 
if I form a view that a particular person may have 
knowledge or does have knowledge of matters that are 
relevant to what I am investigating I must take steps to get 
20 
that person to come and testify. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I do not do that I would be failing in my 
duty. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair in correspondence and 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 17 of 167 
 
this is the qualification I have to the propositions that have 
been put now.   
 
The former President has asserted that he is 
exercising a right not to participate in the matters of the 
commission and by exercising that right he is in fact 
participating. 
 
There is no right not to respond to a 3.3 Notice 
implicating a witness.  That witness has an election. He 
may say or she may say, I am not going to respond or I am 
going to respond.  But there is no right not to deal at all 
10 
with the matters which are the subject of the commission’s 
Terms of Reference if the commission determines that a 
person must come. 
 
So insofar as there is alleged by Mr Zuma’s legal 
representatives to be a right not to respond that is 
incorrect.  It is not a right not to come to the commission. 
There is no such right. 
 
There is an election not to answer a Rule 3.3 Notice 
to put a version or to cross-examine a witness.  But there 
is no right to say I am not coming to the commission at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems to me that the position is if Mr 
Zuma or anybody who is said to be implicated by a witness, 
a certain witness is served by the commission with a Rule 
3.3. Notice to say here is a statement from a witness who 
seems to implicate you in wrongdoing that the commission 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 18 of 167 
 
is investigating.  I mean that notice in terms of the Rules of 
the Commission advises the recipient of a Rule 3.3 Notice 
that you have a right to apply to the commission for Leave 
to Cross-examine this witness.  You have a right to apply to 
the commission for Leave to give evidence yourself and 
contradict whatever the witness is saying.  You have a right 
to apply to the commission for Leave to call witnesses who 
can corroborate what you say – your story.   
 
It explains all of those things.  But you are not 
forced to make those applications. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are free to say I am not going to 
make that application – those applications.  Those people 
can implicate me as much as they want, that is fine.  But 
once the commission says we are aware that you do not 
think you are implicated; we are aware that you have 
chosen not to apply for Leave to Cross-examine these 
witnesses but nevertheless we want you to come and 
answer questions provided the commission has grounds to 
believe that you may have knowledge of matters that are – 
20 
that it is investigating you cannot refuse lawfully. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously if there is a specific reason 
why you cannot appear on a specific date that is different 
then you put your case before the commission to say, on 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 19 of 167 
 
that date – on that date I have to see a doctor. I am not 
well bla, bla, bla.  If the commission is satisfied that it is a 
genuine reason it will give another date.   
 
But 
of 
course 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
recent 
correspondence from Mr Zuma’s attorneys one of the 
reasons that have been given recently why Mr Zuma was 
not prepared to come to the commission on the 21 to 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  25 September is this one.  It appears in 
he – the letter of his attorneys dated Tuesday September 1 
10 
2020 paragraph 5. 
“Further we wish to point out that President 
Zuma is preparing for his much anticipated 
criminal 
trial 
the 
importance 
of 
which 
cannot be over emphasised.  It is rather 
unfair 
to 
expect 
President 
Zuma 
to 
simultaneously 
consider 
evidence 
and 
affidavits of more than 30 witnesses in 
order to make himself ready to appear 
before 
the 
commission 
on 
21 
to 
25 
20 
September 2020.” 
And then later on in – in the same letter at 
paragraph 2 they say: 
“In the circumstances we are instructed to 
inform the commission as we hereby do that 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 20 of 167 
 
for 
all 
the 
reasons 
mentioned 
above 
President Zuma will not be able to attend 
the proceedings schedules on the dates of 
21 to 25 September 2020.” 
 
In other words one of the reasons that they advance 
as to why Mr Zuma would not be attending – able to attend 
the hearing on 21 to 25 September 2020 is that he was 
busy preparing for his criminal trial.  Is that a good enough 
reason not to appear before the commission? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well in our submission no because 
10 
the – the point about that – that paragraph in that letter is 
that is a situation that will prevail for the life of the 
commission.   
And the commission must conclude its evidence by 
September and one of the reasons procedural reasons for 
the issue of summons is to enable the commission to 
consider 
the 
former 
President’s 
evidence 
before 
the 
commission ends which is in December.  Certainly the 
evidence must end by December to enable you Chair to 
write your report by March next year.   
20 
So in the circumstances – particular circumstances 
of this case our submission is that it is not a good enough 
reason to – to refuse to appear.  But if the former President 
does believe it is you Chair will exercise your discretion in 
terms of your mandate and you will exercise your discretion 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 21 of 167 
 
in terms of the directives that govern your chairing of the 
commission.  If he believes there are grounds not to 
appear on a particular date he is free to – to raise those 
with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well on the information… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But not in those general terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Provided – on the information provided 
this is not a case where he was saying the dates that you 
have given me on which to appear before the commission 
fall – are the same dates when I must – I am supposed to 
10 
appear in the High Court for my criminal trial.  That would 
be different.  That would be different.   
But that is not what the letter was saying.  It was simply 
saying he is busy preparing for his criminal trial.  It does 
not say when the criminal trial is going to happen.  But in 
the end even if the criminal trial was going to happen soon 
he would have to appear before the Commission and then 
apply for more time with the criminal trial and say:  I have 
been busy with the Commission. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am now asking for you to give me more 
time in order to prepare for the trial 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to say:  I am not going to appear 
before the Commission because I am preparing for a criminal 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 22 of 167 
 
trial that is going to come at some stage on some dates that 
maybe have not even been determined. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  Quite frankly, Chair.  
The Commission has a job to do.  It is obliged to do it.  The 
fact that there are other mattes that the former president 
must attend to may or may not be relevant, but it is certainly 
no basis for a blanket refusal to come on those grounds at 
all and frankly on any date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And you see, as I see it, that 
particular statement in the letter means that that is a belief 
10 
that he holds that because he is preparing for this criminal 
trial, he does not have to come to the Commission.   
 
And if that is so, if he has that believe, how can he come 
before 
the 
Commission 
at 
any 
stage 
before 
his 
trial 
happens?   
 
Because the closer the... as he approaches the trial 
dates of the criminal matter, the more time he would want to 
spend preparing for that criminal trial. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question is.  Can that person ever 
20 
come before the Commission voluntarily before his criminal 
trial happens? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not on what is contained in that 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 23 of 167 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So whilst the requirement to appear 
in another forum may be a reason to ask for particular dates 
to be changed, certainly not as it appears there, grounds for 
a blanket refusal to come before the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, the issues that we have 
covered in our written submissions, therefore covered two 
principle contentions.   
 
The first is to say that Mr Zuma’s evidence is both 
necessary and desirable for the work of the Commission.  
10 
That we will establish and have dealt with in detail in the 
written submissions. 
 
The second is why it is necessary that summons be 
issued to secure Mr Zuma’s appearance at the Commission 
to give evidence. 
 
Now Chair, that is an added reason but it is not a 
necessary reason.  In regard to the first issue, if I may refer 
to paragraph 12.1 of the written submissions. 
 
In summary Chair, Mr Zuma’s evidence is a necessary 
part of the Commission’s work for at least the following 
20 
reasons.   
 
Firstly, much if not most of the corruptions, an act which 
might constitute State Capture occurred during his term of 
office as President of the Republic. 
 
Secondly, the Commission’s Terms of Reference refers 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 24 of 167 
 
to Mr Zuma directly in a number of paragraphs.  If I may just 
ask you, Chair, to look at page 808 of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am going to... I was going to go 
straight to the Terms of the Reference. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, they are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, you could read the relevant 
parts that refer to him.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will do that.  The Terms of 
Reference are... they are included in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 1.2 reads: 
“Whether the president... 
 
And that is a reference to the former president. 
“...had any role in the alleged office of cabinet 
positions to Mr Mcebisi Jonas and Ms Mentor by the 
Gupta family as alleged.” 
 
Terms of Reference 1.3: 
“Whether the appointment of any member of the 
National Executive Functionary and/or office bearer 
was disclosed to the Gupta family or any other 
20 
authorised person before such appointments were 
formally made and/or announced and if so, whether 
the President or any member of the National 
Executive is responsible for such conduct.” 
 
Terms of Reference 1.4: 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 25 of 167 
 
“Whether the President or any member of the 
present 
or 
previous 
members 
of 
this 
National 
Executive 
including 
deputy 
ministers 
or 
public 
official 
or 
employer, 
any 
state 
owned 
entities 
breached or violated the Constitution or any relevant 
ethical code or legislation by facilitating the unlawful 
awarding of tenders by SOE’s of any organ of state 
to benefit the Gupta family or any other family, 
individual or corporate entity doing business with 
government of any organ of state.” 
10 
 
Terms of Reference 1.5.  Sorry, 1.9. 
“The nature and the extent, if any, in the awarding of 
corruption, if any, in the awarding of contracts and 
tenders 
to 
companies, 
business 
entities 
or 
organisations by government department, agencies 
and entities. 
In particular, whether any member of the National 
Executive (including the President), public official, 
functionary of any organ of state or influenced the 
awarding of tenders to benefit themselves, their 
20 
families or entities in which they held a personal 
interest.” 
 
Those are direct references to the former President, 
Chair.  Terms of Reference 1.1 and 1.7 contain indirect 
references to the former President.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 26 of 167 
 
 
Terms of Reference 1.7 reads: 
“Whether any member of the National Executive... 
 
Which will include the president. 
“...and including deputy ministers, unlawfully or 
corruptly or improperly intervened in the matter of 
the closing of banking facilities for Gupta owned 
companies.” 
 
And then 1.1: 
“whether and to what extent and by whom attempts 
were made through any form of inducement or for 
10 
any gain of whatsoever nature to influence members 
of the National Executive... 
 
Which would include the former President. 
“...including deputy ministers, office bearers and/or 
functionaries employed by office bearers of any 
state institution or organ of state or directors of 
boards of SOE’s. 
In particular, the Commission must investigate the 
veracity 
of 
allegations 
that 
the 
former 
Deputy 
Minister of Finance, Mr Mcebisi Jonas and Ms 
20 
Mentor were offered cabinet positions by the Gupta 
family.” 
 
Now the offer of cabinet positions is a matter which 
caused directly with the... but all those Terms of Reference, 
obviously, obliged you Chair to investigate matters, related 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 27 of 167 
 
to the conduct directly or the former President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think if you go back to... or maybe I can 
just have a look.  One point one, among others, that is of the 
Terms of Reference: 
“Among 
others, 
requires 
this 
Commission 
to 
investigate the veracity of allegations that former 
Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr Mcebisi Jonas and 
Ms Mentor were offered positions by the Gupta 
family.” 
 
Now, one of the matters on which Mr Zuma may assist 
10 
the Commission is this.  Mr Jonas gave evidence that on the 
23rd of October 2015, he met with one of the Gupta brothers 
and Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane at the Gupta 
residence. 
 
And he said the Gupta brother who appears to have been 
Tony Gupta, told him that Mr Nhlanhla Nene was going to be 
fired as Minister of Finance because he was not working with 
them and they wanted Mr Jonas to agree to the Minister of 
Finance and then if he would work with them.   
 
Six weeks after that, Mr Nhlanhla Nene was fired.  And 
20 
the media statement that was issued by Mr Zuma said that 
Mr Nhlanhla Nene had done a stunning job as the Minister of 
Finance. 
 
And it was said that Mr Nhlanhla Nene was dropped from 
cabinet because he was to be the government’s candidate for 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 28 of 167 
 
a position in the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Brics Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Brics Bank, I think.  But the job never 
happened.  And I have heard evidence from somebody from 
the bank who said that is not how the bank... that bank 
operates.  It has got policies and procedures and Mr Zuma 
had no say, had no power to force the bank to take Mr Jonas.   
 
Mr Jonas himself said the... his position as Minister of 
Finance was higher than the position that Mr Zuma was 
talking about in the bank. 
10 
 
And Mr Nene said, actually, the... Mr Zuma’s reason for 
dropping him, that he was to go to that job, was a 
fabrication.  That is what Mr Nene said before me under oath 
here. 
 
So the question is.  How come somebody from the Gupta 
family knew in advanced that Mr Nene was going to be fired?  
Then Mr Nene gets fired.  The President says:  This man has 
done a stunning job.  But he fires him, nevertheless. 
 
The man goes and stays at home.  The job that has... 
that the President talked about, does not materialise.  And 
20 
Mr Nene said:  He never even phoned me after I had left and 
sitting at home and to check whether anybody had contacted 
me about this job. 
 
And then, when Mr Jonas gave evidence, he said the 
Gupta brother who was in that meeting, among others things, 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 29 of 167 
 
said to him:  If you need advisors or you need support staff 
when you become Minister of Finance, we will provide. 
 
And the replacement of Mr Nene, Mr Van Rooyen - I 
have heard that evidence – comes to National Treasury on 
the first day of his appointment, comes with certain advisors 
and those advisors seem to have connections with the Gupta 
family. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Jonas says, at that meeting, the 
Gupta brother also told him that there are people that they 
10 
work with and he says one of them is Mr Brian Molefe, 
another one is Ms Lynne Brown, Minister of Public Enterprise 
at that time. 
 
And 
when 
Mr 
Gordhan 
gave 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission he said he heard that when he was fired in 2017 
by Mr Zuma, Mr Zuma told the Top Six of the ANC that he 
wanted to replace him with Mr Brian Molefe.  
 
And the Commission subsequently asked some members 
of the Top Six, Mr Gwede Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize and Ms 
Duarte, Jessie Duarte to depose to affidavits to say:  Do you 
20 
know anything about this?   
 
And the Commission has got affidavits from them.  They 
did not give any problems.  They supplied affidavits.   
 
And those affidavits do say, indeed Mr Zuma did suggest 
to the Top Six that he wanted to replace Mr Gordhan with Mr 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 30 of 167 
 
Brian Molefe.  The same Mr Brian Molefe that Mr Jonas says 
he was told by the Gupta brother worked... was working with 
the Gupta’s.   
 
And then of course, we all know, it is in the public 
domain that Mr Brian Molefe resigned from Eskom after the 
Public Protector’s report.   
 
I think he said he wanted to clear his name of whatever 
but later went to parliament.  I think he went to parliament 
about a month or two before Mr Gordhan was fired.  And then 
Mr Gordhan was fired.  Mister...  
10 
 
I think the three members of the ANC Top Six who have 
provided affidavits, said that the Top Six rejected Mr Zuma’s 
suggestion to replace Mr Gordhan with Mr Molefe.   
 
And then what we do know is that Mr Gordhan was then 
succeeded by Mr Gigaba.   
 
And what we do know, it is in the public domain, is that it 
did not take long after that before Brian Molefe resigned from 
parliament. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 And 
Mr 
Zuma 
must 
enlighten 
the 
20 
Commission on all of these matters. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, there are, apart 
from those Terms of Reference, there are other Terms of 
Reference where Mr Zuma’s evidence would be necessary for 
the Commission to complete its investigations adequately.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 31 of 167 
 
 
The 1.6 which talks about government advertising in the 
New Age Newspaper and other undue benefits to the Gupta 
family.   
 
There has been evidence directly implicating the former 
President.  Mr Sundaram’s evidence, for example, where you 
have asked for information from the former President which 
has not been forthcoming.   
 
So there are a number of... there is the evidence, for 
example, of the exchange and the study of the former 
President at his residence in Pretoria, Chair.  Where the 
10 
Gupta’s 
demanded 
“favours” 
from 
the 
then 
Minister 
Shabangu in relation to mining licenses.   
 
All those issues are issues that need to be addressed.  
And the evidence to date is replete with such examples 
where it is necessary for you Chair to investigate these 
matters as a matter of your Terms of Reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I mean, I am hearing evidence these 
days relating to Eskom.  And hearing evidence from Mr Tsotsi 
and from Mr Nick Linnell.  It is to the effect that, Ms Dudu 
Myeni called Mr Linnell to Pretoria and said you... I need you 
20 
to come and meet with the president.  He came.   
 
The president did not meet them then but then he was 
told:  Go to Durban.  They have been meeting at the 
President’s official residence on Sunday the 8t h of March.  
He went there.  Mr Tsotsi was called there.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 32 of 167 
 
 
And a discussion took place which was to the effect that 
there should be an inquiry into the affairs of Eskom and 
certain executives must be suspended.   
 
Ms Lynne Brown, I have read her affidavit that she has 
given to the Commission.  If I understood her evidence in the 
affidavit correctly.  She says she knew nothing about that 
meeting in Durban and yet, she was Minister of Public 
Enterprises.   
 
And both Mr Linnell and Mr Tsotsi say that President 
Zuma took part in that meeting.  I have seen the statement 
10 
by Ms Dudu Myeni who denies that Mr Zuma took part in that 
meeting. 
 
I have heard evidence that in regard to Eskom and a 
board 
meeting 
that 
was 
supposed 
to 
happen 
on 
the 
26t h of February, was cancelled because Mr Zuma called the 
chairperson of the board the night before and called the 
acting DG of the Department of Public Enterprises and said 
that meeting must be cancelled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the acting DG at the time says, when 
20 
the President called her because he said he could not find 
the minister or deputy minister.   
 
When she said:  But we cannot interfere.  Or something 
to that effect.  He says, Mr Zuma said:  Well, that meeting 
must be cancelled and dropped the phone.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 33 of 167 
 
 
Now with regard to Eskom.  The evidence that is 
unfolding and there are more witnesses who will come and 
maybe the picture will change when everybody has given 
evidence.   
 
But at this stage, the evidence that seems to emerge 
suggest that there may well be credence to the proposition 
that certain decisions that were made by the Eskom Board 
were dictated to the Exco Board from outside Eskom.   
 
And certain executives were removed.  And then Mr 
Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh from Transnet were then 
10 
seconded to Eskom to take some of the positions of the 
executives who were suspended and then allowed to leave or 
kicked out.   
 
And I have heard certain evidence about allegations 
relating to Mr Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh of Transnet, who 
were leading evidence of some of the people who the board 
had asked to Mr Brian Molefe and to Mr Anoj Singh when 
they were at Transnet, about money that they say they have 
got from the Gupta’s in the night and so on.   
 
Of course, they will come and give their evidence and 
20 
maybe one will get a different picture and maybe one would 
come to the conclusion that nothing like that ever happened.  
But these, all of these things cannot be ignored. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot ignore these things when I asked 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 34 of 167 
 
the question:  Should I call Mr Zuma to appear?  I cannot 
ignore those if I am going to do my job properly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   H’m, h’m.  And you have been 
cautious to say that no findings have been made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you have evidence before you 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...which requires investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And as night follows day, evidence 
implicating the former President must be examined, including 
through the evidence of the former President himself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There are other examples.  Chair, 
the record is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is replete. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...replete of such evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Direct interference in the activities of 
20 
law enforcement agencies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Appointments and dismissals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The meeting with Gavin Watson 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 35 of 167 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...in relation to the BOSASA 
prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those sorts of issues ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...need to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, there was evidence by some of 
the people who were senior officials within the Intelligence 
10 
community 
that 
their 
departments 
had... 
or 
units 
had 
conducted certain investigations of criminal nature.   
 
And the minister serving under Mr Zuma or State 
Security, Dr Cwele called one of them to a meeting at the 
airport where he told them, according to the evidence placed 
before 
me 
that 
President 
Zuma 
had 
said 
that 
the 
investigation should be stopped.  I need to look to all of 
those things. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How can I ignore those things? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How can I ignore all of those things?  And 
all I am doing, I am doing my job to establish exactly what 
happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 36 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that I can prepare reports that is based 
on evidence that has been presented by cross-section of 
people.  And if he is implicated, I am giving him an 
opportunity to come here and clear his name.   
 
But I want to know what he has to say about those 
things.  He might he does not want to clear his name.  That 
is fine.   
 
But I want to know what he knows about the things that 
have been said.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Chair, in summary then.  In 
10 
evidence before you and to date, and I stress to date, 
because there is more to come.   
 
Mr Zuma has been or may be implicated by the evidence 
of at least 34 witnesses.  That perhaps is enough to qualify, 
certainly under Section 3(1) of the act.   
 
Chair, in relation to the second issue that is why there is 
an added reason that it is necessary and desirable for a 
summons to be issued.  
 
The Commission, quite apart from its mandate, the law, 
but as a practical consideration, requires certainty in regard 
20 
to the fact of Mr Zuma’s appearance and the dates of his 
appearance. 
 
We are simply so close to the end of the Commission’s 
hearings that the proper and efficient functioning of the 
Commission would be rendered impossible unless we have 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 37 of 167 
 
that certainty and you are entitled to take that into account in 
the exercise of your discretion. 
 
The history of Mr Zuma’s cooperation or lack thereof 
with the Commission, is set out in the written submissions.  
Paragraphs 18 and 19, Chair, you during 2018, requested Mr 
Zuma 
through 
his 
legal 
representatives 
to 
provide 
a 
response to the evidence of Ms Mentor and Mr Maseko.  That 
has not been forthcoming. 
 
You 
will 
recall 
the 
well-known 
areas 
of 
interest 
undertaken.  There have been and this... the paragraphs of 
10 
the heads and perhaps, I should just mention one or two. 
 
The most recent undertaken.  Just to put that in its 
context.  At the last appearance of the former President 
where he seized to answer questions, to put it at its lightest. 
 
An arrangement was made and an agreement was 
reached that the legal team would provide a document 
containing areas of interest. 
 
There was an agreement and repeated promises that 
that areas of interest document would be responded to.  It 
has not been responded to.   
20 
 
In his opposing affidavit dated the 13t h of January 2020, 
that is the opposing affidavit to this application, Mr Zuma 
stated: 
“I will be sending the Commission my responses to 
the areas of interest sent to me.  This was already 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 38 of 167 
 
prepared but could not be completed when I fell ill.” 
 
Now we are ten months later Chair.  That document still 
has not been forthcoming. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in terms of the agreement that was 
reached on the 19t h of July, when he was before the 
Commission, you were... the legal team of the Commission 
were required to furnish his lawyers within, I think, two 
weeks with a document that would indicate the areas of 
interest in the various affidavits that he had to focus on and 
responding.  
10 
 
And the agreement was that, as far as I can recall, once 
you had furnished his lawyers with such a document, which 
you did around, I think, on the 30t h of July. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was slightly later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was in the first week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or first week, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of the following month. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Once you had done that... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am told it was the 30 t h, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think it was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But there were some administrative 
hiccup. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think a lot of ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In any event, it was delivered. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 39 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Once you had done that, you and Mr 
Zuma’s counsel were supposed to agree a date by when they 
would file his affidavit or affidavits.   
 
And if the two of you did not agree, the arrangement was 
that you would then bring that issue to me and I will decide 
the timeframe.   
 
Now from what I read, one, they did not file affidavits.  
Two, they did not... they do not seem to have reached any 
agreement with you.   
 
And they promised at some stage, I think from what I 
10 
read in the correspondence exchanged between yourself and 
them, that Mr Zuma’s affidavit or affidavits would be filed on 
the 13t h of September, last year.  That did not happen.   
 
Subsequently, they kept on promising that they would be 
filed.  They have never been filed.   
 
And no condonation application has been filed and no 
explanation, as far as I recall, has been proffered to say 
what is the difficulty to the extent that he may be saying in 
his affidavit, at a certain stage he fell ill and that impacted 
the preparation.   
20 
 
It seems that that was long after the deadline had 
happened.  And there was simply nothing coming from them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Chair there were repeated 
undertakings.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 40 of 167 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On 12t h September 2019, Mr Zuma’s 
attorneys confirmed that he would provide his answers to the 
areas of interest document previously provided to him.  And 
then Chair, on the 30t h of September, Mr Zuma’s attorneys 
requested a “indulgence” to provide the Commission with 
the answers to the areas of interest by 20 October 2019 
and simply after that nothing has been forthcoming.   
 
Even in January this year, in opposition to the 
application it said the document is ready, I just cannot 
finalise it.  Ten months later we still do not have the 
10 
document here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the import, let alone the 
implications of that are clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, Mr Zuma’s might not be here 
today 
but 
they 
had 
filed 
his 
affidavit 
opposing 
this 
application.  One of the issues that arises is this, when I 
invited Mr Zuma last year to appear before the Commission 
from the 15 to the 19 July, they criticised me for inviting 
him saying that that is not provided any rule saying in 
20 
terms of what rule are you inviting our client, you know?  
And when it was – you know, it was just a courtesy, you 
know, to say let us not issue a summons because he has 
promised to cooperate with the Commission, they seemed 
to have an objection to say why are you not acting in terms 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 41 of 167 
 
of the rules …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of which led to summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the legal time has now applied that 
I should authorise a summons, then they oppose that and 
say you make it as if he is not cooperating.  So when you 
act and show courtesy and say come and appear before the 
Commission without issuing a summons, you are criticised.  
When you say okay, let us issue a summons, then you are 
criticised. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then you not being polite. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, there are many people who have 
been requested by the Commission to appear before the 
Commission and they have never had any hesitation.  We 
have told, you know, Mr Zuma’s attorneys before – I was 
looking at the correspondence here, that I told the 
President, current President that before the Commission 
finishes its work it would be important that he comes and 
gives evidence before the Commission because the matters 
that 
the 
Commissioner 
is 
looking 
at, 
state 
capture, 
happened at a time when he was Mr Zuma’s deputy.  The 
20 
current President had no hesitation, he said you are right, I 
am going to come.  You tell me when I must come and I will 
come and I said the ANC must also come and I was told the 
ANC has no hesitation to come.  
 
The Commission has approached other leaders of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 42 of 167 
 
the ANC, Mr Mantashe, and asked them to file affidavits 
without compelling them and they responded by filing 
affidavits.  Mr Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize, Ms Jessie 
Duarte, the President himself was asked, without being 
compelled, to file an affidavit about whether had had any 
interactions with the Guptas.  He filed his affidavit, he did 
not have to be compelled. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not complain that there was no 
rule for making such a request. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Chair, I must stress that the 
application by the legal team has not been prompted by the 
notion, which is a preposterous notion, frankly, that you are 
not allowed to issue polite invitations because the law does 
not expressly say, you know, you may do so.  There are 
good legal and factual grounds quite apart from that.  But 
the proposition that you are not entitled by law to issue a 
polite 
invitation 
to 
witnesses 
to 
come 
before 
the 
Commission to give evidence voluntarily cannot stand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I mean, all it seems is I am not 
20 
supposed to ask him to come, I am not supposed to 
authorise a summons to be issues to compel him to come, 
so …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But when you do… 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess I am supposed to just fold my 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 43 of 167 
 
hands and not do anything. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The test, of course, is 
you have a duty, you have a discretion, you have a 
mandate and you have the power and that must be 
exercised reasonably in terms of discretion and all the 
facts that are incontrovertible, Chair, and I will deal with 
some more now and make it certainly beyond, in our 
submission, any doubt that that discretion would be 
reasonably exercised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the one question that I think you 
10 
will need to deal with is to the – it is two questions, one is 
whether 
when 
the 
point 
Section 
3.1 
says 
that 
the 
Commission has got power to summon witnesses, we know 
that this Act is a 1947 Act, it is very old, at that time there 
was only one way of summoning that could happen.  One 
question is whether that summoning in this day and age 
would include summoning a witness to appear and give 
evidence by video link or in any other way that may be 
done with technology.  I raise that because you will 
remember that in his attorney’s letters one of the things 
20 
they say is that because of his age and Covid-19 his 
doctors have advised him to limit his movement. 
 
So the normal way of – when a summons is issued 
in any court to be served on somebody to appear before 
that court, it means that that person must physically come 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 44 of 167 
 
to the court. 
 
Now 
the 
question 
of 
Covid-19 
may 
well 
be 
something that needs to be looked at.  I do not have a 
problem if – I will not have a problem if he were to say for 
Covid-19 reasons I would prefer to give evidence via video 
link.  As long as he does so within the borders of the 
Republic and not from outside, I would not have a problem, 
I have indeed authorised the giving of evidence by some 
witnesses via video link.  I think one of them was Mr 
Mkhwanazi who asked when – I do not know which level, at 
10 
level we were in, said for Covid-19 reasons he was 
reluctant to travel and he asked if he could give evidence 
via video link, I authorised that, it happened.  So I could do 
the same with Mr Zuma if he has a legitimate reason that 
because of his age. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but the question is whether 
summon witnesses as used in Section 3.1 is wide enough 
to encompass that meaning.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course maybe if it does not, if it not 
wide enough to encompass that meaning, it may be that the 
summons might include something to which we will say if 
he wishes to give evidence via video link and he advises 
the 
Commission 
timeously 
on 
those 
dates 
then 
his 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 45 of 167 
 
appearance, 
via 
video 
link, 
will 
be 
deemed 
to 
be 
compliance with the summons.  I am not sure.  What do you 
say about that issue? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The section has a 
timeless 
element 
to 
it 
because 
it 
says 
you, 
as 
a 
Commissioner, have the powers that the High Court has 
and that power has been interpreted and applied over time.  
In fact the legal team has done an opinion on this which we 
can let you have, obviously, but I do think it is somewhere 
in your own archives as well, the many files that you have.   
10 
I am told that there is no sound, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps it is important that there 
should be sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is important. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Purely coincidental, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I should adjourn while they 
are attending to it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  We will adjourn for a few minutes.  
20 
Hopefully they can sort out the sound quickly.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand the sound is back. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes thank you Chair.  Chair we 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 46 of 167 
 
were dealing with the import and meaning in today’s 
technological age of the provisions of Section 31 of 1947 
Commission’s Act.  The powers of the Court ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius, I just wanted to 
say – I just wanted to say that the regulations of this 
Commission, which were promulgated by Mr Zuma when he 
was President include Regulation 10[6] and Regulation 
10[6] says: 
“For the purposes of conducting an investigation the 
Chairperson may direct any person to submit an 
10 
affidavit or affirmed declaration or to appear before 
the Commission to give evidence or to produce any 
document in his or her possession or under his or 
her control, each has a bearing on the matter being 
investigated and may examine such person.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair and those regulations 
have been promulgated under the amended 1947 Act, which 
says that the President may issue regulations to expand 
the powers of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair the 1947 Act, which gives 
powers to the Commission which are equivalent to the 
powers of the High Court is instructed, because the powers 
of the High Court have been developed over time through 
the application of the summons provisions and the giving of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 47 of 167 
 
evidence provisions to take account of technology.  There 
is the judgment of Satchwell, J, the technology of the video 
link is now accepted both in other jurisdictions and South 
Africa as an efficient and effective way of providing oral 
evidence both in chief and in cross-examination and that 
this is simply another tool for securing effective access to 
justice.    
 
We have the example of children giving evidence 
via 
video 
link, 
we 
have 
the 
example 
of 
in 
camera 
witnesses, or witnesses who don’t give evidence directly 
10 
but over video and sound links, so there is no reason why a 
person whose immunity is threatened by Covid conditions 
shouldn’t 
also 
be 
catered 
for 
under 
the 
expanded 
technological rubric of the giving of evidence. 
 
Of course you make the qualification which is 
important that the witness must be within the jurisdiction of 
the Court, so that the evidence that is given can be 
accounted for in terms of the law within the borders of the 
country.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the one approach may be to take 
20 
the summoning to be wide enough to include a video link, 
another approach might be what I said earlier on to have 
the summoning as it would be in a summons but to have 
something that says either maybe in the summons that 
says if the witness, if Mr Zuma through arrangements with 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 48 of 167 
 
the Commission appears via video link on the days that are 
specified that will be deemed to be compliance with the 
summons. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair.  In fact I think that has 
been provided for in other cases specifically in camera 
witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because then it gives him an 
opportunity that if he has no problem giving evidence but 
he has a problem because of his age and Covid 19 then 
that is taken care of, it can’t be advance as a reason for 
10 
not appearing whereas if that is not done he might say the 
Covid situation is a good enough reason for me not to 
appear so but if one – if that is dealt with that way then he 
can’t advance that, that reason. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, yes.   And the powers that 
you have are based in statute as well as in regulations 
which have been empowered by statute expressly, as well 
as the general power that during the charge of the 
procedures, and this is essentially given the authority is a 
procedural matter. 
20 
 
Chair if I may just finish the list of issues where the 
former President has been requested to assist you in your 
investigations.   
 
You requested the President to respond to the 
application 
made 
by 
Ms 
Reddy 
Tlabe 
that 
was 
an 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 49 of 167 
 
application made by her to give evidence and to cross-
examine the former President, arising out of his own 
evidence and in that respect a request was made and there 
has been no response to that.  
 
You have issued at least two 10.6 directives, the 
provision to which you have just referred Chair, requiring 
him to respond, and this is more than an invitation Chair, 
this is an exercise of the compulsory power, to respond to 
the evidence of Messrs Tsotsi, Linnell and Matona and to 
respond to the evidence of Mr Popo Molefe in the Eskom 
10 
and in the PRASA matters respectively.  Those have not 
been complied with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well one of those, I forget which one, 
was I signed the regulation 10.6 directive, I think on the 
28 t h of August.  That may have been the one relating to the 
affidavit of Mr Tsotsi and so on, or it may have been the 
one relating to Mr Popo Molefe’s affidavit in evidence about 
PRASA issues and subsequently I signed another directive 
requiring Mr Zuma to file affidavits.   
 
So this is different, in the past there was a request 
20 
in 2018, that request has never been complied with, there 
was an undertaking that the he would file an affidavit 
dealing with responding to General Maseku’s evidence and 
Ms Mentoor ’s evidence.  That has never been filed. 
 
Then last year when he 
appeared before the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 50 of 167 
 
Commission there was an agreement, you referred to it 
...[intervenes]  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 Yes 
followed 
up 
by 
several 
promises. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and agreement that was concluded 
with him through his lawyers, and which I announced 
publically and I remember after announcing the terms of 
that agreement I called upon you and his counsel to 
confirm that I had correctly recorded the terms and both of 
you confirmed and he had agreed through his lawyers to 
10 
file 
an 
affidavit, 
or 
affidavits 
responding 
to 
various 
affidavits of witnesses who ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The areas of interest documents? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that affidavit, those affidavits have 
never been furnished, so whether you request him to file an 
affidavit you request him nicely, you don’t get an affidavit.  
Whether there is an agreement with his lawyers or an 
affidavit he will file affidavits, you don’t get those affidavits 
and 
now 
when 
you 
issue 
a 
directive, 
because 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which came as a criminal sanction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The directive now carries a 
criminal sanction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now the last time I heard was that 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 51 of 167 
 
the directive that I issued on the 28 t h of August compelling 
him to file an affidavit I cannot remember whether it was in 
regard to the Eskom matter and the Durban meeting or 
whether it was in regard to PRASA, but the deadline which 
had been given the last time I had it had come and gone 
and he had not filed any affidavit and in regard to another 
one I suspect that the deadline has come and gone, but I 
don’t – I haven’t been told whether he has filed an 
affidavit. 
 
So whether you make a request nicely he won’t file 
10 
an affidavit.  Whether you reach an agreement with him 
and he undertakes to file an affidavit he won’t file it.  When 
I issue a directive in terms of the regulations, at least in 
regard to one he did not file an affidavit within the time 
that was given and to my knowledge he did not file an 
application to request an extension of time and in terms of 
the regulations as amended failure to comply with a 
directive issued by the Chairperson in terms of Regulation 
10[6] failing to comply with it without sufficient cause is a 
criminal offence. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.  Chair there were two 
further invites of a less formal nature to respond to Mr 
Human’s 
affidavit 
dealing 
with 
the 
evidence 
of 
Mr 
Sunderam and an invitation to respond to the affidavits of 
Mr Megwe and Ms Pillay also dealing with the evidence of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 52 of 167 
 
Mr Sunderam, those have not been complied with either. 
 
Importantly for the question of an appearance Chair 
you have set aside at least five separate weeks in the 
calendar of the Commission for the appearance of Mr 
Zuma, which have not been adhered to and what you 
directed Chair was that if he wasn’t to appear or had good 
reason not to appear he should make formal application, 
that hasn’t been received either. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was never done. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There has never been a formal 
10 
application, we have always had to deal with allegations 
and correspondence, and of course that is more than just a 
formal 
requirement 
because 
if 
Mr 
Zuma’s 
legal 
representatives were to come before you to make an 
application not to appear in any one of those five weeks 
you would have the opportunity of interrogating that.   If it 
is just simply sent to you in a letter you don’t have that 
opportunity at all, so it is more than just a procedural 
requirement it is a substantive requirement.  
 
So Chair in summary then, unless there is any 
20 
further issue you want to raise the two questions really 
before you are would it be a reasonable exercise of the 
power 
that 
you 
have 
to 
issue 
summons 
in 
these 
circumstances, given the terms of reference, given your 
duties, given the provisions of Section 31, given the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 53 of 167 
 
provisions of Section 10[6] that must be answered in the 
affirmative.  There are the added considerations that we 
have just outlined that make it practically necessary for 
summons to be issued and we therefore ask for an order in 
terms of the amended Notice of Application. 
ORDER 
Having read the affidavits placed before me and having 
listened to submissions made by counsel representing the  
Commission’s legal team I am satisfied that this is a matter 
in which I should grant the application.    
10 
 
I am satisfied that a proper case has been made out for an 
order authorising that the Secretary of the Commission 
should sign and issue a summons against Mr Jacob 
Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, former President of the Republic of 
South Africa to appear before the Commission at ten 
o’clock on the 16 t h to the 20 t h of November 2020 in this 
venue on each one of those days, therefore I am going to 
make the following order: 
 
20 
1. The Secretary of the Commission is hereby authorised 
and directed to sign and issue a summons in terms of 
Section 3 [1] read with [2] of the Commissions Act H 
of 1947 requiring Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, 
former President of the Republic of South Africa to 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 54 of 167 
 
appear before the Commission at ten o’clock on the 
16 t h to the 20 t h of November 2020, both days inclusive 
for 
purposes 
of 
giving 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission 
and 
being 
questioned 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain certain matters relating to the subject of the 
investigations of the Commission. 
 
2. Should 
Mr 
Jacob 
Gedleyihlekisa 
Zuma 
make 
appropriate arrangements with the Commission prior 
to the dates referred to above to give evidence via 
10 
video link and he subsequently gives evidence on 
those days via video link that will be deemed to be 
sufficient compliance with the summons, and the 
Secretary of the Commission should include advice or 
words to this effect in the summons so that Mr Zuma 
will know that such appearance will be deemed to be 
sufficient compliance with the summons. 
 
Is there something that I am ...[intervenes]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No Chair that is – we will assist the 
20 
Secretary in the drafting of the summons in accordance 
with your order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  That is the order I am making. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.   May we be 
excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are excused.  We will take a 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 55 of 167 
 
short adjournment and once the witness here for today is 
ready then I will be called. 
 
We adjourn.

everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready?

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I see Mr Tsotsi is back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chairperson the first witness is Mr 
Tsotsi this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Welcome back Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi may be sworn in Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR TSOTSI:  Zola Andile Tsotsi. 
REGISTRAR: Do you have any objections to taking the

prescribed oath? 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280

ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you swear that the evidence that you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else 
but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MR TSOTSI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson the main 
bundle we will be using this morning for Mr Tsotsi is Eskom 
Bundle 07[A]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I got it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi – thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi 
you will have it also there in front of you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That bundle will contain Mr Tsotsi your 
affidavit on the first – okay we will use the pagination on the 
left hand side top corner – the black pagination instead of 
the red.  Okay.  Ja.   
Mr Tsotsi yesterday we ended on a note and I want to 
continue on that note.  We ended on that note with a 
different witness before us a former member of the board.  
20 
And the main issue with which I want to start is the apparent 
uncertainty about how the Financial Director got onto the list 
of the suspended executives.    
By the way for the purposes of background we will be 
dealing Chairperson with Mr Tsotsi with the end of the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 57 of 167 
 
suspension issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I thought you need to … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Explain that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get him to explain for the public. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just because Mr Tsotsi has been here I 
think he is coming to testify for the commission for the third 
time now – if not fourth time.  So you have called him 
especially to deal with certain matters relating to Eskom that 
he might not have dealt with sufficiently; previously or that 
10 
you might not have covered or that may have arisen from 
other witnesses in the meantime. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you want to put to him some of the 
things that other witnesses say about him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or about some of the matters that he has 
covered.  I think that is the purpose Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why you are back. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now Mr Tsotsi has been informed 
Chairperson accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – so that – that will not take him by 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 58 of 167 
 
surprise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi I want to start with the apparent 
uncertainty and it may not be an uncertainty from the 
evidence we saw yesterday.  The inclusion of the Financial 
Director Ms Tsholofelo Molefe on the list of those who were 
to be suspended.   
 
Now as you have testified the – you went to a 
meeting in Durban on the 8 March 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:  Right. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is a Sunday afternoon.  You meet 
there with Ms Dudu Myeni, Mr Linnell, the President joins 
you later.  There is Dudu – Ms Dudu Myeni’s son as well and 
Mr Nick Linnell recalls that there was a gentleman called 
Jabu Maswanganyi.  You had followed that explanation?  You 
follow the – the narrative explanation? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will not go into the details but in that 
meeting the request to you was that three executives should 
be suspended.  Correct? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Those three executives did not include 
Ms Tsholofelo Molefe. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But we understand from another witness 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 59 of 167 
 
Ms Suzanne Daniels that she has a meeting – she is called 
to a meeting by Mr Matshela Koko on the 10 March two days 
after your meeting.  The 10 March 2015 at Melrose Arch and 
that there she is made to meet with a gentleman called Mr 
Salim Essa.  You would have heard that from her testimony 
at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee and her affidavit 
before this commission. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The meeting at Melrose Arch 10 March 
2015 has a commonality with your meeting in respect of the 
10 
three executives.  Correct? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But they add one more.  They add the 
Financial Director.  But what is interesting Mr Tsotsi is how 
Mr Salim Essa according to Ms Daniels introduces himself to 
Ms Daniels.  He according to Ms Daniels he says I am the 
Minister’s advisor.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I missed that did – did Ms Daniels say 
that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I missed that.  How could I miss that?  
Is it in another bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like to see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no correct Chair.  It is in Ms Daniels’ 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 60 of 167 
 
bundle.  I will open the page to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja have I got it here?  I would like to see 
it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I – I used a different file – let us 
see.  Oh here is my file.  Because mine is marked and I can 
easily get the page which I want.  That is on page – that is 
page 9 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is bundle – Eskom Bundle 08. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 08.  It helps to re-read 
these things Chairperson and you see these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a lot to read and sometimes you 
miss something. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 22 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
“As we were chatting a gentleman walked 
into the board room and introduced himself 
20 
as Salim Essa advisor to Minister Brown.” 
I had missed that.  But apart from the significance that you 
may attach to it for purposes of these – there is another 
significance that you might not be aware of that – but that I 
am aware of that is that if I recall correctly when Minister 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 61 of 167 
 
Mosebenzi Zwane went to Switzerland and met with the CEO 
of I think Glencore Mines in order when Tegeta wanted to – 
wanted to preclude some agreement with Glencore it is said 
that Mr Salim Essa attended that meeting and Mr Ephraim 
who gave evidence before the commission last year said that 
he had been told that Mr Salim Essa had intro – or rather 
that Mr Salim Essa was introduced to the CEO of Glencore 
as an advisor to Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.   
Mr Ephraim’s evidence or affidavit it was not clear 
whether it was Mr Mosebenzi Zwane who said to the CEO of 
10 
Glencore this is my advisor or whether it was Mr Salim Essa 
who said I am the Minister’s advisor.  We have pursued that 
and obtained an affidavit from the CEO of Glencore in 
Switzerland who has provided an affidavit to confirm that Ms 
Salim Essa was introduced to him in that meeting as Minister 
Mosebenzi Zwane’s advisor.   
Although it is not clear I think whether it was Mr 
Mosebenzi Zwane who said this is my advisor Salim Essa 
who said this is – I am the Minister’s advisor.  But there is 
that piece of evidence.  I think that Mr Mosebenzi Zwane has 
20 
been asked to comment on it.  So that is – that is interesting.  
Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chair.  So Mr Tsotsi … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I think Mr Salim Essa officially 
was – I am not aware that he was – he had been appointed 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 62 of 167 
 
as advisor to Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe the public does not know but he 
had been appointed so we will see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no – neither do I know whether there 
was an official appointment Chair.  Mr Tsotsi do you know? 
MR TSOTSI:  No I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Whether Mr Salim Essa was the advisor 
to Minister Brown. 
MR TSOTSI:  No I do not know Chair. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are talking here 10 March 2015.  You 
are the Chairperson of the board.  Did you know who is the 
advisor to Minister Brown? 
MR TSOTSI:  I have met a gentleman who was said to 
Minister Brown’s advisor I just forget his name now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was it Salim Essa? 
MR TSOTSI:  No it was not Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No that is alright.  This is what happens 
Mr Tsotsi.  You come from a meeting with the President; you 
come out of there with three names; do the enquiry and 
20 
these other three names of the executives that should step 
aside or be suspended.   
The Melrose Arch meeting has identified four names 
by a man who says I am the advisor to Minister Brown.  You 
come to the board on the 9t h the day after your meeting and 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 63 of 167 
 
you need to explain to the Chairperson because from the 
memorandum and your proposal whether it is yours or – as 
drafted by Mr Nick Linnell at the very least one is unable to 
determine whether the suspension of the executives is 
explicitly – well that is mentioned or referred to we have 
determined it is not explicitly mentioned.   
So we do not know from the memorandum and the 
proposal who is going to be suspended.  But we know from 
you – you have testified before the commission that these 
are the executives you said to the board should be 
10 
suspended or step aside.  And in your words you said it was 
the three executives.  We have looked at the transcript 
where you say: 
“The 
Financial 
Director’s 
position 
is 
different.” 
You recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But then the board goes into a meeting 
with the Minister.  In the meeting with the Minister the board 
discusses amongst others the inquiry and we will see from 
20 
the affidavit of Ms Nkolo it discusses the executives.   
Doctor Ngubane writes to the Chairperson in the 
affidavit 
that 
the 
Minster 
raised 
concerns 
about 
four 
executives.  The four executives are the ones who get to be 
suspended.  And she expressed the view that the executives 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 64 of 167 
 
if present their presence will hinder the inquiry.  Could that 
be a coincidence that the Minister and you had different 
understandings of who exactly should be suspended? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman I guess I should start with my 
understanding at the Durban meeting which Mr Seleka has 
pointed out that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  The understanding was that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I am sorry.  The Durban is quite 
clear as far as I am concerned. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the three executives I mentioned. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So I think leave the Durban meeting.  
Nobody has talked about a fourth director to be suspended. 
MR TSOTSI:  Now the point I want to make about the Durban 
meeting is that the President said he would inform the 
Minister of the outcome of this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and asked you to talk to the board. 
MR TSOTSI:  So clearly – yes and I will talk to the board.  
20 
So when I left the meeting my understanding was that the 
Minister will also be told of three executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Now it came as a surprise to me that there are 
four areas that were mentioned by the Minister. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 65 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And at the time I did not know about this 
meeting which occurred on the 10t h.  So I – I am – I can only 
arrive at a conclusion that there must have been some 
discussion with somebody where the Minister was either 
informed or was participating in a discussion which then 
introduced a fourth person meaning the FD.   
So is it two things I – I cannot reconcile them 
because the understanding in Durban was three and the 
indication at the board meeting before the Minister arrived 
10 
was still three.  The Minister comes in and she indicates that 
there is a – there are four areas to be looked into and then 
the name of the FD emerges.  Now in the subsequent 
meeting and in the P&G meeting.   
So somewhere along the line it seems as though the 
Minister knew about the addition of – of the fourth executive.  
Whether it occurred at that meeting of the 10 t h or as a result 
of that meeting on the 10 t h I cannot really say.  I do not 
know. 
 
But 
there 
has 
been 
you 
know 
there 
is 
this 
transformation of the – of the issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think the – what Mr Seleka picked up 
is quite important about Mr Essa introducing himself as 
advisor to the Minister.  But it is also quite important that Ms 
Daniels says Ms Essa told her about four executives to be 
suspended 
and 
that 
included 
the 
Financial 
Director.  
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 66 of 167 
 
Because what it means is that on the evidence that has been 
presented to me so far about the – this issue of the inquiry 
into the affairs of Eskom and the suspension of executives it 
is that the first time that anybody seems to have added the 
Financial Director as one of the executives to be suspended 
is Mr Essa when he spoke to – he had a meeting with Ms 
Daniels and Mr Koko.  
 And the point you make Mr Tsotsi is also quite 
important that at the end of the Durban meeting the agree – 
the position was that only three executives were talked about 
10 
and that the President said Mr Koko – Mr Tsotsi please test 
this idea with the board and I will talk to the Minister.  
Talking to the Minister would have meant that he would have 
told the Minister about the discussions at the Durban 
meeting namely that there should be an inquiry at Eskom and 
that there should be a suspension of three executives.   
And you gave evidence previously and said the 
President even – the former President asked you Mr Tsotsi 
do you know who the executives are that are to be 
suspended?   
20 
And you confirmed because you said Ms Dudu Myeni 
had told you. So there was clarity at the Durban meeting that 
there were three executives to be suspended.  There was 
clarity who they were and they did not include the Financial 
Director.  And the former President undertook to convey that 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 67 of 167 
 
to the Minister and then you have the 9t h.  On the 9t h the 
board had a meeting.  Nobody at that meeting mentioned 
anything about the fourth director.   
Some witnesses I think may have said there was not 
mention even of suspensions on that meeting because it was 
short.  But then now – so according to Ms Daniels on the 10t h 
before the meeting of the 11t h Mr Salim Essa tells her it is 
four executives to be suspended.  And indeed ultimately four 
executives are suspended.   
It goes back to an issue I raised yesterday with Ms 
10 
Klein that it looks like certain people were outside of Eskom 
were making decisions relating to Eskom matters and were 
making decisions that the board was required to rubber 
stamp and it would seem that at least in some cases it did 
rubber stamp some of those decisions.   
And it may well be that the persons who were outside 
of Eskom who were making these decisions were not in 
government.  But they were deciding who is to be suspended 
at Eskom; who is going to stay.  I mean you were at the 
Durban meeting; you met with the former President and there 
20 
were three executives to be suspended.  Now it may well be 
that even the former President did not know about this 
addition of the fourth – fourth director.  Maybe he only heard 
after.   
It may well be that he never knew about the fourth 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 68 of 167 
 
director until the suspension had happened.  You do not 
know.  We do not know.  Because one could have expected 
that since in the Durban meeting which you attended with the 
former President the agreement was that three executives 
would be suspended.   
One would expect that if the President subsequently 
was subsequently persuaded that there should be a fourth 
director to be suspended one would have thought that he 
would have wanted to convey that to you so that you would 
know that the addition of this other director is with his 
10 
knowledge. 
MR TSOTSI:  That did occur to me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he never told you about the fourth 
director. 
MR TSOTSI:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson indeed Mr 
Tsotsi in your affidavit and I will read it to you that is page 
17 Chairperson paragraph 12.6.  It is explicit. 
“We immediately began a discussion of what 
20 
was going to be presented to the President.  
This discussion was led by Dudu Myeni.  She 
explained 
that 
the 
situation 
of 
Eskom’s 
financial 
stress 
and 
poor 
technical 
performance warranted that an enquiry into 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 69 of 167 
 
the company be instituted.  She further 
elaborated that in the course of the said 
enquiry three executives” 
Page 17 paragraph 12.6 
“Three executives namely Chief Executive 
Tshediso 
Matona, 
Group 
Executive 
for 
Commercial 
Matshela 
Koko 
and 
Group 
Executive for Capital Dan Marokane are to be 
suspended.” 
So it cannot be any clearer than that. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes, yes I can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Doctor Ngubane tells us in his affidavit 
what the Minister said to the board.  He says: 
“Although the Minister did not say that  
MR TSOTSI:  I want to find it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry he says that: 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka.  I just want to 
mention something Mr Tsotsi. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may comment on it; you might not 
comment on it if you want.  It is interesting that how the 
Financial Director was added to the list of executives to be 
suspended.  It seems like a mystery even among the board 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 70 of 167 
 
members you know.   
But also I mentioned yesterday how Mr Brian Molefe 
was – was seconded to Eskom is dealt with in a certain way 
in Doctor Ngubane’s affidavit.  But interestingly he says he 
does not know how Mr Anoj Singh got added to be seconded 
to Eskom too as CFO.  So there are lots of things that you do 
not understand how they would happen.  Ja anyway. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So on – on his version Doctor Ngubane 
who would later replace you as the chairperson of the board 
he says in his affidavit. 
10 
 “Although the Minister did not direct the 
board to suspend the four executives.” 
Now there you hear the four executives.  Not the three.   
“She raised concerns of her own against 
them and in the end the Minister felt that the 
presence of the four executives might hinder 
the investigation.” 
You hear that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Ms Nkolo says: 
20 
“The Minister said the board must make a 
decision I am going to hang around.”   
You know that. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And where did the Minister go?  Where 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 71 of 167 
 
did she hang around? 
MR TSOTSI:  The Minister was escorted to a what would be 
an almost like a cafeteria that belonged to Eskom within the 
building. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Within the building? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So she is waiting for you – the board to 
make those decisions? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So there the four gets introduced.  So let 
10 
us see from the transcript of your meeting because Ms 
Mabude says which we read yesterday Chairperson. 
“Thanks 
Chair 
I 
think 
the 
Minister 
has 
indicated a whole lot of issues that needs to 
be looked at.”   
And in her speech if you noted what she is – what she was 
saying it is the basis for the Terms of Reference.  So if we 
can use that speech as a way of putting the Terms of 
Reference and from that speech it was indicated to me 
indicating the critical sections that sections that needs to be 
20 
looked at.  We do not have that speech.  Was it in writing; 
was it verbal? 
MR TSOTSI:  No it was verbal there was nothing written. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Tsotsi are you able to confirm 
that? No let me not ask you that question because the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 72 of 167 
 
answer to it is ja.  So the areas are indicated according to 
Ms Mabude by the Minister in her speech.  Needs to be 
looked at and she says: 
“We need to look at that speech in order to 
formulate the Terms of Reference.” 
And then you say in response to her because it is a long 
winded talk - okay, I think based on what you are saying to 
her there are four areas that the minister has spoken about.  
She spoke about maintenance and that is engineering.  
Maintenance is driven by engineering.   
10 
 
She spoke about procurement and that is commercial.  
She spoke about the new Build Programme.  That is Group 
Capital and Technology.  And she spoke about finance.   
 
So I would have asked you:  Do you remember what 
areas did the minister identify?  But there is your answer.  
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So was the minister the first person to 
include Finance in the list of areas that were to be 
investigated? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody else before that had included that 
portfolio? 
MR TSOTSI:   No one else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  and in the areas that were 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 73 of 167 
 
discussed at the Durban meeting, Finance was not one of 
them? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And in fact, Mr Tsotsi.  
In the P&G meeting, when you introduced Mr Linnell, you do 
say to him:  So Nick, the purpose of what we have been 
here... what we have here, Nick.  Is basically the board 
members.  We had the sub-committee meetings earlier but 
the rest of the board is here.   
10 
 
And basically, I explained to the board that you had been 
asked to support Eskom in this whole exercise of this 
investigation, this inquiry, so that, certainly, the governance 
issues and taking care that this thing is done properly. 
 
And is done in a manner that cannot be challenged and 
cannot be referred vaguely on the issues.  But I want to take 
you to, you wanting to address the board on.  And he says... 
you say, sorry. 
“Now the board had made some significant decisions 
and the decisions the board has made in respect of 
20 
the investigation are that: 
1. The 
investigation 
will 
proceed 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
2. Those executives who are directly involved in the 
areas where the investigation will focus, will be 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 74 of 167 
 
suspended.” 
 
And you say:  “And these are four areas.” 
 
This is after your meeting with the minister.  Now you 
are able to say four.  Correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because you have met with the minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Dr Ngubane says, after your meeting 
with the minister, it was then clear that the shareholder 
wants this to be done.   
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
The 
four 
areas 
are 
identified 
...[intervenes]   
MR TSOTSI:   Because he is the one who told me when I 
objected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I just need to make a point here.  After 
the minister had left, I got out of from lunch and I was a little 
late.  I came into the meeting, maybe what, ten minutes or so 
minutes late, and I found two discussions going on.  Well, a 
20 
discussion going on about two issues.   
 
One was the number of executives to be suspended and 
secondly, the people to replace them in the acting positions.  
Now in respect of this matter, I heard the name of the FD 
motion(?) and I raised objections.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 75 of 167 
 
 
And I said:  No, we never agreed on the FD.  Why is she 
being suspended?  Then there was reference to the fact that 
there is a discussion with when the minister was present 
about the financial ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The finance portfolio. 
MR TSOTSI:   The Finance portfolio.  And then I said:  Look, 
that does not leave or result in us to suspend the FD.  So Mr 
Ngubane, Dr Ngubane then said to me:  No, the minister said 
the FD must be included.   
 
So I said:  No, I do not agree and I am going to call the 
10 
minister.  So I walked out of the meeting, picked up... took 
my phone and I called the minister   
 
And I said:  Minister, why are we including the FD?  She 
was never part of the rest of the executives to be suspended.   
 
And the minister just simply said to me:  This is what we 
have to do and that is what you need to do.  She must be 
part of that list.   
 
I was infuriated to be honest with you.  And so I rather 
than argue with her because I am not sure what I would have 
said to her because of the state I was in, I just decided to 
20 
just back off.  So I went back into the meeting.   
 
So I am just trying to point out the fact that indeed the 
arrival of the FD on that list was a very contentious issue 
from my perspective.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But it seems that irrespective of what Ms 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 76 of 167 
 
Daniels says Mr Essa told her on the 10t h of March.  It seems 
on your evidence that the inclusion of, as far as you know, 
the inclusion of the financial director in the list of executives 
to be suspended, is linked to the minister at two levels.   
 
One, because – and you must say if that is not your 
recollection in terms of what happened – one, because when 
the minister spoke to the board on the 11t h, she mentioned 
four areas to be investigated and included Finance which 
had not been included at the Durban meeting.   
 
And she spoke on the basis that the executives leading 
10 
those portfolios, those areas, the board should consider 
suspending them.  That is what at one level.   
 
She is the one who included the Finance portfolio 
amongst the portfolios to be investigated.  And then two.  Dr 
Ngubane, on your evidence, told you that it was the minister 
who wanted the FD to be included.   
 
And you called the minister to verify this and she did not 
say to you:  I never said the FD should be included.  She did 
not say she should not be included, that is the FD.   
 
And she said instead that the... she should be included, 
20 
in effect.  She might not have used those words but that was 
that the effect of what she said to you.  Is my understanding 
of your evidence correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   It is quite correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 77 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  What I wanted to read 
Mr Tsotsi whilst you were addressing or rather explaining to 
the Chairperson about Dr Ngubane, is that statement he 
makes in his affidavit.  He says: 
“After the meeting with the minister, it was clear to 
the board the government, a shareholder of Eskom, 
required the inquiry to proceed and that the four 
executives had to step aside whilst the inquiry was 
underway.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is speaking there? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Dr Ngubane, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But look at the contrast because 
you introduced Mr Nick Linnell with your knowledge of the 
Durban meeting, what was conveyed to you by the... back in 
Durban.   
 
You have mentioned because after the meeting with the 
minister, you know there is now four areas.  But Nick has to 
20 
address you.  But Nick only knows three.   
 
And somebody asked you:  Sorry, Chair.  Is the 
Executive for Finance also included?   
 
And Mr Venete Klein yesterday said, that is the voice of 
the company secretary, Ms Malesela Phukubje.  And your 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 78 of 167 
 
answer was:   
“Oh, yes four.  And that the work that needs to be 
done in respect of the investigation must not be 
compromised by the presence of these particular 
executives  One of the two that from the work you 
have done, the committee would like to know and 
needs to be updated of the potential charges that 
are on the table in respect of the executives and 
probably... 
 
This is the point. 
10 
“...and probably exclude the FD because I was not 
briefed on the FD as far as I know.” 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because your briefing... that is the 
Durban briefing. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The FD was not included.  But certainly 
on the other three, maybe you want to take the committee 
through that and also the processes that need to come into 
play for this to be effected which include them and so on.   
20 
 
Mr Nick Linnell himself said to the Chairperson:  I do not 
know how the third... the fourth, the FD was included.  I 
know that three executives needed to be suspended. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm that? 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 79 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the question is.  Why is the FD 
included?  Now the FD came and testified here Mr Tsotsi.  
And just before I go there.  Chairperson, yesterday in your 
summary, you could not recollect... you could not recall 
whether at Ms Daniels’ meeting at Melrose Arch the names 
were mentioned.  In her affidavit Chairperson, she says:   
“He seemed to accept this.” 
 
Now Ms Daniels has been asked:  What is the process?  
And she says my response was that:   
10 
“I could not suspend someone at the whim and 
needed a very good reason to do that.” 
 
And then she says:   
“He seemed to accept this and then proceeded to 
tell me that in the upcoming days, four executives at 
Eskom 
would 
be 
suspended, 
namely, 
Tshediso 
Matona, 
Tsholofelo 
Molefe, 
Dan 
Marokane 
and 
Matshela Koko.  I looked at Koko in shock and he 
appeared 
to 
have 
knowledge 
of 
this, 
as 
his 
demeanour remained composed.  They are the four, 
20 
exactly the four.” 
 
And the question is, why the FD?  We will come to the 
other ones because Mr Matona, as you know Mr Tsotsi, was 
only appointed with effect the 1s t of October 2014.  So he is 
about five months before he gets suspended.  Correct? 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 80 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   October.  One thing we have overlooked 
about Mr Dan Marokane is that he was even appointed in this 
position he occupied, Group Executive.  What was it? 
MR TSOTSI:   He was Group Executive for ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Commercial? 
MR TSOTSI:   Capital. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MR TSOTSI:   To Group Capital. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Group Capital? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That appointment was in fact made in 
November 2014. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he is even fewer months in this 
position than Mr Matona himself.  So he would be four 
months about in this position.  Correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the board, in the minutes, he... we 
went through the minute with him when he was here.  How he 
20 
-and you will help me with the correct terminology - in regard 
to the Medupi Power Plant.  What was the milestone 
achieved or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the milestone achieved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 81 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the milestone ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that he had achieved. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chairman.  What was happening was that 
we were experiencing delays in the commissioning of the 
first unit at Medupi which would have been the first unit of 
the new Build Programme.   
 
Now, with him coming onboard, he was successful in 
accelerating the commissioning of this unit and actually 
managed to commission that unit sometime and I think it was 
10 
in January of 2015.   
 
Now it is a milestone from the perspective that the last 
time when Eskom commissioned one of those so-called 
thermal 
units 
was 
with 
the... 
would 
have 
been 
with 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   More than 20-years before. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, about 1985 ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Almost 27-years, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, about 20-years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About 27-years. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So how do you suspend somebody like 
that when you say he has done nothing wrong but you 
suspend him, nevertheless? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 82 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It just difficult to understand. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is.  But... are you done, Mr 
Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of course, it puzzles... it boggles the 
mind why you do that.  And we went through the evidence 
with Ms Klein.  Her testimony yesterday to the Chairperson 
was that, she personally had no confidence in Mr Matona.  
But Mr Matona...  
10 
 
The Chairperson put to her, she did not give him a 
chance.  He is hardly six months there or even short of five 
months.   
 
He is called for suspensions when he had presented a 
turnaround strategy to the board.  Do you know that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I recall that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, let me just correct.  The 27-years 
is actually 20-years.  It says: 
“With 
regard 
to 
Group 
Capital 
and 
the 
Build 
Programme, it was noted that the board had visited 
20 
Medupi.  It was reported that Medupi Unit 6 had 
been synchronised which was a significant event in 
Eskom’s history and was the first time such an event 
had taken place in the last 20-years.  It was noted 
that in future the Minister of PE wanted to be 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 83 of 167 
 
included in successful events like this.” 
 
That is the minute of the first meeting of 11 March 2015, 
before the minister comes there and says:  Suspend him. 
 
But let us see.  Let me go back to the position of Ms 
Molefe, doctor.. you are becoming a doctor, Mr Tsotsi.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice went down so I could not hear 
you but now I have a good idea of what you have just done.  
[laughing] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have just done to Mr Tsotsi what you 
did to Mr Klein yesterday.  [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing]  Okay the evidence of Ms 
Molefe which you will be aware of because it involves you in 
some part.  She is appointed into this position as Financial 
Director in January 2014.  You would know because you had 
been the chairperson of the board since 2011? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And shortly after her appointment, she 
20 
says the CEO, Brian Dan has resigned.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And there is an acting CEO, Mr Collin 
Matjila.   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 84 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I will come to him in a moment Mr 
Tsotsi so that we can see how you feature in that regard  But 
Ms Molefe has explained to the Chairperson, giving her 
testimony that shortly after her appointment, she is called to 
the office of the Chief of Staff of the Minister of the DPE.   
 
Mr 
Msomi 
calls 
her 
to 
a 
meeting 
in 
his 
office, 
congratulating her and says to her:  I hope you are going to 
help 
us 
with 
transformation 
issues 
in 
the 
area 
of 
procurement.   
 
You will not know this yourself but later on, she comes to 
10 
you and say:  Mr Msomi is on my case.  He wants to know... 
he wants feedback from me because...   
 
And I am jumping but I will come back to the facts.  And 
she reported to you what is the DPE protocol that should be 
followed in this regard.  Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Yes, I do Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What was your response to her? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, she was essentially looking for 
protection, can I say.  If I can use that word.  Because this 
was somebody who was sitting in the shareholder’s office 
20 
and she felt that it was inappropriate for her to get that sort 
of pressure from that person.   
 
And of course, I knew Mr Msomi.  Now, the protocol is 
such that I as chairman speaks to the minister and the chief 
executive speaks to the ...[intervenes]  
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 85 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   DG. 
MR TSOTSI:   DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Now I recall mentioning this to Mr Matjila and 
that I have got this feedback from the FD that she is being 
pressured to meet with some contractors, some light(?) 
contractors who are experiencing difficulties in accessing 
some parts of the organisation.  I think it was Primary 
Energy, if I remember.   
 
And I then told Ms Molefe that I will speak to someone at 
10 
the department.  Now I what I ended up doing was instead of 
speaking to the minister, I just spoke to the DG because I 
realised that in essence it is easier for the DG to deal with 
that sort of thing because essentially these people report to 
him.   
 
And as it happened, the DG was at the time Mr Matona 
and I had a very good working relationship with him.  So I 
found it easy to address the issue with him.   
 
So I left it at that.  I was not... I do not know what 
exactly what Mr Matjila did it about it at the time but that is 
20 
what I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So here is the important part.  
Should I proceed, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, proceed but I do not want to forget 
this. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 86 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be something in your plan to the 
extent that we might not have covered previously with Mr 
Tsotsi the allegations being made against him by Mr Koko 
about somebody that Mr Koko says had been suspended and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Tsotsi wanted the suspension to 
believe that as well as the allegations of interference in 
certain tenders or some operational matters.  I think we may 
10 
have covered them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want to make sure that if they 
are not covered, we must make sure that they are covered so 
that he deals with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we did ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can do that later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just wanted not to forget it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You can carry on with your plan in 
terms of the questions that you are asking. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, there is an 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 87 of 167 
 
important aspect here in the testimony and evidence of Ms 
Molefe.  And this is where it is.  She says consistently with 
what you have just said.  She is now in the office of Mr 
Msomi and she writes: 
“He indicated to me though there are number of 
black suppliers that complaint about not being 
awarded contracts and would like to meet and 
discuss their complaints.  I indicated to him that I 
relinquish 
my 
role 
as 
chairperson 
of 
Eskom 
Committee.” 
10 
 
But she says:  Well, I am willing to take the details and 
pass them over to the new person at procurement.  And then 
says: 
“Indeed Mr Msomi did arrange such a meeting.” 
 
And guess with who, Mr Tsotsi?   
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did he tell you with whom? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I do not recall that she told me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With Mr Salim Essa. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, okay.  Alright. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And she explained to the Chairperson, 
the meeting with Mr Msomi at the Baron the filling station 
because she was washing to catch a flight, going to the 
airport and it was a brief meeting where the details were 
exchanged and Mr Salim Essa was meeting her for the first 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 88 of 167 
 
time. 
MR TSOTSI:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is where Mr Msomi was 
following up whether you are doing what you are doing.  And 
I want to surmise to you Mr Tsotsi, and you may come into 
this.  When she failed to do what was requested, it became a 
red flag.   
MR TSOTSI:   IN all probabilities, yes.  I see the picture, 
yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it does not end there.  Then comes 
10 
Colin Matjila.  She testified about her having to develop a 
financial sustainability plan.  So there you were told Mr 
Tsotsi that...  That is then Chairperson...  
 
This is in April 2014.  She has just been appointed, 
January 2014.  We are in April 2014.  The financial plan has 
to be developed and there is a meeting and where she has to 
present it to the board.   
 
Mr Tsotsi, you will recall, you said to her:  This plan is 
not robust enough.   
MR TSOTSI:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know what happened thereafter?  
Mr Colin Matjila is the acting CEO and he says:  I will help.  
Get external service providers.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 89 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not remember... Ja, I guess he must have 
indicated that herself.  I do not recall that she ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   But I recall what happened subsequent to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, tell the Chairperson. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Chair, the issue was that, you know, 
because of the growing deterioration financial position of the 
company, particularly because of the consumption of large 
amounts of diesel and the load-shedding programme or 
programme designated, designed to counter load-shedding.   
10 
 
Our financial position was declining and so there was 
some anxiety about what is going to happen, what is likely to 
happen.   
 
And I think the... if I recall what the minister had wanted 
to get a financial position and here given us a certain 
timeframe.  I think in that meeting, the FD must have 
present.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that at the end of June 2014? 
MR TSOTSI:   Probably around the middle of... yes, it was 
about that time. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Or maybe two or three months that we were 
given to come with up something.  And I think also, Treasury 
people were, you know, were also in the loop on this 
particular issue.  Anyway. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 90 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But in the light of what I want you to tell 
the Chairperson. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay so what happened then Chairman is that.  
Ms Molefe at some point came to me and she said to me that 
she is experiencing some difficulty working with Mr Matjila 
who was the acting Chief Executive.  And that he was 
demanding things of her which she could not do.   
 
And this had to do with waiving procurement process to 
10 
enable the company called Regiment to do this project that 
was on the table.   
 
Then I... then she also spoke to some board members in 
that regard and Mr Kunasa[?] was one of them, if I 
remember, people who were involved in the committees that 
were relevant to this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And I then decided:  Okay, let us hear her out. 
So I asked these board members to have a meeting with her 
to hear what out what the problem is including the acting 
20 
Chief Executive.  And the outcome of that meeting was that, 
they were required to follow the due processes.  In other 
words, not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To follow the law. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, to follow the law.  And there was some - I 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 91 of 167 
 
think – I do not want to call it an altercation but there was 
still some argument between herself and the Acting Chief 
Executive.  Who I then discovered was the one who were 
bought these Regiments people on board.  That is when I 
found out that Salim Essa was part of this business.  I did 
not know until I hear from Mr Matjila.  So… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you want to carry on? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.  No, at the end of the day, Chair, the 
proposal and the suggestion from the board was that we 
cannot get into an involved exercise, then these people can 
10 
only some sort of a desktop exercise.  I think that is – if my 
recollection is right, that is where the issue ended. 
 
And then I then had a meeting with the two of them 
because I realised that they were not working well together 
and what I said to them was, people, you know, let us – the 
important thing is to get a result because there is a result 
that is required by the Minister, so let us get on with the 
work and let us not create tension between us. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what we will see what ultimately, 
20 
when all the evidence is in, what will emerge from that 
evidence. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at this stage it seems that it is 
important to note that subject to what Mr Matjila might see 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 92 of 167 
 
if and when he might give evidence here, it seems that he, 
as Acting CEO of Eskom prior to Mr Matona coming in was 
amenable to bringing in Regiments to Eskom and seemed 
to have had some relationship with Mr Salim Essa.  Then 
comes in Mr Matona in October 2014 succeeding Mr 
Matjila.  I do not know whether we will hear any evidence 
about whether Mr – what Mr Matona’s attitude was to Mr 
Salim Essa and Gupta associates, but he gets removed as 
Group CEO and a month after he has been removed, the 
board of Eskom brings in Mr Brian Molefe as Group CEO of 
10 
Eskom. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  There is an 
important detail, Mr Tsotsi, in regard to that issue of the 
corporate plan and get external service providers to assist 
because Ms Tsholofelo Molefe says verbally here and in 
her affidavit that Mr Matjila arranges a meeting with her at 
Monte Casino and they talk about a service provider that 
has the skills, can help, can do the what - cash, unlocking 
20 
at Eskom. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Balance sheet optimisation, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 93 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   It is called the balance sheet optimisation 
exercise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Optimisation, yes.  And they were soon 
joined by a gentleman whom she recognised but the 
gentlemen appeared not to recognise her and that is again, 
Mr Salim Essa.  Says: 
“Essa 
reintroduced 
himself 
to 
me, 
clearly 
not 
remembering our first encounter a couple of months 
before.  It became clear to me that he was very well 
briefed on the strategy planning session and the 
10 
financial qualms of Eskom.  He appeared to have 
prepared very well to meet with us and proposed his 
solution.  As I indicated, that he knows a company, 
Regiments Capital that can assist with unblocking 
cash on the balance sheet.  He said that they had 
done work successfully at Transnet, SAA and City 
Power.  Matjila, who appeared to be very interested, 
asked Essa how soon could he arrange a meeting 
with Regiments Capital.  Essa replied:  As early as 
tomorrow, almost as if this was prearranged.  At this 
20 
stage 
I 
assumed 
Essa 
was 
a 
shareholder 
of 
Regiments Capital.  The next day it is Monday, 
there is a meeting at Eskom arranged with CEO of 
Regiments Mr Eric Wood at Eskom’s offices.” 
You are not placed in the meeting, it is Mr Matjila, Dr 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 94 of 167 
 
Steven Lennon and Ms Tsholofelo Molefe.  Let me fast 
forward because Regiments then say we will provide you a 
proposal in five days.  She says they did not do that.  You 
were provided with a document more than two weeks – 
about two weeks later and this was not a proposal but she 
says it was an agreement.  Do you know that? 
MR TSOTSI:   That could have – would have been 
discussed in the meeting we had with her and the other 
board members, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And she was refusing to sign that 
10 
agreement because Mr Matjila was saying you will sign that 
agreement.  She said no, I will not.   
MR TSOTSI:   I remember one of the complaints she had, 
Chair, was the fact that Eskom was being charged for work 
that should not have been charged for having [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the – in terms of the 
proposed agreement? 
MR TSOTSI:   Exactly, in terms of that proposal she was 
being asked to sign. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is another red flat on her. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Mr Salim Essa knows this. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She has met with – I mean, he has met 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 95 of 167 
 
with her, now is the second time.  Mr Eric Wood has been 
introduced, Regiments, the email came from Mr Eric Wood 
with the proposal which is an agreement and she has 
refused to sign.   
It is interesting what she says Mr Matjila tells her, 
she says – Mr Matjila now is reprimanding her. 
“We 
met 
the 
following 
mornings 
at 
Tintswalo, 
Waterfall Equestrian Estate. At the meeting he 
expressed concern that I was not supporting him, 
stating that he had no aspirations of becoming the 
10 
CEO of Eskom but that he had a mandate from the 
shareholder to fulfil certain urgent matters within 
three months and that we do not have time to be 
following our longwinded procurement processes.  
He stated that he would do no such thing, which is 
follow a process, as he had a mandate from the 
shareholder.” 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair, you will recall, Chair, that Mr 
Matjila is by this time – was already – had already signed 
off on the TNA contract and I think it emerged around this 
20 
time …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is exactly what Mr Molefe is 
saying. 
MR TSOTSI:   …that there was that problem.  So already, if 
he was embroiled with something to do with, you know, with 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 96 of 167 
 
the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the Guptas, h’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Now here he is bringing Salim Essa through 
the back door.  So is tenure probably had some sort of 
relationship with the Gupta family, somehow or other.  Ja, I 
think he – I get the impression that he must have had not 
only mandate from the shareholder he might have had a 
mandate from them, I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He must have been what? 
MR TSOTSI:   He might have a mandate from the Guptas 
10 
as well, I do not know, because it looks like he was, you 
know, introducing their participation into the company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Mr Tsotsi, because 
the TNA is also one of the issues, signed for R43 million.  
Ms Molefe raised that and said in fact that Mr Matjila did 
not even have the authority to sign that agreement and Mr 
Matjila again reprimanded her, according to Ms Tsholofelo 
Molefe: 
“…called me to say that he was well-aware of what 
he had signed and told me stop questioning his 
20 
authority.” 
That is the third red flag.  But the Gobodo forensic auditors 
flagged this issue of Mr Matjila’s TNA agreement. 
And Mr Tsotsi, then we come to that board meeting.  
We are still in 2014 about which Ms Tsholofelo says to the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 97 of 167 
 
Chairperson this board meeting was arranged, we were to 
approve the financials in order to do a road show for 
international bond.  The meeting was scheduled, Mr Tsotsi 
phones me and says that he is going to cancel the meeting 
as he was receiving pressure from outside to cancel the 
meeting.  Now this is not the meeting of 26 February 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:   H’m.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are in 2014.  I think you wrote that 
in your affidavit, Mr Tsotsi.  This is about TNA. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, please do not forget your line 
of thought and Mr Tsotsi, do not forget the issue but I just 
want to interpose and say now that Mr Seleka has 
reminded us of the interaction between – or the interaction 
involving Ms Molefe, the Financial Director, with Mr Koko 
as well as Mr Salim Essa and Regiments and Ms Molefe 
refusing to sign that agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You meant to say Mr Matjila, 
Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Matjila, no, I am sorry, ja, ja, not - 
you know, one is Mr Matjila, the other one is Matshela 
Koko, is it not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, sorry, so you can – no, I mean Mr 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 98 of 167 
 
Matjila, not Mr Koko.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Matjila.  It seems to me that there is 
a possibility that that – her conduct, Ms Molefe’s conduct,  
in refusing to sign that agreement and to cooperate with 
regard to what Mr Salim Essa wanted and what Mr Matjila 
wanted and what Mr Eric Wood wanted in terms of 
Regiments may well be the reason why Mr Salim Essa 
included her in the list of executives to be suspended to 
the extent that Ms Daniels is correct when she says at the 
10 
meeting that she had with Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa at 
Melrose Arch on the 10 March 2015, Mr Salim Essa 
included the Financial Director, Ms Molefe, among those to 
be suspended. 
 
So it is possible that he may have had something to 
do with the inclusion of her name because of that 
experience that Ms Molefe had not cooperated when Mr 
Matjila wanted her to sign that agreement. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I cannot agree with you more, that 
just seems to be the pattern, the picture that is emerging. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:   And, of course, it does not end there 
because their long gain was to eventually replace the FD 
with someone who is agreeable, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 99 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   So this was the – you know, the totality of 
the picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Hence she had to be …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   She had to be included. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because that is the only opportunity they 
would have had of being able remove these people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So if she was not part of that team to be 
suspended initially, they would have had it difficult to try 
10 
and raise some or other idea or method of trying to get rid 
of her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Just so they can put in their own people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because to the extent that they had 
an agenda to loot some money from Eskom, the FD was 
critical. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if the FD does not authorise 
payments, does not sign, then you will not get money and 
20 
they may have remembered that the current FD is the type 
of person who will not agree to the things that we want, 
therefore she cannot be allowed to remain. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She must be added and then they may 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 100 of 167 
 
have shared that with the Minister of Public Enterprises 
hence when she speaks to the board she is the first person 
to include the finance portfolio as one of the areas to be 
investigated and she articulates the principle according to 
one or more of the witnesses who have given evidence 
here.  Although she says she cannot direct the board or 
instruct the board to suspend these executives, she speaks 
in support of a principle that says the executives who lead 
the portfolios that will be investigated, the board should 
consider suspending them.   I cannot tell you to suspend 
10 
them, but I will be around.  I will be around, that is what we 
understand she is says. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then when – if you then accept the 
principle that she introduces namely the executives who 
lead the areas that are going to be investigated, you 
should consider suspending them, board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if finance is going to be 
investigated as well, the FD must also be suspended. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is how it seems the FD comes 
in. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But on what one hears here, the first 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 101 of 167 
 
person to mention the inclusion of the FD is Mr Salim Essa, 
somebody who is not at Eskom, somebody who is not in 
government. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And according to Ms Daniels he presents 
himself to Ms Daniels as adviser to the Minister of Public 
Enterprises.  So then the Minister comes to the board with 
this inclusion of finance as one of the areas to be 
investigated and therefore the FD must also be suspended. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then she gets suspended.  When she 
has left – when the delegation of the board meets with Ms 
Molefe during her suspension she gave evidence here and 
said Mr Romeo Kumalo representing the board started off 
my saying something to the effect that they understood that 
she had written to the board wanting to discuss a 
separation package and then she said here under oath she 
immediately told Mr Kumalo, that is not what I wrote about, 
my letters did not say that.  I wrote to find out the reasons 
for this and that and that and that, that is what I wrote 
20 
about.  I did not write to want to talk about a separation. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then interestingly on her evidence, Mr 
Kumalo, despite hearing that she did not write to invite 
discussions on separation, says to her, according to her, 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 102 of 167 
 
no, you know what, maybe we should talk about separation 
because this investigation could still take a long time and 
that is how they end up talking about separation.   
Ms Klein, who was here yesterday, said to her 
knowledge, the board wanted to keep these executives, 
wanted them to return after the investigation.  So I asked 
her, when you heard Mr Kumalo saying this to Ms Molefe, 
who clearly was not talking about leaving and you see your 
colleague wanting to talk about her leaving, why did you 
not say what are you talking about? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She could not remember why she did not 
say that.  So they end up talking about that.  She ultimately 
after some numerous meetings and exchanges she leaves 
and then, of course, we know that about two months later 
or so, Mr Anoj Singh from Transnet gets brought to take her 
position. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.  Alright, about this meeting, I cannot 
remember – what time was this?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   This meeting, Mr Tsotsi, let me give 
20 
you more information on it.  The Gobodo Forensics has 
flagged the TNA. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Matjila has no authority and there are 
financials – let me see what Ms Molefe says.  She says: 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 103 of 167 
 
“What 
was 
important 
about 
these 
financial 
statements was that we were preparing to go, 
therefore it was very important that the board 
approved the financial statements.  However, what 
happened on the day that the board was meant to 
sign the financial statements, that flagged the issue 
of Mr Matjila.” 
A few days before the board was meant to do so, you call 
her and you say cancel the meeting.  She was able, she 
says, to persuade other board member to have the meeting 
10 
in your absence.  They agreed to meet, they agreed to 
approve the financials and then you called her after that to 
tell her look, I have obtained advice, the meeting was 
irregularly constituted, the resolutions you have taken are 
invalid.  You remember that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, what I recall, Chair, is that at that 
time there was a big problem with security of information at 
the board meaning that there were reported leaks of 
communications coming out of the board and we were – I 
was advised that we should bring in people to come and 
20 
sweep the boardroom and in the interim, if I recall well, 
there was a concern that came from the Minister where she 
was saying that we should not hold board meetings until we 
have cleared the security issue with boardrooms in the 
organisation. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 104 of 167 
 
 
So the boardroom was not available for use at the 
time and I understood that there was – then I said look, we 
cannot have a board meeting until we are ready to have it 
and then I understood that there was a meeting of audit 
and risk to discuss this issue of Matjila’s signing of this 
contract because that matter was being addressed by them.  
Of course, I do not attend audit and risk but 
apparently some of the board members went for that 
meeting and they decided, because they had enough 
members to form a quorum, to make this decision about 
10 
this financing of …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But here is what we need to get to, Mr 
Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Her saying that you say you want to 
cancel because you are receiving pressure from outside to 
cancel the meeting.  We had been thinking that this related 
to the meeting to the 26 February, that it was pressure 
from the President.  When you were here you said she 
would have been polite, you said to the Chairperson.  What 
20 
I said to her is that I am receiving pressure from the 
President. 
 
Then it was explained by her, no, no, no, that is not 
the meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 105 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was about this TNA matter. 
MR TSOTSI:   It was about TN – but I do not – Chair, I do 
not recall receiving pressure from anybody not to have a 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall a meeting where you and 
Ms Molefe were not in agreement that it should be held, 
which was ultimately held without you because she spoke 
to board members and said it is urgent because that is 
what she – that is the evidence she gave.  She said you did 
not want the meeting to be held and you – on that day you 
10 
– I think you had initially agreed – ja, you had initially 
agreed that the meeting be held – I think it was going to be 
held on a Sunday. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I am not mistaken.  And but at a 
certain stage on Sunday, which is when the meeting was to 
take place you – well, either on Sunday or Saturday, maybe 
the day before, you said no – you called her to say no, the 
meeting should not continue and she disagreed.  You said 
you were having a lot of pressure from outside.  I think she 
20 
did not say that you explained what you meant. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she did not know what you meant but 
she ultimately had to talk to other members of the board 
and the meeting was held without you.  Do you not recall 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 106 of 167 
 
anything like that? 
MR TSOTSI:   I recall the fact that that meeting actually 
happened without me.  I was told by my executive in the 
office.  Because I had suggested that the meeting should 
be held over to the next day, which is the Monday because 
of this – to my recollection, the problem was with the 
pouresness of the board, boardrooms and that information 
…[intervenes]   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is because of...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the pouresness of the board. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That information was leaking out of the 
boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the only time to have them swept 
would have been a weekend or at night.  That, Chairman, is 
what I remember.  I could not have said I was getting 
pressure because I was not getting pressure from anybody 
outside.  No, I certainly do not – I did not get any pressure 
from outside.  I would not have cancelled the meeting in 
20 
any case irrespective of that.  Not for that reason, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course you did cancel the one 
for the 26 February. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because of outside pressure. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 107 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, Chair, if we are talking about people 
who 
are 
internal 
to 
government, 
that 
is 
a 
different 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what I am …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   Against people who are external to 
government. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what I am saying is that to the 
extent that Ms Molefe says based on her discussion with 
you, you wanted to cancel the meeting because of outside 
pressure, there could be an argument that with regard to 
10 
the meeting of the 26 February you did cancel a board 
meeting because of outside pressure. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, that is the only point I was 
making. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  But you say your recollection 
as far as the other meeting, the meeting that Ms Molefe 
was talking about, your recollection is that the reason why 
you wanted to cancel the meeting was because you wanted 
20 
that the venue be swept first. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To make sure that there will be no leaks.  
That was the reason. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  To the extent actually I recall that we 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 108 of 167 
 
even had to change the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR TSOTSI:   We actually had to hold a board meeting 
outside of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because of this problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She did say that you subsequently – the 
meeting had to be held again because there was an 
argument that the meeting that they had held, the one you 
did not attend, was unlawful and she says the one that they 
10 
held – I do not know whether it was on Tuesday or Monday, 
but one or two days after the one you did not attend, she 
said you did attend that one. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one may expect that maybe in the 
minutes of that meeting, the one you attended, that there 
may be something that may have been said about why you 
were against …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wanted to cancel this one, those 
20 
minutes should be sought because I think it would be 
surprising if at the beginning of that meeting there was no 
discussion 
of 
why 
that 
meeting 
was 
being 
held 
in 
circumstances where it had been held a day or two before 
it had to be held, so if those minutes are found one might 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 109 of 167 
 
find that there is something said there. 
MR TSOTSI:   It will certainly help Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes thank you Chair, indeed Ms 
Tsholofelo Molefe says Mr Tsotsi that they went to meet 
with the Minister, herself and Mr Matona, and you sent her 
a text message saying I am with the Minister, when in fact 
she was with the Minister together with Mr Matona. 
MR TSOTSI:   Meaning with the Minister meaning what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They were going to complain to the 
10 
Minister that you cancelled the meeting, the meeting which 
is so important the financials have to be approved and it 
was the Minister who said go and have that meeting the 
next day and so they laughed off your SMS which says you 
were with the Minister when in fact you were not.  
MR TSOTSI:   I am not aware of that Chair, I am not aware 
of that I think if either we will have to look and find that 
SMS or something but I am not aware.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But here is the point we want to come 
to Mr Tsotsi we understand that Mr Howa was the CEO of 
20 
TNA.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Molefe and the Chairperson 
stopped her from signing this and I will not say it but I am 
going to go to your affidavit.  That she heard through the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 110 of 167 
 
grapevine much later what the pressure came from.   
MR TSOTSI:   Who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was brought to bear on you - let 
us go to your affidavit page 10.  
MR TSOTSI:   Page 10? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because it was interesting when 
you were saying if we talk about people outside of 
government and you contrasted that to people inside of 
government 
when 
the 
Chairperson 
was 
talking 
about 
pressure.  So I wondered why you will be saying that so 
10 
page 10 you relate the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 10, red or black numbers? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The black numbers Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am sticking to the black numbers.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, page 10.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, from page 9 you talk about your 
interaction with Mr Tony Gupta: 
“Tony Gupta generally asked me for assistance on 
matters they were experiencing some problems with 
20 
Eskom as well as situations where they could 
advance their business interest.  My response 
depended on how much knowledge I had on the 
matter in question if I did I would respond.” 
 6.6: 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 111 of 167 
 
“Tony Gupta explained that they had an interest to 
supply gas to the Western Cape and saw Eskom’s 
open site of gas turbine plant as an anchor tenant 
for that business.  Consequently, they were looking 
for exclusivity and wanted to sign an MOU with 
Eskom.  It transpired that this MOU had already 
been negotiated by another company and at that 
juncture was with the Department of Energy for 
signature by the Minister as was the practice.  I 
explained to him that not only was the MOU agreed 
10 
with another party but it was also beyond the 
jurisdiction of Eskom.  After he discovered who the 
beneficiary of the MOI was he promptly accused me 
of working with barber ’s enemies.” 
And maybe that was a red flag on you Mr Tsotsi but then 
comes the next paragraph.        
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “During that the impulse of the TNA 
contract when the award of the contract by acting 
CEO Colin Matjila was under scrutiny for irregularity 
20 
I was requested by Tony Gupta to make this problem 
go away.  I responded that this I could not do as 
there were processes in place that must take their 
course but for the first time in my encounter with 
him he showed visible signs of anger and frustration 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 112 of 167 
 
as he kept insisting that I was not interested in 
assisting him.” 
Another red flag from you.   
MR TSOTSI:   I would say so yes, right.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could the pressure has come from this, 
Ms Tsholofelo Molefe said through the grapevine she 
understood this to be the position.  So we said we will wait 
for you to confirm it Mr Tsotsi.   
MR TSOTSI:   I actually Chair to be honest I do not recall 
Tony Gupta never asked me to you know to cancel a 
10 
meeting.  I do not – no he has never asked me to cancel a 
meeting.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   But he asked you to take away the 
problem. 
MR TSOTSI:   This was now the problem with Matjila.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now explain to the Chairperson Mr 
Tsotsi because the Gobodo Forensics had flagged that 
issue as a reportable irregularity.    
MR TSOTSI:   Right.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the board in approving the 
20 
financials would have had to include that in their approval.   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so when he is saying to you make 
this problem go away he does not want it to be in the books 
as a reportable irregularity.  
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 113 of 167 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I would imagine that is the case yes 
because Mr Matjila would have to have had – well he was 
on the way to being disciplined for this had he stayed on in 
the company.  I think we traversed this during the 
TNA…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we did.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that was my presentation yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am only pointing out for a different 
reason there are red flags but I am going to explain why 
10 
people are moved from their positions.  
MR TSOTSI:   Alright, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are also flagged.   
MR TSOTSI:   That is right yes I can see that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   And of course it culminated in Cape Town I 
think that was the – it was like I was being warned and I 
was not taking the hint if I can call it that but then in Cape 
Town it became very explicit.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because that is a subsequent 
20 
encounter.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That we have placed you in this 
position.  
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 114 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are not assisting us and we can 
remove you.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I carry on Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, carry on what is your estimate of 
time that you need Mr Tsotsi to be here?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   When I get to putting the versions of 
other witnesses to Mr Tsotsi I think we should go faster 
once we have the grand picture of the reasons leading to 
that.  If we adjourn at, if by one and I think I will not be 
10 
finish by 1 o’clock and we start with Mr Tsotsi at two I 
should be able Mr Tsotsi on my side Chair I think 
personally I will need about 45 minutes.   
MR TSOTSI:   I told Mr Seleka that I would have lunch at 
home today Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR TSOTSI:   I told Mr Seleka that I would have lunch at 
home today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.   
MR TSOTSI:   I see he is talking about 2 o’clock. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now he wants to spoil your plans.  
MR TSOTSI:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And what are your plans with regard to 
the other witness?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mokholo is here. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 115 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is here Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh no we should be able to finish 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the Chairpersons question.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We might have to release her if you are 
going 
to 
take 
as 
long 
as 
I 
think 
you 
will 
with 
Mr…[intervene]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tsotsi.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Tsotsi because we will not be able to sit 
up to normal time today but was she here yesterday as 
well? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No she was not here, yesterday it was 
the company’s secretary.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should we…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that my recollection was that 
because I think was it not that Mr Tsotsi meant to be next 
20 
week, was he meant to be today?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh today.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 116 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Together with her.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was the two witnesses? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was the two witnesses.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I know that she is not supposed to 
be long, is it?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
okay 
no 
that 
is 
alright 
I 
think…[intervene] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But she might have interesting 
information for you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   She might have interesting information 
for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no obviously she would be 
welcome to stay and listen but I think we will not be able to 
get to her because we will not sit the whole day.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should we attend to it at lunchtime 
Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can attend to that at lunchtime.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We will have to arrange another day 
when she can come.  What is your estimate of how many 
hours we need with her? 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 117 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If we do it in the morning Chairperson I 
think you need her for the morning.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your morning is how many hours? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it can be short from ten to – one 
hour to 1 o’clock.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so what we can do I mean if she is 
one hour it is easy to fit her into a morning before the 
witness of that day like we could start at nine if it is one 
hour.  If it is two hours we could bring her in the late 
afternoon after the witness for the day has finished and 
10 
she could come in at four or half past four or five then we 
could sit until six, until seven to try and finish with her.  So 
I think during lunchtime you can attend to that.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay let us continue we will take the 
lunch adjournment at one and then I would like us to – 
after lunch you said you might need how much time with Mr 
Tsotsi?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   About 45 minutes but can I expedite 
that Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you can do 30 minutes that would be 
much better.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we finish about half past two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 118 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we will not be able to go beyond 
three.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright, okay let us continue in 
the meantime.  Mr Tsotsi I do not know about your lunch at 
home.    
MR TSOTSI:   No he is going to have to buy it Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe he should buy you a lunch, yes 
please continue.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  So Mr Tsotsi 
10 
those are in our observations in indicators of what happens 
the underlying reasons for the removal of this executives 
but you are also removed Mr Tsotsi in circumstances where 
the board had agreed with you to do the suspensions.   
Coming to you Mr Tsotsi you testified under re- 
examination something that was new to the Commission 
when your lawyer the attorney re-examined you, you 
mentioned to the Chairperson that you had had a meeting 
with the President Mr Zuma during that conversation or at 
the end of it he told you that if you need to speak to me go 
20 
through Ms Myeni.  Do you recall that?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and Ms Myeni has provided this 
Commission with a statement ah she did not provide the 
Commission we obtained a statement which she submitted 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 119 of 167 
 
at 
the 
parliamentary 
portfolio 
committee 
which 
the 
Commission has shared with you.  In her statement she 
says what you are saying is not true.  You were the one 
contacting her and I am linking this to what you say the 
President told you.  You are the one contacting her 
because you were concerned that the board was about to 
pass a motion of no confidence in you if you did not 
suspend the executives and you needed her advice.   
It was all about you the meeting in Durban was all 
about you the President was not involved.  Why would the 
10 
President be involved and not give a written direction to 
either the Minister or to yourself as a Chairman of the 
board, and that is her version.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And she says it is not true that she 
called you and asked you to go and attend the Durban 
meeting to meet with the President.  She says in effect you 
have been pestering her with calls seeking advice from her 
on Eskom matters and she says if I am not mistaken Mr 
Seleka she says there is a third party that you were also 
using.  She does not disclose the identity of the third party 
20 
but Mr Seleka is right she says the meeting in Durban was 
about you and she says Mr Zuma did not attend that 
meeting.  What do you say to all of these things?        
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I think her version is completely wrong 
it is incorrect.  First of all, I would have no basis for 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 120 of 167 
 
looking for advice from Ms Myeni.  She had nothing to do 
with Eskom and for all intense and purposes she would not 
be in a position to engage with me on issues of Eskom.  So 
my looking for advice from her I think is just untenable.  
Secondly she indeed is the one who called to say that the 
President would like to have an audience with me at the 
President’s residence in Durban and she called me I think 
it would have been either the Thursday or Friday or 
Saturday, no Friday I think it was which would have been 
the 6 t h I think and Mr Linnell in his evidence I listened to 
10 
confirmed to that he was also asked by Dudu, Ms Myeni to 
go and attend a meeting at the Presidency.   
Now she did not disclose to me at the time she 
called 
me what the discussion was about notwithstanding the fact 
that I asked her what is it that the President wants to talk 
about.  Whereas with Mr Linnell apparently she did 
disclose based on the fact that she and Mr Linnell had, had 
a meeting on the 6 t h from what we gathered from his 
evidence.  So all in all Chairman that is a complete 
20 
distortion of the facts and I think it is fair to say that the 
whole exercise of us going to see the President is well 
corroborated by what Mr Linnell also had to say.  So I do 
not know where Ms Myeni gets all of this understanding 
about what happened.  But from my perspective it certainly 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 121 of 167 
 
is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She says that the reason she brought Mr 
Linnell to the Durban meeting is because the assistance 
you needed from her was of a legal nature.  You needed a 
lawyer to deal with the problems relating to you at Eskom 
particularly that your board wanted to remove you.  At that 
stage had there been any indication from any board 
member or from anybody that the board wanted to remove 
you as far as you know.             
MR TSOTSI:   No Chair there was no such indication 
10 
whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   I had never heard of that and I do not know 
of anybody who was aware of it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course Mr Linnell also made it 
quite clear when he gave evidence here that he was 
disputing Ms Myeni’s version that the Durban meeting was 
about you.  He also said that is not true.   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that is the version that emerges 
20 
from Ms Myeni’s statement that she seems to have 
submitted to parliament.  Yes, Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi on this 
vote of no confidence against you, you say you know of no 
one who knows of that but remember you asked Mr Linnell 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 122 of 167 
 
to give you or your lawyers a statement or affidavit which 
he did when you were charged by the board.  
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You would have seen that statement 
then and now it speculates at the end of it that he learned 
through rumours and I am asking you this because you are 
here you can clarify to the Chairperson that the board – 
when the meeting of the 26 t h of February was cancelled by 
the Minister it was because the board apparently wanted to 
discuss your removal.   
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I recall that appearing in Nick’s 
statement and I think he and I talked a bit about that.  
Obviously at the time when Dudu Myeni alleges that I was 
trying to avoid myself being – a motion of no confidence 
being passed on me.  At that time, we should have been 
before the 26 t h of February.  There was no basis upon 
which I could even speculate that there could have been a 
motion of no confidence against me on the 26 t h.   
So subsequent to that when Nick told me about this 
alleged rumour or information that in fact the board was 
20 
intending to pass a motion of no confidence in me on that 
day the 26 t h of February.  I then started to think possibly 
that was the reason why the meeting was stopped because 
somebody obvious it would have to have been the Minister 
because she is the one who wanted the meeting to be 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 123 of 167 
 
stopped would have then known that I would have had to 
face a vote of no confidence from board members.  So if 
anybody should have information should this be the case it 
would be the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka I missed something 
what did – is it a statement by Mr Linnell which included 
something along the lines that the board wanted to remove 
Mr Tsotsi.       
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a statement he submitted at the 
time when Mr Tsotsi was subjected to this disciplinary 
10 
charges but he speculates it on the end of that statement 
Chair.  Due to time constraints we never got to it.  He said 
he heard after, through rumours that the meeting of the 
26 t h of February 2015 was cancelled because the board 
wanted to have Mr Tsotsi, to vote on Mr Tsotsi’s no 
confidence, to pass a vote of no confidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well okay no that is fine.  I know that 
even in your removal your being charged later in March 
seems something very strange to me but it would be even 
stranger if before the first meeting of the new board if we 
20 
leave out the induction if before the first meeting of the 
new board new members wanted to remove the Chairperson 
who had been part of the previous board.  It would really 
show that there is really something very strange that was 
going on.  I mean even before the first meeting of the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 124 of 167 
 
board they are talking about removing the Chairperson who 
had been part of the previous board but maybe there were 
those plans already in place but it would be strange if the 
former President knew about those rumours or rather it 
would be strange if the reason why the former President 
wanted that meeting cancelled because of he had heard 
about those rumours it would be strange that he would not 
tell you.      
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one would have thought that he 
10 
would rather have left that issue to the board and to you 
how you handle it and not interfere.  If the Minister knew 
anything about it, it would be strange if even after she 
never said anything and when one reads the affidavit of the 
acting DG who called you about the cancellation of the 
meeting her evidence and her affidavit suggest that you 
were very opposed to the cancellation you wanted reasons 
why and she says she could not give you reasons and she 
did not want to tell you that it was the President who 
wanted the meeting cancelled but ultimately she had to say 
20 
that that is what she says in her affidavit.   
Now if you were aware that the meeting was going 
to 
be used by the board or some board members to seek to 
remove you one would have thought that you would not 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 125 of 167 
 
have been so opposed to a cancelation of that meeting 
particularly if maybe you were concerned that they could 
succeed but the way she says you were insisting wanting 
reasons that is not consistent with somebody who knew 
anything along the lines that if that meeting was not 
cancelled there would be a vote of no confidence in you.       
MR TSOTSI:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair I thought I would 
put that very question to Mr Tsotsi.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I think you were doing the right 
thing to put these things to him.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I saw Mr Linnell said it was a 
rumour he heard after the fact.  Mr Tsotsi this is what Ms 
Dudu Myeni says further she says: 
“Why should Mr Tsotsi agree to such instructions 
she says a verbal instruction at the level of the 
President it should be in writing.  What was being 
20 
hidden here does this mean that Mr Tsotsi became a 
Chairman of the board without understanding the 
roles and responsibilities of a Chairman or at least 
a director.  Can we simply believe that anyone at 
his position could simply be instructed while having 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 126 of 167 
 
no role in any entity such as Eskom.  Why did Mr 
Tsotsi be naive and get misled.” 
What do you say Mr Tsotsi?     
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I have no answer to that I mean I think 
she is off the wall completely if I can use that expression.  
So I really cannot even begin to address that.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   But her comment may still be valid or 
questions may still be valid in the context of the meeting 
you actually had.   
MR TSOTSI:   Explain? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you agree you had a meeting with 
the President and Ms Myeni they told you go suspend the 
three executives.  Go start an enquiry.  It was not in 
writing, why were you naive, why were you misled, why did 
you accept such instructions as a Chairperson of the 
board.   
MR TSOTSI:   Chair what I said in my affidavit is that I did 
not accept any instructions from the President because I do 
not take instructions from him, but I had a relationship with 
him but what I needed to do was to test the idea with the 
20 
board with whom I have a relationship and that the board 
did the right thing by establishing the opinion of the 
shareholder.  So the process through which we went to 
deal with this matter was very different from what she is in 
her mind alleging that I was naive and that I took 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 127 of 167 
 
instructions from the President, no that was not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think your evidence last time is 
consistent with what you are saying in the sense that you 
never said that at the meeting in Durban you were 
instructed to go and do anything, yes.  Indeed, you actually 
said towards the end the President, the former President 
said you go and test this idea with the board.     
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he said he would talk to the Minister 
that you made clear that the evidence of Mr Linnell also 
10 
does not reflect that there was an instruction that was 
given to you whether by Mr Zuma or Ms Myeni.  What one 
gets the picture that emerges is that Ms Myeni and 
probably Mr Zuma had an idea that there should be in 
enquiry 
into 
the 
affairs 
of 
Eskom 
and 
that 
certain 
executives should be suspended. 
Whether that idea emanated from one of them or 
both 
or whether it was an idea that originated from somebody 
else we do not know but that is the idea that was the 
20 
subject of the Durban meeting and in that Durban meeting 
they put these proposals these ideas and they were 
discussed.  You said that you were not opposed to the idea 
of an enquiry because independently of them you had 
thought that an enquiry might be a good idea but you said 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 128 of 167 
 
you were opposed initially at least you opposed to the 
suspension of executives and I think Mr Linnell confirmed 
that at the Durban meeting you were certainly initially 
opposed to the idea of the suspension of the executives.  
But certainly the evidence does not suggest that you were 
instructed but you agreed to take these ideas to the board.  
Is that right?         
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair I might also say that Mr Linnell 
10 
did say that the President said go do it, well go do it but 
that is Mr Linnell who said that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Tsotsi I am putting this to you 
so that Ms Myeni does not say but they did not tell him 
about my statement.  Do you understand?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so I am not necessarily saying 
that I agree with what she is saying I am just saying you 
have a chance to respond to it.     
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what you are also doing is 
testing his own evidence.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he denies Ms Myeni’s version you 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 129 of 167 
 
are testing his own evidence because in the end I want to 
see who is telling the truth.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is right that you should test his 
evidence 
just 
as 
you 
will 
test 
Ms 
Myeni’s 
evidence…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When she comes here…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you or somebody else from the legal 
10 
team but I think we must take the lunch adjournment now.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the lunch adjournment and 
we will resume at five past two.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi I read from 
20 
Ms Myeni’s statement just before the adjournment and 
having had a look again at what she is saying it seems to me 
that she is essentially saying to the Chairperson about the – 
meaning you – I am now referring to you the Chairperson at 
the time that the Chairperson did not understand his 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 130 of 167 
 
fiduciary duties. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not the culprit Mr Tsotsi.  You are 
not the culprit somebody else is the culprit.   
MR TSOTSI:  I thought it was mine. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Remember 
her 
allegations 
about 
instructions you – why would you take instructions like that 
and seems to suggest that now this is what I am saying to 
you.  Seems to suggest that you failed in your fiduciary 
duties. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I think we dealt with this a bit earlier 
before the break when I was saying that my interpretation is 
that I was not taking instructions from the President or 
anyone else for that matter.  I was simply wanting to test this 
idea that he had with the board which is precisely what I did.  
So I disagree with assertion that I do not understand my 
fiduciary duty. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  In the meeting of the 9 t h Mr Tsotsi 
you say – you say to the board: 
“I have been summoned by the President.” 
20 
Now this is from the transcript of that meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“I have been summoned by the President.” 
And you say three times. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 131 of 167 
 
“And the most recently was yesterday.” 
Now this is the 9t h you are referring yesterday being the 8t h 
March. 
“Where he has finally made up his mind 
about what he wants to do about the situation 
of Eskom.  Both Minister and I have been 
summoned by the President separately on 
several occasions where he has expressed 
his view about the situation that finds – that 
he finds at Eskom.” 
10 
These are the min – the transcript of the audio recording of 9 
March 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I was intrigued by summoned three 
times.  You and the Minister summoned separately the 
President because we did not see – we do not see that in 
your affidavit.  Are you able to explain to the Chairperson 
why? 
MR TSOTSI:  Why that statement is not in my affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No why [00:03:14] one three times so and 
20 
whether in fact you had been summoned three times by the 
President? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chairman this goes back quite a long way 
even during Mr Gigaba’s term of office.  On the occasions 
when the President wanted to understand what is happening 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 132 of 167 
 
at Eskom he would ask to see the Minister and the Minister 
would ask me to accompany him.  And this happened a few 
times over a period of maybe two – over two years maybe.  
So you know it is sort of intermittently there was no 
particular pattern.  There is just the last one being when on 
this occasion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So is your explanation to the Chairperson 
that in respect of this particular issue the enquiry and the 
stepping aside of the executives the summoning of you by 
the President happened three times. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  No, no, no.  I was meaning that the concern 
that as – President has expressed about the situation at 
Eskom had been raised with by him in my presence and in 
the presence of the Minister as well before.  But there was 
no discussion about an enquiry.  There was no discussion 
about suspensions or anything like that.  It was just you 
know an opportunity for him to express his concern about the 
situation in the company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know that he had in fact spoken 
to the Minster separately about the situation at Eskom? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  No I did not know.  I did not mean in all those 
occasions that he had spoken separately to the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry just repeat that.  You did… 
MR TSOTSI:  I did not mean – like I said some of the 
occasions I was with the Minister when the President raised 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 133 of 167 
 
the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But let us confine ourselves to the issue 
here. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because you say the last of the three 
occasions was last night. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am sure you would have met with the 
President many other times not only three times at the time 
you were the Chairperson of the board. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But it seems to me that the statement is 
specific to the issue you are bringing to the board.  I am 
bringing this before you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He is now made up his mind about what 
he wants to do.  That is what you added. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So was this raised with you on three 
different occasions and you say the Minister has also been 
20 
summoned separately by the President.  You are referring to 
this enquiry. 
MR TSOTSI:  No.  No I am referring to the concern that the 
President had about the performance of the business.  When 
I say he has finally made up his mind I am referring now to 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 134 of 167 
 
the – to the attitude he has taken of an enquiry and of a – 
you know the action that he is talking about there. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Could 
you 
please 
address 
the 
Chairperson because what it happens here is the impression 
again it brings back to memory that impression that there 
seems to be a consistent effort by outside – somebody 
outside of Eskom whether even in government to control 
what the board in fact is supposed to be doing.  They 
controlling 
the 
board 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
board 
itself 
controlling the affairs of Eskom.  Your comment on that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair that could be the case.  I – it is quite 
common that you hear from you know the shareholder 
representative the things that they think should happen in 
the organisation.  It happens quite a lot with the SOE’s 
anyway.  And I think this is something that I notice that you 
are very concerned with because you know the need for the 
board to be independent but there is undoubtedly quite a lot 
of interference may construed as political interference.  But 
it happens.  Yes it happens quite a lot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So is that an acknowledgement that it 
happened 
here 
when 
we 
talk 
about 
the 
enquiry, 
the 
suspension of the executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   It happens yes.  It is in essence a reflection of 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 135 of 167 
 
– of political authority you know engaging. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Bringing its muscles to bear on you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And SOE? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually I think there are many people who 
believe that the failures that we see in a number of SOE’s 
are precisely because government or politicians continue to 
interfere in how those SOE’s are run.    
 
If the politicians were to leave the boards and 
10 
managers of SOE’s to do their job properly and if they were 
to make sure that that people who are appointed to the 
boards and the people who are appointed to senior positions 
in the SOE’s are people who have the expertise and the 
independence with integrity and leave them alone to run 
these as businesses as they would run a business.  There – 
a lot of these SOE’s would perform very well. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman that is the SOE the Eskom I found in 
1995 when I joined the company.  The company was making 
its own decisions and – and simply had a you know a normal 
20 
shareholder liaison relationship.  But even the Chairman 
made very – made it very clear that he will not broker any 
interference by government. And I mean for those early years 
since the dawn of democracy certainly as far as Eskom is 
concerned that was the case of the company was extremely 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 136 of 167 
 
efficient.  It was a world class institution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well you know I think you may have 
been one of the witnesses but there have been other 
witnesses who made it quite clear that in the first years of 
our democracy and for quite some time after that Eskom was 
the envy of other similar entities worldwide.  It was held in 
high regard that is no more. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and a lot of people will say it is 
because politicians interfere in the affairs of these SOE’s 
10 
and largely they do not allow the managers and the boards to 
run the businesses of the SOE’s the way they consider 
appropriate and of course getting the people with the right 
skills, right experience, integrity and independence is critical 
you know.  And they are all – so many of the SOE’s are all on 
the verge of going under. 
MR TSOTSI:    Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know you talk of SAA, you talk of 
Eskom, you talk of PRASA, you talk of Denel it is – I mean 
even Denel I heard evidence that once upon a time Denel 
20 
was also highly regarded internationally.  Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi a little bit on 
that meeting and I am moving on.  There is Mr Jabu 
Maswanganyi Mr Linnell has touched on and on an aspect 
which we were not aware of before.  That he amongst other 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 137 of 167 
 
things he assisted in drafted the letter that you wrote to the 
Minister saying dissolve this board.   
 
He and you know actively in that meeting according 
to Mr Linnell participated actively providing documentation to 
Mr Linnell in regard to issues at Eskom.  But all Mr Linnell 
says unverified, unidentified sources.  But he is actively 
involved.  According to Mr Linnell Jabu Maswanganyi may 
have been the one who told him and I am giving you all 
distinctive view in not – in no particular order.  But I want to 
show you the level of his involvement that he is not a once 
10 
off figure according to Mr Linnell. 
 
He might be the person who told Mr Linnell when Mr 
Linnell received an email saying you are no longer needed 
on the 17 March.  That is six days after the 11 March some 
eight days after your meeting at the President’s place on the 
8 March. 
 
So it is fairly soon – fairly close to the beginning of 
the events.  That when he – after he received that email he 
connected the email to the meeting he said he learned took 
place on the 16 March 2015, the evening of the 15 March.  A 
20 
secret meeting between some board members and some 
suspended executives.  This first deal with Jabu – Mr Jabu 
Maswanganyi.  Here he has a hand in the drafting a letter 
that ultimately you put together to the Minister.  And this 
meeting of 16 March is referenced in that letter.  We shown 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 138 of 167 
 
you that letter.  Who is Mr Maswanganyi? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I must first of all indicate that the issue 
of my not recalling Jabu really bothered me for quite a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is maybe Mr Seleka you started too far 
back because Mr Tsotsi did testify about Mr Maswanganyi 
last time.  He said he knows him quite well but he said he did 
not remember him as having been present at the Durban 
meeting and he said he thought he would have remember if 
Mr Maswanganyi had been in that meeting.  That was your 
evidence.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Exactly that Chair, exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so – so I am just saying you started 
too far back.  You should start somewhere else. 
MR TSOTSI:  No but it is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  It is fine because there is some – a point I wish 
to make around exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Like I said it bothered me that I could not 
remember him.  So I decided look why do I not just ask Jabu 
20 
if he was there.  So I called him and I asked him and he said 
yes he had been at the Presidency at the same time we were 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR TSOTSI:  For whatever he had been there for.  And as I 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 139 of 167 
 
said to him look it is funny that I did not remember you being 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did he admit that he was at the 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:  Now what he says is he had an encounter with 
Nick and myself in the anti-room so to speak in the – waited 
to get… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the passages or what? 
MR TSOTSI:  To get into the meeting but he says he did not 
participate in the meeting with the President.  Look this is 
10 
what I recollect.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you know Mr Linnell said something 
which you did not say not necessarily because you – you 
would have sought to conciliate but it is something that I was 
going to ask you.  Mr Linnell said in effect there were two 
meeting in Durban.  He said the first meeting did not involve 
the former President.  He said it was himself, Ms Dudu 
Myeni, yourself and he said and Mr Maswanganyi.  And he 
said he indicated what Mr Maswanganyi’s contribution was 
mainly with documents and so on at that meeting.  But he 
20 
said later on you were asked to move to another meeting 
which is the room where the President joined you.  And he 
said you must have waited for about five minutes in that 
other room and then the former President came in.  I asked 
him whether everybody who had been in the earlier meeting 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 140 of 167 
 
moved to the other room and I think he said yes.  I do not 
know if he makes – he – Ja I remember I asked him whether 
Ms Myeni’s son Thalente had also moved and he said yes if I 
recall correctly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think we asked him about Mr 
Maswanganhi as well and I think he said yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So  
1. I want to check with you whether you remember the 
10 
position as having been that you – there were like two 
meetings or not? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair that is definitely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  The session before we met the President 
where Dudu was – Dudu Myeni was outlining the – outlining 
the issues.  And then we moved into the sitting room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Another room ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes where then the President came in and 
joined the meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so I just – I just wanted to… 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Indicate that but also to say that according 
to Mr Linnell everybody who had been in the first meeting 
moved into the second meeting ja.  Ja. But you are right it is 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 141 of 167 
 
funny that you would not remember. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes it is strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having seen somebody that you know so 
well. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  Very strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he denies having taken part in the 
meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja he said no he did not participate in the main 
meeting with the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he denied participating in the meeting 
10 
where the President was sitting? 
MR TSOTSI:  Where the President was present yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the other meeting… 
MR TSOTSI:  But yes he was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he admits that he was there? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR TSOTSI:  No he admits he was in that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may well be that Mr Linnell might 
not have been emphatic about his presence in the second 
20 
meeting I am not sure.  But at least if Mr Maswanganyi 
admits that he was – he took part in the first meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That resolves quite something. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 142 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually it might not matter whether he 
was… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the second meeting or not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  My recollection of Mr Linnell is that 
he did not speak in the meeting with the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you are right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That he did not speak. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That Mr Jabu Maswanganyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But in the end it.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It does not matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether he spoke or he did not speak or I 
think what is important is that he admits having been in the 
first meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That resolves quite a large portion. 
MR TSOTSI:  Maybe I was very uptight Chairman so maybe I 
20 
did not notice he was in the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR TSOTSI:  I said maybe I was very uptight and I did not 
notice that he was in the second meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 143 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, no Mr Linnell did say you were very 
uncomfortable in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja Mr Linnell said that.  He said – he 
said you seemed an unwilling participant in the meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But of course according to Ms Myeni 
one would not have expected you to look like an unwilling 
participant because this was a meeting that you had wanted.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Myeni of course 
also says her son was not there. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair the son was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Tsotsi I have a few points then I am 
over.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got anything to say about Ms 
Myeni’s 
version 
that 
there 
was 
no 
meeting 
with 
the 
President? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman that is blatantly false.  That is 
putting it as mildly as I can – as I can.  It is blatantly false.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  There is no particular 
order to this point Ms Tsotsi.  These are just versions we get 
from the commission – from the other witnesses.  We 
understand from the other witnesses I think Doctor Ngubane 
in particular to some extent Ms Venete Klein that you had 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 144 of 167 
 
made when you presented the report you made allegations of 
misdemeanours against the four executives.  So you told the 
board these people must be suspended and these are the 
reasons why they should be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your reason – the reasons you gave in 
regard to each one and I think at least the first three.  The 
reasons you gave related to allegations of misconduct. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman I do not – what happened was that 
Nick and in preparing whatever he wanted to present 
apparently had somehow got hold of some information 
10 
regarding whatever might have been going on with each of 
those people.  I am not sure exactly where he got it from I 
really did not even ask him.  And what happened was when I 
was making the point I was saying Nick had said to me there 
are some issues around these people.  And I said, well look 
if there are issues around them you can raise them it is not 
an issue.  But the understanding is that these people are not 
in the position we had wanted to put them in because of 
them being having committed some misdemeanours.  That is 
not part of what the intention is.  So I – I think at some point 
20 
I gave over to Nick and I think Nick must have said 
something about those things.  I do not believe that I – or if I 
said them myself it would have been stuff which I got from 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see that is an important issue that 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 145 of 167 
 
you need to deal with.  Because it starts off with I think both 
Doctor – with Doctor Ngubane and maybe Ms Klein as well 
saying that actually you were pushing for the suspension of 
the executives.  I hope I am not misrepresenting anything.  
But I am – that is my recollection certainly from Doctor 
Ngubane’s evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they – they were questioning you.  I 
do not know whether it is on his version that is what 
happened on the 9t h or but at a certain stage either on the 
10 
9t h or the 11t h I think he portrays you as somebody who was 
pushing for the suspensions and my impression was that 
bringing in these allegations of misconduct against them may 
have been misunderstood by them as your way of pushing for 
their suspension.  Now that is strange when one has regard 
to the fact that you said when you gave evidence here at the 
Durban meeting when this idea of the suspension of 
executives was raised you were opposed to it at least 
initially.  You were opposed to it.  And Mr Linnell has 
confirmed that you were opposed to it – the idea of the 
20 
suspension of the executives.  So – so that is 1.  But then 
secondly I would say it would be as strange as to why Mr 
Linnell would go and seek to dig allegations of misconduct 
against these executives in circumstances where he knew 
that at the Durban meeting everybody was agreed that it – 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 146 of 167 
 
the suspensions were not going to be based on allegations of 
misconduct.   
 
Even if he did that for a reason that you – we do not 
know it seems to me that it would be – that is strange if you 
even entertained them whatever they are particularly coming 
from him.  He is not an Eskom person.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is being brought from outside.  He was 
at the Durban meeting where it was made quite clear that 
wrongdoing is not the basis of the suspension of these 
10 
executives. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why – why is he going digging up 
things?  I would have expected your attitude when he – if he 
told you about such to say, but that has got nothing to do 
with the suspensions you know that so why are you bringing 
them in?  What is the relevance? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now if he told you about them and you 
go – you went ahead and entertained them and shared these 
allegations with the board that seems strange to me to say, 
why 
are 
you 
doing that because 
you 
know that the 
suspensions are not based on allegations of wrongdoing so 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 147 of 167 
 
what is the relevance of these allega – of telling the board 
about these allegations?  
MR TSOTSI:  Yes that is correct Chairman.  That is why I am 
– I am a little surprised because first of all in – on the 
meeting of the 9t h there was no discussion about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Suspensions. 
MR TSOTSI:  Suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  May – I think I am – I think some 
witnesses have or maybe – I think Mr Linnell might have … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No it is Doctor Ngubane.  It was Doctor 
10 
Ngubane Chair who said Mr Tsotsi mentioned misdemeanours 
and suspensions on the 9t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I sought to – I sought to put.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry I sought to put to him that the 
audio does not reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not want to help you Mr Tsotsi but 
that is the recording of the meeting does not reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman it also to me smacks of some agenda 
of some kind.  I mean why would someone say that I 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 148 of 167 
 
discussed these issues on the 9t h when you know there is 
evidence that I never raised any issue about suspensions on 
the 9t h. And I think the meeting of the 11t h any such 
discussion about whatever the people were supposed to have 
done would only have come out I think at the time when Nick 
was being introduced.  I cannot remember very well.  That 
could have – but that discussion did not persist in the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Because that was not the purpose of what we 
10 
wanted to do.  I do not even remember whether Nick actually 
stated that the – as a result I do not even remember some of 
these – so called misdemeanours are.  So I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think last time you did testify about them 
if I am not mistaken.  Mr Koko, I know what the allegations – 
or was it another witness? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was trying to recall ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no, no.  Ja ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Try to recall what were the allegations.  
And Chair, they... one allegation against Mr Koko, Mr Tsotsi 
was in relation to sexual escapade captured in a CCTV at the 
Arcade Parking Lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 149 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one regarding the FD, the Financial 
Director.  It was about her 
allegedly interfering with 
tenderers during the bidding process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, or talking to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that... no, that was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or talking to service providers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To... to...  
MR TSOTSI:   But that was put to bed as far as I know.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
she 
has 
testified 
that 
you 
investigated that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She asked that it be investigated.  You 
investigated and you came back to her and said that the 
allegations were baseless and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Dr Ngubane, I think said, mentioned 
that that was the allegation against her ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...as mentioned at the meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I am just a little bit mystified as to how it is 
that I could have been pushing for the suspensions to 
happen when I was in effect opposed to the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
Mr 
Seleka 
you 
might 
have 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 150 of 167 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I assist? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...refresh our memory of our Dr Ngubane 
said.  But I seem to think that he said it was... Mr Tsotsi was 
pushing for the suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I got the impression that he was 
saying, some of the board members were not happy with 
that.  I think that part, at least where which he says was on 
the 9t h.  I think, certainly, on the 9t h, he says Mr Tsotsi was 
10 
pushing for the suspensions and the board members were 
against this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Against it.  Yes.  Your recollection is 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is exactly what Dr Ngubane 
testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what you have said is the audio 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...recordings of the meeting of the 9t h 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...does not support what Dr Ngubane say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 151 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and so you put that to him when he 
comes back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought that, I may be mistaken, but 
I thought that when I read the transcript of the meetings of 
the 11t h, I thought I did also come across parts which 
seemed...  
 
You know, sometimes you cannot be sure who is talking 
10 
but I thought I came across parts which seemed to reflect 
that the chairperson, who I thought would have been you, 
was talking to these... talking about these allegations of 
misdemeanours and so on.  Mr Seleka, is my memory...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, you will recall.  There is one 
where there is a to-and-fro about whether the FD should be 
suspended.  And Mr Tsotsi says:  No, the FD’s position is 
different.  Somebody says:  It not different, chair.   
 
And they are asking but what is wrong with the FD?  It 
was a male voice which we are seeking to identify there, 
20 
which says, the FD... there is an allegation that the FD met 
with bidders during the tender process.   
 
And Mr Tsotsi says:  No, was that reported?  Another 
person also ask.  Mr Baloyi.  In fact, Mr Baloyi asked 
whether was that reported.  You did ask the same similar 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 152 of 167 
 
question.   
 
And I cannot recall what was the answer going forward.  
That is the only time, according to my recollection, I see 
somebody seeking to motivate the suspensions of the 
executives along the lines of misdemeanour allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So your recollection is.  Mr Tsotsi 
does not get involved in talking about the allegations of 
misconduct during the meetings of the 11t h? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the extent that anybody might have 
10 
mentioned, then it would not have been him on your 
recollection? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My recollection, it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  So I may be 
mistaken here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it maybe it might have been Mr 
Linnell in one or other meeting because I do know that there 
20 
is somewhere where somebody mentioned and talks about 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And at the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or unless I am... I think I am talking about 
what was in the transcripts but actually it was in the 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 153 of 167 
 
memoranda. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or 
correspondence that 
Mr Linnell 
prepared. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was... which had that was... that 
part, also I remember, his correspondence whether it was a 
memo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or he raises a document ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A document where he goes to town about 
these allegations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Chair, he does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He certainly does.  And I think he alludes 
to them when he is with the P&G.  He alludes to them but 
does not specifically deal with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also, it is just that one, you know, a 
witness 
comes 
and 
goes. 
 
You 
remember 
afterwards 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what you probably should have asked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because one should have asked where he 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 154 of 167 
 
was getting it from. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  I think I did ask the question how 
the charges came about.  My impression is, he was relying 
on what was given to him by Mr Jabu Maswanganyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Those unverified and unidentified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also it is strange.  Why would you 
want to take those allegations and bring them to the board 
meeting, bring them to Mr Tsotsi when he knew that the 
meetings had nothing to do with allegations of wrongdoing 
10 
and the suspensions had nothing to do with them?  Why was 
he doing that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well that’s correct, because his 
rationale, remember, his principle was.  He considered that:   
“I would consider key-areas of business that the 
inquiry would focus on and also whether anyone in 
particular in those areas may have a propensity to 
interfere or have such a presence as to create 
perception of potentially impeding the investigation.” 
 
And he was saying: 
20 
“As a matter of life...” 
 
And he was saying to you, Chair. 
“It does not happen in life.  When you have these 
people 
then 
they 
will 
interfere 
with 
the 
subordinates.” 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 155 of 167 
 
 
And he gave the analogy of two bankers who robbed the 
bank and if the police find the other one, you know it can 
only be your colleague.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So his rational is one thing, but he 
actually went and did is another.  But then the board still 
decided, this is not about wrongdoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, h’m.  Okay so maybe he sought 
to rely on those to say these people have a propensity to 
misconduct themselves.  So there is a good chance they will 
10 
interfere with the investigation.  [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When Ms Klein said there was no shred 
of 
evidence 
that 
they 
had 
interfered 
with 
previous 
investigation.  But Mr Tsotsi, that is what has been said 
about you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you motivated.  You gave 
allegations of misdemeanours as the reasons why.  And they 
20 
say that four, on the 9t h of March, that you said that the four 
should be suspended.   
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, one of the things that would have 
been, I think, disrespectful to those executives who are 
concerned, would have been to talk about them being 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 156 of 167 
 
suspended in their presence in a meeting.  So, yes.   
 
Quite honestly, they were sitting there.  Mr Matona was 
sitting there.  Ms Molefe was sitting there.  How on earth 
would you in a meeting of that nature, you know, start 
embarrassing them with suspensions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say:  I just have just come from Durban 
and the President said you must have an inquiry and these 
must be suspended. 
MR TSOTSI:   Exactly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MR TSOTSI:   It does not... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Molefe did say exactly this 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Denying.  Because we have also put it to 
her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you, Mr Tsotsi, say to them there is 
an inquiry and the suspension of the executives?  He said 
20 
the suspensions was not mentioned. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, of course. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And she referred us to the proposal that 
had their names ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the memorandum.  Ja. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 157 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And she was saying:  How could we sign 
a resolution to suspend ourselves? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, absolutely.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Mr Tsotsi ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are ten to three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am going... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, Mr Baloyi was opposed 
10 
throughout, to these suspensions. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he asked about the urgency.  What 
is the urgency about?  Where is the report you are talking 
about or background information or background research?   
 
And in regard to the issue of the urgency.  You are 
having the ordeal.  Or shall I say?  Giving you the tongue 
lash.   
 
And you were saying:  If you do not realise the urgency 
of this matter, then you are not supposed to be a member of 
20 
the board.  Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I recall this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he was opposed to this, right to the 
very end of the P&G meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 158 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he still requested that report. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Dr Ngubane also says to him 
dismissively:  We do not have this report.  There may be a 
report existing somewhere but that is not our report.  We 
have taken the decision.  It is our own decision.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I am referring to it because I think 
he was red-flagged. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think he was red-flagged. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next thing is Mr Tsotsi.  You are 
already out but he raises concerns.  He testified here to 
some extent, not in so many words, but he has testified 
about the T-Systems contract.  You may not know about it.   
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The T-Systems contract which kept on 
being extended and extended.  He deals with it in his 
affidavit and he was querying why a contract of an IT was... 
20 
the IT contract had reached some... what was the amount?   
MR TSOTSI:   R 5 billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, R 5.2 billion.  When it did not... the 
Audit and Risk had made queries on it, negotiations on the 
price.  The issue could be dealt with by the Executive 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 159 of 167 
 
Committee but the Board Tender Committee decided to... 
decide on the matter and that Board Tender Committee was 
chaired by Dr Ngubane.  But you would not know about that 
because ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Not that specific aspect but I do know about 
the very dubious issue that occurred around the T-Systems 
contract.  Chair, this contract came up for renewal and 
everybody who put in their bids were interested including T-
Systems.   
 
And at some point, I get to hear that T-Systems did not 
10 
qualify.  So they were taken out of the running.  And I believe 
- this is what I am being told now because I would not get 
involved in these issues.   
 
But I was told that the contract and the bidders who are 
under consideration for the contract, there were some 
negotiations that were going on already to see which one 
should be selected.   
 
All of a sudden, the whole process collapsed.  And a 
proposal came to say:  Look, we have to start this thing from 
scratch but in the meantime, let us extend T-Systems 
20 
contract.   
 
Now this is... by the time we were dealing with what Mr 
Seleka is talking about, it is nine months since the beginning 
of the very appointment of T-Systems.   
 
So that whole IT contract had some very funny behaviour 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 160 of 167 
 
that was associated with it.  I just thought I mention that 
because I was aware of it from the onset. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he says that when he inquired... 
made inquiries with Dr Ngubane, Dr Ngubane shouted at him.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Chairman, I must apologise how it 
related to Norman.  He is a very pleasant person.  I guess I 
got very impatient with him for whatever reason.   
 
But it is true what the evidence leader is saying about 
him, having been opposed to the contract(?).   
 
Particularly the concern about the pace at which things 
10 
were happening.  And I have a great deal of sympathy for 
that view because I had a particular problem myself with the 
suspensions.   
 
So I understood where, you know, where he was coming 
from in terms of his objections.  And when I spoke to him 
much later, after he himself had been removed from Eskom. 
 
He recalled that his objection to the process that was 
then going on at the time, he believes must have had 
something to do with the way the board turned on him.  So, 
yes I do recall that.  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because both the way in which the 
board acted towards you to remove you and the way in which 
it seemed to have acted towards him to remove him, is 
strange.  It is... there is a level of intolerance that is unlike 
unheard of.   
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 161 of 167 
 
 
You have just begun to work with everybody because you 
are new.  Let us assume that the chairperson has made some 
mistake but to then really say let us charge him.   
 
And of course, would want and look at charges that were 
used, remove him.  Then here is another board member.  
Something has happened and suddenly he must be removed.  
He gets removed.   
 
It is all very suspicious to say the least.  It is not the 
way you would expect board members to behave.   
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, things that seemed to take a 
10 
completely turn after that alleged meeting of this... that night 
meeting or the secret meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Of the 16t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And my subsequent letter in regard to that 
meeting with the minister, I think must have unsettled some 
people and they acted very quickly to turn the gun on me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is all very strange.  All very, very 
strange.  It is not the way you would expect a board to act.  I 
20 
think that is not even the way you would expect a political 
party to act, politicians to act.  The speed with which they 
sought to remove the chairperson.  The speed with which 
they sought to remove Mr Baloyi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 162 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is very strange.  It calls for some 
explanation to say:  What was going on?   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Tsotsi.  Tell the Chairperson a 
little about this meeting.  We have heard about deceit(?) in 
Mr Linnell’s affidavit that there was a secret meeting.  He 
linked his emails, the email he received about you are no 
longer needed.   
 
And we have asked him who were some board members?  
Who were some suspended executives who met that evening 
10 
in a secret meeting on the 16t h of March 2015?  Can you 
enlighten us on that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I myself at the time when this 
meeting took place, I had no idea until the following day 
where upon I was told by Nick that there had been this 
meeting.   
 
And that he believes that this meeting was in fact a 
decision to terminate his involvement in the process and that 
it was working against the decisions that the board had 
taken.   
20 
 
So he then volunteered to draft a letter to the minister 
from me indicating that, you know, there was this allegation 
of this meeting and this would have been in contravention of 
what the board had wanted to do and that there was 
...[intervenes]

Page 163 of 167 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, may I... sorry, may I 
intervene? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know who were the “some” board 
members and “some” suspended executives who were at that 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, I asked... at the time I asked Nick.  He 
did not know.  He was not aware of who were in that 
meeting.  But I subsequently asked Jabu because apparently 
Nick had worked with Jabu to draw up this letter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And Jabu indicated that there was... Romeo 
Khumalo was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He knew about the meeting having taken 
place? 
MR TSOTSI:   He knew that the meeting had taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR TSOTSI:   And he mentioned Romeo Khumalo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   He also mentioned Zethembe Khoza. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then I asked who the executives were in 
that meeting or suspended executives. 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 164 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   That he did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I only heard of these two names having 
been present in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you establish whether he was there 
himself? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, he says he got it from his sources. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I presumed that ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   ..you know that he was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am sorry, we will have to stop 
here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will have to stop here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know you have not finished.  Mr Tsotsi, I 
apologise that we are not able to finish with your evidence 
when you have come back for the third time.  I apologise.  
20 
We will have to ask you to come back again.   
 
I hope it will be for the last time.  But that will be 
arranged.  So I apologise.  We have to stop.  Now I had 
hoped we would stop at half-past two but the issues that 
need to be covered are important and they are not few.  So 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 165 of 167 
 
arrangements will be made.  I apologise.   
MR TSOTSI:   No, I understand.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   My invoice will follow, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR TSOTSI:   My invoice will follow shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  I thought that you would have 
sent you invoice to the evidence leader. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing] 
MR TSOTSI:   [laughing]  That is a good idea. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know how long you were going to 
still be but I think we have to stop.  You will have to continue 
on some other day.  But it should be... there is no reason 
why it should not be one of the mornings or one of the 
afternoons in the next two weeks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no reason why there cannot be a 
day where... because probably you will not need more than 
20 
an hour or two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, shorter than that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, shorter than that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I literally have one, two, three, four, five 
questions ...[intervenes]  
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 166 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughing] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...to put to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but sometimes we... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...finding myself and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know.  [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So but we certainly should not need 
more than hour.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we could start at nine o’clock.  By ten 
10 
his is done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or we could ask him to come at four.  By 
five he is done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or come at five.  By six he is done.  So 
you can explore that with him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we can take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is that fine Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should be fine? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright.  Let us stop here then.  On 
09 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 280 
 
Page 167 of 167 
 
Monday, we the Commission will start at two and not at ten
