REGISTRAR:  Please place your full names for the record? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  My name is Maite Nkoana-
Mashabane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
10 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you may sit Minister.  I just want to say before 
we start welcome and thank you for responding to the request that you 
come and share with us information relating to the Waterkloof landing 
that you may be able to share with us.  I confirm that you are here 
because I requested that you come and that you are not under any 
subpoena so I thank you for responding positively to the request.  I 
thought it was important that we should have you to come and deal with 
certain aspects because it is important that as far as possible the 
20 
commission gets all perspectives from role players as to certain things 
before it reaches any conclusions.  So that – that is why I requested 
that you be asked to come here and thank you for responding 
positively. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  My honour Chair.

Page 8 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  That is what I was advised yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you very much.  Minister I believe you also 
served as a High Commissioner in various countries.  Could you just 
tell the Chairperson where did you serve as an Ambassador when 
during your time before you became the Minister of International 
Relations? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you Chair.  I was amongst – 
10 
I had the honour to be amongst the first twelve Ambassadors or High 
Commissioners post 1994 appointed by our first President of the free 
South Africa.  My posting was to Malasia in 1995.  At the time when I 
served in Malasia I was concurrently serving as Ambassador in the 
Philippines and High Commissioner in Brunei.  At the conclusion of my 
term then in 1999 I was transferred or re-appointed by then President 
Mbeki to India as High Commissioner.  There I also served as non-
resident High Commissioner and Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Maldives, 
Bangladesh and Napal.  Upon my return early – end of 2005 I was 
appointed in my home province as MEC for then two departments and 
20 
my big responsibility was to amalgamate both local government and 
housing which I would say myself and the team had the honour to 
accomplish that task.  That is – my next appointment was to become 
the Minister of International Relations and Cooperations since May 
2009. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 9 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Minister just to put your evidence 
today in context and you are aware of the Waterkloof landing or what is 
the incident where a commercial aircraft landed at the Waterkloof 
Defence Force Base. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  And I am not sure whether you had followed the 
evidence that has been led before the commission from various 
witnesses including Ambassador Koloane’s evidence.  And that 
10 
happened on the 30 April 2013 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  How did you get to know about that incident?  Because 
at the time you were the Minister of International Relations. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well I got to know of the landing of 
the aircraft on television. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. And was the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat – repeat that. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I got to know that an aircraft had 
landed on television. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  And as a Minister what steps did you take? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I immediately called the DG – the 
then DG who is our Ambassador in New York now or a permanent rep. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 10 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes so that would be Ambassador Matshela because 
he has also testified?  Is that… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I hear he has also testified yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I saw him – was – yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes alright. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm.  And I wanted to understand 
how did we get involved in this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh maybe before you get there maybe you can just 
tell me the whole story that you heard on television.  Because probably 
whatever was said might have included something about your 
department and then you reacted in a certain way bla, bla, bla. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe what did you hear on television and then 
how did you react bla, bla, bla? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well when the news broke a 
private aircraft had landed in a – a – supposed to be a secure space for 
government so I was not perturbed at first because many such 
20 
incidences happen without us.  We only get involved if there is – there 
was a diplomatic guest arriving.  So that is when I – at first I was not 
perturbed – I was not really worried because we would not be involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what – what was said on television? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  What – what… 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 11 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did not include any reference to your department at 
least what you heard at that time? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:    At the time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your reaction was you know well at least there is 
nothing – it has got nothing to do with my department at that stage? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay please continue. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  And then – and then at what 
10 
point then Minister did you realise that – you had to take steps now as 
the Minister of International Relations after you have heard = heard the 
report from the radio – ag from the TV? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well we then heard – we heard 
that the Chief of State Protocol was present in the vicinity – in the 
area.  So that is when I wanted to understand what was he doing there?  
So that is when I called the then DG and the former Ambassador and 
the Head of HR to understand what this was about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you say you called the DG that was Mr… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Matjila. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Matjila – ja Matjila. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE: Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you say the former Ambassador you 
referring to Mr Koloane? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 12 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and there is a third person that you say you 
called? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Mr Mohai who was the Head of HR 
then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So to understand what this was 
about.  From the outset we wanted to understand how did – because I – 
we were not involved so I wanted to understand who sent him to 
10 
Waterkloof.  He said no-one.  It had nothing to do with the department.  
He had not been sent.  It was an oversight.  So I said, okay now that 
we are not involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now Mr Koloane saying that to you? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So I said I am not happy.  I then 
instructed DG that they – he has – and himself that he has to face a 
disciplinary process which ensued.  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  So just by – 
20 
because of your – of your experience having been a Minister of 
International Relations. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Was this the first incident to occur where you would 
have an aircraft of this nature landing at an air base and you have your 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 13 of 153 
 
Chief of State Protocol being part of that exercise and without you as 
the Minister having any knowledge of that? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Because if – if other aircrafts 
normally do not – or other visitors normally do not – if they were not 
visiting us but they are part of you know they are serving in their 
respective governments they will directly go to the relevant department 
and make applications there.  So it is – we only got involved if this was 
a diplomatic mission and proper applications have to – had to be made. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so where an aircraft would bring in diplomatic 
10 
personnel maybe they – I do not know if that is the correct name. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the kind of people that would require your 
department to be involved would you always know in advance or it 
would depend on the level of the diplomatic persons involved – as 
Minister? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair it would depend on the level 
of the guest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  But even with that we would 
20 
have to check documentary proof if there would have been a need post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  You – you – the level at which you 
would have to know in advance would be from what?  From Minister 
level? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Minster, Head of State. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 14 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Deputy President or Prime Minister and so on. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  And at the time then when you had – 
just before you had directed that disciplinary hearings proceedings be 
brought against Ambassador Koloane did he make any mention of why 
he did what he did? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Never save to own up.  He has 
10 
been owning up and not saying how did he get to do this.  So he went 
through the disciplinary process.  He opened up and again he owned 
up.  And that is when he got sanctions that I had presented in my 
affidavit. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And – and he got to get the 
punishment he got. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us talk about the meeting because I take it 
to have been a meeting but you must tell me if I am wrong. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you heard the then DG. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koloane. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Head of HR. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 15 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That meeting.  It was a meeting, is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well -  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was it not?  Where you heard this story? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It was when – it was when Chair I 
was just trying to establish the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As to really did this happen?  But I 
did not want to be – because I did not want to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be too involved? 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because it is not my response – it 
is too involved because it is not my responsibility necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you did obviously want to know what 
happened and then in order to be able to make up your mind whether 
you should ask the DG to invoke some disciplinary processes? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well I wanted to know the basics. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But I did not want to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get too involved. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Get involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 16 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  When the process had not even 
started yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at that meeting did he – you said – I think you 
said he owned up and you said he said it was oversight, is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Because I asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  What task were you performing? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As Chief of State Protocol.  He 
could not respond.  He said it was an oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So I thought this is a case for 
disciplinary process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So I must get out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So that the government officials 
deal with the matter – senior officials properly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at that stage did he say anything to you or did you 
know at that stage anything about the allegation that he had told some 
officials that the President knew about this aircraft that was going to 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 17 of 153 
 
land or that instructions had been given either by the President, 
President or Minister of Transport or Minister of Defence.  At that stage 
do you recall whether that was something that you had heard about or 
did he tell you about it or is that something that you might have got to 
know later? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I heard about that later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because like I said Chair I did not 
want to get myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Too involved? 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Into the – too involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So that we establish real facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Minister would it – 
ordinarily is it possible for any Ambassador –I am so sorry – for any 
Minister or Head of State at the level at which you have already 
identified that is senior Ministers and Heads of State, is it possible for 
them to arrive in the country without you knowing as a Minister of 
International Relations? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Some do.  They are on holding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is not official? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  If it is not official. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  They arrive. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 18 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And they go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Some out of courtesy Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Do say we are around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it is official you would know? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  If it is official there will be a 
10 
diplomatic note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That says here is an envoy – if it 
is an envoy of President so and so or is a Minister of this and that.  
Those things are normally dealt with by the Protocol Division.  But if 
the guest was to come to me or to the President that is when I would 
then act because I would then have to participate in their process – in 
their program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that one could have a situation where 
a Minister comes into the country – a Minister from another country. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Comes into the country on official business and all 
the documentation has been done. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 19 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you might not know because he or she does not 
need to see you and does not need to see the President. In other words 
would you only know personally because the Minister concerned wants 
to see you while he or she is in the country or wants to see the 
President?  If they do not want to see you or the President they might 
be in the country and you might not know of personally but officials in 
your department would know.  Would that be possible? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It is possible.  Like I repeat Chair 
there will be a paper trail of diplomatic notes between their respective 
embassies and the Protocol and the department.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  And then Minister 
moving then to – then after you then had directed that disciplinary 
proceedings should be levelled against him and then as you have told 
the Chair that happened. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Then when next did you get involved in the matter if 
you did? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I next got involved Chair when the 
results came out of the disciplinary process.  When – and I sanctioned 
20 
– I signed off.  And he went to serve his term and came back.  By the 
way former Ambassador Koloane I first met him in 2007 meet  - I mean 
see him for the first time in Spain during President Mbeki’s time.  He 
was Ambassador of South Africa in Spain.  So when he came back I had 
become a Minister.  This man had served in Kotovo for – representing 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 20 of 153 
 
DTI in Japan, in China, Shanghai.  So in all the areas that he had 
worked in he had excelled.  So he came back and we needed to – he 
came back at the time when we were advising a post for the DDG for 
Protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry Minister. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we get to that point. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You and I and Ms Norman and your council probably 
remember some of the details because we have had to look at the 
10 
documentation ahead of today. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But other people might have forgotten certain things.  
I think let us start with what you established the result of the 
disciplinary process to have been? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words the disciplinary process concluded and 
you got to know.  Tell us what you got to know had happened at the 
disciplinary process. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    And what the outcome was and – so that we can 
then follow everything properly? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well the disciplinary process found 
that Chair he should be suspended for a period of three months.  Two 
months – I am sorry.  One of the three months without pay.   
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 21 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I saw – I saw your affidavit says that but I think the 
ruling says. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Suspension without pay for two months.  It does not 
seem to make any reference to three months.  You might be mistaken 
about that? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Let me get the Chair again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I do not know whether my – there is a problem 
with my one now.  You must tell me if there is. 
ADV NORMAN:  No Chair I can – I can hear you properly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can hear me? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister can you hear me quite clearly? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I can hear you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying I saw that in your affidavit. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that the sanction that had been imposed on 
him was three months. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying that when I looked at the ruling of the 
Chairperson it said two months.  There was no reference to three 
months as I – as I read it.  So I am just wanting to check whether you 
might not be mistaken about saying three months. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 22 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I can go and check the records 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  As I understand I think Ms 
Norman also says the same. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes it is.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says two months. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  May I just direct the Minister to the relevant page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Minister in – next to you, you will find that 
there is two lever arch files. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  The one is marked Exhibit FF3.  If you just turn it on 
the spine. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  This one. 
ADV NORMAN:  On the spine – inside – outside the spine – outside the 
file – sorry.   
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Exhibit FF8? 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh sorry okay.  Sorry. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Oh this one? 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  FF3 – yes thank you.  If you may please 
turn to page 36, 36 of that bundle. Chair it will be under a divider 
marked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I found it. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 23 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh have you found it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you.  Marked 6.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It is at page 36 at the top. 
ADV NORMAN:  Page – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is under paragraph 12, can you see it? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair are you allowing me to 
10 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Para 12.1  
“Suspension without pay for a period of 2 months as 
an alternative to dismissal in terms of Clause 2.7 [4 
of Chapter 7] of the SMS handbook.  12.2 – Final 
written warning which shall be placed on the 
employee’s personal file and shall remain valid for 
six months.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – your reference to the three months might 
have been 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 24 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mistaken. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Chair may the witness – may the Minister also read 
paragraph 11?  Because it seems to tie in with the sanction above 
paragraph 12.  Where you have just read on the same page.  Paragraph 
11. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes okay.   
10 
“Based on my consideration that is Mr – Advocate 
Matlrjesnr of the facts both parties aggravating and 
mitigating factors I strongly recommend that their 
employer seriously consider redeploying Koloane to 
another branch in order to revive the confidence, 
integrity and efficiency of sate protocol.” 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Then upon receipt of this then what did 
you do Minister? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe … 
ADV NORMAN:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 25 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just say this.  That last page Minister which – 
in which the sanction appears. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is page 9 of the disciplinary Chairperson’s ruling on 
sanction.  I do not page 8 of that ruling and also there is no page – I do 
not have page 6. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do have page 7.  I did not have these pages last 
time when there was a hearing.  I understand that various attempts 
have been made to try and obtain these pages.  I take it and which Ms 
10 
Norman will confirm including from the – from your former department 
probably you can do nothing about it now because you are not in that 
department.   
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – excuse me.  One does not know what the 
Chairperson had said in page 8. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which may have informed what he says or she says I 
do not know if it was a he or a she. 
ADV NORMAN:  It is a she. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the top of page 9 of the ruling – page 36 of the 
bundle under paragraph 11.  So – so I just mentioned that.  I do not 
know whether you have any recollection whether when you previously 
saw the ruling if it was given to you at the time whether it had all the 
pages? 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 26 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well it had all the pages Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I am [indistinct] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we have that disadvantage.  Yes okay alright, 
continue. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you Chair I confirm Chair the 
steps and we have prepared a small bundle for the Chair of the efforts 
that the commission had made but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you should deal with that now so that we put it 
aside. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair.  May I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just tell me what efforts have been made? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  
That is a document that consists of various emails but maybe we could 
start Chair – I know emails we have got to start backwards but I am 
advised that maybe we might need to just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well some of us  
ADV NORMAN:  You want to start with the basics? 
CHAIRPERSON:  When it comes to technology have certain challenges. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But start wherever it is convenient to start. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Chair may we start then at page 5 of 
that?  Which is the latest communication again another last attempt 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 27 of 153 
 
which we made yesterday to Advocate M B Matlejwane who was the 
Chairperson and I confirm that I spoke to her personally and she 
produced this email – sent this email to the commission.  It says: 
“Good day.  It is addressed to myself and to Ms [indistinct] I refer to the 
matter.  I was –  
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair? 
ADV NORMAN:  Page 5 I beg your pardon. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  This that you have has 4 – it ends 
with page 4. 
ADV NORMAN:  It does not have page 5? 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It does not have the – page 5 
sorry. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  May I just read into the record Minister?  I 
am sorry I am sure it was in – copy notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there no spare copy of page 5? 
ADV NORMAN:  No unfortunately there were only three Chair.  Only 
three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV NORMAN:  Yes but.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She will read the whole … 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  We will make it available. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 28 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. Page 5 she says: 
“Good day.  I refer to the above matter. I was the 
Chairperson 
in 
the 
disciplinary 
hearing 
of 
Ambassador VB Koloane in 2009.  I was contacted by 
the 
Department 
of 
International 
Relations 
and 
Cooperation’s sometime in August 2019 seeking 
missing pages, page 6 and page 8 of the sanction.  I 
did confirm to – I think she meant to say to the 
department that unfortunately I do not have the 
document anymore.  My office was using a different 
10 
system then and I do not have the file anymore.  I 
was also contacted by Mr Mblambo several times 
from the commission and I informed him that I do not 
have the file anymore.  Regards.  Advocate M B 
Matlejwane.” 
And then Chair would observe that page 4 of that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Is an – consists of emails – maybe I should – Chair if 
you would let me please start from page 1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Because then that – that is a flow of emails from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Page 1 it is an email from Mr Pat Mlambo to 
myself for my information of – he had forwarded all the emails.  We 
requested him to forward all the emails in relation to this matter which 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 29 of 153 
 
he forwarded yesterday.  But then below that there is an email which 
was sent on the 14 August 2019 at 17 minutes past 8 to the Advocate 
Joiney who is a legal advisor within the Department of DIRCO.  I was 
copied and the subject – it was from Mr Pat Mlambo the investigator.  
And the subject was Re Ambassador V B Koloane’s sanction. 
“Morning All.  I did get hold of Advocate Matlejwane 
just now and she informed me that they are still 
trying to find the document which unfortunately and 
he puts in brackets [and mysteriously] is missing 
from her file.  Also that it has since been a while that 
10 
she presided over the matter and in the process she 
has since had a new PA.  I therefore advise that you 
[indistinct] this into your statement that she could 
not find the missing pages of the sanction instead of 
just a telephonic discussion about it.  She undertook 
to do so as advised.  The following is the email 
address she provided for future correspondence.” 
Then Chair the next page, page 2, it is an email from Advocate Joyini 
from - from DIRCO.  It is dated 13 August 15 - at 15:16. 
“Dear Advocate Norman, thank you very much for 
20 
your guidance.  Much appreciated.” 
And then in there I had sent an email to Advocate Joyini on 
13 August. 
“Dear Ambassador, thank you for your response.  I 
suggest that you escalate the matter to the DG, 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 30 of 153 
 
because Mr Putih is not responding.  If that does 
not work DIRCO must write to the Presiding Officer 
and request a copy of the sanction.” 
So the responses that we are getting are - is a result of that 
effort and then - then again on Tuesday on 13 August Advocate Joyini 
wrote to me. 
“Dear Advocate Norman, thank you very much for 
your email.  Our Labour Relations Section has been 
trying since July, the 31 s t.  See the emails below 
dated 31 August, the 2 n d and 5 August.  Your 
10 
guidance will be highly appreciated.” 
There is an email Chair that is dated 31 August.  The date 
reflects at page 2 and if Chair turns to page 3 that is the subject 
Ambassador V B Koloane’s 
sanction. 
 
That 
email 
is 
from 
Mr Jeffrey Mamabolo Director Labour Relations.  This is what she said. 
“Dear Mr Putih, our conversation earlier refers.  
Attached herewith 
is Ambassador V B Koloane’s 
sanction as discussed.  You will notice that pages 6 
and eight are missing.  Hence my humble request 
for the said pages.  Your assistance will be highly 
20 
appreciated.” 
And then it is followed by another email on 2 August. 
“Dear Mr Putih …” 
This one is from Mr Mamabolo again. 
“Dear 
Mr Putih, 
the 
email 
before 
and 
our 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 31 of 153 
 
subsequent 
conversation 
refers. 
 
Please 
be 
reminded to check for pages 6 and eight of 
Ambassador Koloane’s sanction.  Thanks very much 
in advance.” 
And then again on 5 August Mr Mamabolo wrote. 
“Please be informed that I tried to call your offices 
this morning without any success.  I just wanted to 
follow up if whether you managed to locate the 
missing pages as per my request below.  Your 
response would be greatly appreciated.” 
10 
So these efforts Chair started way back in July as soon as - 
after the hearings of the - of the evidence of the witnesses that related 
to the Waterkloof, but Chair we have taken further steps now to 
approach the representatives of Ambassador Koloane.  Unfortunately at 
the hearing Ambassador Koloane was not represented, but was 
represented by Labour Relations. 
That - that is what the record shows, but we have directly 
now made contact with his current attorneys or at least those that 
represented him before the Commission.  They have indicated that their 
documents are in - they have been archived and that they will look for 
20 
that.  They will respond to the Commission by Monday next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Then Minister - then you 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 32 of 153 
 
then receive the sanction and you - you - what is the steps then that 
you took?  Were you satisfied with the sanction and then if you were 
then what steps did you take? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well the steps I took was to 
immediately remove - remember him from - Ambassador Koloane from 
being - since - since the saga started we shifted him, but we then made 
sure that he does not go back to Protocol. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  When he came back after the 
sanction he was … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and when you say after the sanction you mean 
after the suspension? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  After the suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE: 
 
After 
he 
had 
served 
the 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two months? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  He was sitting in the DG’s 
office like really literally - we could not demote him.  He is the DDG.  
20 
He is sitting in the DG’s office doing manual work that a Director could 
do for all the time period before we had to get - get him gainfully - yes, 
because salaries - salary was paid at that DDG level. 
He had gone through this - the - the disciplinary process.  He 
is back in terms of labour laws.  So he never went back to where he 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 33 of 153 
 
was - he was serving before as it is suggested that he should not in 
your - in the documents he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  In the - in the conclusion of the 
disciplinary hearing that he should not go back to the position that he 
was in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to just - I want to go back to the - to paragraph 
11 of that ruling, but before that I want to confirm that you - you did 
understand as the department or as the Minister at the time that as far 
as the sanction for his conduct was concerned.  It was only the 
10 
suspension for two months without pay … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the final written warning 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is all that you were required to do to comply with 
the sanction. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understood that part? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there was this other part which maybe - 
20 
looks like a recommendation.  I just want to read it again.  In paragraph 
11 of her rule - it was a “her” it was a “she” Ms Norman?  The 
Chairperson of the disciplinary hearing. 
ADV NORMAN:  It was the Chairperson.  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a lady? 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 34 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  A lady Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She says: 
“Based on my consideration of the facts both 
parties aggravating and mitigating factors I strongly 
recommend that the employer seriously consider 
redeploying Ambassador Koloane to another branch 
in order to revive the confidence, integrity and 
efficiency of State Protocol.” 
10 
What was your understanding of this recommendation? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  My understanding was that he 
should - because we would not have been involved in the landing of an 
aircraft somewhere if it was not that he had put himself there as - as 
Protocol.  So the recommendation I understood it to mean that - exactly 
that. 
He erred by being - by putting himself where he should not 
have and - and putting the integrity of State Protocol in a precarious 
situation.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was your understanding that what you were 
20 
obliged to do was to put him on suspension without pay for two months 
… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And have a final written warning on his file. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 35 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be there for - that would be valid for six 
months … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that there was also a recommendation … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With which you were not obliged to comply … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But which you could consider in your own way and 
see whether you would go with it or not.  Was that your understanding? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  That - as a former 
10 
Ambassador … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I understood that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Protocol is Protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So I took even the para before - 12 
- into consideration.  That is why he never returned back to being the - 
to Protocol and even when he came back as much as he was still at the 
level of a DGG, because that is now a - that is a position you apply an 
20 
get appointed for. 
He could not go back to that and I was convinced - like I said.  
As a former Ambassador that Protocol is to be respected as Protocol.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understand that part, but I just want to 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 36 of 153 
 
understand what your understanding was … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time.  Namely that as far as what appears in 
paragraph 11 is concerned. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not take that or did you as binding upon you 
to do what is said there.  You - you took it as a suggestion and you had 
to evaluate and see if you went along with it.  Whereas with regard to 
in - what is in paragraph 12 putting him on suspension without pay for 
two months and a - a final written warning whether that is what you 
10 
took 
as 
obligatory 
upon 
you, 
but 
the 
other 
one 
as 
a 
suggestion/recommendation which you had to weigh and see if you 
were going along with it. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did you take all of them as obligatory? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair, I - I took 12 as obligatory.  
Yes, but I further took advice from paragraph 11, because we did not - I 
did not send him back to the position of Chief of State Protocol.  As the 
paragraph says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you - you took paragraph 11 as advice? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And took paragraph 12 as obligatory? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes, sir. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 37 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you Chair and then if - my calculation then 
if one interprets that sanction would be that because the sanction was 
dated 29 July 2013.  Then and the written warning part which appears 
at paragraph 12 - 12.2 - would have expired on - in January 2014.  That 
six month period. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  So then at the expiry of that six months period 
then what happened? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms Norman do you … 
ADV NORMAN:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not want her to deal with what happened - which she 
has started dealing with - what happened when the suspension period 
of two months expired. 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She started dealing with it … 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not think she had completed. 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh, yes.  When … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I interrupted here when she was talking about 
that. 
ADV NORMAN:  About - oh, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 38 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us - let us go back to saying how did you 
effect the sanction that says - that said he should be on suspension 
without pay for two months?  How did you effect that?  How was that 
effected or implemented at a practical level? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well at a practical level it had to 
be the responsibility as per my instruction to the officials that are 
responsible for undertaking such tasks.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do - do you know how it was effected at a practical 
level or is the position that you conveyed an instruction as to what 
should happen, but you do not know whether it did happen? 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I trust that it did - it did happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know for sure? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well I never got … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A report? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  A report that says it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not happen. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you also did not get a report to say Minister we 
have given effect to the sanction.  This is what happened. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The report of giving effect … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 39 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Was verbal and it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Conveyed to me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  By then - the then DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My understanding of the suspension part of the 
sanction is that he was - the department was required to - not to allow 
him to be at work for - for two months and not to pay him for that period 
10 
of two months. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is that - is - was that your understanding as well? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and to the extent that you may have given 
instructions to officials.  The instruction would have been along those 
lines? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Just for record purposes 
20 
that part that Chair has just asked appears at pages 38 to 40 of the 
same bundle.  Minister if you could just turn to page 38.  There is a - a 
memorandum to the Director-General which - which is approved.  That 
relates to the sanction without pay.  I am not sure whether this is the 
answer … 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 40 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  That you have given to the - to the … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:  Chairperson. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Pages 38 and 39 Chair and it is signed by the 
Director-General and that signature appears at page 39. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that is a memo.  Is it from the Human Resources 
Unit of the department to the Director-General … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To approve implementation of the suspension without 
pay sanction? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Then - then Minister - 
20 
then that is the first part of the sanction.  Then the second part was the 
written warning part … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  And then if you go back.  Then that written warning 
would have expired in January 2014. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 41 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  How does it work practically in - in civil service?  
If there has been a written warning … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV NORMAN:  And then that period comes.  It - it expires.  Does that 
mean that it is expunged completely from the records?  How does it 
work? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As it is stated in the sanction.  He 
says: 
“It shall remain in the personal file.” 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So it means at the end of that 
period it should no longer - it - it is rendered having been removed from 
the file or because it - even if it remains the record, but it - it ceases to 
become what - you know it states as - gets … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you do not give - you then - you do not pay 
attention to it after the expiry of the period.  Is - is that your 
understanding? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well that is what labour law - we - 
we follow labour law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Understand, but I am just wanting to understand your 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 42 of 153 
 
own understanding of what it means to say it has expired.  Is it that you 
do not take - you do not pay attention to it after it has expired? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because then I think the law 
advises so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well … 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometimes there are all kinds of interpretations of the 
law, but I do not think it is necessary for us to bother about that part. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Chair.  Then Minister at page 
- if you go back to your statement now.  Thank you.  At page - in - in 
paragraph 4 of your statement Ambassador Matjila did give the 
Chairperson a background to the process, but we would like to 
understand the process at ministerial level when a person is to be 
posted now as - as an Ambassador and - and the consideration that you 
would have taken into account in dealing with Ambassador Koloane. 
Could you just give the Chairperson how does the whole 
20 
issue of vacancies that you make mention of in paragraph 5 - how does 
that happen and what do you mean by the cycle that you make 
reference to in both paragraphs 4 and five.  If you could just explain 
that process. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Okay. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 43 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to interrupt you Ms Norman. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry about that. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think let us before we get there … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us get they complete picture of what was 
happening with regard to Mr Koloane from the time he came back after 
the expiry of the two months of suspension to … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  (Intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The time when you recommended that he be 
appointed as Ambassador for The Netherlands.  You have already 
started - you had already started saying he was sitting in the DG’s 
office doing work that a Director could do, but being paid at the level of 
Deputy Director-General. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I do not know whether that is all you wanted to 
convey as to what was happening with him during that time.  I just want 
to make sure that if there is more you want to tell me in regard to what 
was happening.  You - you are able to tell me the full story. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The answer Chair is yes, but he 
also show contrition, because ours was to observe him as he was 
sitting where he was sitting.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe going back - one step back.  With regard 
to the result of the disciplinary process did you get to know - I mean 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 44 of 153 
 
you told me that you got to know what the sanction was.  Did you get to 
know that he had pleaded guilty to three charges and to - did you get to 
know what those charges were?  Did you see the documentation and all 
of that at that time? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I did, but I do not - I cannot recall 
each - what - what were they, but I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Remember that I saw it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time you - you … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You informed yourself fully … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About what had transpired at the disciplinary hearing? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not be able to remember now, but at that 
time … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You informed yourself fully? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it that you would then have seen that he 
20 
pleaded guilty to three charges … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those charges - Ms Norman … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Yes Chair.  The page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I would like us to refer to them. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 45 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  To - to them.  I will give you the page now Chair.  
Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They - they must be the same … 
ADV NORMAN:  They appear at page 25 of the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was on … 
ADV NORMAN:  I beg your pardon Chair.  Page 5 of the - yes.  Page 5.  
I beg your pardon.  What appears at 25 is …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is of FF3? 
ADV NORMAN:  Of FF3.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5? 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Page 5.  Chair, yes.  Page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have - have you got that page …? 
ADV NORMAN:  Minister.  Do you have the page Minister? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister. 
ADV NORMAN:  The relevant - page 5 on top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bundle that had the ruling of the Chairperson … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I have six.  I have six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the  
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I have four - five.  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  You do not have five? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No.  I have four. 
ADV NORMAN:  There is something wrong with your bundle. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Six - seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I think maybe somebody sabotaging you Minister. 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh.  You can do that.  Thank you.  Chair that one that 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 46 of 153 
 
Minister - counsel is giving is - is the Commission’s bundle, but it is an 
actual bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe let us do this, because it is our - we are 
about to reach the time for the tea adjournment. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me take the tea adjournment now. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will somebody just make sure that the Minister has 
got … 
ADV NORMAN:  The full set. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same documents and bundles that we have … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that she has all the same pages. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We must not have pages that she does not have … 
ADV NORMAN:  That she does not have.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we take the - the tea adjournment five minutes 
early.  So that this can be sorted out. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is about nine minutes past now.  We are going to 
resume at 25 past 11. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that that can be sorted out … 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 47 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  We will do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe I will make it half past, because there might 
be time to sort that out and you must have time … 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the tea - for tea. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We were looking at the charges ...[intervenes]   
ADV NORMAN:   Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I will prefer to go to the ruling of the 
Chairperson of the Disciplinary Inquiry ...[intervenes]  
ADV NORMAN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where she also repeated what the charges are. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the charges were, I think that appears, or the 
charge sheet appears at page 7 Minister, can you see page 7? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I want to go ...[intervenes]  
ADV NORMAN:   That would be page 26 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  26. 
ADV NORMAN:   26 yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 48 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay let’s go to page 26, yes that is the 
Chairperson’s ruling, it starts at page 25. 
ADV NORMAN:   That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to find it Minister? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, please switch on your mic so whatever you 
are saying can be recorded. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, now the representative of the employer at the 
disciplinary hearing is recorded as having been Dr H M Manzini, would 
10 
that be a person that you would have known at the time, or not really? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Nor really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright.   Now at page 26 the chairperson of 
the disciplinary inquiry records that the charges were as follows.  
 
Charge one, it is alleged that during the period February 
 
2013 to April 2013 the employee, that is Mr Koloane abused 
 
diplomatic channels and took it upon himself to facilitate an 
 
illegal request for landing of an international aircraft at the 
 
Air Force Base Waterkloof on the 30 t h of April 2013 between 
 
6h50 and 7h00 in the morning. 
20 
 
Charge Two, it is alleged that the employee misrepresented 
 
facts in an endeavour to procure the illegal and unlawful 
 
and/or wrongful landing. 
 
Charge Three, the employee compromised the processes and 
 
procedures of his employer in that 14.1 there was no review 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 49 of 153 
 
 
and/or 
recommendation 
from 
the 
political 
desk 
in 
the 
 
department on this particular request and 14.2 the inter-
 
departmental coordination process that normally ensues did 
 
not take place. 
 
Those were the three charges.  Now that I’ve read them and 
you have looked at them does that accord – do they accord with what 
you understood the charges to have been? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay alright, maybe if you can give your answer 
in such a way that can be recorded and heard, it accords with what you 
10 
understood the charges to have been? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  The actual ruling would you – do you 
remember whether it was – it may have been part or was part of the 
documents that you did see at the end of the disciplinary process.  This 
particular ruling by the Chairperson, the document that we are looking 
at now, do you recall whether it was part of the documents that you saw 
that may have been given to you to apprise you of what happened at 
the disciplinary process? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Chair…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t remember? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   I remember but I do know that the 
processes of the work that is done by professionals it’s not necessarily 
what the executing authority should be chasing on a daily basis 
because you end up not providing proper leadership and it’s – the 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 50 of 153 
 
employer, number one for all the officials in the Department is the DG, 
the executing authority is the political head.  So I focused on my 
political work and if I need something through the processes of the, you 
know, administration then I should ask properly so that we are in order, 
thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no I understand what you are saying, you 
know for me part of what I want to gain from your evidence is the 
benefit of what you knew and what you did not know about this 
Waterkloof landing incident and Ambassador Koloane as at the time 
when you made the recommendation that you made.  So I’m asking the 
10 
question whether you recall whether you did see this document or you 
might not have seen the document but you knew important features 
about it, maybe because you were told in a memo or maybe you were 
told verbally or is the position that you can’t remember whether you did 
see it or you didn’t see it? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   I might have seen it because it’s 
2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes it’s a long time but that’s why I’m asking so that 
I know if you say no I definitely saw it and I read or say, look I’m not 
sure whether I saw it or not but I think somebody may have sent a 
20 
memo to apprise me of what had happened or somebody gave me a 
verbal report and I understood what I needed to know about the 
process for purposes of my decisions. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Chair, like I said earlier on I tried 
to discharge my duties as far as I understood what my responsibilities 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 51 of 153 
 
were on a daily basis until I left the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   That’s whey even when I 
overheard about this – our involvement in another space, I immediately 
wanted to understand what it was but on what was happening on daily 
basis from that day till I left two years ago I would not be 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s lots of things you might not remember? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that I understand but it’s important that I know 
10 
what you remember and what you don’t remember because I don’t want 
to assume that you knew certain things because you were Minister of 
the Department when in fact you might not have known them.  So that 
is why it’s important to find out what you might have known and what 
you might not have known. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe what we’ll do – we should do Ms Norman, 
maybe let’s continue when we talk about the recommendation we might 
have to come back to what the charges are and what happened 
because I prefer that we will go through systematically but maybe we 
20 
can jump, let’s have that and then we can come back to it. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you, minister you were at the point where you 
were just going to briefly explain the process of posting of 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 52 of 153 
 
Ambassadors and who does the Minister consult and how does that 
process happen.  So this is now after Ambassador Koloane had 
returned, I would imagine to the DG’s office as you’ve already indicated 
to the Chairperson and you say in paragraphs four and five you deal 
with the process and how they can post of Heads of Nations are dealt 
with in a particular cycle, that is what we would like to understand. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Thank you Chair.  Since 1994 
when South Africa was re-admitted in the global space there was high 
demand for South Africa to make a contribution here and there and also 
high demand outside the country and even internally.  The internally 
10 
remains, our financial situation might not be able to make us maintain 
but wherever we go still, even where I am seated as Minister of 
Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, South Africa is still highly 
regarded and a voice is needed.  So for the purpose of processing 
things in the Department at the time when I was there was that when 
you post officials, starting from Ambassador to whatever senior/junior 
official we had to decide that we have two cycles. That there’s a cycle 
of those who would leave beginning of the year of if not mid-year so 
that we’re able to keep track of what, you know – and these people 
move with families, I’ve gone through that.  Children are taken out of 
20 
school and so on and so on, nevertheless politically it gives you chance 
to consult broadly and then the DG will, every six months, bring the – a 
list of vacancies that needs to be filled in the six months to come.  So 
the Minister would go and show the President our…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Minister to interrupt you, maybe I’m not the 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 53 of 153 
 
only one feeling a little hot will somebody attend to the aircon but it 
shouldn’t be too much, okay I’m sorry Minister I interrupted you, you 
had just said you have to take the list that you got from the DG to the 
President, continue from there. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes and then posts that – we also 
have a second opportunity, then we invite the invitees, they’re still 
invitees even if they’re nominated for a six-month orientation.  That six-
month orientation gives us even an opportunity for waiting for the 
receiving country to also reflect on whoever is going to be sent to their 
country.  Also the other agencies in government gets an opportunity to 
10 
check.  So this six months’ orientation doesn’t say, I was posted 
before, I shouldn’t go through this, it’s until I left, almost like 
rudimentary.  You have to go through that, if I may detour a bit, I 
remember the late Ambassador, former Minister Skeyeso when he was 
to be posted to London, he came to my – he walked into my office and 
said, wait are you serious, you want to train me as an Ambassador, I 
said I don’t know how to not follow this procedure but when he was to 
leave after six months we also organised that they come together and 
reflect on the experience of sitting for six months and sharing 
experience and being shown the routes, this way and that way, he 
20 
volunteered to speak on how much he did not know about this work and 
he felt very, very angry with himself because he’s now former Minister 
and he’s been Minister for so many years and he did know what he 
should have known prior to.  So it also humbled me that here is a very 
senior leader who says this is a very stressful task.  So even this 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 54 of 153 
 
Colonel…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just to complete that detour maybe – was he 
raisin that question of Minister, are you serious that you want to train 
me as an Ambassador was it because he had served as an Ambassador 
at some stage in the past or because of any particular experience or 
was it simply because how senior he was as a Minister? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Senior Chair as a Minister but 
also once Minister of Public Service and Administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   So senior political also but there 
10 
are things that – a knowledge that has to be gained to become a fine 
diplomat, it’s like you can’t buy a car license and get on the road and 
start driving. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes, so – but even for those who 
have served as Ambassadors, like Ambassador Koloane they – if they 
were nominated they also still have to go through that six months like I 
said it gives other countries where they are sent an opportunity to also 
reflect on them.  Draft letters of recommendation from the Minister to 
the President’s approval are generated from the office of the Minister 
20 
and sent to the President.  This is after consultation again with the DG.  
Once chosen the nominees would attend the orientation that I had 
referred to, run by the Diplomatic Training and Research Development 
– you want me to continue? 
ADV NORMAN:   No. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 55 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well she’s guiding you she must – ja. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Minister, let’s just take this situation where 
we have this particular nominee that would have been Ambassador 
Koloane and on the charges that the Chairperson has already referred 
to then it became known that in fact, he admitted before this 
Commission that he had name dropped not only the President’s name 
but the name of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Defence.  
So would that …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   May I interrupt you again Ms Norman, I’m sorry.  
Before we get there I would like to know what the purpose is of taking 
10 
the names that you get from the DG to the President at the stage which 
seems to me to be the beginning of that six-month process, as I 
understand you and you must tell me if I don’t understand you correctly 
it seems that the first step you get a list from the DG of vacancies.  
Now I don’t know whether you said you get – that’s what, that’s all you 
get from the DG or you also get names from the DG of potential 
candidates or is it only the vacancies you get from the DG? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   It’s both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You get both? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   The DG can propose names but in 
20 
every country you will have a portion of political appointees and a 
portion of career diplomats.  I strived to try and – because career 
diplomats, many of them are – they don’t always get in but many of 
them…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They don’t always get? 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 56 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Chair they don’t always get to the 
top because you don’t apply to become a diplomat in order to become 
an Ambassador it’s a prerogative of the President as to who he sends 
out but I strived also, as I had said as an Ambassador I came in as a 
political appointee but I also saw what the late Ambassador Skeyeso 
that it’s also important to give space to those who are also former 
activists who also had served the country well and can be good 
Ambassadors.  Now former Ambassador Koloane had done both and 
had served two departments, the DTI and also DIRCO and like I said, 
when we started, when I met him he was an Ambassador appointed by 
10 
former, former President in Spain.  I’m sure the Spanish even if they 
see him today none of them would say they can associate him with what 
you say but post that there was a disciplinary process which he went 
through…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I’m sorry you are getting into the part that she is 
still going to – I just wanted to clarify the procedure or process that 
leads to the appointment of any particular person as an Ambassador.  
So you get both the posts that are vacant and the list from the DG, list 
of names but the DG doesn’t propose or nominate anybody but he or 
she gives you a list of potential candidates. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Internally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you say internally does that mean he has a list 
somewhere or there’s a pool of career diplomats who are available and 
there’s a pool of potential political appointees from whom the President 
could appoint, in other words where does he get the list that he gives 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 57 of 153 
 
you, how does it come about? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Well the list from the DG’s side I 
wish I could say she, whoever is appointed…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well I’m talking he – I’m talking in general but 
the particular one that you had was a he. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Was a he, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   So as Minister of Women, Youth 
and Persons with Disabilities I was complaining to the President the 
other day  whispering to him that we have less than three DG’s in 
10 
government because he had made us happy by appointing 50% 
Ministers, I benefited but he always correct us, no we spoilt it me and 
the Deputy so I whispered to him, I said hey we were also very happy 
but when I looked at the list of DG’s we are not doing very well, we’re 
just out of so many departments we have less than three….[Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s what it’s about. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   That’s why I verbalise it even in 
wrong spaces. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that’s fine, it sounds like what was said about 
the Constitutional Court for quite some time that we only had two 
20 
women judges for a long time of course we have more now, not enough 
but also we are quick to remind everybody that the JSE which 
interviews and makes recommendations Judges make a very small 
number of percentage of people who are in that body a lot of them are 
politicians and politicians who are in parliament.  Okay alright, so that 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 58 of 153 
 
is what you were saying when you said you wish it was a she, you could 
say a she? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Well in this case here it’s a he.  
Where would he derive the pool from it’s of career diplomats who now 
qualify to be Ambassadors or who have accumulated enough experience 
to become Ambassadors.  Both male and female, during my term have 
done exceptionally well, not that political appointees don’t do well but 
they are giving space to also appointing those who had vowed to spend 
their lifetime as representing South Africa, it’s been good.  So former 
Ambassador Koloane had been such…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the DG would know career diplomats who are 
available for posting. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would he also know politicians, in other words 
people – and other people who might not be politicians who may be 
eligible that could be considered, is that correct? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes we could also get suggestions 
from, maybe your portfolio or to say, you know, so and so can also, on 
the part of the political appointees.  Like some country has just sent 
…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I hope you don’t get any recommendation from the 
Judiciary as to what politicians should be appointed as an Ambassador, 
that would be improper. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but ..[intervenes]. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 59 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   But the attempt we made was to 
at least – I’m sure it’s still the preoccupation of the current Minister 
that, ideally we should have 70%, 30% from outside, 70% from internal 
and 30% from outside because it’s good to also have experiences but 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you say 70% from internally, is that a 
reference to career diplomats? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright but you – are you saying that the DG 
would not have a list kept somewhere of people who are available or 
10 
would he have such a list? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   He can’t keep a list permanently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   He has six months to think, the 
six-month cycle gave us an opportunity to collect information to know in 
the next coming six months we’ll have these vacancies.  It has not 
always been possible, half the time you’re caught off guard and you’ve 
got many vacancies and …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not enough people. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Not enough people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so are you therefore saying there might not 
have been a standing list that he had to consult each time there were 
vacancies but every six months he would need to create a list in the 
sense that he would need to be ready whenever you say there’s a need 
he would need to be able to say here’s a list.  How he got that list is 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 60 of 153 
 
his business, in other words, how he got the names other than the 
career diplomats who are internal, anyone who was not part of the 
career diplomats, how he got those names was left to him? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:     Not at all sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Chair I am saying the concern of 
the DG is to work with the Minister because you are talking about 
people who are going to represent the President and the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   So he can’t have a…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   A free reign. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  A free reign but he can have a free 
reign of those who are career diplomats to say – to avail the names to 
say, here are career diplomats with experience.  They also go through 
the check and I think the six-month period and the six months, yes, that 
we had created helped us a great deal yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I understand from what you are saying that as 
far as career diplomats are concerned, he would know them.  He would 
know who’s available, who’s not available and what level of experience 
they have and so on, is that right? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I’m interested in knowing how he would get 
names of those who are not career diplomats, now…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Those who are not career 
diplomats Chair, can come from all senior citizens in the country who 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 61 of 153 
 
would approach us and we put the names on the list and send where 
they should be sent because after all it’s the prerogative of the 
President to appoint [indistinct] as Ambassador at the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s what I’m trying to understand how 
somebody who is not a career diplomat would – could end up on the 
list.  This is just for general understanding, I know that maybe 
Ambassador Koloane’s situation might be different but I want to 
understand the generalities first.  So somebody might approach the 
department, let’s say a politician or former politician, I’m not sure and 
say, I want to put down my name if there is a post for Ambassador I 
10 
would be available and they could give their name to the DG, is that 
right, could it happen like that or not really? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Not really.  It can – the DG 
collates the lists from the internal and from those that would have 
approached government to say we are ready to serve, we can share our 
experience.  And all those who would have been nominated or verbally 
nominated by any – any leader of society to say, we think so and so 
can help in becoming an Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But at a protocol level what I think I would do if 
I was DG and people were free to approach me and say, I am happy to 
20 
serve.  I would put down their names and get their CV’s and keep those 
for when it may be necessary.  So I am trying to understand whether as 
far as those who would end up being on the list that would be taken to 
the President but who were not career diplomats whether the DG was 
free to say for example to the ANC, have you got names of people that 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 62 of 153 
 
can be considered either now or for the future.  Where there was a free 
to go the – any political party for example because I think it – I think it 
does happen that sometimes an Ambassador is… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  From the opposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is somebody from another party.  You know I think 
there have been… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Several. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An Ambassador too who used to be in the DA. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Gibson and I think Mr Tony Leon. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And Mr Mr Leon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am not mistaken. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I am thinking whether it was part of his job in 
order to collate names to make an approach to some organisations 
including civil societies or how did this list come about?  That is what I 
am trying to understand.  The career diplomats I understand. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I do not have a problem it is just the other ones. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well political parties may approach 
20 
the President with the names you have – the examples you have made 
which reminds me of another lady who was from your profession Sheila 
Camara.  They approach – they can approach the political office and 
say, we have got these people available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 63 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  Minister if you 
may take – just turn – the same Volume FF3 – Exhibit FF3.  If you could 
just turn to page 45 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Are we back to FF3? 
ADV NORMAN:  Ff3 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Page 45.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry I ended up not getting an – the answer 
to the original question that I actually wanted. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think both the Minister and I forgot about that or 
maybe I forgot and the Minister thought she gave me the answer.  So 
the original question was, what is the purpose of taking the list of 
names to the President at – after the – the DG has given to – given 
them to the Minister?  What is the purpose of that?  Is it for the 
President at that stage to say, I am happy about these people or to 
make the selection of who as far as he is concerned – I wanted to – I 
was thinking whether I should say he or she?  Whether it is to get the 
approval at that stage of the individuals for the different postings or 
whether it is to get an idea whether he has any issues with them but he 
20 
is not at that stage making any final approval.  It is just to get an 
indication or what the purpose is? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The purpose Chair is to get an 
indication to say, we have got so many vacancies and we have got this 
approaches and this is our recommendation.  So he – from the time of 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 64 of 153 
 
President Mandela – well I was an Ambassador I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But from the time of President 
Mbeki and President Zuma they would say, go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And do your work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because they had the liberty to 
know that you still have six months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To process these people before 
they went.  During my time when I was appointed Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It took us three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To know everything and pack and 
wait for the agreema.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But as time went on we realised 
we need more time to bring the fairness.  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So the final – the final yes or nod 
from the President comes with when he signs off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes after he had the recommendation of the Minister? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Well yes.  After the – and 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 65 of 153 
 
then he signs off the names and then we quietly wait for the agreema 
from the receiving country.  But at the initial stages we will say, these 
are the vacancies.  We would not say, this one must go to work at 
Duggu, this one must go anywhere.  It is just to say here is a list of 
vacancies. Because – well maybe in the spirit of [indistinct] you just 
make yourself available you cannot say I also want to go there.  Not 
even Ambassadors [indistinct] said that to us.  He did not say, I want to 
go to London.  No.   He just avails him – availed himself and it was the 
prerogative of the President to say, I am sending you to this country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the purpose of that initial meeting between 
10 
the Minister and the President where you bring the … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  The number of posts and the names. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is for the President to give some indication if he has 
any problem with any of the names, is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he has no problem you then go back to do 
some further work? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – you said that during the time of President 
Mbeki and I think you said President Zuma as well they would say, go 
back and do your work. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 66 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I got the impression and you must tell me if my 
impression is right?  I got the impression that what you were conveying 
was they would not be too interested in looking at details or names at 
that stage.  They would say, go and do your work.  Is that what you 
mean? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well the details it is the work that 
– if I – there is political work that the Minister has to do the Minister 
has the executing authority to do that work.  The career diplomats are 
the responsibility of the also the DG to say, I have these men and 
10 
women who have served the country.  Maybe they have been serving 
also at headquarters for the past so many number of years or so many 
and so many and – or sometimes we do – we did and we – and I see 
the practice is continuing of shifting ambassadors from one area to the 
other because some would have been good in this and then shift them 
to the other areas where they could help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would you at that stage of that initial meeting with 
the President to get an indication of his attitude towards the filling or 
appointing the people there.  At that stage would you have their CV’s 
and so on and would that information be sent to him ahead of the 
20 
meeting so that when you meet he has had a chance to look at them?  
Or how would that work normally? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We – we will – we will deposit the 
CV’s but we will have to talk to the CV’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the CV’s yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 67 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so when you leave that meeting you have an – if 
the President has not indicated any difficulty with any particular name 
you would take it that in principle he has no problem with anybody but 
then you would know that you must still go and do political work about 
these names and later on you would then make a recommendation. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is after that recommendation that you would 
10 
know whether finally he approves or not.  Is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Because he will sign off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He would sign off ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No thank you very much.  And then maybe 
because – before Ms Norman continues.  Also the – you know when – 
when Ambassador Koloane was appointed there were talks about him 
being promoted.  What is the level or ranking of an Ambassador 
compared to a DG and also maybe even a – I do not know – maybe I 
want to say even compared to the Minister because I understand that 
20 
once somebody is an Ambassador to a country they represent the 
President but also I think they are referred to as Your Excellency and 
all of that.  So I just want to understand the ranking you know.  Is it a 
promotion if you have been at DG level?  Is it a promotion if you have 
been a Minister or is it a demotion if you have been a Minister?  Is it 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 68 of 153 
 
promotion – where does it rank? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair I would say it is an honour to 
carry a letter that says, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane represents the 
country in the whole of Malasia.  It is an honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So it can be former Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It can former Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It can be a former preacher. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But it is an honour.  It is never a 
demotion or a promotion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But I think it is an honour. But for 
postings like New York where you represent South Africa at the UN the 
practice has always been it must be someone with really real diplomatic 
experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It – does it like carry a particular prestige sometimes 
because of the location where you are posted?  Maybe prestige is a 
20 
wrong name, is a wrong word.  I am saying – I said – I asked the 
question whether if you are posted to the UN. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it carries a particular prestige, your posting 
and I am – I just said maybe prestige is a wrong word.   
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 69 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you wanted to talk about that part if you are 
posted to certain countries or certain bodies you say you might need 
special 
expertise 
and 
experience 
to 
be 
appointed 
to 
those 
ambassadorships? 
MINISTER 
NKOANA-MASHABANE:  
Well 
to 
– just 
to be 
an 
Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is an honour itself. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Is an honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So I think I over-extended the 
responsibilities, the heavy responsibilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That you carry as you move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess the point you are making is you may have 
a country which is such that in order for the representative of the 
President of the country there to be able to carry out his or her 
responsibilities properly they should have a certain level of experience 
20 
in that kind of job which might not be the same if it is another posting 
and so on depending on the demands and the responsibilities? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  From my little experience Chair I 
said it is an honour to serve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 70 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because I do not remember where 
you would say this is a small [indistinct] Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  This is one – this is a big one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because when you arrive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  They first – it is not automatic that 
when you are nominated by the President you will get a nod from the 
receiving country.  So when they receive you they have already done 
10 
their homework and they would be knowing who they are receiving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So – but I do not remember any 
other country.  Because I said earlier on because of the stature of our 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Where an Ambassador is sent and 
ignored. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  In fact more and more as we grow 
20 
into a democracy even the neighbourhood becomes very, very, very 
critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So whether it is near or far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Ja. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 71 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It becomes just that it is an 
honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To carry the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Of the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  With you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would I be correct in understanding your evidence in 
this regard to be to this effect?  That it may be something special to be 
10 
appointed as DG of a department, as Deputy DG of the department.  
Maybe it is even an honour okay.  But when you are appointed as 
Ambassador to represent the President, the Head of State and to 
represent your country in another country it is a special honour.  Is my 
understanding of what you are saying correct or not really? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair I think you are correct but 
also equally as soon as they pack up their bags and get into wherever 
they will be posted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  They also have to be responsible 
20 
for the PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So it is an honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But because we are South Africa. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 72 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  You run… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Just on the point Minister when you 
are an Ambassador in a country do you receive a salary from that 
country or do you retain your salary in South Africa? 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  In fact if – if we hear Chair that 
you have received anything from another country where you are 
supposed to be – even if you are hungry you have to pretend that you 
are full.  So we just hear that you are beginning to take… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Receive. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Receive things you come back 
home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So even if you go for three months 
20 
or four months and there is austerity measures and there is no food at 
home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The discipline of the Ambassador 
is keep – keep your flag 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 73 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tighten the belt. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Flying and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well I do not know whether Ms Norman… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So you do not receive – to respond 
to your question. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We – Ambassadors do not get paid 
by foreign countries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  They live on what they get from 
their own countries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Minister at page 45 of FF3.  Are you 
there? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you.  There is a list of heads of nation posts 
June 2014 cycle. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  When you were talking about this deployment are we 
referring to that list and when you answered to the Chairperson that 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 74 of 153 
 
you would have received a list from the DG, would that be the list of 
the countries that had vacancies? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe a question I should have asked earlier 
Minister.  The list of names that you would have – you would receive as 
Minister from the DG every six months or as I understand the position. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be a list – would the names as a norm be 
required to be more than the posts or would it need to be – there 
should be as many names as there are posts or there was no specific 
10 
rule? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We – we have now been so lucky 
as a – to have enough names at a given time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because of the maybe the – the 
fact that South Africa requires… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Some [indistinct] but we... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The list actually cautions that you 
20 
need people but not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No nothing specific 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 75 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But also not everybody can be an 
Ambassador waking up in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I am sure ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Minister.  And then if you turn over to the 
next page of the – page – from page 45 you have the letter – the 
submission that you made to the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page must we go to? 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Page 47 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  47. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes 47 of page of Exhibit FF3.  Now at this point then 
when you write to the President because you have already answered to 
the Chairperson that you would go to the President, you would discuss 
the vacancy list, possible nominees, at this point then when you the as 
a Minister start putting down a submission to the President would the 
country where the particular incumbent is going to be posted to, would 
that have been decided already by the President at this point when you 
make the submission? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Not necessarily.   
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  And then in this instance of the – of the letter 
which is dated 3 June which relates to Ambassador Koloane.  Would 
you have chosen that country for him? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We – we had a DDG sitting where 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 76 of 153 
 
there were Chair if you may allow me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  DDG’s apply on a regular – any 
DDG in any other department, regular applications.  DG’s apply 
regularly like all others.  When… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Apply for appointment? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  For the – for the positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be Ambassadors? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To be DDG’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To be DG’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Like I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I am saying internally they 
compete like anyone else.  But – so they can be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Minister again.  I do not know whether an 
attempt was made to put on the air conditioner. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is on but maybe it should be increased a 
little bit.  Yes, yes. I am sorry you may proceed Minister.  DDG’s apply 
bla, bla, bla. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  They apply and compete for the 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 77 of 153 
 
positions but Ambassadors are appointed internally and externally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without applying? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Without applying.  You cannot 
apply to become an Ambassador. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  You just make yourself available to serve 
that is all. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So the Ambassador Koloane 
happened to have been available when we had the vacancy in that 
particular country and because he had gone through all the processes 
which we referred to earlier on we put his name also.  And even the 
receiving country did not reject him.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Norman. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you Chair.  I see in paragraph 15 of the 
statement you – if I may just read that quickly? 
“During the June 2014 cycle placement he was 
considered for the posting together with 17 others.” 
20 
So were these 17 considered also for the Haigh or were they 
considered for the various countries that appear at page 45? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  There would have been 18 
vacancies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18? 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 78 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But we had to immediately fill in 
the 17.  But also then we had to look at as usual experience.  How do – 
after having sent the list and come back with the list, how do we deploy 
– how does the experience count on?  Because now we have internal 
people and external but we also have to consider experience.  That is 
how the name of Ambassador Koloane came  
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  So at this point then when you made the 
10 
recommendation is it correct Minister that in this submission that I have 
referred you at page 47. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  There is no mention of any disciplinary hearings, 
charges against him, having served any sanction, is that correct? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That would have been I think post 
punishment punishment.  When you nominate you nominate.  If there is 
a – we have six months to get queries as people go through training to 
say this one can go but this one had served if you like, if it is a jail 
time a time.  But he is also an experienced Ambassador.  So we had no 
20 
other way of keeping him paid, sitting at home doing nothing and we – 
we cannot say go home because we had no reason.   
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think Ms Norman it is important to read into 
the record the Minister’s letter to the President. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 79 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we could ask you Minister if you can read that 
letter? 
ADV NORMAN:  If you could read – yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page – you letter to the President at page 47.  
Have you got the page? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you.  Have you got it Minister page 47? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No. 
ADV NORMAN:  47. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  It is in the file – oh FF3 that file. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  FF3. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, yes that is the one.  Yes if you could just turn to 
page 47. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Can you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  47 would be at the – at the beginning. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay where is your – somebody helping you. 
ADV NORMAN:  I am sorry I have just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they just absent? 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, yes 47.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Sibeko. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 80 of 153

10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes and also signed by the President on the 4 June

ADV NORMAN:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes – your letter itself is dated 3 June 2014, is that 
right, on the first page? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  May I just ask Minister to turn to 
page 35 of the same bundle?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 35? 
ADV NORMAN:  35 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 82 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Although – although it is incomplete. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  You have pages I have [indistinct]. 
ADV NORMAN:  But I will just take – page 35.  Have you got it 
Minister? 35. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  If you just refer to the document it 
is better … 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh.  Sorry. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because here it is … 
ADV NORMAN:  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Numbers. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Alright.  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  She is going to assist.  Just turn to page 35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I - I am sorry. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister you - you cannot see the page numbers? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No. 
ADV NORMAN:  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The file I have is … 
ADV NORMAN:  It is - it is … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I said they must not … 
ADV NORMAN:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sabotage you. 
ADV NORMAN:  I - I think what confuses the - the Minister is that they 
had actually numbered the dividers themselves. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 83 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  So sometimes when you get to the divider you do not 
know whether there is actually a document underneath, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Then you - maybe when you … 
ADV NORMAN:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Refer … 
ADV NORMAN:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you refer her to a page maybe you must 
mention the divider … 
ADV NORMAN:  The divider number. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And under what - what divider the page … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The document is. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Are - are you there? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Page 35.  Although that paragraph is incomplete, but 
there is something that I would like to just deal with in response to 
some of the questions that you gave to the Chairperson’s questions, 
20 
but in paragraph 7 … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  It is stated by the Chairperson of the disciplinary. 
“The facts show that Ambassador Koloane abused 
diplomatic channels and took it upon himself to 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 84 of 153 
 
facilitate the illegal request of - for the landing of 
the aircraft.  In mitigation Ambassador Koloane 
admitted hereto error - due to error of judgment.  
He failed to verify if the Indian High Commission 
provided a note verbal to the department.  That was 
despite the fact that he is expected to be well 
versed with diplomatic protocol.” 
And then you went further by directly speaking to the common 
post Airforce Base Waterkloof and say that: 
“There would be four or five Ministers on the flight 
10 
and furthermore dropped the names of the Minister 
of Transport, Minister of Defence and the President 
in order to pressurise the command post to issue 
the clearance for the illegal landing of the aircraft.” 
But just taking all of the answers to the questions by the 
Chairperson you had said that the person - being a diplomat is an 
honour … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  And the person actually represents the country. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Now there is as finding that already he had abused 
diplomatic channels. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV NORMAN:  When you made the recommendation where you not at 
least - even in the very least concerned that having abused his 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 85 of 153 
 
diplomatic powers when he was State of Chief Protocol.  Would he not 
do the same when he was posted elsewhere? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well this is post all the sagas.  So 
you either - how do I bank a person in a department forever, because 
there is pre … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pre Waterkloof? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there is post Waterkloof and there is post 
disciplinary processes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  There is a post disciplinary 
process.  So how do you - and post six months - how do I keep the 
person coming to work and doing nothing and have experience, 
because even now he is now retired, but we do not have any record of 
anything untoward as to where he post the posting that is under 
discussion. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure if I follow what you are conveying Ms - 
20 
Minister.  Just start again. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I am saying Chair this is 2019.  We 
are still on the case of post disciplinary process of 2013.  He had been 
posted and he is back home and we have not had post the disciplinary 
processes and all that and post the post diplomatic posting.  There is 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 86 of 153 
 
no - like I said he showed contrition when he came back and we said 
him - and we had a vacancy and he was not selected out of - he was 
not the only nominee. 
There were 17 others at that time.  So if you - if you are a 
political person you would know that at The Hague there is no - there is 
no freestyling.  It is - it is about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  There is no freestyling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It is - if - if it is about somebody 
10 
who can abuse diplomatic immunities there is absolutely nothing to 
have, because it is not like being sent to a country where focus is on - 
on all the other things and save to say that it is - it is a place where we 
can send people who just understand diplomacy. 
So he was not sent to a big country or whatever, but that 
nomination was like any other but the considerations, because you are 
asking what consideration did you make also that we sent him to a 
limited space where there will be - that this contrition continued to be 
for this - for this for my career diplomat who is or current career 
diplomat who had had a mishap and had also sat and came back. 
20 
So we had no other way of keeping him at home and doing 
nothing, but we also were considerate of the fact that it - it cannot be 
that he is going to be in a space where he could have you know the 
opportunity to repeat the same mistake.  What I was trying to emphasis 
Chair was from what I am hearing he is now retired even from The 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 87 of 153 
 
Hague while we are still on the nomination. 
He has served and he has come back and there is no - there 
is no tell-tale evidence that he continued with the pre Bruce and we are 
on the post - post period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying that there is no record or indication 
that he - after he had been posted to The Hague he repeated what he 
had done? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I do not have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is that what you - you are saying? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is - it is important that I understand … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you are saying.  It is important that I 
understand your perspective. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How - how you viewed the whole situation … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do want to try and put myself as far as it is 
humanly possible … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In your position … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you made that recommendation, because I do have 
difficulties with it.  So that I can tell you, but I am interested in 
understanding your perspective … 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 88 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How you saw things so that I can see how that fits in.  
So that - that is why I keep on asking you … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you mean this or you mean that. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Continue Ms Norman. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  I beg your pardon.  Thank you 
Chair and then - so in other words if I - if I really - just to summarise 
the answer you have given to that Minister is that the fact that he had 
10 
abused previously diplomatic powers that he had was not a factor that - 
that you considered when you prepared your submission, because 
according to you there had been charges.  He had served his sanction 
so to speak? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  If you - if we look at all the 
nominees.  Even those, because when countries decline a nominee they 
do not do it in writing.  It is like if you apply for visa.  The country - the 
receiving country would not put it on your passport to say you are not 
passing here, but post the sanction I had no evidence - I still do not 
have - that he had not learned, but also there is not a single nominee 
20 
that even as a receiving country where they will say here are the good 
things about Maite.  Here are the sins. 
It is for the receiving country to say we cannot receive so - 
Maite because of the following, but that Waterkloof saga was all of the 
country.  It was known.  It was not a top secret.  He had been 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 89 of 153 
 
suspended.  He had served.  We had put a letter in his file.  The six 
months have passed and as we are sitting here I do not have evidence 
of him having done or abused or did this or that. 
I was trying to say Chair nominees from country A to E 
including South Africa do not say these are the good things that 
somebody has done.  These are the bad things he has done.  It is for 
the internal machinery to say so if we said we have suspended so and 
so.  He has done this. 
Post that what we do with the experience when it is 
necessary for us to utilise that.  Here we are also referring to the joint 
10 
disciplinary process that did not say fire him.  That did not say send 
him to jail.  None of the processes said he could not continue being a 
DDG. 
So if he qualified to continue being a DDG we saw no reason 
why he could not - we could not utilise his experience in that space for 
that time.  Like I was saying earlier on Chair with humility post that if 
the gates were closed in the other departments I am sure we would be 
speaking of a different thing today, because protocol - as I entered your 
gates here - here I am. 
This is protocol of your building.  So if I can observe this, 
20 
because your staff says so.  There is no way I could bring my own even 
as a Minister.  I have to comply.  So all departments also have their 
own rules and procedures.  If you all were to keep them tied I cannot 
work in there and say I am Minister of Woman, Youth and People with 
Disabilities. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 90 of 153 
 
Do not ask me to bring this and I get in here.  I was shown sit 
here.  You will have tea here.  Go there.  Wait.  This is protocol in 
short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE: 
 
Professionalism 
it 
is 
professionalism, because if all our civil servants were to do nothing 
after disciplinary procedures.  We would have nobody working.  If we 
were to follow also South African laws and labour laws and our 
Constitution and abide by it.  We are guided by the leadership. 
We are guided by the Constitution and our labour laws, but 
10 
also - so we - we are unable to punish post punishment.  This is where 
I humbly submit my appreciation of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman I thought your question was about the fact 
that the - Mr Koloane’s role in the Waterkloof landing … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the disciplinary process was not mentioned in 
this letter to the President … 
ADV NORMAN:  That is correct.  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and maybe the Minister has answered.  That 
maybe it is just that she went wider, but … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you see how you take it further. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 91 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Minister.  That - that answer you have given 
relates to now communicating to the outside world … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  What he had done … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  But then insofar as the President is concerned, 
because the portion that I read out in the sanction relates to him had 
abused his - his diplomatic powers and also having abused the name of 
10 
the President and Ministers. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV NORMAN:  In that regard was there a reason why you did not 
place that information before the President?  I know you have answered 
that it was known countrywide, but in your submission now as a 
Minister … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Was it not something that you said you would say to 
the President?  I would also want you to consider this.  This is the man 
that has actually abused you name, but I want - I - I would recommend 
20 
that you place him in The Hague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words if I can add … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To - to that question.  What - what counsel is saying 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 92 of 153 
 
is did you not consider it appropriate or necessary to inform the 
President that this person that you were recommending for appointment 
to receive this honour that you talked about. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To represent the President … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the country outside South Africa.  Did you not 
consider it necessary to bring it to his attention that this person you 
are recommending is somebody who played this particular role in 
regard to the Waterkloof landing which was such a big topic … 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you could say if you so choose, but 
notwithstanding that I recommend that you appoint him because of A, B, 
C, D.  You did not say that here and the question is did you not 
consider that it was necessary to place that before the President.  So 
that the President has a - had a full picture of this person you were 
recommending he should give this special - this honour to represent 
him in another country. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair the question you had - you 
are putting to me it is what I had already responded to … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But - but let me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please repeat. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Let me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it means I did not understand it. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 93 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes.  Nominations are standard, 
but discussions about names are also - like I said earlier on - if we put 
your name - if you apply for a visa you still need the passport.  If we 
stamp you know you an - an undesirable person.  The country that had 
issued the passport has the responsibility to say undesirable or to - or 
the individual can also say I had served my disciplinary process. 
So beyond the punishment what other punishment - all I am 
trying to say is that nomination letters are standard.  It is about the 
credentials of the person you are nominating.  The trespassers are the 
ones that we discuss.  So there was absolutely nothing secret about the 
10 
Waterkloof issue and that the joint disciplinary process and has gone 
through all the processes about him and he had come back now as a - 
so - you see. 
We - can we trust a person with being a DDG in a department 
and not have recommended firing him but find it difficult to nominate 
him.  The President had all the powers to say not this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you say to me you did not include that part in 
your letter to the President namely Ambassador Koloane’s role in the 
Waterkloof landing including what he was found guilty of in the 
disciplinary process and that he pleaded guilty to the three charges - 
20 
what those charges were. 
If you say I did not include it in the letter, because prior to 
writing the letter I had a discussion with the President where I informed 
him of all of those things.  Therefore I did not see the need to put it in 
the letter.  It is one thing, because then you are telling me I did inform 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 94 of 153 
 
the President of all of those things, but not in the letter. 
In a discussion.  If you say no I did not tell the President all 
of those things even verbally and I did not put it in the letter, because I 
believed that he knew those facts, because of A, B, C, D whatever A, B, 
C, D is.  Then I understand as well.  So the question relates to your 
own judgment of what to tell the President before he could make such a 
decision, but also it will - it relates to what did the President know 
about Mr Koloane’s role in the Waterkloof landing before he approved 
his appointment himself. 
Did he know that he pleaded guilty to these charges?  Did he 
10 
know that he had been found guilty and there had been sanction or did 
he not know about that, because it maybe that people might know what 
is in the public domain, but that disciplinary process might not have 
been in the public domain.  I am not sure.  So that … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is where I would like you to clarify. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair let me just with humility 
repeat that a nomination letter is procedural. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  A nomination letter … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That we firmly write … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It is a - it is a process, but each 
individual gets discussed, but when you write a nomination letter as a 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 95 of 153 
 
Minister.  You are saying the things that you think the person who can 
do in that particular area.  So tell the President, remind the President 
about the processes.  Yes. 
Every President has to be reminded of who Maite is.  She 
served as an MEC in Limpopo.  This is her role.  This is her - so it - it 
was not hidden.  So it was not - he was not appointed in secret.  Chair 
we also said earlier on post nomination there is a six month period 
where the Head of State can change his mind. 
He is not obliged because there was a nomination.  In fact a 
nomination is a suggestion.  He can say no to anybody.  Like - as he 
10 
appoints Cabinet.  He can say no.  I am putting this one here, there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he - whether he says no or yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Depends on what he knows … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what he is told. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the particular candidate. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hence the importance of the question.  Why is it that 
20 
you did not in your letter of recommendation to the President see it 
necessary to tell the President that this person that I am recommending 
has the following things that may be seen as negative, but here are my 
reasons why. 
That notwithstanding I am recommending that you should 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 96 of 153 
 
appoint.  So that you make sure that the President has a full picture 
about this person who must if appointed represent him in another 
country. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chairperson we have had many 
nominations.  Not all of them have gotten (indistinct) across the 
borders.  So when we nominate we nominate and we feel the discussion 
about the name.  That is a discussion with the Head of State so that he 
has full picture - as Chairperson is asking - of who is going where. 
So the nomination it is not an appointment, because Ministers 
do not have … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  That I understand Minister. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I understand. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So - so the - your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Was did we tell the President or 
remind him? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe - maybe we should start this.  Did you - 
20 
do you accept that when you nominate - when you nominated any 
candidate for appointment as Ambassador to … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Wherever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A President. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 97 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You needed to - you give the President concerned as 
full a picture of that person as possible.  Obvious in terms of things 
that are relevant. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I do accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a principle? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I also know that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As a principle … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Like I said I kept repeating that the 
nomination letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It is like if I apply for a visa.  So if 
I had trespassed somewhere.  It is for the - those who deal with issues 
on that level who must say trespassers will become a problem and it is 
the responsibility of the Minister of DIRCO to also talk to the President 
about each nominee. 
So, but it is the prerogative of the Head of State to say yes or 
20 
no.  He can say yes to the nomination and two months later says no to 
the actual appointment.  That is his prerogative.  So the nomination it 
is not the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no I understand that.  Let me ask the 
question pertinently.  Did you at any stage before the President at the 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 98 of 153 
 
time approved the appointment of Mr Koloane as Ambassador for The 
Netherlands?  Did you at any stage inform the President that this is the 
man who played quite a significant role in the Waterkloof landing and 
that this man had been subjected to a disciplinary process? 
He had pleaded guilty to three charges which included 
misrepresenting facts and which included that he had falsely told 
official - officials in the Defence Force that the President knew about 
the Waterkloof landing or had given instructions and that the Minister of 
Transport at the time and the Minister of Defence at the time had no 
objection or also said they had been instructed. 
10 
He pleaded guilty to - to that.  He was found guilty by - in a 
disciplinary hearing.  Did you ever place - obviously not necessary in 
these words that I am using, but the substance of what I am saying - 
did you place that before the President in a - in a discussion on any 
other form? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair, all nominees including 
Ambassador Koloane are or were discussed.  The nomination letter 
normally does not carry all the details about an individual be it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you say normally carries or did you 
say does … 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Does not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normally does not carry? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Does not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Carry, but the discussion do. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 99 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Earlier on we also referred to how 
open we are on nominations of Ambassadors that even those who are 
brought by political parties are brought in.  The check - you do not 
write the check - checklist on a nomination, because there are other 
agencies who have to do the checklist on the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Minister no I must interrupt you. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is simple. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you or did you not …? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At any stage inform the President of it? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was fully aware … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  He was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of who Koloane was … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that he is - he had gone through a process.  He 
had pleaded guilty blah, blah, blah. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He knew about that? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes, sir. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 100 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you.  So - so the fact that you did not put it 
in the letter does not mean that you did not tell him? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Thank you Minister. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  No Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank - thank you Chair and then just maybe lastly 
Minister there is at page 50 if you just turn over the page.  There is 
that - the agreement is that what you referred to from the - from The 
Hague.  At page 50 Minister there is from - do you have it? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Page 50. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 5-0 - 5-0? 
ADV NORMAN:  5-0. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think somebody must assist the Minister. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Go and assist the Minister. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes …(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Is - is that the agreement that you referred to earlier 
that then after the nominees then - that the receiving country then 
20 
sends that - that agreement to South Africa? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you and then at the last paragraph at page 
- if you go back to your statement Minister - page 16.  You have also 
mentioned 
other 
factors 
that 
made 
you 
recommend 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 101 of 153 
 
Ambassador Koloane.  Although you have dealt with that aspect, but I 
would want you to just put those on record so that we do not leave out 
anything in your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Did you page 16? 
ADV NORMAN:  Back to the statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Paragraph 16 - 1-6. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Which - which statement. 
ADV NORMAN:  Your - this one - this one. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Oh.  This one?  Yes. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  That one.  Yes your statement. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Paragraph 16. 
ADV NORMAN:  I - I apologise.  Sorry. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  At page - that will be the last page of your statement. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hu-uh. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  There … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry Ms Norman.  Page 3 of the 
statement? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  That is page 3 and paragraph 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 102 of 153 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  So could you just read out those are the 
considerations that you placed in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair, I have said in the affidavit 
that: 
“It must be noted that Mr Koloane was the most - 
the most eligible amongst DDGs since he was not 
assigned to any departmental branch.  Therefore 
his 
nomination 
could 
not 
have 
affected 
the 
department’s operation or any vacancies within the 
department.  At that time he also had a top secret 
10 
clearance certificate.  Therefore meeting all the 
criteria for the placement.  When Mr Koloane was 
nominated or recommended for the posting to The 
Hague he had already completed his sanction.” 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I just want to emphasise … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The paragraph 17 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  For the record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do - oh, you - you want to high - highlight that. 
“At that time he also had a top secret clearance 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 103 of 153 
 
certificate.  Therefore meeting all the criteria for 
the placement.” 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  And - and Minister one thing I did not ask you right at 
the outset when you started testifying was whether this is your 
statement, but could you do that now?  That - is that your signature 
that appears there? 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chairperson, this is a copy of an 
affidavit of as a witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To this hearing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chaired by your good self. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And the signature is mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is yours … 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
ADV NORMAN: 
 
And 
you 
deposed 
to 
that 
affidavit 
on 
18 September 2019 in Cape Town? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes sir. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 104 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  That is the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister I - I had thought that we would finish earlier 
than - than lunchtime.  We have taken longer than I thought and maybe 
I also contributed to that, but we reach the lunch time at a time when I 
still have some questions to - to put to you.  So I thought we would be 
able to finish before lunch and we will disperse.  So - so we are going 
to take the lunch break, but I would like us to come back.  Is that fine 
10 
with you? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we - we are going to come back at 2 o’ clock, 
because there  
ADV NORMAN:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are still quite some things that I would like to 
hear the Minister on. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We adjourn.  We will come back at 2 o’ clock.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 105 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...of what a top secret clearance certificate says 
about a person who holds it.  What is your understanding of what 
possession a top secret clearance certificate means for the holder of 
that certificate?   
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   It means…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the aircon might be creating some problems, if 
you can lower it a little bit, maybe let me repeat the question Minister 
so you can understand. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question is what is your understanding of what 
10 
it means about a person if it is said he or she has a top secret 
clearance certificate, what does that convey to those who know that 
this person has got that certificate? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   It will be that the department or 
the agency that does this work of checking had done their job on that 
particular person.  For every senior SMS you are appointed after the 
appointment then there’s a thorough going on your status. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but that’s what I want, obviously there’s some 
work that the people who issue the certificate must do before they 
issue it but I want to try and understand in the context of the position 
20 
of Ambassador but maybe that applies to everyone who gets the 
certificate whether it means you are highly educated, whether it means 
you are a person of integrity, whether it means you are hard-working, 
whether it means you are very particular about doing your job the right 
way.  So I’m wanting to get, when you emphasise as you do this 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 106 of 153 
 
requirement, there must be something that is important about it in the 
context of an Ambassador and I’m trying to understand, exactly what 
that is. 
MINISTER 
NKOANA-MASHABANE: 
 
 
You 
have 
to 
have 
all 
those…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s all of the above? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   All of the above but also it’s done 
regularly, it’s not like – because …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You got it ten years ago…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Ten years ago it’s okay, if I’m 
10 
given another assignment I must be checked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   And I must be cleared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   That’s why it is said at that time 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how regularly do they do – re-do them do you 
know or at that time did you know how regularly they would do them 
if…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   For every appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 107 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:     Before the Ambassador 
designated, leaves the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Because we had, had some areas 
where we had to bring back somebody who was already on a posting 
and it wasn’t cheap. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   So every nominee had to wait for 
that clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so when you have been issued it in regard to a 
10 
particular appointment it doesn’t necessarily mean…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Forever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is going to be – they’ll do another checking 
after a year or two or three, it just means you have it until there is 
another appointment, if there is another appointment then you must be 
subjected again.  
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   No even if you would have gotten 
it a year earlier, if you are going to a new assignment they come back, 
yes because we just found it to be important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now all of the above that we talked about that 
20 
you’ve got to have them that’s in terms of a top secret clearance 
certificate but I take it that also for being appointed as Ambassador all 
of the above applies there as well, is that right, is that correct? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay now in your own words are you able to say 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 108 of 153 
 
to me – to tell me what the factors or requirements are that are 
expected to be taken into account before a person is recommended to 
the President for appointment as Ambassador.  Now I know that maybe, 
all of the above that we have said apply but I just want you to, in your 
own words to say, these are the factors or requirements that, as far as 
you understood at the time that you were Minister of International 
Relations were applicable? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   That you can stand for your 
country against all odds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you can serve your country…[intervenes]. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   You can serve and stand for the 
interest – for the National interest of your country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Against all odds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All odds, okay so that’s the overall one? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   That’s the overall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but you say included in it…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Included in that Chair I did say 
earlier on that if we know that you can or you have accepted an airline 
ticket at – not two years ago but as you were serving in that foreign 
20 
country you come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you accepted a? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   An airline ticket from Cape Town 
to Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, you come back immediately? 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 109 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes you come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because that’s unacceptable. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes because you cannot be – you 
are a guest you are there to build relations yes even if you’re a 
vegetarian and they give you Pork, you find a way to say I’m allergic so 
that you don’t sound – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes alright.  So there may be many factors that come 
in but the overall one is whether that person can serve the country and 
stand for his or her country against all odds. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine.  Now I just want us to go back 
to FF3 will be written on the spine FF3 and then I want us to go to the 
document – the ruling of the Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry 
relating to – the one relates to sanction the other one relates to 
whether or not Mr Koloane was guilty of the charges.  So I want us to 
go to the one relating to whether he was guilty of the charges and I 
think it is to be found at page 25 of that bundle.  If you need assistance 
somebody can come and assist you, I think approach the Minister and 
assist her.  You’ve got it, okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We already dealt with what the charges were and 
they included charge two where the Chairperson recorded at paragraph 
ten which is at page 26 that, 
 
“it is alleged that the employee misrepresented facts in an 
 
endeavour to procure the illegal and unlawful and/or wrongful 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 110 of 153 
 
 
landing”, 
 
And that refers to the landing of the commercial aircraft at 
Waterkloof.  In paragraph three on that page, the Chairperson records 
some objection that Mr Koloane seems to have expressed and then in – 
at page 27 he refers to the fact that the employer representative 
argued that the charges are as stated above and the evidence in 
support of the charges was intended to show the employee the 
evidence that was going to be led to prove each charge, then under 
four it says,  
 
“the parties asked for the adjournment of the proceedings in 
10 
 
order to deliberate among themselves on the point raised by 
 
the employee”, 
 
Then at paragraph five – I think five and six are quite 
important and seven he says, 
 
“when the matter resumed the employee informed me that he 
 
is ready to plead to the charges as captured above with the 
 
exclusion of the facts and evidence in support of the 
 
charges”, 
 
And then in six he says, 
 
“The employee pleaded guilty to all three charges, I went 
20 
 
through each charge in order to satisfy myself that the 
 
employee understands the elements of each of the charges, 
 
the employee persisted with his guilty plea on each charge, 
 
then he says under seven, I consequently find the employee 
 
guilty of charges one, two, thee”. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 111 of 153 
 
 
Now it seems to me that what this tells me – tells us is that 
Ambassador Koloane pleaded guilty to, among others, a charge that he 
had misrepresented facts in an endeavour to procure the illegal and 
unlawful and/or wrongful landing.  My understanding of his evidence, 
because he did give evidence here, I did not understand him to dispute 
that part but also one of the things that he said when he was giving 
evidence here was that he admitted that in effect, he had told some 
officials that the President knew about the aircraft that was going to 
come and land or had given instructions or had put him under pressure.  
One of these might be wrong but in effect, he admitted that he had 
10 
conveyed to certain officials at Waterkloof that he – the President knew 
about what he was trying to get them to do to facilitate the landing of 
the aircraft.  Now – and he said here that, that was not true, in other 
words what he had told those officials was not true.   
My understanding is that that, that’s what he also said in the 
disciplinary hearing, I think when he was here he may have said – he 
said the same thing at another forum and I can’t remember the 
Committee that he talked about what it is called.  Now it seems to me 
that he had been dishonest in saying to those officials anything along 
the lines that the President had either asked him to assist or had put 
20 
him under pressure or had instructed him.  Now that is on his version, 
if he – if we take his version, namely the President never instructed 
me, the President never put pressure on me, the President did not know 
about the landing as far as I know, that is Mr Koloane here before me, 
if that is true he had said something contrary to that, to the officials 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 112 of 153 
 
and it seems to me that he had been dishonest, would that be your 
understanding of what it amounted to, what he said, namely the 
President gave instruction or knew about this but then he comes and 
says, no the President didn’t know about this, I didn’t speak the truth 
when I said that to the officials? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be your understanding as well? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes now was that your understanding also at the 
time, after the disciplinary process that he had actually acted 
10 
dishonestly by invoking the names of the President and the Ministers, 
the two Ministers in order to try and get this landing approved or 
cleared? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   My answer Chair, is yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   But to add on that is that, in fact I 
recall now that there were two disciplinary processes, the one in the 
department and the joint one.  So none of the two disciplinary 
processes had said let’s punish beyond this.  So because there were 
two, one was a DCPS one was a departmental one, none of them had 
20 
concluded that he needed to be however fired or you know sent to jail 
or something.  So what leg would I be standing on when they said now 
– he had served the term he’s back in the department so what do you 
do with this DDG because none of those two processes could strip him 
of the status…[intervenes]. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 113 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   His position. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   His position, so because I mean if 
I had stolen I’d go to jail so the person confesses, he shows remorse 
and I think that’s what we need, how many people are we rehabilitating 
in our Criminal Justice System who we can point at and say, that one 
we gave a chance and look at him now, he is straight and proper.  So 
we had to weigh the two because here is a man who doesn’t hide from 
my sitting or my understanding behind every whatever, he – I was 
watching him on television when he was …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he gave evidence. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:     Gave evidence yes it was the 
same, same that I asked the day I saw him, did you remember you’re 
the Minister he cried.  So I am now here before you wondering, when 
there were two disciplinary processes when DIRCO does not own an 
airport when those two processes, the JPCS cluster one was like a 
panel meeting. None could come out with this man had confessed to 
what he had done wrong, he had never wasted anybody’s time so why 
is – at least one of the disciplinary processes not saying, this one don’t 
touch ever again but he must remain in his position.  It’s not like he 
had run away or hidden anywhere, suspend he does – there’s nothing 
20 
that we said he must not do or do that he didn’t do but also the people 
who know the law the ones who ran the two processes none of them 
said, this man we decide he must never serve.  Did not say he deserves 
to be fired so the wrongdoing it’s not what I can ever stand up and 
defend but I am still saying, did we rehabilitate him, did we manage to 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 114 of 153 
 
– as a country as a community squeeze something good out of this, I 
think that’s what was the [indistinct] at the time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well you have gone ahead to a part that I was 
still going to come to but that’s fine.  I just want to read some excerpts 
of how one of the witnesses who came here, former Minister 
Ramatlhodi viewed this whole Waterkloof landing.  I’ll just really read 
some excerpts from his evidence he says, 
 
“now my attitude, I did not know these people, they came in  to 
South Africa and one day I met correctional services that a  private jet 
lands at Waterkloof Air Force Base carrying  
wedding 
and 
10 
people, wedding people.  That for me was the  
last insult, I mean 
it was a stab at the back for those who  
died because there were 
many who died when I was there  with 
them 
that 
we 
should 
get 
foreigners, they come in here  
and then they land a wedding charter 
in our Air Force Base.   
So we had a meeting of the Security Cluster 
because I was  
sitting in correctional services, I told my fellow 
Ministers that  
this is the last insult, this cannot happen in our 
country from  
then inside we told the President, do not attend that 
wedding,  
do not do it because you have just messed up”, 
 
And then later on he was asked whether the President did 
20 
attend and he said, 
 
“Not only did they land there they actually got even the 
 
escorts of the security everything to that place there” 
 
And then later I put a question to him, 
 
“Was it your understanding that the landing of those 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 115 of 153 
 
 
aeroplanes there could not have happened without his 
 
knowledge or approval or not necessarily, I’m just asking that 
 
because you are saying that you said to him, you know I think 
 
you must tell me if I did not hear you properly, you said to 
 
him you have messed up this is not acceptable.  This  is not 
 
done or something like that then Minister Ramatlhodi says, 
 
we said to him, Mr President it is unacceptable that a private 
 
jet carrying wedding party from another country lands at our 
 
Air Force Base, we had fought for this base to be under our 
 
command so it is not acceptable, so do not grace this thing 
10 
 
by going to the wedding, in addition to what has already 
 
happened and then he says, I had a feeling that it could not 
 
happen without his knowledge and in fact there was talk like 
 
that because the Chief of Protocol in the Presidency, 
 
Ambassador, I forget his surname, he was in Holland now 
 
because after that he had to be redeployed to Holland and 
 
then later he says, so apparently that fellow got a call from 
 
number one as they called him those days and then he says,  
 
then he authorised the landing, then he says – he was asked, 
 
where did you hear about that if I may ask, how did you learn 
20 
 
about what you have just told us, that number one was called 
 
then he says, well we have meetings in the ANC we spoke 
 
most of us.  I cannot say I got it from so and so or the other 
 
one but my impression was precisely that he actually 
 
authorised it and then later he says, you see Chair,  Presidents 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 116 of 153 
 
I’ve got friends in the business community and so  on 
they 
do 
see 
people and so on but these ones, I felt they  
were insulting even 
the President because what they were  
doing was to show off, you 
know that they had captured the  Republic it is theirs.  They are not 
Presidents but they can  land at an Air Force Base, later he says, so 
it’s just important  
that we get that full picture, so I just invite 
you – oh that’s me  
talking to him, he says, Chair what happens 
at the Air Force  Base of South Africa is only Heads of States land 
there and  
when they land we receive them with all the protocols 
either  
one Minister or the other is sent to go and do that but on this 
10 
 
occasion, this aeroplane from India just landed there.  
 
There was preparations because even the traffic cops 
 
were escorting those busses which were going to North West, 
 
so he says, so it was well planned reception which could not 
 
happen 
without 
higher 
authority 
knowing, 
while 
they 
 
mobilised even the Municipalities to provide security for 
 
those busses that went there”. 
 
I think those are the parts I wanted to read.  On his evidence 
he viewed this Waterkloof landing of a private aircraft in a very, very 
serious light, many people did, from what you said, I think you also – 
20 
you viewed it very seriously because you say, what he did, that you 
cannot condone, I think you say but you talk about what to do after that 
has happened. So he – Minister Ramatlhodi was saying this was very 
serious, now I understand him to – when he says they were showing 
off, I understand him to be saying in effect, you know that place is a 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 117 of 153 
 
special place, Heads of State land there, these people are not 
Presidents but look at what they do in our country.  They want to show 
that, look we are in charge, we land where the Presidents land and 
when you view it like that, certainly for me how bad it was, comes back.  
Is that also the way you see it or maybe you might put it in your own 
way to see how seriously you view it? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Chair I view it as seriously as 
you’re saying but I also say to myself, the high security zone cannot be 
run by one man in a suit and he’s allowed.  We should be sitting here 
talking about how they could not land even with Koloane but we are 
10 
having a different conversation.  Something went not so right but if it 
went right the joint cluster could have come out with a sanction that 
says something else that would have made it difficult, even for the 
name dropper to escape it.  So if it’s just about name dropping and all 
of us came back to this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Minister I am sorry to interrupt you. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are times when I just want you to talk in 
general. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the principle. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In general not whether it is Koloane or whatever. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then when we talk about Koloane we can talk about 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 118 of 153 
 
him. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want at this stage how you viewed this thing 
irrespective of who made it possible? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I want at this stage. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I – Chair could only represent what 
I see as a wrong doing particularly what you are quote – you are 
quoting a man I worked with Ramatlhodi who was once my Premier who 
served in the DCPS at that time and post that he became Minister of 
10 
Mining.  So all those who said this was wrong remained in positions. So 
I think it was a lesson for all of us not to lower our guard and take all 
our security responsibility to 1% because I do not know how we all 
thought he should be carrying the security of the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are you talking about now? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I am talking about the entire 
people who were supposed to be supporting the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The entire gambit.  The officials, 
political otherwise. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It really shamed us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But it also gave us a wakeup call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 119 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So that is all I want to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No thank you.  That … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But I really do not want to 
represent other Ministers and former. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I accept. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And current. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You talk for yourself? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I will be saying things. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That they will say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  You know she was trying to 
represent us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I do not want to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But I was raised with norms that 
say no is no. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes is yes and that I respect it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No that – that is helpful Minister.  Now I think 
what could have been done and what could not have been done with 
regard to Ambassador Koloane afterwards would be influenced in part – 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 120 of 153 
 
I am not saying it is the only thing.  But in part by how we view the 
incident. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is at one level.  Then there is the question of 
him having misrepresented facts in order to get the landing to be 
approved as I understand his position.  So part of my difficulty with 
your decision to recommend him for appointment as an Ambassador 
stems from this that I understand that in order to be an Ambassador – 
in order to be conferred with this honour that you talked about which 
you get when you are appointed by the President as Ambassador to 
10 
represent the President in a foreign country, to represent the nation of 
the country in another country.  That honour requires that at least you 
must be somebody of integrity.  You must be somebody who is honest.  
Now I do not know about you but my thinking is that somebody who 
uses the name of the Head of State in this way of Ministers and says, 
the President knows about this aircraft.  Or the President is putting 
pressure on me or the President has instructed that this should be done 
when actually he knows that is not true is not honest.  Is that – is that 
your thinking as well? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair my response is yes.  But all 
20 
the leaders who were at the helm at the time will say I think – I am 
talking particularly about Ministers.  There is a sign of – there is at the 
end the one who must say yes and no after two disciplinary hearings 
could not say, take this man to jail.  Like – could not say, it was like he 
gave you a wakeup call that you are not doing what you are supposed 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 121 of 153 
 
to be doing.  So how I wish we could be sitting here and I am 
responding to how the GCPS cluster – how everybody who had had a 
view on this matter had suggested something else and there was no 
discussion about a DDG going back to work.  Why are we not equally 
worried about what does a DDG do in a government department?  I 
believe all departments are sensitive and the little I know is that in the 
absence of a DDG, in the absence of DG the – a DDG acts.  So the 
entirety of government was still okay with him serving as a DDG.  So I 
agree with you fully but I think we even saved that space by just 
removing this person out of that big responsibility of still being sitting 
10 
here in the area. But he also helped us by confessing. He did not have 
to jive and bring lawyers and things and run this way or that way.  But 
at the end this one voice guided by all this disciplinary hearings that he 
said.  I actually am humbled that you reminded me of Ramatlhodi my 
big brother.  Because half the things you are saying you are saying he 
was referring to I did not read about.  I was part of them.  I do not – I 
did not read about Ramatlohodi [indistinct].  We slept in the same – 
under the same roof.  So the way he felt should be the way I felt 
because we believed in one cause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now – no I understand that Minister.  I think we – we 
20 
are on the – up to a certain point at least so far we are on the same 
level I understand what – how you viewed the situation.  It seems to me 
that what you would do with him as somebody occupying the position of 
DDG in the long term was something that was an important factor in 
your mind.  Am I right?  In making the decision to recommend him. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 122 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I would say part of because he had 
gone through all the processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The disciplinary hearing of the 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And of the joint security cluster. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  None of them said, take him to jail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now let … 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But send him back to the 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us talk about the joint security cluster.  I do 
not know whether that was the correct term for the committee. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we know what – which committee we are talking 
about.  My understanding is that they were investigating what the facts 
were. 
ADV NORMAN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me.  I have not refreshed my memory on their 
20 
report recently but I do not think they would have had power to say he 
must be dismissed or not.  And I – I doubt whether in their report they – 
they were going – they would go that far.  Because they would – were 
not the disciplinary committee of the department. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:   Yes Sir. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 123 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that you say there were two 
disciplinary… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hearings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hearings. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you mentioned that committee. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be – that might not be correct because 
they were not a disciplinary process.  You accept that?  They were a 
fact finding committee not for purposes of disciplining anybody.  Is – 
10 
are you with me? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair my understanding is in fact 
finding you could also document that you know if things were equal this 
could have happened.  You cannot say I am fact finding but you are 
running very serious security of the matters of security in a country and 
we just say, no everything else can go let us ask this woman why did 
she recommend this man. And – but he can be let loose even with the – 
the fact – they were not fact finding period.  They could not lock him up 
but they could have made it easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They could say he should be – they could say 
20 
something along the lines that your department should consider 
initiating a disciplinary process.  They could say that I would imagine. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We had already in fact Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We were ahead. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 124 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you were already? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We were ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because we appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The veracity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Of the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but what I am saying is it would not have been 
their place to say what the sanction should be for him in circumstances 
where there was a separate disciplinary process that would deal with 
that issue.  They – they – it would not have been right for them to – 
that is what I am thinking and you can just tell me. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – for them to pre-empt. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair – I – I am listening to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And I am listening to what you 
20 
saying my brother said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And knowing him if all those were 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 125 of 153 
 
sat there and they felt they have the right to all walk at the same time 
and go to the President and say, President this is not on.  It did not 
happen.  So it cannot be that the whole – I do not know if Chairperson 
indeed we can say the security of the country can be relegated to one 
individual and we say we are all safe.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No not necessarily.  I do not know whether when you 
talk about one individual you refer to Ambassador Koloane  I am not 
talking about – that is the only. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I am actually not referring to him 
but I am saying. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The reason why we have – we 
should be having so many of us guarding the interests security, 
economic, well-being of our citizens is that all of us take this 24 hour 
job serious.  And that if they say if President says Maite this is your 
responsibility for now.  I leave no stone unturned and I cannot have 
somebody visiting and doing something and I explain later how that 
person used name dropping and so on and so on.  I do not want to get 
into that Chair.  But I am just saying that I think me, you we need to do 
more to be secure.  All of us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see – you see Minister part of what needs to 
be done when a problem has arisen when something like this 
Waterkloof landing has happened is to establish the roles of different 
people. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 126 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to see who did not do his or her job properly.  
And we are not going to see that if we – if we do not look at the roles 
of individuals. We just deal with people collectively.  We have got to 
see what did you do?  What were you supposed to do?  Did you do what 
you were supposed to do?  Did you not do what you were supposed to 
do?  Why did you not do what you were supposed to do?  Because we 
have got to find out how did this happen.  I do not know about you but 
on the evidence that I have heard and what I am saying about some of 
these things is what I am thinking at this stage and it is not my final 
thoughts.  They are not my final thoughts.  My final thoughts will be 
10 
when I finish the whole work of the commission.  But what – what – part 
of what I am thinking at this stage provisionally is that whatever we say 
Mr Koloane played – to say the least – a very significant role. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In enabling Waterkloof landing to happen. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he told certain key officials something to the 
effect that this is what the President wants.  So that is – we are 
therefore legitimately trying to enquire if this is the role that this 
person played and subsequently he was appointed as Ambassador.  A 
20 
position with such honour.  What was the understanding of those who 
had a role in his appointment?  What were they – what did they know 
about his role and what was their perspective?  Maybe they saw 
matters differently and that is part of the reason why I am trying to 
benefit from your own perspective to say, look I was the Minister who 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 127 of 153 
 
recommended – who made the recommendation to the President.  This 
is what was in my thinking.  Yes I see that what he did was very wrong.  
See actually that maybe he played a very significant role but 
nevertheless this was my thinking.  I think we are one at saying he 
played to say the least a significant role in enabling the landing to 
happen. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are one on that? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And we are one – we have already reached 
10 
agreement that he had acted dishonestly in telling officials that the 
President and the other Ministers had –knew about this or had 
instructions. We are one on that as well, is that right? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We are one and also  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I have worked with government 
officials for the past I do not know twenty years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Or since we became … 
CHAIRPERSON:  25 years or more. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  They can actually exhaust you 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 128 of 153 
 
Minister in demanding paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So how telling and telling and 
telling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Could make everybody believe, 
believe, believe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Actually says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Like I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Officials should have – have taken 
responsibility together at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We suspended him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Without pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We put him or on his file for six 
20 
months something else that says, this man must be watched.  But when 
he has to come back into the department and become the same, same – 
not Chief of Protocol but DDG we felt maybe if he is somewhere in a 
corner we will be more – we can be thinking straight.  I think lessons 
learnt is what do officials do with paper and processes where they can 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 129 of 153 
 
actually frustrate a well-meaning Minister or what can they not do by 
just saying, we were told?  This one told this one that.  This one told 
this one that.  And one person becomes the teller of the stories – 
others I do not care because the outcome of our process was about the 
official in the department.  But as Chair had said earlier on we almost 
put the country at risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  It could have been bigger. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But if there was no post-mortem 
10 
that says besides giving this man all the powers again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Be a DDG.  And let us go all go be 
happy.  Who else was being interested in doing [not speaking into the 
microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry the microphone was off. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I am saying that lesson learnt 
would be that we need to secure ourselves with our learned officials. 
So if we had recommended that he goes somewhere and they – we are 
serving the same government.  They could have said no. We had – this 
man did not leave the following day.  There were six months in between 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 130 of 153 
 
where if anyone had a feeling that he should be stopped could have.  
They were all there and just a nomination alone of a person who 
everybody was happy with him going back to where he came from I do 
not know whether this contrition, this sense of remorse could have 
borne some few or little fruits for the country.  But I think lesson learnt 
we have not – I do not think we – we are – I do not know if this – 
through your process we will say – we will say lesson learnt.  Let us 
use bureaucracy for the good and for the security of our country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you said that they were all there, they knew 
about his nomination I take it you meant the cabinet, you meant 
10 
security, peoples officials, high officials in security – in the security 
cluster that many of them would have known he has been nominated 
and nobody came to approach you and said, no but how can you make 
this person an Ambassador. Is my understanding correct? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay. Now – but… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But we were trying to do 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No I understand that ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  In the absence of… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  How do we just all keep quiet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And do nothing about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 131 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Post.  Because we – we were – we 
are now dealing with post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That explains. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We could have just all gone quiet 
and went to sleep. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But we did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now what do you say to somebody who says this 
10 
person’s conduct in relation to the Waterkloof landing that is Mr 
Koloane and the findings made in the disciplinary enquiry including his 
own plea of guilty to the charges that included misrepresenting facts, 
telling officials that the President knew about the – this or wanted this 
to happen or something to that effect.  That this person lacked integrity 
and therefore lacked an important requirement or – or quality that 
somebody who must be given the honour that you were talking about to 
represent the Head of State and the country should have.  This person 
did not have this very important quality and therefore you should not 
have recommended him. What do you say to somebody who says that? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I would say for me who had worked 
with Koloane it is like we are talking about two people.  Because we are 
referring to a man who has been an Ambassador before had helped jack 
up our protocol, had wronged, had come out without making people get 
into corners and said, I did something wrong.  And post that he went 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 132 of 153 
 
and served and came back voluntarily on retirement to say, what did we 
do with the rest of the saga?  Did we ever sit back and reflect on what 
Ramatlhodi was saying, the other party?  So that is what I am saying.  
The honour he did before, he wronged, he was punished, he went back, 
served and came back.  So I am dealing with two Koloane’s.  The one 
who could be an excellent representative who could do wrong and does 
not hide – you know that some cases even in – are in the labour courts 
forever and they do not come out because lawyers and so on and so on 
I am sure you no better.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Lawyers and so on and so on. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And so on.  This one did not waste 
time.  He just came out and when given an opportunity post servicing 
his term he went back and represented South Africa well and came 
back.  So I am dealing with two Koloane’s.  By the way the same 
Koloane that Ramatlhodi will say he knew the activist in the camps.  He 
also might have been served by an Ambassador in Spain or Consul 
General in Shanghai at one stage or the other I do not know.  So Chair 
I think we are dealing with a case that needs lessons to learn. But do 
we – do we like to chase those who come out and confess?  Or do we 
like to – to protect those who hide and make us to go on a wild goose 
20 
chase and the security of our country is over-exposed?  I think this is 
an opportunity for us to reflect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What about this?  That there are certain things that if 
you are guilty of that if you have done. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 133 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are such that it does not matter what academic 
qualifications you may have.  It does not matter what good you may 
have done before. But if you have done that you do not deserve certain 
appointments.  You do not deserve certain honours.  Not that your track 
record is not being recognised. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not because your high academic qualifications are 
not being recognised but because somewhere a line must be drawn.  
You cannot for example say, I admit that I have raped this child. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But because I have admitted and because I was in the 
struggle … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when I working in that job - in that job I did 
so well.  Please just give me a suspended sentence. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have to go to jail. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think some of the people in the country would 
look at Mr Koloane’s role in - in the Waterkloof landing incident and the 
20 
seriousness of the Waterkloof landing incident and his dishonesty using 
even the name of the Head of State to achieve what he wanted.  To 
shame the whole country and say that person did not deserve to be 
given the honour of representing the Head of State of this country. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 134 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No matter who the incumbent is. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Head of State of this country and to represent us 
as a nation in another country because that is a special honour.  That 
should never have done … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have happened and we do not understand how 
Minister Nkoana Mashabane recommended this person … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Against this.  Please use this opportunity to deal with 
10 
somebody who might look at it that way. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I would say to South Africans 
mothers who are dealing with gender based violence and femicide that 
we need to be truthful and deal with issues at hand and start with 
dealing with the most immediate at hand.  The appointment of an 
Ambassador 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Head 
of 
State.  
Recommendations come. 
Whoever is incumbent the buck stops with whoever is the 
Head of State and who does he want representing him wherever, but we 
should help our leaders as you said.  That we deal with issues together.  
20 
Not that when it gets tough we lead by taking corners.  I cannot over 
emphasise that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us assume that you were still Minister of 
International Relations now … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 135 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the facts relating to Waterkloof had happened 12 
months ago. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you and - and Mr Koloane had played the role 
that we now know he played. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you have been able now to recommend him for 
appointment as Ambassador? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  For all the officials serving in our 
Government.  If they have so - being so wrongful they need to go to 
10 
jail.  If they had served terms as you said correctional services.  How 
do we rehabilitate them?  By them doing what they are good at or by 
sending them - them to the gallows for having been wrong. 
I think there we can be assisted by law experts as to what 
does our Constitution and labour law say.  Once wrong you go to the 
gallows even if you have shown remorse.  When we are unable to deal 
with people who are raping and maiming our mothers and children at 
this hour.  We have challenges - you said earlier on Chair. 
You thought we would finish before break.  We spent the 
whole day here with your patience dealing with the matter of 2013.  I do 
20 
not know when I get out of here how many women would have been 
slaughtered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know Minister, part of the problem starts with 
what our values are as people.  What is our sense of right and wrong? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 136 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do we visit wrongful conduct with consequences 
… 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or do we paper over the cracks. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might - we might be dealing with gender based 
violence, people raping children, people raping women, people raping 
elderly women who cannot defend themselves, but it may be starting 
somewhere. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are our values?  What values do we insist on?  
What are the standards … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we insist on.  Is the standard that we insist on 
that somebody can say the Head of State said we must allow this head 
of this - this aircraft to - to land here and therefore influence other 
officials to say - to think the Head of State wants this to happen and 
something that - that shames the whole country happens … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when it has happened we recommend that that 
20 
person who admits to having said - done this, knowing that it is wrong.  
We say to the Head of State give him the honour to represent you 
outside the country and to represent us as a nation. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The Head of State even as I am 
sitting here can take advice, can appear and I have seen him appearing 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 137 of 153 
 
- former Head of State here in the Commission.  I think some of the 
questions can be referred to ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  To him. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Some members ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But having said that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  A cluster of Ministers cannot all be 
happy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  With just saying we had officials 
who almost compromised the security of the country … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To one man and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he is the person who when certain officials in the 
- in Waterkloof were saying this is not right.  Where is the note verbal?  
As I recall the evidence he is the one according to some evidence who 
said it has got to be done or words to that effect.  The President or 
number one wants it to be done or something to that effect. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  You know Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Earlier on I was asked how long 
did I serve as a diplomat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I have used the services of 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 138 of 153 
 
Waterkloof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As special envoy for nine years … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But not on one trip … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Did those who run the airport 
never asked for documentary proof … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That I was going to land there or 
10 
take off from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They asked for documents? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I wrote - I - I can show you a pile 
of letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Every trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Every - whether I was going to 
land at 02:00 am in the morning.  Whether I am going to take off at 
02:00 am in the morning.  There will be documentary proof that I was - I 
20 
had applied to utilise that space.  So this - the uniqueness of this one 
and just collapsing it into the recommendation says something about all 
of us, because I know Waterkloof. 
I have used the services of that airport and I have had 
officials who worked with me writing … 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 139 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Every minute every hour.  If the 
President says you go there.  There is no time to be - accept to pack 
the bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To be asking questions and that is 
how I ended up having to utilise that space, but with a note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So that they can record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But on this unique one everyone 
wants to just say he said this.  He said that, but a Minister of 
International Relations could not access that airport without a note.  
That the President has sent this person to pass here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I have gone through that for nine 
years.  Not by telling … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  By signing off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you Minister that the - the legal team 
of the Commission if I - if I understand correctly they - they were 
looking at what the practice was - what - what normally happened at 
Waterkloof.  Maybe there was some evidence that was given or maybe 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 140 of 153 
 
it is still coming. 
I know that we are not done with all the witnesses relating to 
the Waterkloof landing.  There is one witness who - who is still coming, 
but anyone who thinks that the evidence we have about Waterkloof 
maybe is one sided or is not complete or does not give us a complete 
picture.  They must feel free to make evidence available to us to make 
sure that we have a … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A complete picture. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do want to have a complete picture. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want to have half a picture.  That is part of 
the reason why I wanted to hear your own perspectives … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we move forward about your decision to 
recommend … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr - Mr Koloane.  So - so - and - and that is - that is - 
we have dealt - we dealt with it, but I think the important thing is that 
20 
you - you have been able to indicate your - your perspectives. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think there is one or two things that I want to - to - 
to check.  The conversation that you had with the former President 
where you told him about Mr Koloane and the disciplinary process and 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 141 of 153 
 
so on.  Do you remember whether it happened at the time you were 
discussing the list at the beginning of the six month period or it 
happened later or - or is it something you cannot remember? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The - well I cannot have the fuller 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Discussions of how many times we 
discussed this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A number of times. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Pre … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Pre-appointment. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Pre-appointment.  Not just about 
the appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Oh you mean … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Just about the Waterkloof … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the Waterkloof.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And I sometimes wake up in the 
middle of night and remember what the former President had said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The first question he asked … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  When he saw me for the first time 
after they said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Can you ask if my name was used 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 142 of 153 
 
and ask if they said I said I want this.  I am - I am perturbed that you - 
you never asked me about whether I know the family or not, but it is 
okay.  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well - no, no the - well.  Well I can tell you this 
Minister before we started in the morning I thought whether we should 
ask you, but because it was not part of what had been planned … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you might say you know maybe you should 
have been given notice and we … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do intend and it has been quite some time.  I did 
say this publically. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do intend asking Ministers - all serving Ministers 
and past Ministers … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether they have had any interactions with the - 
with the Gupta family and if so in what way.  You might remember that 
we already have an affidavit from the President … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when I spoke to the President I said 
President you must be the first one.  You must give us an affidavit that 
tells us whether you know the family and what interactions you have 
had with them.  No maybe I - maybe I - I think he is the one who 
offered to be the first one. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 143 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I said I want affidavits from all the Cabinet including 
you Mr President … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Deputy President and he said I will be the 
first one to give you … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he has given us and we have made that public. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so it is not like we - we were not going to ask 
10 
you, but we thought because we did not notify you any … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About anything.  We said this is what we are talking 
about.  Maybe you would feel it is - it is unfair.  So let us wait for the 
process where you will file … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will give us an affidavit. 
ADV NORMAN:   
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Chair, I - I would be glad to do that 
… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because I served … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As an Ambassador … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 144 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Of South Africa … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In India. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  In India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  On another day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, but you were saying that this Waterkloof landing 
10 
was discussed with the - with the President.  You discussed it a number 
of times … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said he asked you to ask whoever whether 
your name was asked or something. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because the first time I - I had a 
conversation with him he was - he looked very, very angry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  On the third or fourth day he was 
to fly to Brazzaville … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE: 
 And 
things were still 
being 
disconnected there. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 145 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  He stood there and shook his head 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And I felt a little bit sorry for him 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But having said that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We have an opportunity … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To get our security proper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That when it is Ministers, right.  
When it is an official.  Note this one must tell that one this that.  
Presidents come and go, but South Africa must remain secure for South 
Africans. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you say he was at some stage quite angry 
20 
about his name being used in this way? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That is what - that is the reflection 
I saw. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the impression you got? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 146 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time that you made the recommendation and 
you had the discussion with him did he not say anything like how can 
you recommend this person who lied about me or who misrepresented 
things about me? 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Well he asked … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And we said we - we cannot have 
different standards … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  For some officials and different 
standards for other officials … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because like I said he was one of 
the 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So we spoke a little bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We talked Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  With your permission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And spoke about gender based 
violence. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 147 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  We have not asked … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The profile of all the serving 
Ambassadors … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  As to who did what when … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Where. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  A few months ago Minister Mchunu 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Organised a march … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  From the City -the central of the 
City of Pretoria … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  To the Union Buildings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Where men were to sign off that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  That this will not happen in their 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 148 of 153 
 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Buy the time we arrived at the 
Union Buildings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I had three women surrounding me 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Crying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  And they said we are not going 
back to our homes … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Tonight because here we are 
marching with those who had made our life hell.  We have watched our 
children raped.  We have been raped … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  By them and they are here with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I tried chasing that case.  I do not 
know what had happened.  I had people from your place and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Everybody we were matching. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  I looked at those women and I felt 
I needed to get to a bathroom and wipe off (indistinct), because I am 
not going to sleep where they are going to sleep.  I do not know 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 149 of 153 
 
whether they are still sleeping.  Where they should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So the amount of time you have 
given us is highly appreciated, but our platform is burning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  So it is true that we must check on 
characters of people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But I think we must also check on 
our correction - corrective - or is it Department of Correctional 
10 
Services? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Whether we are correcting people 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But I am not here to speak on 
behalf of other departments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But we could not have gone 
through this far … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  With the only thing that you do is 
you had admitted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  But we do not say let us go further 
21 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 191 
 
Page 150 of 153 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Because we respect ourselves, but 
so why - why is the nomination … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  The only issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is the only - well maybe it is not the only 
issue, but certainly with regard to you.  It is an important point of 
discussion, because … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made the recommendation … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we - I want to understand … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What your perspectives are … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is or are, because … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For me I look - I look at it and it does not seem right. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That somebody who acts dishonestly and does so in 
regard to something that brings the whole country into shame like this.  
Who has the temerity to use the name of the Head of State in this way 
should be given the honour … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Huh-uh.

CHAIRPERSON:  To represent the country elsewhere.  Something says 
to me it is like we are saying it is fine.  Even if you do not have 
integrity we can give you the honour of representing … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Head of State in another country and you are 
representing us and you say could there not have been other people 
who have this quality of integrity … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who could have been given that honour and maybe 
he could have - could have been dealt with in another way.  So, but I 
10 
say all of these things because as I have been saying throughout today 
I want your perspective … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And these are not my final thoughts. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to benefit from how other people including 
yourself … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Viewed this, but from my side that is how it appears 
and I wanted … 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To benefit from what … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have to say.

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I do not know if there is anything arising 
… 
ADV NORMAN:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I know that counsel for the Minister is pressed 
for time. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  No, no nothing else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  There is - there is nothing. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  No nothing.  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So, but just to round off as we - as we close.  
So the position is that you are saying the President at the time was 
fully aware of the role that Mr Koloane had played in - in the Waterkloof 
landing including what had at the disciplinary processes - hearing, but 
and - and he was angry at some stage at least.  As far as you were 
concerned … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how his name was used, but you said to him it 
would be justified to appoint Mr Koloane to - as Ambassador because of 
a number reasons that you have articulated today.  Is that right? 
20 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Minister for … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON:  Coming to give me your perspectives and your 
understanding of the issues in making the decision that you made to 
recommend Mr Koloane.  I appreciate that you came.  We have taken 
much longer than we - we should have, but I think it was in the interest 
of making sure that I understand completely … 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What your thinking was and what your perspectives 
were.  Thank you very much.  You - for now we will excuse you.  You 
are excused. 
MINISTER NKOANA-MASHABANE:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn for the day. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are not going to be sitting tomorrow, but we will 
sit next week on Monday and Tuesday the Commission will hear 
evidence from former officials from the intelligence - senior officials.  I 
think Mr Njenje and Mr Maqetuka and Mr Shaik.  They will give
