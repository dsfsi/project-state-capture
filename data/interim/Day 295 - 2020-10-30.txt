Good morning Mr Teubes. 
MR TEUBES:  Good morning. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You are currently employed where? 
MR TEUBES:  I am employed at Denel Land Systems. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is – everybody refers to as DLS. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what is your current job title? 
20 
MR TEUBES:  My current job title is General Manager 
Combat Systems. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now is it correct that you have 
cooperated with the commission, its investigators and legal 
team and have provided a number of affidavits to us? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 5 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.  Chair may we refer 
you to the bundle in which you will find that two affidavits 
that will be referred to.  It is in Denel Bundle 05. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so the bundle we will use today is 
Denel Bundle 05. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is – it contains only one exhibit 
which is W17.  May I ask you please Mr Teubes to look at a 
particular page number?  If you can just bear in mind there 
are a number of page numbers that appear written or typed 
10 
in at various spots on each page.  I am simply going to 
refer you to the top left hand page – left had side of the 
page.  Can you please open where it says Denel-05-006 on 
the top left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the air conditioner is quite 
noisy this morning. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is Chair.  Someone can sort it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The person who normally attends to it 
does not seem to be around.  Okay alright let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Do you have that page 
20 
number? 
MR TEUBES:  I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And for convenience I am just going 
to refer to a page like this just as 6 not give you the full 
number okay? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 6 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.  Am I correct in 
saying that this is the first page of your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Kennedy.  I do not 
know if it is going to be too hot if it is switched off 
completely.  So explore the possibility of not switching if 
off completely but maybe it should not be such that it 
makes as much noise as it has been making.  Okay alright.  
Somebody is attending to it – we can continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It does become very hot as the day 
progresses here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is important you should let me 
know because I might not know how hot it is that side. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but at least I think that level of 
noise is better than – that before.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It provides better – better audio and it 
provides also some relief from the heat. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It seems to be a good compromise 
thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And Mr Teubes… 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 7 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We thank – we thank this technician. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Multitasking technician. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Multitasking. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Registrar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Teubes this is the first page of the 
first affidavit that you provided to us at he commission, is 
that right? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that your name on page 6 and can I 
10 
ask you to turn please to page 50 – 50.   
MR TEUBES:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that your name and signature that 
appears at the foot of the page? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if you turn to page 51 are those 
the details and signature of a Commissioner of Oaths in 
front of whom you took the oath to confirm the contents of 
this affidavit? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Have you been through this 
affidavit and are you satisfied that the contents are true 
and correct as far as you – your knowledge goes? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct yes thank you Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair may I just refer you to one tiny 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 8 of 115 
 
technical problem that has arisen.  If I can take you to 
page 10? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You will see at the foot of the page 
where the person typing the document has inserted the 
typed page number.  It is page 5 of 46. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then if you turn the page it jumps 
to page 7 of 46 at the bottom.  And in the following page 
which is at page 12 of our bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It goes back to six.  So all the pages 
are here but the sequence I am afraid has been mixed up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  But is it only in regard these two 
pages where page 7 appears and page 6 appears 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As far as I am aware that is the only 
glitch in this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I just wanted to point it out upfront. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Because when I first started looking 
at the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  This jarred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One could spend the time trying to find… 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 9 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So if I can just have that placed on 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then may I then ask – we will 
deal with – there is a supplementary affidavit later in the 
bundle but we will deal with that separately if we may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair may I then formally move for 
10 
your leave to admit this affidavit in Denel Bundle 05 from 
page 6 including all of its annexures I would ask Chair for 
leave to have that admitted as part of witness Exhibit 
W17? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The statement/affidavit of Mr Reenen 
Teubes starting at page 6 together with its annexures is 
admitted as Exhibit W17. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now may I ask you 
in the same bundle please Mr Teubes to turn ahead to page 
850.   
20 
MR TEUBES:  I have got it Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  850? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not seem … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It would be right at the end. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 10 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to go only up to 849. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then I am afraid there is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I go only up to – mine goes only up to 
849. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then there is a problem.  This was 
added to our bundle only yesterday by the Secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It seems that – maybe it was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it one of the pages you handed up at 
some stage? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it one – is the missing page – page – 
one of the pages you handed up yesterday?  Because there 
is a page that I think you handed up – a document a one 
pager I think which would have had to be put in.  But I do 
not know if they did not put it in. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes I do not know I hope that that has 
been done.  But that was for a different witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But Chair this will… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  This will be problem.  I will take a bit 
of time to deal with the main affidavit.  The supplementary 
affidavit that is not in your file needs to be put in.  May we 
just ask through my learned colleagues that that steps be 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 11 of 115 
 
taken for the appropriate staff in the Secretariat to make 
sure that a copy is made available to us? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To hand up when we are dealing with 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Should – perhaps I should wait for 
that to arrive for you to see it so that… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You can be satisfied before you admit 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  May we just 
indicate that last night from the attorneys who have been 
assisting Mr Teubes provided by Denel as Mr Pillay and Ms 
Wilsnach?  Mr Pillay is present I am not sure Ms Wilsnach 
20 
is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But they sent us yesterday evening a 
further supplementary affidavit in draft form of Mr Teubes.  
I have had a chance to go through that it is very brief and 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 12 of 115 
 
as Mr Teubes has pointed out to me this morning it is not 
meant to change any evidence it is just to provide a little 
more detail and some sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If we can leave that to deal with that 
at a later stage as well? 
MR TEUBES:  Yes.  No, no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But going back to whatever document I 
do not have for page 850 if one of your juniors has got one 
10 
that they are using maybe they could borrow me that one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that you can continue on the way you 
have planned to in terms of asking the witness. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Chair I was given the 
impression yesterday that the supplementary was going to 
be delivered to you last night.  You may not have received 
it or you may have received it but have – I know you were 
dealing with another hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was not told anything. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I see my Registrar is shaking his 
head. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it sounds like it did not reach even 
your Registrar. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 13 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it did not reach ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I just check if a spare copy is 
available? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright no I am afraid no spare copy is 
immediately available.  Alright thank you.  So then may I 
with your leave Chair then take the witness to the main 
affidavit that you have admitted?  If I can just mention that 
the two supplementary affidavits give additional details for 
some of the topics.  In the first affidavit I would have 
10 
preferred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If everything had been before you to 
deal with all of that topic by topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I may just have to come back to 
the supplementary affidavits and just fill in the detail then.  
So I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is not an ideal logical sequence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I am afraid the 
logistics 
sometimes get complicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  And may I with your 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 14 of 115 
 
leave lead the witness through some of the uncontroversial 
aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uncontroversial ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To begin with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Mr Teubes can we go 
back to your main affidavit at page 6?  You mentioned that 
your current title is General Manager of Combat Systems at 
DLS and you refer in your affidavit to your background on 
page 8.  You are a qualified Mechanical Engineer with a BE 
10 
and G and also a Masters in Business Leadership an MBL, 
is that right? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you joined Armscor in 1989 and 
moved to Denel when Denel was established in 1992? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you have worked in different 
capacities.  You set out your various capacities on the rest 
of this page 8, correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Did you work throughout this 
period from 1992 until today at Denel? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And always in DLS? 
MR TEUBES:  Always – always in DLS.  There was a 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 15 of 115 
 
period Chair that I worked in the UAE – stationed in the 
UAE but still employed by DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Now you have 
referred in paragraph 22.12 page 10 to your involvement in 
the Hoefyster Program going as far back as 2004 and you 
fulfilled various roles as an employee of DLS on that 
contract since 2004 until today? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now on page 11 you will see 
that paragraph 3 is headed A Brief History of the Hoefyster 
10 
Contract.  That then flows because of the problem with the 
sequencing of the pages in the photocopying process and 
the pagination process that I have already raised with the 
learned Chair.  Page 11 that ends with 3.2 is followed by 
page 13 according to the pagination with 3.3, is that 
correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And you have set out there a 
summary of the Hoefyster Contract involving Denel and 
DLS in particular. 
20 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that right? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now I would like now to get to the 
first meaty topics that you deal with in your affidavit having 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 16 of 115 
 
dealt with this background and that is Denel’s acquisition 
of an interest in LMT Holdings and you start that on page 
14 and that runs through for some pages.  Can you without 
going into all the detail in the affidavit because that is 
there before the Chair for the learned Chair to be able to 
read in due course.  Can you just summarise in a couple of 
sentences when LMT was acquired; what was acquired and 
why? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair just as background and I touched on it 
in the Hoefyster Section as well.  When Hoefyster was 
10 
initiated as from RFP perspective from Armscor there was 
a requirement to do some test in South Africa as well as do 
some technology transfer to South Africa from the different 
foreign suppliers.  In this case specifically Patria.  Patria 
contracted that LMT locally to be their local engineering 
partner for the Hoefyster Program. So in – in the pre-
contract phase where a lot of work was done including the 
landmine testing LMT was contracted by Patria to support 
them.  So in this period a lot of intellectual property 
[00:16:07] specifically on the vehicle was vested in LMT. 
20 
 
So at a certain stage we got involved with LMT 
when the RFP was submitted to Armscor and in that stage 
as per my affidavit and I think we will probably go in later 
in detail is we got to know of the difficulty – financial 
difficulty of LMT.  And we had to take a decision in terms of 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 17 of 115 
 
protecting the IP that was already created for Hoefyster in 
LMT what needs to be done to action that and this 
acquisition program was partly then to protect the created 
IP within LMT on the Hoefyster Program. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Had LMT prior to it 
having a majority share purchased by Denel had it prior to 
that been providing work and equipment to Denel? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair yes although on a very limited basis 
there was not – there was not a big – big contracts so it 
was more on specialised vehicles of which the quantities 
10 
was very low. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And did LMT have capacity to build 
hulls for the armoured vehicle that are relevant for 
Hoefyster Contract. 
MR TEUBES:  Chair very limited. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now may we then turn to page 
20 and you deal with the first transaction involving VR 
Laser and that related to the production of 217 armour 
hulls for the Hoefyster Platform components in 2014.  Now 
if I can just ask you a point of detail before we get into the 
20 
substance.  There is reference to 217 so that is 217 
vehicles. There is reference in papers that have come 
before the Chair already in this commission that – that 
there was a variation from 217 down to I think it was 83 or 
– sorry 183 or 184, is that correct? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 18 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So when you refer to 217 that 
is the original number that was contemplated but later it 
was reduced slightly. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now we have dealt with LMT’s 
capacity and what it did before it was acquired by Denel or 
the majority shareholding was.  Were you aware of VR 
Laser before this transaction that we are going to deal with 
here in 2014?   
10 
MR TEUBES:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you have a relation – did you as 
Denel have a relationship with VR Laser? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair we as Denel had the relationship.  The 
majority or the major area of the relationship was with one 
of our sister business units called Mechem.  It is more in 
the humanitarian area and VR Laser was building Casspirs 
for them as one of the main suppliers to Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And how did the Casspirs 
compare with the Hoefyster Control – sorry Contract 
20 
vehicles?  Were they – was it similar?  Was it identical? 
MR TEUBES:  It is not – it is similar processes but it is not 
identical vehicles Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright now you refer in your affidavit 
I am not going to take you again through the detail but you 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 19 of 115 
 
refer 
to 
the 
point 
that 
you 
did 
not 
have 
a 
direct 
involvement in the RFO or the evaluation process, is that 
correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So – and then you refer to in 514 
page 21 to a cross-functional team selected by Ms 
Malahlela.  She was then Head of Supply Chain within 
DLS, is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And she selected members to sit on 
10 
the cross-functional team.  Were you a member of that 
cross-functional team? 
MR TEUBES:  I was not a member of the cross-functional 
team Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  So you did not take part or did 
you in the evaluation of the proposals received by the 
bidders in response to RFO? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair I did not take part in the selection 
process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Were you part of the executive of 
20 
Denel at that – of DLS at that stage? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now were you involved in the 
decision – I know you were not involved in issuing the RFO 
or the evaluation of the offers that came in response but 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 20 of 115 
 
were you involved in the decision at executive level to go 
out on a RFO process initially? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair just to clarity the decision to go out on 
a RFO was not taken on executive level it was taken within 
the Supply Chain environment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now there has been some 
suggestion by some witnesses who have already given 
evidence that LMT had the capability of making these hulls 
– Platform hulls for these vehicles and it was now majority 
owned by Denel and it would make sense to keep that in-
10 
house and in fact the policy was to procure from an in-
house division or entity rather than going outside if that 
was – if that could be done subject to the price being 
acceptable, quality etcetera.  Do you have any comment or 
view in relation to the fact that LMT was not automatically 
given this business but instead the Supply Chain bids went 
out for – on a RFO allowing competitive prices to be 
submitted? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair I think to have a view on it I would like 
to – there is two variables in it.  The one variable is I think 
20 
we need to distinguish between a facility or a capacity that 
can do mass production versus a facility that can do 
prototype production.  So if the question is asked do LMT 
have the capability or capacity?  The answer is yes for 
prototyping for low volume type production – the answer is 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 21 of 115 
 
yes.  For high – for high volume production I do not believe 
that they had the capability and in it – to execute Hoefyster 
they probably would have invested a lot of money in their 
infrastructure to do that. So I think that is a – I think that is 
important maybe just to note that.  Sorry the second 
question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I think you have – I think you have 
covered what I was really trying to get at. 
MR TEUBES:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But your views that you have just 
10 
expressed they were not – you were not consulted before 
the decision was taken by others to go out on a RFO? 
MR TEUBES:  No this is – this is in the majority of the 
cases this is – this is done on a program level but the 
EXCO cannot just excuse and from this decision when this 
decision is then presented or the outcome of this at EXCO 
level then EXCO needs to make a call on the process that 
was followed yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you then on pages 21 to 23 set 
out the detail of what you were able to pick up from the 
20 
documents 
of 
the 
cross-functional 
team 
and 
their 
evaluation, correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But you were not involved personally 
in that process? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 22 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct as part of the preparation for 
the commission and the questions that was asked I did my 
own research and this is the information that I could collect 
on that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you refer on page 22 to a 
recommendation 
made 
by 
the 
cross-functional 
team 
paragraph 5.1.10.  You see that? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Cross-functional 
team 
made 
a 
submission to the DLS EXCO were you part of that EXCO 
10 
that considered the recommendation? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair yes I was part of that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what was the recommendation 
for? 
MR TEUBES:  The recommendation was for the contracting 
of VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did – was the decision to be taken by 
EXCO or anybody else? 
MR TEUBES:  The delegation – this was above the 
delegation of the DLS EXCO so the DLS EXCO’s role in 
20 
this 
was 
a 
recommendation 
to 
the 
corporate 
office.  
Because this specific delegation was above DLS. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So Ms Malahlela and her cross-
functional team made a recommendation to EXCO.  You 
were required to approve that recommendation before it 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 23 of 115 
 
went higher but the fact that you approved it was not the 
final word.  You – your approval was simply to approve it 
as a recommendation to head office. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja Chair if it is okay I do not think it is 
approved we can only recommend it onwards. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  So – ja so there was no approval from our 
side.  We had evaluate it and then if we were happy and 
we – if we support it then we recommended it for a higher 
approval. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I might just have a moment Chair? 
If I can ask you please to turn to page 408.   
MR TEUBES:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Are you familiar with this document 
that you have referred to in your affidavit? 
MR TEUBES:  That is the submission yes to the DLS 
EXCO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And relating specifically to this 
Hoefyster Hull contract? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And the appointment of VR Laser.  
Now it is at page 412 space is made for you to sign as 
recommending the proposal for the award to VR Laser in 
your capacity as Chief Operating Officer, was that your 
capacity at that stage? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 24 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And who did you report to Mr Teubes? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair I reported to Mr Stephan Burger as the 
CEO of Denel Land Systems. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So he was CEO, you were COO, 
correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And there was space provided  apart 
from your name and that of Mr Knoetze the Chief Financial 
Officer at the foot of the top half below your name there is 
10 
provision for Mr Burger to endorse the recommendation in 
his capacity as CEO. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you and he in fact endorse the 
recommendation? 
MR TEUBES:  No we did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And why was that? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair the submission that was made at this 
stage was made with old information.  This prices that was 
submitted here was still based – received in 2012 so we 
20 
believed that the suppliers should get an opportunity to put 
up fresh submissions firstly.  Secondly these quotes that 
they refer to was not valid anymore at that stage Chair.  So 
it was from a process perspective also not an opportune 
point to take a decision with quotations that was not valid. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 25 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So that is a submission on the 25 
April 2014 page 409. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
And 
you 
did 
not 
accept 
the 
recommendation of the cross-functional team you required 
further updates to be provided to you – to the organisation. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and were those updates then 
asked for by DLS of the bidders? 
MR TEUBES:  They according to my knowledge Chair they 
10 
went out then on a formal RFP process to the different 
bidders yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now if I can take you please if 
I might just have a moment?  Page 255.  Now 255 contains 
a series of emails.  I would like you please, if you would, to 
go to what appears to be, at least halfway down, an email 
from you sent on the 25t h of April 2014 addressed to Ms 
Malahlela and copied to various others.  Do you have that? 
MR TEUBES:   I have got it Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can you just read for the record?  You 
20 
subject refers to an urgent Exco meeting for the hull 
supplier.  Just read for the record what you say:  Hello, 
Celia... 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
“Hello, Celia.  As an input to the meeting, please 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 26 of 115 
 
check the LMT Shareholder Agreement and if there 
are any reference made to Hoefyster.   
I again got an SMS now from Stephan Nel, accusing 
us of contravening the shareholders agreement with 
regards with us contemplating contracting other 
parties on the hull manufacturing.” 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now the Commission has already 
heard evidence that there was three offers submitted to DLS 
in response to the RFO.  One we know was from VR Laser 
which was recommended to be accepted by the Cross-
10 
Functional Team.   
 
There were two others, according to the evidence 
already produced and referred in your evidence too, that one 
was LMT and the other one was DCD. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now just explain to the Chair about 
this SMS that you got from Dr Nel.  Who is Dr Nel and who 
was he at that time? 
MR TEUBES:   Dr Nel is the CEO of LMT.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And what was his complaint? 
20 
MR TEUBES:   His complaint from his perspective is that in 
the shareholders agreement there was some exclusivity for 
the Hoefyster contract allocated to LMT and he would like us 
to 
abide 
that 
specific 
condition 
in 
the 
shareholders 
agreement. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 27 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you were asking, as I understand 
you email, from Ms Malahlela to check up if Dr Nel’s 
complaint was valid?  In other words, whether the agreement 
between Denel and LMT, in fact, gave them an entitlement to 
the business. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did she come back to you and 
advise you on a response to your query? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, what she did, she consulted with our 
Internal Legal Executive, Ms Denise Govender to get a copy 
10 
of the shareholders agreement because we did not have one 
at DLS because the shareholding was at corporate level.   
 
So all these documents were on that level.  Denis did an 
analysis for Ms Malahlela on this question and then she gave 
a response on that.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And what did you understand 
the response to be, to the effect that there was a problem 
that you were bound to give the business to LMT or not? 
MR TEUBES:   My understanding Chair from that response 
was:  No, there is no obligation on us.  The obligation on us 
20 
through that agreement was that we will endeavour to assist 
LMT with business, business development and order cover 
but it was not project specific. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now your affidavit from page 23 to 
page 25 refers to the query that was raised, arising from the 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 28 of 115 
 
SMS received from Dr Nel.  Is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And we do not need to take you 
through it.  I believe it is in the details that is helpfully set 
out there.  And then, you refer in paragraph 5.1.20 to an 
email between yourself, Mr Knoetze and Ms Govender and 
you will find that at page 417, I believe. 
MR TEUBES:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:   I have got it Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy, you mentioned quite a few 
page numbers.  Did you end up with 417? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is 417, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that...  Does that reflect the 
correspondence 
that 
you 
had 
with 
Ms 
Govender 
and 
Mr Knoetze? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think when you have your head like that, 
20 
I cannot hear properly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says it not captured properly, ja.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry Chair.  Thanks for the 
guidance.   
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 29 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I will put the microphone on.  I beg 
your pardon.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am afraid my eyesight is not good 
and the lightning is not great and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [Indistinct] is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  But I was saying you were 
...[indistinct]  I think your eyesight probably has improved 
10 
quite a lot since sometime back. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It used to be quite a challenge.  [laughing]   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but I think you have improved quite a 
lot. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It has a bit.  I have had some surgery.  
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was the upshot, now that you 
20 
have resolved... had you resolved the issue that Dr Nel had 
raised? 
MR TEUBES:   I believe so Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 30 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what the happened with the award 
of the bid?  Did you then proceed to make a decision to 
award the business or was there a further step for further 
revision of prices? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, after this... just for clarity.  After this 
first submission in April, which we did not accept, they went 
out on a RFP process.  There was a process followed and 
post that process, DLS Exco made a recommendation and it 
was subsequently approved then on corporate level Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And what was the decision? 
10 
MR TEUBES:   The decision was to contract VR Laser Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Do you know at corporate level 
made the decision to approve? 
MR TEUBES:   That was approved by the Group CEO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that Mr Saloojee at that stage? 
MR TEUBES:   Thank you, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Do you have any knowledge 
whether Mr Saloojee had the authority under the delegation 
then applicable at his level or whether it required further 
approval or final approval by the board? 
20 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, Mr Saloojee’s delegation at that stage 
was up to R 200 million.  So any contract within that limit, he 
could approve.  And he did point to me that this contract that 
he finally approved was within that limit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you then in your affidavit from 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 31 of 115 
 
page 25, paragraph 5.2 deal with the adjudication of the 
updated request for proposals.  So that preceded the final 
approval of the awards to VR Laser.  Is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   25, 26, 27.  Now I would like to stop at 
a point at page 27, paragraph 5 to 10.  And there is a 
reference to an undertaking being given by Mr Burger to 
negotiate with VR Laser Services as the leading product to 
reduce the price they had offered.  How did that come 
about? 
10 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, Ms Celia Malahlela shared with myself 
and Mr Burger the outcome of the Cross-Functional Team, 
their recommendation.  And as then in evaluating that, Mr 
Burger then made this comment that although VR Laser is 
the preferred supplier, that he will then still negotiate with 
them to reduce the price further. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But this was a competitive process 
involving, maybe not a public tender, but an RFO for three 
bidders who were competing against each other, not so? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Do you know whether the other 
bidders were also asked to adjust their prices at the time 
that Mr Burger said he would negotiate with VR Laser? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, no.  The other bidders did not get an 
opportunity. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 32 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have any view as to whether 
that was fair or appropriate? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, I think the fact that everything was 
closed and the recommendation was made.  What happen 
normally within Denel environment, there is no changes then 
to the information on that recommendation up to the point 
where it is approved.   
 
And then post-approval, then we will get a mandate to 
negotiate with the selected supplier to see if we can reduce 
the prices.   
10 
 
I do submit that the interaction with a supplier prior to 
the final approval on the correct level is not worth in the 
Denel processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am sorry.  Just repeat that final 
answer.  Or just repeat your answer again to that question. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes.  That in Denel, in the process of 
adjudication up to a point where a final approval is given, it 
is not worth in the processes that you can engage with a 
supplier.   
 
Post to that approval - what happened in a lot of cases, 
20 
we will then give a mandate to do a negotiating team to say:  
We would like you to reduce your...  Go and negotiate and 
reduce the price another X percent.   
 
So there is always the goal of further price reduction 
post the final approval of that contract or the submission. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 33 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that because of what you 
have just said.  There would have been... there was no need 
for the other suppliers to be given a chance to reduce their 
prices. 
MR TEUBES:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or do I misunderstand you? 
MR TEUBES:   No.  I think...  Well, the principle factor is, if 
one supplier is given an opportunity during the evaluation 
process, all the other suppliers need to have a similar 
opportunity. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, okay. 
MR TEUBES:   Which was not in this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  
Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Mr Teubes, would this be 
done at a stage that the decision had already been taken to 
award the contract to that party and having decided that he 
would then make an effort to reduce their price a bit? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ja. 
20 
MR TEUBES:   But that happens post the approval for 
contracting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And would they be aware when they 
were approached to negotiate a reduction, that they had 
been approved? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 34 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, I would not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Because if they knew that they 
were approved, there would not exactly be much inducement 
on them to negotiate, at least, substantially downwards. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now was there an issue in 
relation to the budget ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr Kennedy.  I am sorry.  
When there are negotiations post the adjudication for the 
reduction of the price by the winning bidder, even if they 
10 
have not been told that they have won, does that reduction 
or does the reduction that is contemplated in that situation, a 
reduction in the price, a reduction that could go down even 
more than the prices that have been offered by the other 
suppliers who lost?  Or it could, it might or it might not? 
MR TEUBES:   It did...  Chair, there is no specific guidance 
on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   So it depends on the competitors, how close 
they were in terms of pricing ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TEUBES:   ...compared to the winning bid.  But if there 
is a significant difference, then normally you would not get 
close to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 35 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   We are not talking about huge percentages.  
Normally that we can negotiate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TEUBES:   Normally, it is in the region of 5% to 7% that 
we can negotiate.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, it may be that there ought to 
be no objection in principle to post the adjudication 
negotiations for the reduction of the price with the winning 
bidder.   
 
If one approaches the matter on the basis that whether 
10 
or not that bidder should have won, should be judged before 
the negotiation.   
 
If it should not have won, then the fact that the price 
negotiated after, is irrelevant.  I should not have won and at 
the point at which the adjudication was made, it had a 
certain price.  And that is the price on which it should have 
been judged. 
MR TEUBES:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if at the time it was judged to the 
winner, it was... it deserved to win.  Then any negotiations 
20 
that could happen after – between it and the company, 
maybe is really neither here nor there.  I am just thinking 
aloud. 
MR TEUBES:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have some comments on that? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 36 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, I fully understand your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TEUBES:   In my years at Denel, I have never been in a 
situation where there was a decision made to have a specific 
supplier selected out of an evaluation process and then 
during 
the 
negotiations, 
that 
position 
has 
changed 
substantially.  I have not seen that yet.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it could be that if there is – there is to 
be negotiations for the reduction of the price before 
adjudication, that should be afforded to everybody because 
10 
at that stage, they are still all competing. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if the actual adjudication has 
happened and a particular bidder has won and it deserved to 
win ...[intervenes]  
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on what was known at that time in terms 
of its price and so on, then it may be that if the company 
afterwards say:  Look, maybe we can just get one million or 
two million off, you know, get reduced. 
20 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe there should be no problem with 
that because they have won already. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So the question should be whether 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 37 of 115 
 
they deserve to win and if the answer is yes they did deserve 
to win, then the rest should be fine. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TEUBES:   I fully agree Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   I think some of the lessons learnt in this is, 
that we go through a process in adjudication.  Then there are 
clarification questions from the suppliers and some of this 
could influence their answers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   And obviously, there are processes to be 
followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   But I think the lesson learnt here is after this 
evaluation process, give everybody an opportunity for a final 
and best offer before we close.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TEUBES:   Which we have not done.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR TEUBES:   But I think that is an area that we can 
improve on.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Of course an alternative 
approach might well be, you do not allow anybody to 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 38 of 115 
 
negotiate further.  You have one chance as a bidder to 
submit a bid and that must then be evaluated.   
MR TEUBES:   That is true as well Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  That is another one to say, do 
not say somebody has won if you are still unhappy with 
something like the price.  When you say they have won, 
certainly something like a price should be settled. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed.  And would you agree with me 
Mr Teubes that at least would have the advantage that it 
would avoid any corruption or irregularity with information 
being shared with one bidder to, for example, reduce its 
price to get an advantage over another bidders which had 
started off with the lowest price? 
MR TEUBES:   Ja, I fully agree Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Okay.  Now in relation to this 
particular bid for the 217 hulls.  VR Laser in the documents 
that you have provided and also that of others, other 
20 
witnesses have indicated that VR Laser was substantially 
more expensive than the LMT at the tune of about a hundred 
million.   
MR TEUBES:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you aware of that? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 39 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, I was aware of that, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And there is also been evidence 
that the amount that would have been paid to VR Laser 
under the contract if it was awarded at its price that was 
being considered in the final evaluation, would have been 
way over the budget that was available by way of funds 
allocated for this product.  Were you aware of that? 
MR TEUBES:   I was aware of it, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So at executive level, did you discuss 
this when you were considering whether or not to endorse 
10 
the recommendation of the Cross-Functional Team that 
despite this big price difference, VR Laser should be 
recommended to be awarded the contract? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, the discussion was in twofold.  The 
one is the difference between the prices with the different 
suppliers but obviously, we would like to protect the budget 
on the programme.  So the prices were also compared to the 
budget.  So we...   
 
There was a lengthy discussion on the, let us call it the 
integrity of the prices, especially given the changes of prices 
20 
on the 2012 versus the 2014 submissions.   
 
And we were concerned, how is it possible that without 
substantial change in information we can have such a big 
price swing in the different areas.   
 
And I have to state.  As LMT price came down, the other 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 40 of 115 
 
two suppliers also went up, 2014 versus 2012.  So that was 
– it was discussed but at the end of the day, Exco said that 
they would like to protect the budget of Phase 2 and make 
sure that the final price is within the budget.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that achieved?  Was the final 
price achieved that would bring your organisation within the 
budget level? 
MR TEUBES:   The...  If I, Chair, if I can recall.  The budget 
was about R 960 000 a unit and the price that we contracted 
eventually was a million.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was a substantial reduction 
on the part of VR Laser? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  If I can take you please to page 
606?   
MR TEUBES:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is a letter that was sent by VR 
Laser’s, Mr Jiyane.  Do you see that at page 613?  It is 
dated the 24t h of June 2014 and it is addressed to 
Ms Celia Malahlela.  And it refers to an updated proposal or 
20 
updated 
quotation. 
 
Does 
this 
represent 
the 
revised 
quotation after Mr Burger negotiated that with them? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   H’m.  When Mr Burger negotiated with 
him, were you part of those negotiations? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 41 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   No, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you aware whether he did that on 
his own or was colleagues present? 
MR TEUBES:   I do not know.  I do not have any details on it 
Mr Chair.  So I do not know.  I cannot give a comment if he 
was on his own or with colleagues. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Now if I can take you back to 
page 29.  Your affidavit sets out a table.  From pages 29 to 
30 is a table.  What does that reflect? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, that reflects a summary of the revised 
10 
proposal that was sent from VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And it is apparent from this 
table, correct me if I am wrong, that some prices were 
reduced but some or different items were kept the same. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.  On all the small 
amounts and then the industrialisation and the learning 
curve areas, those prices were kept the same.  The prices 
that were reduced was on series production prices. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if we look at page 30, where do we 
find that? 
20 
MR TEUBES:   Chair that is just above the heading, 
quotation for ...[indistinct] protection only.  You will see 
there, there is series production units based on the DLS 
schedule.  The initial price was R 1.108 million and then they 
are bringing it down to one – just over one million. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 42 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Quite a substantial difference. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct.  It is roughly about 10% 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now you then refer to your -  
recommending that – this is in 5.2.21 – that the reduced 
price be incorporated into a draft submission to Exco for a 
final decision by Exco, correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer at the top of the 
next 
page 
to 
a 
different 
view 
being 
expressed 
by 
10 
Ms Malahlela.  Did she convey that you? 
MR TEUBES:   No, she did.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what in essence of the point of 
disagreement between you and her?  Was it whether or not 
the revised price could be incorporated into the submission 
to Exco? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.  Her view was exactly 
as described earlier.  Is that there was a process followed 
and you cannot consider any other inputs of the closure date 
of these submissions.   
20 
 
My view was that yes I agree with that.  But this specific 
price is lower from a – let us call it from a programme 
advantage perspective.   
 
And I thought that it would add – give us a better 
negotiation position as well as a mandate from management 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 43 of 115 
 
to include that.   
 
But I have to state and it is further stated that I have 
agreed with her and that the submission was not updated.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was not updated? 
MR TEUBES:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Was the matter then referred to 
Exco? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Chair.  Oh, if I can just correct?  The 
matter of differences between me and Ms Malahlela was not 
referred.  We have agreed on it.  So we – the two of us were 
10 
happy with it.  So the submission was then referred. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry?  The submission was...? 
MR TEUBES:   Referred to Exco for further recommendation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And what – how did Exco deal 
with it? 
MR TEUBES:   They recommended it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Recommend.  And was that in terms of 
the final revised price that we have just been looking at, 
going down to just over a million? 
MR TEUBES:   No, it was still the original submission from 
20 
Ms Malahlela. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was there then to be further 
negotiations thereafter? 
MR TEUBES:   They could not make that call until that was 
approved Chair on group level. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 44 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what happened then? 
MR TEUBES:   Can I just for clarity? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   It was then referred to group level. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was then referred to group level? 
MR TEUBES:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was then approved at group level? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct.  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was there to be any further 
attempt negotiating reduction after group level approval? 
10 
MR TEUBES:   Yes.  Yes, Chair.  This revised proposal that 
was sent that was not considered, gave us at least an 
indication that they are willing to reduce their prices.  So 
that was then given as a goal in terms of the contracted 
price with VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now what did you understand to 
be motivating Ms Malahlela’s resistance to include the 
revised price even though it gave an advantage of financial 
benefit to Denel?  What was – what did you understand her 
purpose to be doing – to be in resisting your suggestion that 
20 
the proposal be updated for submission to Exco? 
MR TEUBES:   I do not think there was any sinister Chair – 
any sinister views.  It was purely – this is a process that was 
followed.  And she would like us to stick to the process as 
within the policies of Denel. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 45 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  If I can take you 
please to your affidavit, paragraph 37?  You refer to your 
concluding a covering letter motivating for the conclusion of 
an MOU with VR Laser to be signed off by Mr Burger.  Did 
you attend to that? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did she in fact approved it? 
MR TEUBES:   He signed it and the approval level was on 
group.  So he signed it be recommended for approval on 
group level. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now just to ask you to give a 
comment as to how you felt about the process overall that 
was been conducted here for the grant of a contract to VR 
Laser? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, just for clarity.  Are we referring to 
the Hull Contract or the MOU? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The whole process that led up to the 
approval of the MOU.  Did you feel that it was being done 
correctly?  Did you feel it was being done with sufficient time 
and attention and compliance with procedures? 
20 
MR TEUBES:   I...  Firstly, I think there was a rush to get 
this through.  And then in hindsight, at that stage, it did not 
concern me.  I did not have specific concerns of why it is 
rushed.  I think hindsight, I have to say, I am concerned with 
the fact that it was rushed through.   
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 46 of 115 
 
 
I think the fact that it started as an MOU as an initial 
process.  There is also not a clear process in Denel to 
handle MOU’s.  There are clear processes for single – 
approval of single source suppliers but not MOU’s.   
 
So I think, at that stage, I did not question it but in 
hindsight, I would agree that yes there is a level of 
uncomfortableness with it.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, at this stage, may I ask – may I 
suggest a five minute adjournment so that we can attend to 
the problem that was raised earlier.  And that was the 
10 
missing supplementary affidavit.  At this stage, it would be 
convenient to refer the witness to that.  May we ask for just 
a five minute adjournment so that your file with your leave 
may be updated with the addition of that affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you not think we may be should just 
make it a tea-adjournment? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we do not have to take another 
time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Certainly Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we might end up with about ten 
minutes.  But you will let me know once you are ready. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 47 of 115 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, thank you.  May we thank you 
for the indulgence to get the papers in order.  Once again, 
apologies for the problem.  You have before you, Chair, the 
main affidavit which you have already admitted.  May we 
suggest subject to your guidance that that be given 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Are 
you 
keeping 
your 
mask 
on 
intentionally or you forgot to…? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is an oversight, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   One gets scared when you actually 
start to get so used to it that it becomes almost like 
wearing your glasses but thank you for your guidance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The main affidavit has already been 
admitted and what we suggested, that because admitted as 
is then either 417A or 417.1 and then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You now talk about the supplementary? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, the one that has already been 
admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just to distinguish it from the two 
supplementaries that we are going to deal with now. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 48 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you want us to change W17 to 
W17.1? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, may I suggest that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, we can do – we can leave it 
as W17 and make the next one W17.1 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so maybe let us do it that way 
because on record we have already said this one is W17. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And may we now 
direct your attention to what has been added to your file as 
10 
you gave leave to do during the tea adjournment.  You 
should find at page 850… 
CHAIRPERSON:   850? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   …a first supplementary affidavit 
which we would ask once the witness has confirmed its 
accuracy to be admitted as W17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that will run for many pages with 
20 
– including a number of annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then I mentioned that we have 
received now a further supplementary affidavit which I 
understand has also been added to your bundle that you 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 49 of 115 
 
will find at page 1078. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And we will ask that that, once it has 
been confirmed by the witness, be admitted as W17.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact may I just correct myself, it is 
currently not in the form of an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is currently in the form of a signed 
statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That Mr Pillay, the attorney assisting 
Mr Teubes, has kindly indicated that he will attend to it 
straight after and if that can be substituted in affidavit form 
in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I then just go through the 
process of referring the witness to these two affidavits or 
statements and then just ask him to confirm their contracts 
and we will ask for formal admission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Teubes, can I 
ask you please then to refer to page 850. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is a statement/affidavit.  Is it 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 50 of 115 
 
correct that you prepared this affidavit or you finalised this 
affidavit? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so that was at the request of 
investigators of the Commission who had raised certain 
issues. 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then may I take you please to – I 
am sorry, Chair, I have got it here, it was concealed by the 
staple.  Page 862, is that your signature on the 21 
10 
October?  That was a week or so ago and that you signed 
this affidavit. 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In front of Commissioner of Oaths.  
Have you been through this affidavit and are you satisfied 
and can you swear on oath to the Learned Chair that the 
contents are true and correct as far as your knowledge 
goes? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Chair, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  We would then ask 
20 
formally for leave to have this affidavit of the 21 October 
from page 850 admitted in the record as EXHIBIT W17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement/affidavit of Mr Reenen 
Teubes starting at page 850 is admitted as EXHIBIT 
W17.1. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 51 of 115 
 
STATEMENT/AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
MR 
REENEN 
TEUBES 
STARTING AT PAGE 850 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT W17.1 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  May we then just 
complete this process, Mr Teubes, by referring you to page 
1078? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is referred to as supplementary 
statement and it runs through to page 1082, is that 
correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On that latter page is that you 
signature bearing the date of yesterday, the 29 October? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It has not yet been sworn in front of 
Commissioner of Oaths. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But do you confirm the arrangement 
that I have made with your attorney Mr Pillay that that will 
be attended to and we will be sent the attested version as 
attested in front of a Commissioner of Oaths? 
20 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Have you been through the contents 
of this statement? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, I have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you confirmed the truth and 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 52 of 115 
 
correctness of the contents as far as your knowledge 
goes? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  Chair, we would 
then ask formally please leave to have this statement from 
page 1078 admitted as EXHIBIT W17.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The supplementary statement of Mr 
Reenen Teubes appearing at page 1078 is admitted as 
EXHIBIT W17.2. 
SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT OF MR REENEN TEUBES 
10 
ON PAGE 1078 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT W17.2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And, Chair, may we ask your formal 
leave to substitute for these pages the pages of the 
affidavit once it has been commissioned and we give you 
the reassurance that that will be done only the basis that 
there will be no change to the content of the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is in order. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  One final issue on 
this later statement, Mr Teubes, you refer to a number of 
annexures, you have indicated to me privately that the 
20 
annexure references in fact refer to annexures by their 
annexure number that have already been attached to the 
main affidavit, is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:    That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so on that basis, Chair, we will 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 53 of 115 
 
not attach any further copies because that would simply be 
a duplication. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it apparent from the supplementary 
statement 
that 
the 
references 
to 
the 
annexures 
are 
references to the annexures to his main affidavit because 
that 
is 
important 
otherwise 
when 
one 
reads 
the 
supplementary statement one will think the annexures are 
missing.  So if there is …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I understand the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If in the text of the supplementary 
10 
statement it is clear that the annexures being referred to 
are those attached to his main affidavit, that is fine, but if 
it is not apparent from it, it may be necessary to find a way 
of informing whoever reads that the annexures referred to 
are those in the main affidavit.  That might be done … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   One way of – a formal way of doing it 
would be maybe a supplementary affidavit that would 
explain that by him.  An informal way would be some 
indication but I suspect that it is better to do it formally. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I make a suggestion in that 
regard? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is not clear from the statement that 
they are in fact annexures to the main affidavit, so there is 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 54 of 115 
 
an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is the statement that needs to 
be converted into an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May we then take the liberty when 
that affidavit is prepared, perhaps where he makes the first 
reference to an annexure by number, you will find that at 
page 1079, para 2.1.5, it is right at the foot of the page.  
Perhaps 
what 
I 
would 
suggest 
the 
easy 
way, 
if 
it 
10 
satisfactory to you, Chair, is for the affidavit to include an 
additional sentence to say the reference to this and all 
other 
annexures 
in 
this 
affidavit 
are 
references 
to 
annexures to my original affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that would be in order and 
when it says original affidavit I think it might help because 
that affidavit now has an exhibit number, it might be 
helpful to say my affidavit deposed to on such and such a 
date which is – which has been admitted as EXHIBIT so 
and so.  That would be in order and I guess what we can 
20 
do, I can grant leave that the replacement affidavit that is 
going to be put in may include such an additional 
sentence. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because he was going to do  - he was 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 55 of 115 
 
still going to go to a Commissioner of Oaths for this one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is meant to be exactly the same as 
this but I am happy to give leave that such a sentence be 
included. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that EXHIBIT W17.2 will include that 
sentence. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you comfortable with that 
arrangement, Mr Teubes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Chair, we will do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and our team will obviously 
liaise with your attorney to make sure it is all done in the 
correct way and done speedily. 
MR TEUBES:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much.  Right, thank 
you, Chair, may we then turn to the supplementary affidavit 
received  or signed a week or so ago, that is W17.1, page 
20 
850, Mr Teubes. 
MR TEUBES:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now some of this affidavit overlaps 
with the affidavit that we have already been through at 
least on the hulls’ contract.  Does this affidavit deal at all 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 56 of 115 
 
with the hulls’ contract, the one from 850?  You refer to a 
prepayment to LMT. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then you deal at page 860 in 
paragraph 4 with the Hoefyster hull contract, that is the 
one we dealt with this morning already, correct? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you deal with some specific 
questions that were raised, as I understand it, by the 
investigators, is that right? 
10 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So you expand on your earlier 
statement regarding the Patria contract and is there 
anything you want to add that arises from 4.1? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Mr Chair, the Hoefyster hull contract is 
addressed in paragraph 4 on page 860. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   But there is nothing more, Mr Chair, that I 
would like to add other than what was already discussed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I would like, if I may, Chair, to just 
direct the attention of the witness to 4.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You refer to efforts from DLS to 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 57 of 115 
 
improve LMT efficiency and quality.  Now you have referred 
to some efforts in your main affidavit.  As I understand it, 
you were here giving further detail and documentation just 
to support what you had said in the main affidavit, is that 
right? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And just sum up for us, please, for 
the Chair, what was being done and why in regard to 
efforts by DLS to improve LMT’s efficiency? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, over a period pre-ownership and 
10 
post ownership of LMT various contracts from DLS was 
placed on LMT, a variety of contracts ranging from design 
work right through to production.   
Our support on that was a couple of things.  , from 
a business perspective we had a couple of our senior 
people that interacted on a regular basis with LMT to 
support them in terms of business management and in 
terms of quality, some of these communications that I 
referred to here was from our quality executive that was 
helping and assisting LMT with their quality processes and 
20 
we have also dispatched some of our quality inspectors on 
a regular basis to assist them on their production lines. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that done before the RFO 
for the hulls contract was issued? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 58 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now that brings us then to 4.3 
which is what informed the move away from LMT and I just 
want to take you back to your evidence earlier.  You have 
indicated 
that 
there 
were 
problems 
with 
LMT’s 
performance, they were being addressed in the manner 
that you have just indicated, attempts to improve.  That 
came with the assistance of DLS, correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And you have mentioned 
elsewhere a prepaying to LMT, was that also to assist them 
10 
where they were struggling? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now the problems with the 
performance of LMT seem to have been an important factor 
in not giving the hull contract to LMT but rather to VR 
Laser despite the fact that VR Laser was so much more 
expensive than LMT, is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I ask you a hypothetical 
question?  What would have happened if the committee, 
20 
the cross-functional team that Ms Malahlela was heading, 
had come up with a recommendation that given the huge 
cost saving that LMT was suggesting by having such a 
lower price, that it should be recommended to the board or 
to head office to grant the award of this contract to LMT?  
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 59 of 115 
 
What would your attitude have been? 
MR TEUBES:   Well, firstly I think, coming back to my 
earlier statement on the additional price submitted by VR 
Laser, whatever the outcome of this process was, I believe 
it would have been an objective process, Chair.  So we 
would have accepted it but understanding the challenges 
that was within LMT we would have also take additional 
measures to support them to improve efficiency, to improve 
qualify and I believe, like I have said earlier in my 
feedback, there would have been a significant investments 
10 
needed to increase their capacity from a prototype low 
volume type environment to a high series production, so all 
of that would have been support from DLS to improve LMT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have in mind what kind of funds 
might have been necessary in order to give whatever 
support LMT should have been given in order to improve its 
efficiencies? 
MR TEUBES:   Unfortunately, no, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Do you have an idea whether it 
could possibly be anything close to the difference between 
20 
VR Laser ’s price and LMT’s price? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, it would be a guess, if I give you any 
indication. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  Okay, you do not have… 
MR TEUBES:   I do not have an idea. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 60 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would it have been possible, do you 
think, would it have been not advisable to look into that 
possibility particularly given the fact that LMT was not 
some stranger outside third party at arm’s length, it was 
majority owned and controlled by Denel. 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, I think all of these actions should 
have happened prior to the RFP process on the whole 
contract because if you do these actions post then it would 
not be possible to take that into account through your 
10 
evaluation process, so I think the capability and the 
capacity that we are talking about, there should have been 
some indication of how would they establish that pre the 
RFP process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Presumably – I am sorry, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, your answer reminds of the 
question which Mr Kennedy might still be going to in due 
course of whether if you had a company, such as LMT, 
which was controlled by Denel  51% whether it should be 
20 
put through any competition with outside companies or 
whether what Denel should do, DLS should do, is this 
company can do this job, maybe we just need to help it 
here and there.  We might need to invest some money and 
maybe go that route without involving outsiders to compete 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 61 of 115 
 
with your own company.  Did you have any views on that? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, in hindsight it is easier to have a 
view on it in that process.  In that process – and this is the 
report that I referred to here, there was significant delivery 
issues within LMT.  There was significant quality issues on 
products that they delivered.  So I think if that was sorted 
out and at least there was some firm basis from where you 
could do that, I think it would have been a different view, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well because I guess if you have 
10 
not – if you do not do that as Denel or as DLS with regard 
to LMT, then you find yourself in a situation where LMT is 
competing with VR Laser and whoever, these are outside 
companies, maybe you are going to say well, we know our 
LMT, they will not deliver the kind of quality that we require 
and therefore you go for an outsider.   
But it may well be that if you from the beginning 
said look, if we spend any money on LMT to improve its 
efficiencies, it is not just for now, it is for long term, it is 
an investment in LMT therefore it is worthwhile on a long 
20 
term. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be different, would you 
agree? 
MR TEUBES:   I think it is a valid point, Chair. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 62 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  The Chair has heard 
evidence about a strategic vision and purpose underlying 
entities such as LMT buying a stake in LMT to bring its 
capacity in-house.  You have also referred to this.  So you 
touched on this earlier in your evidence.  Would that not 
have been a sensible business decision in the wider 
interests of the group to try and enhance LMT rather than 
10 
just refusing it business? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, yes, maybe just touching on the 
strategic intent, Denel Land Systems do not have any 
vehicle capability.  So what do we do, is we have got guns, 
we built all various guns and we built turrets.  Now turret is 
the portion where the gun fit in, it fits on top of a vehicle 
and we have been doing that for many years.  So what – a 
part of our turnaround strategy was to position ourselves 
as what we call a level 5 system integrate and level 5 
system 
integrator, 
if 
I 
can 
compare 
with 
the 
civil 
20 
engineering world, it is a turnkey solution.  So you would 
give the customer the whole package and that is what 
Hoefyster is, as an example. 
 
So DLS took a decision that we would like to 
position ourselves and we got approval for it as a level 5, a 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 63 of 115 
 
systems house.  So to do that we needed vehicle capability 
and that, part of that, was the LMT – bringing them within 
the family. 
 
Just to answer the question from that perspective 
as well, is I think if it was business as usual then it would 
not have been a problem to take that decision and to 
support it but unfortunately a lot of the emails and a lot of 
the correspondence is clear that at a certain stage there 
was a total breakdown in relationships between DLS and 
LMT.  So we grew apart, we had different strategic visions 
10 
and I think looking back, the top leadership that were 
responsible for both units should have probably reacted on 
that and brought everybody back in line.  I was not done 
and we would allow it to go into different directions and, 
unfortunately, the business relationship suffered because 
of that and I think that, as a basis, unfortunately had an 
impact in are we willing to invest, yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say the bad relationship that 
seems to have developed between LMT and DLS or the 
breakdown in communication or the tensions may have in a 
20 
way contributed to that route not being looked at properly? 
MR TEUBES:   Yes, Chair, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you, Chair.  May I just 
to complete this part of the evidence dealing with the hull 
contract, take you back in your affidavit – your main 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 64 of 115 
 
affidavit to page 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   33. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TEUBES:   Thank you,. Mr Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You refer in paragraph 5.2.3 to: 
Permission being requested by DLS to negotiate  
the price to a maximum of 1 050 000 per hull to 
bring it down within the budget that was then in 
place.” 
10 
Was that approval granted by Exco? 
MR TEUBES:   By Group. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   By Group? 
MR TEUBES:   Group, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and then you refer in 5.2.32 to: 
“Contract negotiations took place which included 
the reduction of the price.” 
Then you refer to a meeting on the 14 November 2014: 
“Where DLS negotiated mainly for a production 
price of R1 million per unit for each hull, payment of 
20 
a prepayment of 12%.” 
Etcetera.  And then at the top of the next page you refer to 
the people who were invited to attend, that was Mr Jiyani 
and Mr van der Merwe of VR Laser Services and Ms 
Malahlela and yourself for DLS. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 65 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did that meeting in fact take place?  
You were not simply invited but you attended? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And what was the outcome 
of that? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, there was actually a series of 
meetings, this was the initial meeting and I cannot recall 
exactly how many meetings but there was couple of 
meetings that happened on this specific subject. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you persuade VR Laser to reduce 
its price to exactly R1 million per hull? 
MR TEUBES:   They did but the issue was escalation, the 
escalation 
formula 
where 
there 
was 
a 
three 
month 
difference between the two parties, June to November, 
three to four months, so on that specific one we could not 
move them.  So the position that we were below the 
mandate of 1 050, so that that three months difference in 
escalation is a lot less than that 50 000 difference. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you.  May we now turn 
20 
to the next contract that you deal with in your main 
affidavit and that is a contract that was awarded in 2015 to 
VR Laser services and that refers – you refer to the 
memorandum of agreement.  Is it correct that this related 
to appointment of VR Laser as a single source supplier of 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 66 of 115 
 
certain components? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now am I correct in understanding 
these are components in addition to the hull that was dealt 
with in the 2014 contract. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The single supplier concept within the 
context of Denel, is its essence that when Denel appoints a 
supplier as a single source supplier that Denel actually 
10 
gives away its right which it otherwise would have to look 
for somebody else to give or provide it with the same 
services while that other agreement with that service 
provider is on?  For example, if you talk about a lawyer, 
you know, attorneys, as a company you can have an 
attorney whom you have appointed to do certain work for 
you but that does not prevent you from engaging another 
attorney to do something else for you, even if it is similar, 
you know?   
 
Or you could talk about somebody to provide you 
20 
with certain products, you might appoint somebody to 
provide you with certain products but you might decide that 
you actually need more and go to somebody else to also 
provide you with a few.   You have not given away your 
right to look for somebody else, without being in breach of 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 67 of 115 
 
any agreement with the current supplier. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the essence of a single supplier, 
the appointment, that as Denel you undertake not to look 
for some similar services or products from somebody else? 
MR TEUBES:   Chair the answer is yes, but will I be 
allowed just to expand a little bit on that if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   In our single source supplier motivations 
and selections we will never opt in that category nobody 
10 
that supplies the normal service that you will find out in the 
market that there are multiple competitors for we will never 
go for a single source.   
What drives a single source I think it’s important to 
know we develop as well so most of the products that we 
have starts from the development phase.  So you will 
develop a specific product for a specific requirement and in 
that it’s not high volume its relatively low volume.  There is 
significant investors in those components so you will not 
have that investment in multiple suppliers.   
20 
So you will go out and choose a partner, a partner 
single 
source 
supplier 
that 
will 
assist 
you 
in 
that 
development phase as well as the production phase.  So 
our criteria to go out for a single source and just with the 
PPPFA we actually need now a days to get National 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 68 of 115 
 
Treasury approval for a single source.   
So a single source approval that has changed over 
the years well partly because of Denel policies that has 
also changed to be aligned with National Treasury rules, 
my understanding of it is that firstly is it maybe a OEM that 
has originally, manufactured this, it’s got the IP so you 
cannot go to somebody else.  The second portion is it 
critical in terms of manufacturing processes.   
So manufacturing processes that could impact the 
safety of the system or cost of the system.  So all of those 
10 
factors is taken into account in our recommendation or our 
motivation rather to National Treasury for that approval.  
So your principle question is yes you preclude other people 
from that but I think it’s not but I think it’s not an easy 
process to get to that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it’s not so much out of choice that 
you exclude other people. 
MR TEUBES:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s because of the investments that may 
be involved in developing or maybe because there is 
20 
intellectual property involved which will force you to use 
that particular entity anyway.  
MR TEUBES:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Teubes your 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 69 of 115 
 
affidavit then goes onto refer to Ms Malahlela wanting to 
put this contract out to a competitive tender or RFQ 
process if you could look at your page 35 paragraph 6.1.4 
and you backed that up with annexures which are emails 
and so forth.  Is it correct that she raised that proposal or 
intention to follow a competitive process?  
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is it correct that you took a different 
view?  
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that your own view or is that one 
that was dictated or instructed to you or anybody else?   
MR TEUBES:   That was a view that was instructed by 
somebody else to me.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And who was that? 
MR TEUBES:   That was Mr Stephan Burger.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was your own personal view, 
did you believe that it could or should go out at least on an 
RFQ if not an open tender. 
MR 
TEUBES: 
 
 
My 
original 
view 
aligned 
with 
Ms 
20 
Malahlela’s view but in the discussion with Mr Burger the 
points 
that 
he 
put 
on 
the 
table 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
interchangeability of these manufacturing components as 
well as the investment needed for the manufacturing 
processes after having a debate or a discussion with him I 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 70 of 115 
 
eventually agreed with his view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well in that event it probably is not 
accurate to say it was a view that you were instructed as 
such because I think you were persuaded. 
MR TEUBES:   That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it became your own view as well after 
the debate, yes.   
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Mr Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, but the point you 
make is that prior to that your view was more in line with 
Ms Malahlela’s view.  
MR TEUBES:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR TEUBES:   Correct, and I think that is backed up with 
my discussion with Mr Drevin and where we had a 
discussion he did his motivation and that motivation was 
not supplier specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right thank you can I ask what your 
opinion is now with the benefit of hindsight.  Do you still 
maintain the view that you came to after being persuaded 
by Mr Burger? 
MR TEUBES:   I think hindsight ja in this case also with 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 71 of 115 
 
everything that happened around it I probably would have 
sticked with Celia’s position it is just within this whole 
process a lot of things other than technical ability started 
to play a role.  So if let us call it the political ownership 
part did not play a role I think it was correct to go single 
source and not to go out in multiple tender but the fact that 
there were other factors starting to play a role in hindsight 
I would have done it differently.     
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did the controversy that became 
apparent in the media about who the true shareholders 
10 
were of VR Laser and their political connections and their 
connections or the involvement of the Gupta’s or Mr Salim 
Essa or Mr Duduzani Zuma knowing that has generated 
some controversy does that influence your view that 
perhaps it should have been good from the beginning to 
just follow the competitive process Ms Malahlela was 
suggesting or is it something else?  
MR TEUBES:   No, it is as you described.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  
MR TEUBES:   If I may could I add something to that? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Please, yes.  
MR TEUBES:   I think the context of decision making on 
Hoefyster I think it is very important Chair.  When we 
received this contract in 2007 DLS was almost in the same 
challenges that Denel is today so we had significant 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 72 of 115 
 
business challenges, significant cash flow challenges and 
then we got to face the contract.  At that stage with limited 
resources, limited capacity in the company and we had to 
start 
executing 
an 
extremely 
complex 
contract. 
 
So 
whatever business decision we were taking was to try and 
reduce the risk on the programme.   
Now some of that we were successful in and some 
we were not successful in reducing that risk.  So any of 
these decisions for example getting a single source to do 
the fabrication obviously it must be done from a financial 
10 
sound commercial perspective but a lot of it was to try and 
drive down risks on the program.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I can understand with respect the 
logic of having a single source supplier appointed so that 
you can reduce risk and there are all sorts of IP technical 
supervisions issues so that you have one entity that you 
know is going for the period of the contract be committed 
to dealing with that and you can then supervise.  What I 
would like to turn to now though is the question of before 
you appoint a single supplier would it not be appropriate to 
20 
let other entities compete for the appointment of a single 
source supplier…[intervene]  
MR TEUBES:   Yes, but…[intervene] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Ms - sorry if I might just 
complete the question if I may I am sorry it is a bit long 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 73 of 115 
 
winded.  But Ms Malahlela has already given evidence that 
she 
heard 
you 
from 
a 
perspective 
Supply 
Chain 
Management 
that 
it 
was 
important 
to 
comply 
with 
processes 
that 
did 
allow 
at 
least 
a 
measure 
of 
competiveness.     
MR TEUBES:   Ja, I agree Chair with the principle of this 
but I also at that stage the argument of we just went 
through a process to appoint a whole supplier.  The 
essence of what we want to put in a single source is 
similar that also played a role in it rightly or wrongly but it 
10 
played a role in this decision, but I do agree in hindsight 
that it would have been a preferred position to go out on a 
tender, ja.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mlambo, I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Kennedy, Mr Teubes what is it 
that you may not do if you have appointed as the single 
source supplier that you may do if you have appointed 
them but not as a single source supplier.  In a way I am 
going back to the question I asked you earlier on are there 
things that you are prevented from doing just because the 
20 
appointment that you have made of A is on the basis that A 
is appointed as a single source supplier as opposed to an 
ordinary suppler.      
MR TEUBES:   Ja, Chair from the PPPFA again my 
understanding, I am not an expert on it, perspective if you 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 74 of 115 
 
do not have a single source supplier there is certain 
criteria or certain processes to be followed with tenders 
and so for every requirement you have you need to go out 
on an open tender and then that tender is awarded based 
on that selection criteria.  If you have a single source 
supplier, you can go on a close tender to that suppler and 
in my mind that is the difference between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is important because I think 
when Ms Malahlela gave evidence this issue of the 
implications of being appointed as a single source supplier 
10 
whether it was different from what is provided for in 
procurement processes and National Treasury regulations 
or instructions where you are allowed as an organ of State 
under the PPPFA not to go on open tender.   
But there the position as I understand it is put as if 
Mr Teubes is the sole supplier of that product.  If there is 
nobody else who can provide that kind of product, then you 
do not have to go to open tender then you can just appoint 
Mr Teubes and your justification is he is the only one who 
provides this kind of product. 
20 
Now I have always asked them the questions I mean 
the people who have testified about there and then I said I 
do not understand the logic of that provision because if 
you invite, if you go the open tender route Mr Teubes is 
going to put in his bid, if he is the only supplier of this 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 75 of 115 
 
product there is going to be nobody else and then you end 
up with him anyway.  But if you are mistaken in thinking 
that he is the only one there will be somebody else and 
that somebody else could just happen to be cheaper than 
him.  So you lose nothing by going the open tender route 
even if there is only Mr Teubes who supplies this kind of 
product that is in relation to Treasury.  
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your understanding that the single 
supplier arrangement at Denel fits into that arrangement 
10 
under National Treasury in PFMA provisions.  Is it that it is 
the same thing?  
MR TEUBES:   It is the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TEUBES:   Ja, I have to say if you look at the 
procurement policies over the many years let us say over 
the last 10 to 12 years in Denel this issue of single source 
and single source approval has significantly changed 
although the laws has not changed I think the application 
within Denel was different and just an interesting example 
20 
roughly in about 2008/2009 the policy at that stage was 
that the single source approval was done by the Chair of 
the procurement committee which was relative – which was 
equivalent to Ms Malahlela position.  So she could approve 
it in the Denel’s policies.  Over years I think our alignment 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 76 of 115 
 
between policy and law became closer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Kennedy.       
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Teubes 
can you turn to page 44 please at the foot of page 44 your 
paragraph 62.29 refers to the procurement policy of Denel 
at Head Office which came into effect on the 19 t h of 
November 
2014 
you 
have 
helpfully 
attached 
to 
…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry did you say 34?    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   44. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   44, okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You have referred us to the 
procurement policy as it existed, in 2014 you have 
attached a copy of that policy.  Mr Mlambo from – who was 
then the Supply Chain Group Executive at Head Office has 
already given evidence in relation to the same policy.  Now 
you 
express 
an 
opinion 
in 
this 
paragraph, 
the 
disappointment of VR Laser as the single source supplier 
in fact contravened the procurement policy.  You say that 
the 
award 
of 
the 
contract 
was 
in 
conflict 
with 
the 
20 
procurement policy ay Denel (SOC) Ltd.   Were you aware 
of that conflict at the time you were part of the process 
which recommended VR Laser ’s appointment? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair I was not aware of the conflict up 
to the point where we got to this point where it was raised.  
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 77 of 115 
 
So during the process of the evaluation and decision make 
on the MOI I was not aware of it but up to the point where 
we had this EXCO meeting where it was raised I became 
aware of it.    
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Notwithstanding 
that 
the 
recommendation was then made to appoint VR Laser 
despite the fact that if you were aware of a conflict, is that 
what you’re saying? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On what basis could you then make a 
10 
recommendation that you knew was in conflict with the 
Groups procurement policy.   
MR TEUBES:   In the EXCO discussions that we had the 
issue was that the procurement policy there we felt that the 
highest authority which was a group CEO could approve 
deviations from it and we believe that the approval to enter 
into an MOA was an approval for a deviation and that was 
the basis.  So it was not a basis of the one overriding the 
other, the discussion in the EXCO was that this was an 
approval for a deviation.  I know it is worded differently in 
20 
the minutes but that was the essence of the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am just wondering why the Group 
CEO could be said to have approved a deviation in 
circumstances where there was no request for deviation 
placed before him.   
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 78 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   I take your point Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay Mr Kennedy.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Mr Teubes if I can refer 
you to page 46, okay let us start if we may at 45 in 62.33 
you referred to the committee taking a decision that the 
memorandum of agreement that was in place with VR Laser 
took precedence over the procurement policy.  Now what 
agreement are you referring to there?  Was that the hulls 
contract agreement or what?       
MR TEUBES:   No, Chair this was the MOA.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is the MOA that had already 
been concluded.  
MR TEUBES:   That is correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and I just want to pick up with 
the point that you made earlier because you said as I 
understood 
it 
that 
part 
of 
your 
- 
the 
reasons 
that 
persuaded you to give the single source contract to VR 
Laser if I understood you correctly is that these additional 
components were additional that would be added onto the 
hulls.  The hulls were to be manufactured by VR Laser in 
20 
terms of the first contract that has already been awarded 
to it so it made sense that you would not have different 
suppliers supplying different elements it would make sense 
to 
have 
the 
same 
one 
for 
both. 
 
Is 
that 
a 
fair 
understanding?      
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 79 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   No, that is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would you accept though this 
proposition that the first contract entitled them only to 
manufacture hulls and that of course we know was the 
subject of a fairly competitive process in that the RFO 
process was followed where there were at least three 
interested parties that were offered that opportunity to 
compete.  VR Laser, LMT and DCD not so?       
MR TEUBES:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did the objective and the legal 
10 
provisions that the Chair has referred to of procurement 
regulations and so forth did that not then require that the 
second process in fact go out competitively.   
In other words, these were not items that you could 
purchase under the first agreement because the first 
agreement just had a narrow scope. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This was in addition to that and so 
although from a business sense it might make sense from a 
business point of view it might make sense to say well if 
20 
we already appointed them, VR Laser, in the first contract 
why not appoint them again but was it not in fact a 
requirement of the procurement policy that this to be 
competitive just like the first process had been.       
MR TEUBES:   Chair I think it is a valid argument from our 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 80 of 115 
 
perspective is that we have motivated the MOU to the 
highest authority within Denel and that was approved and I 
know there was objections from Mr Mlambo on it, I know 
there was consultations but at the end of the day it ended 
up with the top executives in Denel approving this MOA.  
So from that perspective my personal view was all of this 
was considered and it was a go ahead to do it, but do I 
today 
understand 
that 
from 
a 
procurement 
policy 
regulations perspective it could have been done differently 
I agree.      
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you also agree that the top 
executive however senior whether it be the Group CEO or 
the Group COO or the Board itself they are also bound 
legally by what is laid down by parliament in the PFMA the 
Public Finance Management Act, was is laid down in 
Treasury regulations under the PFMA and also under the 
procurement policy of Denel itself?  
MR TEUBES:   I fully agree.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and was it – I am not suggesting 
that one should not look at possible blame that should be 
20 
attached to the senior executives at group level but was it 
not part of your duty, you and your colleagues duties within 
DLS to ensure that if a recommendation was going up to 
Head Office for approval by the Group CEO that you should 
not be proposing or recommending a decision which might 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 81 of 115 
 
violate the PFMA or the Treasury regulations or the 
procurement policy of Denel.       
MR TEUBES:   Within the context of Denel is that the 
Denel procurement policy is derived from all the laws and 
the regulations, that is done by Denel Corporate.  So on a 
division level we act according to the policy so we do not 
have a direct relationship with the PFMA.  So the policy in 
our world is a translation of the PFMA and the application 
in our world.   
So to answer you Chair is that there was no specific 
10 
thoughts, specific comparisons done to recommendations 
to the PFMA. the comparisons was done to the policy.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy’s question has brought me 
back to an answer you gave earlier on and I just want us to 
interrogate that.  You said that because this agreement had 
been taken to the Group CEO and he had approved that 
somehow meant for you that it was fine. 
MR TEUBES:   Hmm.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there not a problem with that 
approach in circumstances where it comes from somebody 
20 
who would have made a recommendation prior to that issue 
coming to the Group CEO or because you do not want a 
situation where the Group CEO says I approved this 
because everyone below me recommended that I approve it 
and I relied on their recommendations and those under the 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 82 of 115 
 
Group CEO say we actually thought since he approved it, it 
should be fine.  Do you understand my concerns?         
MR TEUBES:   I do Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that to the extent that one may 
be dealing with somebody who made a recommendation at 
a level before the matter went to the Group CEO each one 
of those people who made a recommendation ought to be 
able 
defend 
if 
they 
defend 
their 
approval 
or 
their 
recommendation on its merits and not because later on 
somebody senior also approved.  Do you accept that?      
10 
MR TEUBES:   I do, I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR TEUBES:   I think if I may add Chair at a point where 
this was finally approved I think Mr Dennis Mlambo’s 
concerns was known.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TEUBES:   So it was not a consensus position within 
the bigger Denel on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
MR TEUBES:   So I would put it to say I do not think the 
20 
final approval could have been based on a consensus that 
there was consensus, it was known that there was a debate 
on this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of course that answer would be fine 
if you say look I stand by the recommendation that I made.  
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 83 of 115 
 
I think it was a good decision to recommend but having 
said that I am saying the Group CEO was aware of a 
different view or different views from Mr Mlambo.  He was 
also supposed to take those into account and decide.  He 
decided in particular way and I take it that he weighed up 
the different views but still be able to say as far as my 
recommendation is concerned that I stand by it I can 
defend it this is how I defend it or obviously you might say 
look at that time I thought it was justified but now when I 
have had a chance to look at the facts, look at the 
10 
situation or with the benefit of hindsight I am not able to 
defend it but at that time this is how I saw it.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  If I may just pick 
up just to complete this line of questioning pursuant to the 
Chairs questions.  Here you had Mr Mlambo at group 
executive level for Supply Chain being against the idea, 
correct? 
MR TEUBES:   Correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he was the expert, that was his 
field, you are not an expert in Supply Chain Management, 
20 
am I right?  
MR TEUBES:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Your expertise lays elsewhere in 
engineering and also in business leadership etcetera.  But 
Mr Mlambo’s concerns appear to be similar to what your 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 84 of 115 
 
own Divisional Supply Chain Head, Ms Malahlela, was 
warning you about as well.  In fact, the process started 
where she had said I believe we should go out to tender all 
RFQ’s and she was overruled within the division, correct?     
MR TEUBES:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then when the process was then 
pursued where the RFO was issued and - I am sorry where 
the RFO was not issued, where instead it was decided 
simply to award it to VR Laser she still raised concerns did 
she not about procurement irregularities.      
10 
MR TEUBES:   I cannot - I think in principle you are 
correct Chair but I cannot remember specific concerns.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I take you to 831 she of course 
has given her own evidence but I respect your – your 
evidence now that you cannot recall specific concerns.  But 
Ms Malahlela gave evidence that was instructed to prepare 
the memorandum we find at page 831 which was to make the 
recommendation in relation to the DLS contract as a sole 
20 
supplier contract to VR Laser.  And she says – are you 
familiar with this document?  Well you have actually attached 
it as an annexure but were you familiar with it at the time? 
MR TEUBES:  I am yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you give that instruction to her to 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 85 of 115 
 
issue this – or prepare this memorandum? 
MR TEUBES:  I – can I go back to what the Chair said 
earlier.  I do not think it was an instruction Chair.  I think it 
was a – we had a debate I do not think she was forced to 
write this memorandum.  In my mind is she wrote this 
memorandum after we had a debate and there was alignment 
on the idea.  So I do not think she was forced and knowing 
her is that she will not do anything against her will.  So – but 
I cannot – I do not agree with the word force.  But – um – ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I take you…  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Could it be that she was 
expected to do it on the basis that it was the majority view 
even if she did not agree with it?  Is there room for – would 
there have been room for her to do it under those 
circumstances not because she is forced in the normal sense 
but on the basis that the majority view is different from hers? 
MR TEUBES:  Yes Chair it is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR TEUBES:  Just quick context here.  At this stage she 
was an EXCO member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  So she was part of this EXCO meeting that 
had this discussion. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 86 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  I would think if she had such strong 
reservations that it would have been minuted in the EXCO 
meeting which it was not.  And again hindsight is the minutes 
a perfect reflection of – of the meeting I do not know.  But I 
would say if an argument is placed that she was forced to do 
that I did – does – it is not reflected in the minutes.  In the 
minutes it says the EXCO took the following decision and 
that minutes was accepted as a true reflection of that 
meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  I think Mr Kennedy might or 
might not take that further.  I seem to have the impression 
that her conduct after in terms of emails and correspondence 
seems to reflect that her view was still different from that of 
EXCO.  But Mr Kennedy might or might not be able to take 
that further. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  May I just raise this with the 
witness if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On this very page we at 831 Ms 
20 
Malahlela when she was taken to this in her evidence the 
other day directed the Chair’s attention to two points.  In the 
first paragraph she referred to the Group Supply Chain 
Executive gave an instruction that DLS must first explore 
how DVS will be used in the project on condition they – and 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 87 of 115 
 
then – so that relates to DVS.  But – but then she said to the 
Chair that she had deliberately put in a reference above her 
signature on the next page 832. 
“I request permission to implement the EXCO 
decision in this regard.” 
And it was her diplomatic way of recording that – or hinting 
that it was EXCO that was making the decision.  I take your 
point that she was part of EXCO but that she was not happy 
with the decision.  She did not agree with it.  So in other 
words she was not saying, I Ms Malahlela am in fact asking 
10 
or recommending that you give approval Mr Mlambo.  Any 
comment on that or do you stand by your earlier evidence? 
MR TEUBES:  Mr Chair I stand by my point.  Obviously I 
have got a lot of respect for Ms Malahlela and I do not want 
to debate her feedback to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TEUBES:  But I think as an EXCO if an EXCO has taken 
a decision you either abide by that decision or you formally 
state your objection and it must be minuted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I now take you to your latest 
affidavit that has been admitted and I take you please to 
page 1078.  This is Exhibit W17.2 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is the one that you prepared 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 88 of 115 
 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In fact when I refer to affidavit in fact 
will be an affidavit once you sign it before a Commissioner of 
Oaths. 
MR TEUBES:  Yes.  Hundred percent thank you Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I can be forgiven for that terminology 
that I use it is just simply for convenience.  Now why did you 
prepare this affidavit?  Was this at our request or the 
investigators request? 
10 
MR TEUBES:  No it was my own initiative Mr Chair.  In the 
previous supplementary a question was asked by the 
investigators who initiated this MOU process and I only made 
a single line answer without giving context to it.  Because I 
believed I addressed it in various areas within my statement.  
So I have only stated there it was Mr Stephan Burger.   
But I felt after all the – I was listening obviously to 
some of the witnesses here and I felt that maybe my 
different  areas that I have touched on this if I can give a 
chronological order of those events it will assist the 
20 
commission.  So this is not new information it is just 
repacking the chronological order of events. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well thank you for your concern to be 
comprehensive and detailed to give the Chair the full facts 
and the documents.  May I just ask specifically in relation to 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 89 of 115 
 
the issue we have just been debating?  At page 1081 
paragraph 7.  In fact sorry perhaps just to give it the context.  
The discussion from 1079 deals with the motivation of Martin 
Drevin for a single source.  Is that the same single source 
contract that he have been discussing up to now? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And does the same apply to the first 
draft Group CEO Supply Chain submission paragraph 3? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then the MOU from Denise 
10 
Govender. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And the second draft page – at 
paragraph 5 on page 1081. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And does the same apply to 6 – 
paragraph 6? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  I do not believe unless you want 
to highlight anything of particular significance for the Chair’s 
20 
attention I do not believe that it is necessary for us in your 
oral evidence to go through that.  But the evidence will be 
before the Chair for consideration.  What I would like to take 
up with you though Mr Teubes is your paragraph 78 at the 
foot of page 1081 and that is Celia Malahlela’s concern.  You 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 90 of 115 
 
refer to a reply from Celia in context it is a reply to a second 
draft submission. Was that the one that you had amended? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And the amendment was for VR 
Laser to be awarded the contract as a single source supplier 
without – without going through a competitive process. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now to look at her – how you 
have articulated her concern as she conveyed it to you 711 
says: 
10 
“Celia replied 10:31 on the 23 March raising 
her concerns with regard to – is that WRT – 
with regard to?” 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
“Change submission.  She suggested that we 
have a meeting to discuss.  I cannot recall if 
we had the meeting or what the outcome of 
the meeting was given that it was after the 
EXCO meeting.” 
20 
Is that still your position you cannot recall the [00:09:29]” 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Malahlela has given evidence about 
her discussions with you and Mr Burger where she raised 
repeatedly her concerns and she has expressed to the Chair 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 91 of 115 
 
her concern that she really was not taken sufficiently 
seriously in the advice she was giving as the Supply Chain 
Expert that this could not be done.  Any comment on that? 
MR TEUBES:  I have listened to Ms Malahlela’s evidence 
and that specific concern that she raised that she addressed 
in a letter to Mr Burger was only done much later than this 
specific incident.  So that – there is not a direct link between 
this meeting and that letter that she has written to Mr Burger.  
It is only – it was a couple of months later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy the amendment that you and 
10 
Mr Teubes were talking about in regard to paragraph 7.1.1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the amendment that Ms Malahlela 
talked about where she said she had prepared a submission 
going in a certain direction but she discovered later that that 
submission had been amended without her knowledge as I 
understood the position? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say something that was quite the 
opposite.  Is that… 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is one would think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what we are talking about. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The is one of the things that she 
testified about.  Perhaps I need to take you Chair just to 
cover that adequately.   
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 92 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because it is important. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I may have skipped – skimmed through 
something in the affidavit of Mr Teubes.  Mr Teubes you refer 
in your affidavit to email correspondence relating to the 
drafts of the submission whereas I recall you used the term I 
am – I have updated the submission. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To adopt a different angle. 
MR TEUBES:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just find that reference.  I am 
10 
sorry I do not have it at my fingertips Chair but can I just be 
given a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I ask while my learned colleagues 
are trying to find the reference for us – may I ask was there 
interaction between Ms Malahlela and Mr Burger at this 
stage in relation to the preparation of the documents and the 
procedure being followed or did she do everything through 
you? 
MR TEUBES:  I do not know.  I think the – Chair that the 
20 
majority discussions was probably with me although as what 
during happened during the hull contract there was also 
regular interactions between Ms Malahlela and Mr Burger.  
So I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did – in one of your affidavits you have 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 93 of 115 
 
referred to Mr Burger taking the initiative in relation to the 
approach for single source suppliers, is that correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I would like you please to expand on 
that.  In what way did that manifest itself? 
MR TEUBES:  If I can refer to my latest supplementary 
statement that I sent through last night? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  And if I take you to point 2 there on page 
1079. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  There under the Motivation for Mr Drevin. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  First paragraph. 
“In the week of 4 to 5 March I cannot 
remember the exact date Mr Burger had a 
discussion with me regarding the risk on the 
Hoefyster Program and specifically the supply 
of fabricated components and the fact that 
most other companies like Patria vertically 
20 
integrated to include this capacity in the 
company.  He suggest that for DLS to mitigate 
this risk a single source agreement must be 
established 
with 
the 
supplier 
that 
this 
capacity – for this as this capacity and 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 94 of 115 
 
capability.  I agreed with his reasoning in 
terms of the inherit risk and then I had a 
discussion with Martin Drevin to draw up that 
motivation.” 
But I think it key – I refer to there on the 216 on the next 
page. 
“This motivation is a technical risk motivation 
where 
it 
was 
technical 
risk 
mitigation 
orientated and not supplier specific.” 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright and then if I can refer you on 
10 
the same page the top of page 1079.  There is a heading the 
Individual within DLS who initiated the MOA. 
MR TEUBES:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just read out that next paragraph. 
MR TEUBES:  That - Mr Chair that was the question from the 
investigators 
which 
I 
reacted 
to 
in 
my 
previous 
supplementary and my answer on that is: 
“It is my understanding that it was Mr 
Stephan Burger in his capacity as DLS – the 
then DLS CEO who initiated the process of 
20 
there to be a single source supplier of 
Hoefyster turret armour steel fabrication and 
components.” 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  I am referred Chair thank 
you apologise for the delay.  My attention is drawn to page 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 95 of 115 
 
679.  You do refer to it in your affidavit and I just cannot find 
that at the moment but yes thank you.  679 is a series of two 
emails the one at the top is from yourself to Ms Malahlela, is 
that right? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then that was a response to hers at 
the foot of the page, is that right? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And further down the page of the March 
2015 and she said: 
10 
“Hi 
Reenen, 
please 
find 
the 
attached 
document as requested.” 
Now she gave evidence the other day before the Chair that 
she had submitted – she had prepared a submission to deal 
with the proposed transaction.  She dealt with it in a 
particular way but you then wrote back to her to say as you 
do in the top email. 
“I have changed the angle that we asked for 
approval 
from 
Riaz 
please 
see 
attached 
submission – any inputs?” 
20 
Now what informed that? 
MR TEUBES:  That was informed by a – if you just look 
again at my – the statement of last night is that we had a – 
we had the first draft as per the email of the 12 March then 
post that I received an email from Ms Denise Govender our 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 96 of 115 
 
legal executive in Denel attaching a MOU for this work and 
specifying VR Laser.  I had then on her reference – she 
referred me to Stephan and we had a discussion and the 
debate on that and it was post this debate that I have 
updated that submission. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now can I take you back please to page 
832 which is the one we looked at earlier where she refers to 
a request for permission to implement the EXCO decision in 
which she had been a minority.  And you mentioned earlier 
that Mr Mlambo had taken a different view.  We know what 
10 
his position is at Group level.  He is basically the top within 
the group. 
MR TEUBES:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  He was the absolute ultimate authority 
within the group relating to Supply Chain and procurement, 
correct? 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And were you aware that his approval 
was required for this type of transaction? 
MR TEUBES:  I do not agree with his approval in the – if you 
20 
look at the policy it says he needs to be consulted. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes he gave evidence about a 
particular reason why he should have been consulted. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But leave it at that the Chair will 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 97 of 115 
 
assess the evidence obviously in due course.  But I am 
interested in the handwritten portion that Mr Mlambo has 
said he inserted.  You see the – you see the typed portion 
above the handwritten portion says Approval.  The intention 
was to get him to sign to give his approval. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And he did not sign that instead he 
wrote in the reason why he was not approving. He said:   
“NB – DVS and LMT must submit proof that 
they cannot meet the requirements prior to 
10 
the contract being awarded to VR Laser.” 
Now you have already dealt with LMT and its limited capacity 
and its limited track record as well as problems that were 
being experienced with that.  I do not think we need to 
traverse that again.  But just deal briefly if you would with 
DVS.  He is suggesting that DVS as an in-house division of 
Denel should provide proof that it cannot do this type of 
production before he would be happy. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja.  If I just – Chair before I answer that if I 
can just give context between this letter vis a vis the 
20 
approval process for the MOU?  This letter that on which 
Denis Mlambo made a comment is about six months after the 
MOU process.   
So this specific letter does not reflect on the approval 
process or an input to the approval process of MOU it 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 98 of 115 
 
reflects to a position where we wanted to go out or there was 
a discussion to go out on either a tender or not a tender on 
this – the T5 program which is another product and the 
EXCO discussed that and that is where the whole decision 
that you referred to earlier appear in terms of policy versus 
approval levels came into debate.   
So the decision that we requested here from Mlambo 
was specifically on a T5 product to either go out on tender or 
in this case follow the MOU process.  So that was the 
reference in this letter. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But Mr Mlambo was concerned 
with a number of breaches of policy.  In fact the one he is 
identifying 
here 
specifically 
relates 
to 
the 
in-house 
capability.  In fact that as I recall was his evidence that that 
required 
his 
actual 
approval 
before 
work 
that 
could 
potentially be bond in-house with outsourced to somebody 
the group. 
MR TEUBES:  That is correct.  If there was in-house 
capability then that was subject to approval. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  So were you aware at the time 
20 
that he had issued this note firstly showing that he did not 
approve it and secondly giving his reason then.  He had 
other reasons that he raised in his evidence later. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But this specific one were you aware 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 99 of 115 
 
that he – this was the outcome of the process in which his 
approval had been sought but refused? 
MR TEUBES:  Yes I was aware of it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And did that not ring some alarm bells 
to you as a senior member of the DLS management as the 
COO at the time?  That we cannot do this without satisfying 
Mr Mlambo in terms of his authority and in terms of the 
prescripts of Denel policy for procurement that we must 
satisfy him that both DVS and LMT do not have the capacity? 
MR TEUBES:  I agree with the principle that my thoughts at 
10 
that stage was I got this letter and it was approved by the 
Group CEO.  And I would have – and my understanding was 
that he has taken in Mr Mlambo’s concerns and then he 
approved it.   
So I agree with you again in hindsight that we should 
have considered it differently but at that stage we accepted 
the Group CEO approval of this position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know one of the matters Mr Teubes 
that I look at from time to time when I hear evidence of how 
certain things happened in various SOE’s during these years 
20 
that we are talking about in the context of state capture and 
corruption.  Is where – where it is clear that the wrong thing 
was done and not the right thing.   
I try to look at why is it that maybe so many people 
who saw this or read the documentation who had what was 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 100 of 115 
 
being done or what they were being asked to agree to or 
approve.  Why is it that not enough people said but there is 
something wrong with this?  You see.  
So when then one looks at – at this issue here and 
one hears the argument from Mr Mlambo that it did not make 
sense to him to – for Denel to want to so to speak outsource 
business when they have got internal or Denel entities that 
have got the capabilities can do the job.  So – and then you 
see the Group CEO having said approved there.   
Well when Mr Mlambo was giving evidence I said was 
10 
this approved?  Meaning he approved your comments or was 
he giving the approval that you were not giving?  He said no. 
I think he said he – the Group CEO was giving the approval 
that he was not giving.  He was overriding it.  So I ask 
myself the question but  
1. What did this Group CEO say about the arguments – 
the merits of the arguments raised by Mr Mlambo?  
What did the other people other than the Group CEO 
say about the merits of the arguments by Mr Mlambo? 
Because one would expect that if there is no sound 
20 
answer to his arguments other people who did not think 
anybody had given a proper explanation should say, but 
hang on we do not understand why you are going ahead 
because we think Mr Mlambo whose point is valid you know.  
And then maybe if there are enough people who say that 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 101 of 115 
 
maybe the Group CEO is going to think twice before he 
approves. But if they all adopt the attitude, look let us leave 
it to this Group CEO if he approves he approves. 
MR TEUBES:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Then 
wrong 
things 
happen. 
 
You 
understand where my concern is? 
MR TEUBES:  Fully – fully understood Chair.  I just have to 
point out that between me and Ms Malahlela we did have 
meetings with Mr Denis Mlambo on this issue 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR TEUBES:  And we had discussions with him.  So it was 
not purely a situation submit this motivation and get either a 
approval or rejection back from corporate.  So we did engage 
with him. There is email communication post meetings we 
had with him on this.  But I – it – that does not disregard 
your position and your arguments on it I just wanted to add 
that it was not purely a blind process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  There was interaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  But as you sit there and you 
20 
look at his arguments what is your reaction as to what 
should have happened about his arguments?  Do you regard 
them as sound and as there not having anybody who came 
up with sounder, better, stronger arguments? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair as per the email communication post 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 102 of 115 
 
our meetings I differed with him with his arguments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  I did not agree with his perception of the 
capabilities in the different companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  I honestly believe that he did not have the 
same depth of knowledge on those capabilities that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEUBES:  So it is from that perceptive I differed with 
him and it is known in my emails that I differed with him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But did you put those arguments to 
him to say, you say we have got those capabilities within 
Denel but you are mistaken on that because of a, b, c, d we 
do not have those capabilities.  Or those capabilities are just 
not – the ones we have are not adequate for this purpose.  
Did you get a chance – did you put that to him? 
MR TEUBES:  Chair I believe in the meetings that I refer to 
in my emails I did.  In retrospect I should have probably put 
it in writing as well which I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TEUBES:  But I had joint meetings with him and Ms 
Malahlela ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay alright.  Mr Kennedy. 
MR TEUBES:  Thank you.  Chair may I then refer – sorry 
may I just make sure of how much time we still need to 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 103 of 115 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   How much time do you think you need? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I hope about 20-minutes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us try...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I know you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us try and finish it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We can try and finish.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I ask you please to turn right to 
the end of the bundle, page 862?  In fact, 861.  This is part 
10 
of the supplementary statement that you have prepared 
yesterday.  No, sorry.  It is the first supplementary affidavit.  
Do you have it? 
MR TEUBES:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not yet.  Sorry. 
MR TEUBES:   I have it.  Thank you, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At the foot of the page, 5.4.  MOU date 
versus the acquisition date of Denel Vehicle Systems.  Why 
was DVS not considered?  Now as I understand the earlier 
part of your affidavit, this is one of the questions that were 
20 
put to you by the investigators of the Commission for you to 
answer. 
MR TEUBES:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right? 
MR TEUBES:   Correct.  That is correct, Chair.   
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 104 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And your explanation, on the top of the 
next page: 
“According to my knowledge, VR Laser and DVS 
Processors were two parallel processes.  DVS did 
not have a hull manufacturing capability at the time.  
It was supplied by Denel.   
And 
Patria 
was 
hesitant 
to 
support 
DVS’s 
involvement at the time due to the perceived 
competition on the RG-41 vehicle from DVS which 
latter issue was subsequently resolved.” 
10 
 
May I just focus for a moment on the DVS entity? 
MR TEUBES:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Because we have seen Mr Mlambo was 
not saying necessarily that DVS had capacity but at least if it 
did not have capacity, it must provide proof that it does not 
have capacity. 
MR TEUBES:   Correct, ja. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Was 
the 
Patria 
issue 
about 
confidentiality or perceived competition rather in relation to 
its vehicle?  You say that was resolved.  Was that resolved 
20 
before the award of the contract to VR Laser? 
MR TEUBES:   No.  No, Chair.  That was resolved quite later 
and the reasons why, that the strategy has changed and 
including DVS to be the assemble house for the vehicles.  So 
we had to get approval from Patria in line with their licensing 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 105 of 115 
 
agreement so that DVS can be contracted for the assemble.  
So the issue was not resolved on the manufacturing.  The 
issue was resolved on the assemble portion of the contract. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  And then I would 
like to just tie up one last loose end in relation to this 
contract.  Can I now you ask please to turn near the front of 
the bundle to page 35?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 835? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   35. 
MR TEUBES:   I got it Mr Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now this was the passage I was unable 
to put my finger on earlier, the changing of the angle.  We 
have seen that the email where you use that terminology a 
little bit earlier.  Remember, we looked at that? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But what it is used here is to see 
reason why you changed the angle, according to your 
affidavit.  Look at page 35, 6.1.5. 
“I responded to the email...” 
 
That is Ms Malahlela’s email. 
20 
“...on the 20t h of March 2015, advising that I have 
changed 
the 
angle 
of 
the 
draft 
solution 
and 
requested her input on the same.   
In the revised draft submission, I added to the 
background and motivation and removed the supply 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 106 of 115 
 
chain 
note’s 
heading 
that 
had 
been 
included 
recommending that the single source supplier be 
chosen through a competitive bidding process and 
also recommended that VR Laser be appointed as 
the said supplier.” 
 
Her evidence the other day suggested that she was 
effectively instructed.  You said that you believe that she 
bought into the idea and was persuaded.  You stand by that 
evidence? 
MR TEUBES:   No.  No, Chair.  These are two different 
10 
subjects.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I beg your pardon. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja.  So on this – the letter that we previously 
discussed was on the T5-programme about six months later 
than the MOA. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja, so this MOA process here was that the 
first draft and the second draft on the submission that is 
discussed here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Thank you for clarifying that.  
20 
Now may we turn now to a couple of other aspects that were 
raised in your various affidavits or statements?  Turn now 
please to page 48.  You refer to in paragraph 8... 
MR TEUBES:   I have got it.  Thank you Mr Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You refer to negotiations with LMT for 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 107 of 115 
 
rewarding the Hoefyster contract to VR Laser.  Just 
summarise what this was about. 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, when we got approval to contract 
the whole contract to VR Laser, there was a condition in the 
approval to say, is it possible to fine an alternative 
contracting model to include LMT or not?   
 
So that – through that approval, he gave me the 
mandate to engage with Dr Nel to see can we involve them in 
this process or not.   
 
And with that process, we – well, I have developed the 
10 
two options, Option A and Option B.  That was discussed 
then with Dr Nel at length.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then if you can turn please to 
page 46?  This deals with the appointment of VR Laser by 
DLS in 2016.  Now we have already dealt with the Hull 
contract that was awarded in 2014.  The Single Source 
Supplier contract that was awarded in 2015.  Correct? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Am I correct in understanding, you are 
dealing here with a separate transaction that followed that? 
20 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that relates to different items than 
those covered by the first two contracts. 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct.  Also for a different 
programme. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 108 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And for a different programme.  Right.  
Not for Hoefyster? 
MR TEUBES:   No, it was for the Malaysian programme 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now I appreciate that you were 
dealing with this at the request of the investigators to deal 
with specific issue.  But can you just sum up your points in 
relation to this particular contract?  What significance is 
there that you would like to draw to the attention of the 
Chair? 
10 
MR TEUBES:   Chair, off the cuff, there is nothing else that I 
would like to add here.  My apologies.  No, I do not think 
there is something that I would like to in addition to these 
three points. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But thank you Mr Teubes.  There is one 
aspect that I would like to draw to your attention just to 
explain and that is at page 47, paragraph 7.8.  Oh, sorry 7.7.   
“On 22 March 2016, Ms Malahlela had at the Exco 
meeting of DLS raised the concern once more about 
20 
the 
apparent 
over-reliance 
by 
DLS 
on 
a 
memorandum of agreement it had concluded with VR 
Laser, where this agreement was in conflict with the 
Supply Chain Policy of Denel.” 
 
Do you recall her raising those concerns in 2016? 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 109 of 115 
 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, yes.  And in this case, it was also 
minute on the Exco meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now – so this is the – and when 
you refer here to the apparent over-reliance, according to 
Ms Malahlela, by DLS on a memorandum of agreement, 
would that be the first agreement from 2014 for the hulls, the 
second agreement in 2015 of the Single Source Supplier of 
additional items, or what? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, it is the second agreement.  The 
MOA agreement with VR Laser. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And so she was alerting you 
there to the fact that that second agreement was in her view 
in conflict with the Supply Chain Policy? 
MR TEUBES:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you discuss it with her?  Did you 
indicate a contrary view to her or do you not recall? 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, the only discussion was at this 
Exco meeting.  And as I...  I cannot remember the detailed 
discussions on the Exco meeting but I have reflected the 
comments that was minute by Mr Burger in this Exco 
20 
meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then, Mr Burger’s 
comments – comment from him is referred to in your 
paragraph 7.8.  You say: 
“Mr Burger in his capacity as the CEO of DLS 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 110 of 115 
 
advised that the memorandum of agreement was to 
be signed by the Group Chief Executive Officer of 
Denel Limited and should therefore supersede the 
Supply Chain Policy of Denel in instances where the 
two documents were in conflict.” 
MR TEUBES:   That is exactly how it was minute in the Exco 
meeting, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that make sense to you?  Do you 
understand why that should be the case?  Because when 
10 
Ms Malahlela or whoever gave evidence about it, it sounded 
strange to me ...[intervenes]  
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that you can have an agreement – you 
can say an agreement that is in conflict or concluded in 
breach of the company’s policy is fine because it is signed 
by the Group CEO.  Because one would – one expects that 
agreements must be in line with the policy. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did this point make sense to you when 
20 
you heard about it or when you heard Mr Burger said this? 
MR TEUBES:   Ja.  Mr Chair, I was in that Exco meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You were.  Ja. 
MR TEUBES:   Ja, so I was part of it.  No, I have to say, I 
cannot remember exactly what my thoughts was on it.  In 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 111 of 115 
 
retrospect, in reading it now, I have got the same concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TEUBES:   But I cannot recall specific thoughts on it 
during that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Ja, it is like.  Well, if it is 
signed by somebody higher up, even if it is against the law, 
it is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.   
MR TEUBES:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Ja, okay alright.   
10 
MR TEUBES:   Noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact, in that vein, may I take you 
back to your comment that you made earlier?  That with the 
benefit of hindsight, you have realised, particularly in 
relation to the media controversy and the public interest in 
the link between VR Laser and the Gupta family and their 
networking including Mr Salim Essa. 
 
You realised that that perhaps things could and should 
have been done differently.  Can I just put a proposition to 
20 
you Mr Teubes for your comment if you wish to make a 
comment? 
MR TEUBES:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I want to suggest to you that while I 
accept fully that you are an engineer by background and not 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 112 of 115 
 
a lawyer, does this not illustrate that one has to ensure 
compliance with procurement policies upfront?   
 
Because you do not know when you are sitting in a 
position of Mr Teubes or Ms Malahlela or whoever upfront, 
exactly who may or may not be behind particular tenderers 
and so forth.   
 
And you learnt the hard way later in an organisation like 
Denel that there are all sorts of things that are coming out of 
the woodwork.   
 
And that is precisely why the process has to be fair and 
10 
lawful and competitive from the beginning so that the 
process does not get mired in controversy later when it 
emerges that a single source supplier has been allocated... 
 
A contract has been allocated to a company that through 
shareholders are now causing embarrassment to Denel and 
where procurement policies have not been followed. 
MR TEUBES:   H’m.  Mr Chair, I fully agree with that.  I think 
that is the hard lesson learnt out of this process.  I think we 
have also learnt the lesson in this process, be more critical 
of what is happening and not just accept.   
20 
 
And I think when if you look at one of the Denel’s values 
that have changed now is it courage.  And the courage is to 
question.   
 
And I think we went through a period where we probably 
did not question enough.  And I think – I fully agree with the 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 113 of 115 
 
statement, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And may I ask, to what extent was your 
feeling of comfort at that stage that it has now changed to 
discomfort?  To what extent were you influenced?   
 
Although you were senior within DLS, to what extent 
were you influenced by the fact that Mr Burger was senior to 
you and was giving you a measure of reassurance.   
 
And so to, you have mentioned earlier to the Chair, it 
was subject to the Group CEO, Mr Saloojee giving his 
approval and that was given.  Did that give you comfort? 
10 
MR TEUBES:   Mr Chair, at that stage my focus on the 
technical performance and the technical risks and crisis’s we 
had on Hoefyster.   
 
So maybe I did not spent enough in applying my mind 
around 
the 
– 
let 
us 
call 
it 
the 
political 
ownership 
environment.  
 
 So to answer the question, was I comfortable or not?  I 
think as time progressed and with all the media hype around 
the owners, the level of un-comfort rose. 
 
But I cannot give you an exact point where I said to a 
20 
point this is unacceptable.  But that level of un-comfort rose 
over time.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much Mr Teubes.  We 
have no further questions as the legal team for this witness.  
Thank you, Chair.   
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 114 of 115 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr Teubes for 
coming to assist the Commission.  We appreciate it very 
much.  If we need you to come back, we will ask you to come 
back.  But for now, you are excused.   
MR TEUBES:   Thank you very much Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, we have no 
further witnesses arranged for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We have been allocated further time, 
10 
not next week but the following week, starting on the 
9t h of November ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...where we have a number of 
witnesses lined up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Who will include Mr Mantsha and as 
well as Mr Ntshepe.  The legal team will be consulting with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He was not available until now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We will be consulting with him this 
afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
30 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 295 
 
Page 115 of 115 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we would ask for the proceedings 
of today to then be adjourned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And for the Denel stream evidence 
then to be postponed to resume on the 9t h of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  We are going 
to adjourn or the day.  Next week, the Commission will hear 
evidence by Ms Kwinana who used to be a member of the 
SAA Boards as well as evidence from Ms Dudu Myeni who 
was chairperson of the SAA Board for a certain period.  So 
10 
for today, we are going to adjourn at this stage.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 2 NOVEMBER 2020
