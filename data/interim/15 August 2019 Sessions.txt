PROCEEDINGS ON 15 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning – good morning Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you ready this morning? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, yes we are Chairman. Chairman Mr 
Thabethe has got legal representatives.  It might be prudent for them to 
place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us do that.   
ADV HERMAN FOURIE:  Good morning Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV HERMAN FOURIE:  From my side Herman Fourie from the law firm 
Jacobs Fourie Attorneys on behalf of Mr Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Yes. 
ADV JACOBS:  Good morning Chair.  Mr Jacobs from the firm Jacobs 
Fourie Attorneys in Bloemfontein. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I must clarify is it both attorneys for him 
– for him or? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman both of them are from – 
for Mr Thabethe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both – okay, no that is fine.  Okay no thank you.   
Okay.  You are ready? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes I am Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us administer the oath or affirmation unless you 
have got something to say before we do that? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 3 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I always do Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If I might just? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There is just one or two things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The first is that it is Mr Peter Mbana 
Thabethe who will be giving evidence today.  He is an implicated party 
Chairman but he has all along indicated his willingness to assist the 
commission.  That is really what I wanted to place on record.  And – 
10 
which brings him here today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The second point Chairman is simple 
again his evidence falls within the ambit of terms of reference 1.4 and 
1.9.  The third point Chairman is that the exhibit that contains his 
affidavits is Exhibit HH10.  If you may kindly admit that to the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do that once – after she – he has been sworn 
in.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just – just before you start with his evidence. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then the last point Chairman is that 
we will making reference over the next two days to various documents 
that you have before you but in due course we will then make reference 
to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 4 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have added some documents to the 
reference file for instance but it keeps growing as we – as we continue 
with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  The witness is 
ready to be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just administer the oath or affirmation please. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Mbana Peter Thabethe. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding to your 
conscience? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you may proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Maybe at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Maybe at this point you will then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Admit the… 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 5 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Admit Exhibit HH10 to the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the affidavit of Mr 
Mbana Peter Thabethe will be marked Exhibit HH10. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman the second set of documents 
are what we have labelled the court record.  It is a record of other court 
proceedings that we thought would be relevant at some point even if it 
is when we are making submissions – submissions Chairman.  We ask 
that those too be entered into the record as the court record bundles A 
and B? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do they relate to different court proceedings? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They relate to different court proceedings 
Chairman but you will find that a number of the FA’s served in different 
– same FA served in different court proceedings.  So by way of example 
there is one that has got – that serves here in these papers that Mr 
Thabethe has submitted that we have put into that file Chairman 
because it has a few more annexures or it has the complete set of 
annexures.  Mr Thabethe has indicated that he has not had access to 
all the papers he would have liked to have access to and for that 
reason he is relying on other sources of the same information even 
other affidavits.  It is really a reference bundle Chairman that we 
20 
believe will come in handy.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to find a way of identifying it you see the 
one has got an index on top which also has got a case number so it is 
easy to identify it with a case number but the other one does not seem 
to have any court process immediately at the top with a case number. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 6 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman if – it is Volume 1 and 2 it is all 
one case if my recollection serves me well.  It is the same case 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm it is just that you said it is different court 
proceedings. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I beg – Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I asked whether they relate to different court 
proceedings you said yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Okay I misunderstood the question 
Chairman. Those particular papers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One matter? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Relate to one matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  The B is it a continuation of Annexures to 
certain affidavits? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The microphone Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file that contains documents relating to 
case number 168/2 – is that 2016? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  2018 if I am not wrong Chairman.  It is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  2018. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Free State High Court Bloemfontein in the 
matter between the National Director of Public Prosecutions is to be 
marked Exhibit HH Court Records A and the other lever arch file which 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 7 of 146 
 
has got some of the annexures belonging to the same matter will be 
marked Exhibit HH Court Records B.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe you 
have the witness bundle in front of you.  You have to switch on your 
microphone please Sir.  So you press – that is it and you may want to 
pull it a little closer just so that you are very audible.  Thank you very 
much.  And then the nod is not recorded on the microphone. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe if we look at the very first 
document in the witness bundle that is in your possession – if you look 
at page 1 – paginated page 1, the numbers are on the right hand side 
of the page and then if you go to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Exhibit HH10? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is Exhibit HH10 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are asking him to look at ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct.  And if you keep your 
finger on page 1 and turn to page 26. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would like to ask you to kindly identify 
1. Whose document this is? 
2. Whose signature is on page 26? 
3. Where the document was deposed to and when? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  The names on the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 8 of 146 
 
affidavit are mine and the signature is mine.  It was – the oath was 
taken in Bloemfontein on the 5 August 2019. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Can you then look at the next 
document that you have submitted?  If you turn to page 100 paginated 
page 100. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And while you have your finger there if 
you can then turn to page 145 – 145.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again could you identify the name on page 
10 
100 whose document this is.  Then at 145 who the de – whose 
signature appears thereon and the date and place at which this 
document was deposed to? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it is my name and my signature.  
It was a sworn affidavit that was done in Bloemfontein on the 18 May 
2018. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  The last document you will 
find on page 236 and if again you put your finger there and go to page 
243.  Once again can you identify this document, date and place of 
deposition for the Chairman? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  It is my name and 
… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Page 243 has the signature. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is my signature. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And when did you depose to this 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 9 of 146 
 
document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was done on the 10 August 2017. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  So today you will be relying 
on these three affidavits 2017, 2018 and 2019?  Is that correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now that we have these formalities on the 
record could you please tell the Chairman what your occupation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether you did get a chance to get 
10 
somebody to work towards getting clearer copies of these affidavits and 
whether that is likely to produce any positive results? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman can I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just could not read any of these pages – these 
pages – this affidavit which is shaded. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In particular the one – the 2018 affidavit 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Starting from page 99. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to the end of – up to just before divider number 5. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman we have asked our 
investigators to see if they can get a better copy.  We have been trying 
to do so Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have not had very much luck. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 10 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I think we have had a new opportunity 
to find. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Better copies of affidavits that have been 
filed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe explained this morning when 
we had our short consultation as did his attorneys that they actually 
checked the court file. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that file’s copies were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is worse than these? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Worse than these particular ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They too have made a great effort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To try and get clearer copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe they might indicate whether that is his 
attorneys whether they were in touch with the attorneys for the NPA in 
20 
that matter whether they also have a similar problem.  Because I 
thought maybe the attorneys on the other side might have a clearer 
copy because otherwise if possible maybe one of the lawyers rather 
than the investigators could just phone the firm of attorneys who acted 
for the NPA and say, do you have a clearer copy of this document can 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 11 of 146 
 
we be assisted?  And then they might just be able to assist.  I do not 
know.  Is that something that has been done? 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Chair thank you we have tried in the past to 
obtain a clearer copy.  We have personally like my learned colleague 
stated tried to obtain the court file to see if for some reason a clearer 
copy would be in the court file and there has been no success.  If it can 
be we can try and obtain certain unsigned documents if that might be 
able to clarify and then we can place that on record that the content of 
same would be similar that might assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that would assist.  If it is basically the same 
10 
documents just that it is unsigned that would assist then that part can 
placed on record and I am sure Mr Thabethe can confirm that it is 
unsigned but it is exactly the same or something like that.  It is 
something that would be most welcome. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Chair we then undertake if it is suitable for 
yourself and for my learned colleagues to try and obtain throughout 
such a copy we obviously cannot make any promises to same but if we 
can as soon as same becomes available then we can provide yourself 
and everyone concerned with such a copy and then at a relevant time 
we can just confirm accordingly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you do not – you do not recall whether your 
attempts included talking to the attorneys who represented the NPA in 
those proceedings? 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Chair at this stage for today not when we 
drafted the affidavit 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 12 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  We tried to obtain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  We did not make a renewed effort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  For today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  You will note in the affidavit for Mr Thabethe 
there is mention made that if certain documents are requested 
beforehand. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  That it be requested in order for us to try and 
eliminate what the situation that we have now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  But we will endeavour to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  From now on again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  And as soon as same becomes available we will 
inform everyone accordingly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that would be helpful because when I tried to 
read those affidavits last night I just could not really read anything and 
obviously that is not good for us when we deal with it – when the 
witness deals with it if I have not had a chance to look at it.  So of 
course you not being in your office does cause some challenges in 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 13 of 146 
 
terms of getting certain things maybe done but maybe not.  So if it is 
possible that one could get a clearer copy even if it is an unsigned 
copy as long as the understanding is that it is exactly the same 
document and if we – I could have it by end of today then be able to 
look at it this evening before tomorrow that would be helpful. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  We will endeavour for same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe could 
you please tell the Chairman what your current occupation is? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am a pensioner Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You seem to say that with – with some pleasure.  
Maybe you are enjoying your retirement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair no I – since having 
relinquished my position of Head of Department I opted to go on 
pension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You – you speak of relinquishing your 
position at the Department when I read paragraph 17 on page 7 of your 
affidavit the 2019 affidavit you speak here of a contract you had.  You 
20 
speak of being suspended but you also go on to say at paragraph 17 
that the contract has not yet been terminated by the Department.  
Maybe you could just explain that to the Chairman? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Thank you very much Chair.  I was 
suspended pending the report that was tabled by the Public Protector 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 14 of 146 
 
that required that the Province should do an investigation on the – on 
the recommendations that were raised by the Public Protector.  And 
then during my suspension my contract also came to an end.  During 
the time when that contract came to an end I never received any 
indication from Government whether this contract has been terminated 
or whether the contract has been extended.  So it was quiet.  But the – 
the salary was terminated.  I since then applied for my pension benefits 
thinking that I am no longer an employee hence – because the contract 
did come to an end but I was not given any notice in that effect if 
indeed it had – the contract was terminated.   
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  It just was not clear from 
paragraph 17 whether you were still drawing a salary or not but you 
have now clarified that point. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I take it that you did not get a severance 
package or any kind of package either from the Department you last 
served in? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was not a severance package it was 
a pension. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  The investigation you referred to – 
20 
you were suspended because they were going to investigate some 
matters.  If you look at page 148 unfortunately Chairman it is the same 
file Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is one of those slightly opaque. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 15 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am looking for another file for another reason.  
Yes okay.  What page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is page 148 Chairman and it is 
Annexure FR2.  It is one of the rather poor copies but I really am 
simply making reference to this.  This is the letter of suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe what has come of any 
investigation that you may be aware of that followed on the 
recommendations of the Public Protector?  If you are not aware of an 
investigation you will simply say that. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am now aware Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You have never been called back to the 
Department to deal with any matters arising from the Public Protector’s 
Report? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The only time I have been called was 
last week where I have been called by the Public Protector to come and 
give witness.  But it related to a separate investigation on the same 
matter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I then – I will not take that matter any 
further because it is not one that we are dealing with directly but can I 
20 
ask you this question?  There was a report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe Ms Gcabashe I do not think he answered 
your question.  He may have misunderstood the question.  I think the 
question Mr Thabethe was whether you have since your suspension the 
Department has ever called back to the Department to ask you about 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 16 of 146 
 
anything connected with that investigation or your suspension. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No I have not been called Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Thank you Mr 
Thabethe.  There was of course also a report that had been 
commissioned by National Treasury in or around 2012, 2013 and a final 
report on the aspects investigated was issued in February of 2014.  
That report also recommended that steps be taken against you in 
particular – do you know of any investigation against your conduct or 
aimed at interrogating your conduct that might have been initiated as a 
10 
result of the National Treasury Report? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair I am aware of an 
investigation that was done by the National Treasury with regard to the 
Vrede Dairy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The question though is are you aware of 
any investigation that interrogated your conduct which investigation 
would have been prompted by the National Treasury findings in 2014? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No I am not aware Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Let us talk a little bit about your 
qualifications Mr Thabethe.  Would it be correct to say that you are an 
20 
agriculturalist? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That will be correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think of pertinent relevance to these 
proceedings would be for the Chairman to understand just a – give him 
a brief summary of those qualifications that you have in the agricultural 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 17 of 146 
 
field? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you very much Chair.  I have 
since the 1 February 1989 employed and involved in the agricultural 
sector in different areas in South Africa.  I obtained by Bachelor of 
Agriculture Degree in 1988 from the University of Fort Hare and during 
1991 I obtained my Bachelor of Agriculture Honours Degree also from 
the University of Fort Hare.  And then I obtained my Master’s Degree in 
Development Communication from the University of Pretoria in 2002.  
After I obtained my first Bachelor of Agriculture Degree I was employed 
as an agricultural advisor at the Mpumalanga Agricultural Development 
10 
Corporation during the period of 1 February 1989 until the 30 August 
1992.  On 1 September 1996 after having moved from the Development 
Corporation into the then KaNgwane Department of Agriculture which 
later was then amalgamated and I was appointed as Assistant Director 
Non Formal Training.  I remained in the employment of the Department 
of Agriculture for the Mpumalanga Province up until 3 July 2009 
although in a different position and in different areas of the province. 
On 3 August 2009 I was appointed as a special advisor to the 
Minister for the National Department of Agriculture Forestry and 
Fisheries of which after I was appointed as an Acting Deputy 
20 
Director-General Operational Management for the Department of 
Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries until 30 July 2011.  I relocated to 
Bloemfontein 
during 
2011 
after 
having 
been 
appointed 
on 
1 August 2011 as the Head of Department for Rural Development for 
the Free State Provincial Government. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 18 of 146 
 
During 2013 the Department of Rural Development was 
amalgamated with the Department of Agriculture.  Whereas I was then 
appointed as Head of the Department from 1 May 2013.  Chair since I - 
I have commenced my employment in the Agricultural Sector I have 
gained extensive knowledge and experience in the sector in agriculture 
in general and I have been actively involved in a number of activities. 
Inclusive was strategic planning for the South African 
Agriculture and Agricultural Development and I have also attended 
various international causes and references on behalf and - and 
conferences on behalf of the National and Provincial Departments of 
10 
Agriculture.  Chair we have attached in this affidavit a copy of my 
curriculum vitae which contains a summary of my employment history. 
The specialist knowledge I have acquired.  My in service 
training.  My international experience and my academic qualification 
which has been attached.  I can conclude Chair by saying I was 
therefore appointed as Head of the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development based on my knowledge and experience of agriculture in 
South Africa.  I thank you Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe you refer to your CV.  You 
also have told the Chairman that you were the Head of Department for 
20 
the - for - in the Free State for the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development.  Your CV also indicates that at some point - point you 
were an Acting DG in the National Department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you have held senior positions in your 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 19 of 146 
 
term of employment? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I have - I have done so Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I have an interest in what you call 
specialist knowledge acquired which you have put into your CV.  It is on 
page 1-5-7.  That you have that particular column. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Ms Gcabashe I just want him to fill a gap that I 
picked up on his employment history.  A period of four years between 
1992 to 1996 it looks like you were not working.  Is that correct?  When 
you were telling us what - what you were doing when and where.  There 
was a gap there. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank - thank you Chair.  When - 
when I moved from the Mpumalanga Development Corporation I joined 
the KaNgwane Government in which I worked until it - there was an 
amalgamation of the regions which was former South Africa and - and 
the homeland systems.  It was then that I - after that amalgamation I 
was appointed Assistant Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So during that four - four year period in part you were 
- before 1994 and what was called KaNgwane … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  KaNgwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Homeland or Government and then after 1994 then it 
20 
became Mpumalanga Province. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Mpumalanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is where - that is where you were. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 20 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just that something that I think in your - in your 
statement there was also that gap but I - I also thought when you were 
speaking there was a gap but maybe I did not understand correctly.  So 
you 
were 
in 
partly 
KaNgwane 
then 
partly 
in 
Mpumalanga 
Administration? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I am at page 157 of the paginated 
papers Mr Thabethe and I would like you to interpret for the Chairman 
10 
the specialist knowledge acquired table.  I - I have a particular interest 
in what would be an intermediate level of knowledge as opposed to an 
advanced level of knowledge and the reason for my interest is because 
the very last entry speaks to the Constitution of the Republic of South 
Africa, Section 25 and Schedule 4 of the Constitution. 
Now for those competencies you say you have or had an 
intermediate level of knowledge.  Please explain that to the Chairman. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  The - the - thank you Chair.  My - 
my indication there - the - the first column there was basic.  It means it 
is - it is elementary.  You have not dealt with that particular act or 
20 
whether it is policies that you have dealt with.  You - you do not have 
thorough knowledge in that regard. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  (Intervenes). 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  When you … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Sorry.  Can you repeat that?  If it is basic 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 21 of 146 
 
you do not have thorough knowledge in that regard? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  You - you have just exposed to 
them but you have not interacted in terms of the implementation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If you have - you - you are 
intermediate my interpretation was that you have dealt with it but still 
at a lower level.  When you are advanced it - it means you have also 
dealt with it at senior level. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see my - my interest in just probing 
this a little further is because of the very senior positions you have 
10 
occupied and the centrality of the Constitution to the manner in which a 
senior member of the Public Service would conduct him or herself.  Are 
you with? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am with you Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now for the Constitution of the Republic 
of South Africa one of the focal areas we will be dealing with today and 
tomorrow is Sections 2-1-5, 2-1-6 and 2-1-7 of the Constitution.  You 
have understood that proposition? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I note however that you also referred to 
20 
Section 25 of the Constitution which is the provision that deals with 
property.  Also a rather important element in agriculture. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So my question is if you were not as 
familiar with the Constitution and with - in particular the sections I have 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 22 of 146 
 
just read out to you would that be something that you would disclose to 
an - a perspective employer or what would the position be? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the reason Chair why I have 
marked myself down in that regard as intermediate is because it 
requires a thorough legal knowledge for you to be able to do that 
interpretation.  Now I did not have that level of knowledge for me to be 
able to do interpretation.  Hence I have placed myself as intermediate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the knowledge that you are referring to there 
that you had knowledge of the Constitution in general or was it 
knowledge of Section 25 of the Constitution? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it was mostly the knowledge of 
Section 25 and Schedule 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you were saying you had what you regarded 
as - as intermediate knowledge of was Section 25 of the Constitution 
and Schedule 4? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I however point out to you 
Mr Thabethe that when one looks - I know it is a poor copy - but when 
one looks at the punctuation here you have written Constitution of the 
20 
Republic of South Africa, - that is the punctuation that matters.  Then 
you write Section 25 and Schedule 4.  I simply explain to you why I 
read it differently. 
That because of the punctuation you have put in here you are 
talking - and also because of the positions that you occupied as a 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 23 of 146 
 
senior manager in the Public Service that you would have to be familiar 
really with the broad provisions of the Constitution you must as a 
senior manager.  You cannot become a Head of Department and not 
know whether by way of example a Premier or a Member of the 
Executive Council should be signing off on a particular resolution or 
proposal because it will have a legal implications. 
You know there is a lot that you actually need to be able to - 
to discuss with the people you work with when you are in a senior 
position and those provisions that you are discussing with them - I just 
took an easy one.  That one is Section 100 of the Constitution.  Those 
10 
provisions actually inform you and inform your principals of the powers 
you have and the powers they have.  So the Constitution is really 
central to everything we do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you might wish to - to check whether in the 
light of the comma to which you have made reference which - which I 
could not see because this copy is so poor.  You might wish to check 
what he has to say to your understanding of that.  Namely that it seems 
to be saying that he has intermediate knowledge not just of Section 25 
and Schedule 4 but of the Constitution, Section 25 and Schedule 4. 
What - what do you say to that question - to - to that 
20 
understanding of what is written there?  Do you agree with it?  Do you 
not agree with it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I - I agree with - with the 
interpretation.  It includes the Constitution … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 24 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Section 25 and Schedule 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  So that part is clarified. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman and - and it is a 
well-made concession because of your seniority within the service and 
the responsibility that comes with the level at which you operated both 
at National Government and at Provincial Government because by way 
of example you are advisor to Minister Joemat-Pieterse at some point. 
Again as an advisor you have to be familiar with the powers 
that the Minister may or may not exercise.  You would agree? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair.  The - the 
10 
reason why I indicated it in my CV so that whoever gets exposed to my 
CV to take a decision either of employment or for any other purpose 
will have an understanding of my knowledge and understanding of the 
Constitution, Section 25 and Schedule 4 because those which I thought 
will be more relevant to - to my job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be fair to say what you refer to as 
intermediate knowledge of the Constitution, Section 25 and Schedule 4 
- would it be fair to say that that means reasonable knowledge knowing 
that you are not necessarily a lawyer but you - it is a reasonable 
knowledge of the Constitution at least insofar as it may relate to 
20 
matters that fall within your job.  Would it be fair to say that is what it 
means? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct.  That is correct 
Chair because my interpretation of advanced it means you are an 
expert. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 25 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I will - to give you an indication now I 
will be exploring this matter a little further when we look at the senior - 
I beg your pardon.  The Supply Chain Management Policy of the 
Department of Agriculture that you signed off on because that document 
gives effect at the end of the day to Section 2-1-7 of the Constitution 
but I do not want to explore it now. 
I will probably explore it after tea.  I just want to indicate to 
you now that this is going to be an important aspect of what I will be 
exploring really having a discussion about as we proceed.  More 
10 
pertinently for current purposes could you please enlighten the 
Chairman on whether you were headhunted for the position of Head of 
Department Rural Development in the Free State or whether you 
applied for that job voluntarily? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I applied for the job which was 
advertised.  In - in fact Chair I - I had to choose.  The National 
Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries had actually placed 
me to become an Agricultural attaché in Brazil and I at that same time I 
had applied for the position in the Free State.  I had to choose which 
one because my kids were still at school I opted to stay in the country.  
20 
I opted to go to the Free State. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Having opted to go to the Free State can I 
ask you this question prior to your appointment as Head of Department 
Rural Development had you met the then Premier Mr Magashule?  So 
prior to your appointment had you met the then Premier Mr Magashule? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 26 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  I have met at different 
gatherings and also in the ANC meetings. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because as I understand it, it is the 
Premier who appoints Heads of Department.  Please correct me if 
something different happened in your case. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You were appointed by - and that is the 
norm - by the Premier? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By the Premier.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The Premier however did not encourage 
10 
you in any way manner or form to apply for this job? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  Not - not so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Had you met the MEC who you ended up 
reporting to Mr Mosebenzi Zwane prior to your appointment as Head of 
Department Rural Development? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  I only saw him the first 
time during the interview. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who else sat on that panel that 
interviewed you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I do not remember very well.  I do not 
20 
want to speculate in case I - I give wrong names but what I can say it 
was a team of MECs that interviewed me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Premier was not part of the panel? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  The Premier was not part of the 
panel. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 27 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is it correct that on your appointment in 
2011 the Department of Rural Development and the Department of 
Agriculture were two separate departments? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  They were two 
separate departments under one Member of the Executive Council. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Could you then please explain to the 
Chairman the distinct competencies and responsibilities of the 
Department of Rural Development as opposed to those of the 
Department of - of Agriculture? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the Department of Agriculture 
10 
derives its mandate from the National Department of Agriculture 
Forestry and Fisheries which were in the past as one department which 
were then split from National.  After that split we had a National 
Department of Agriculture which they added two functions which was 
Forestry and Fisheries and the new department that was created was 
the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. 
The Department of Agriculture had a concurrent function with 
the Provincial Department of Agriculture but not in all aspects like 
Fisheries.  Fisheries was only a national competency.  It is not a 
competency of the province.  The same with the Department of Rural 
20 
Development and Land Reform.  The Land Reform part it is a national 
competency but the Rural Development it is a concurrent function. 
So when - when the Department of Rural Development was 
formed in the provinces after national had decided on a Department of 
Rural Development and Land Reform the province had only the mandate 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 28 of 146 
 
for Rural Development.  When it was initiated in the Free State that 
responsibility was given initially to the Department of Public Works but 
on operations it became very difficult for the Department of Public 
Works to work with the Department of Rural Development because they 
had to mostly deal with agricultural development and farmers because 
those were the Rural Development issues that were to be dealt with. 
They then transferred the function to the Department of 
Agriculture in the province of which then they advertised the post for 
the Head of Department for Rural Development and that is the position 
that I applied for.  Then the two were easy to work together but there 
10 
were still challenges because there were two separate departments.  
Each one with a Head of Department reporting to the same MEC. 
A recommendation was then made that the two must be 
amalgamated into one department with one Head of Department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who made that recommendation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The recommendation was raised by 
the two of us who were HODs for Agriculture and Rural Development.  
We made a recommendation because we - we saw it very difficult to 
work and operate because in fact it was supposed to be one person 
attending the other meeting.  The other person attending the other 
20 
meeting of the other department but we were supposed to come 
together and consolidate that information so that we are able to plan 
and work together.  So it - it was not easy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But that planning and working together 
was for reporting purposes reporting to the MEC.  I - I would have 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 29 of 146 
 
assumed that their distinct functions that Rural Development would 
require of an officer and that Agriculture would require of an officer or 
an HOD. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it was not only reporting but also 
the budget part.  You - you cannot have one vote reported by two 
accounting officers because the vote was one because the MEC will 
present one budget vote and then you will then have one accounting 
officer because you cannot have two.  It means the other HOD will not 
be an accounting officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I guess there was difficulty in establishing who - 
10 
between the two of you - who would be the accounting officer as long 
as there were two Heads of Department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  It - it - fortunately I was new.  I 
then allowed the older HOD to become the accounting officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But please explain that.  What is - what is 
your understanding of an accounting officer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  An accounting officer becomes an 
accounting officer in terms of the PFMA. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What responsibilities come with being an 
20 
accounting officer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As - as highlighted in the PFMA there 
are responsibilities given to the PFMA so that the accounting officer 
becomes accountable of all activities including the budget that happens 
in that department.  Reporting responsibilities and - and also 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 30 of 146 
 
operational 
activities, 
capacity 
building. 
 
So 
across 
those 
responsibilities must be - must be accounted for. 
Responsibilities can be delegated but it - their accountability 
remains the responsibility of the accounting officer. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So just to take an easy scenario.  When 
you then became HOD in 2013 when you became HOD of the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development you were the sole 
accounting officer.  You were the Head of Department.  You took 
responsibility for all matters relating to the operations of the 
department? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that your answer contained exactly what 
Ms Gcabashe was looking for in her question that preceded this last 
one.  My understanding of her question is that she wanted you to tell 
me, at least the important responsibilities of an Accounting Officer in a 
Government Department, do you want to do that, some of the important 
responsibilities or functions of an Accounting Officer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I can mention a few Chair, the 
budgeting responsibility, the expenditure of the budget, the reporting 
responsibility in terms of those budgets and expenditures that you 
20 
have, it becomes the responsibility of the Accounting Officer.  
Accounting to the legislature, accounting to Treasury and also 
accounting to the National Department of Agriculture and the 
Department of Rural Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But isn’t the position that, apart from accounting to 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 31 of 146 
 
somebody as an Accounting Officer, a very important responsibility that 
an Accounting Officer has in a Government Department whether it’s 
Provincial or National Department, is to make sure that funds allocated 
to the Government are used properly for the purposes for which they 
are set aside and to make sure that funds for the Department, only 
used in accordance with proper procedures, certain processes are 
followed and there is no wastage of funds and so on, isn’t that – aren’t 
those some of the important responsibilities.  I may not be tabulated m 
they way they are formulated in certain legislation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair, it’s part of 
10 
expenditure so they get covered, how do you spend the budget 
correctly and so on so as you deal with your expenditure part of the 
budget then it has got a range of activities that are covered under 
expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    In fact the way you put it Mr Thabethe 
paragraph 18 page 7 – paragraph 18 of your affidavit is that you had 
responsibilities – I’ll wait for you to get to that page. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes I’m there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do you say paragraph…[intervention]. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Page 7 paragraph 18 Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you may proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You outline your responsibilities as Head 
of Department as including – and I’m just jumping a couple of lines to 
the fourth line, 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 32 of 146 
 
 
“Ensuring effective service delivery within the legal mandates 
 
of the Department and the Free State Provincial Government”. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Those are your words, so your 
understanding is, the manner in which you discharged your duties had 
to be within the legal mandates of the Department and the Free State 
Provincial Government? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Of course one knows that the umbrella 
framework that informs those legal mandates – I go back to, it would be 
10 
the Constitution, the PFMA, Treasury Regulations, Instruction Notes, 
Practice Notes etcetera, etcetera. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That’s correct Chair.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You’re reporting – when you reported did 
you report to the MEC, one, did you report to the Premier, two or did 
you report to Exco, that’s the Executive council? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or all of the above? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Or all of the above, and if you could just 
elaborate on how this worked when you were Head of Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   As Head of Department you report to 
20 
the MEC, the MEC is the member of the Executive Council.  Heads of 
Department attend the Executive Council on invitation, so we do not 
directly report to the Executive Council but we go there on invitation to 
make – to attend a meeting or to make a presentation but the reporting 
line is the Head of Department report to the MEC. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 33 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I have also understood, and please 
correct me if I’m wrong, that Heads of Department would also attend 
Legotlas which really are political forums but it’s an interface between 
what the Politicians would like to do in discharging their mandate 
because they are the majority party and what the administrators, people 
like you, have to do to implement that mandate, have I got it right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair we – Heads of 
Department do attend Legotla to understand the mandate and also to 
advise on technical issues. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    How many of those would you attend in a 
10 
year? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s – I’m trying to recollect. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    And estimate – I think the Chairman 
would be happy, just to get a sense of that interface, that really is all 
we’re trying to explore? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Like two or three Legotlas a year or only one more or 
less? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   We would actually attend more than 
one, you’d have a Government Legotla, you’ll have a local Government 
Legotla 
because 
as 
a 
Provincial 
Department, 
working 
with 
20 
Municipalities you’d want to know what are the issues.  Sometimes, you 
may – in the Province you may have more than one maybe two in 
another year – it depends on the issues on the table that they may deal 
with issues, if that agenda might not have been finished, then another 
Legotla could be called.  It depends on the specifics, that what could 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 34 of 146 
 
be required to be dealt with. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can you explain where at those forums 
you would then be given instructions in a particular way or whether you 
simply would be exchanging ideas with your political principals who 
also happen to be the principals in your department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   In the Legotla it’s mostly exchange 
of ideas, so that you understand what will be the key deliverables, what 
is going to go into the – or what comes from National for 
implementation.  If I can give an example when the National 
Development Plan was given the Provinces had to go into a Legotla and 
10 
say, which is our responsibility as the Free State, and what is the 
responsibility of what department to implement.  If there are 
deliverables how do we deal with those deliverables?  So there you 
exchange ideas and then Department – out of those ideas you then go 
and development action plans. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Please help me understand the 
difference between an action plan and a strategy that would emerge 
from a meeting of this nature? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   What then happens, from the Legotla 
each department will then develop a strategic plan.  Once the 
20 
Department has a strategic plan, it means that strategy will then tell 
how are you going to deal with the implementation of what is required 
by that particular Department.  Once the strategy has been 
implemented then the Department will then develop an action plan 
which will have timelines, targets, deliverables, who is responsible to 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 35 of 146 
 
do what and by which budget.  Then that goes to the action plan. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Now I will explore this again with you a 
little later in greater detail but just for my broad understanding, the 
strategic plans are catered for in the PFMA read with the Treasury 
Regulations, a I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So there’s really a legal responsibility 
that lies with Departments to prepare these strategic plans? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    And when you prepare a strategic plan, 
10 
you call it that, it is called a strategic plan, it’s not called something 
else? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I ask this, simply because I will be 
exploring with you the Mahomo-Mobung strategy and I would want you 
to place it in context because that strategy appears to have informed 
the establishment of the Vrede Dairy Project, but Chairman I see that 
it’s just after quarter past eleven, is this a convenient time to have a 
cup of tea? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let’s take the tea adjournment, we will resume at 
20 
half past eleven, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS:    
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 36 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chairman.  Just 
the last element of the discussion we were having about strategic 
plans.  Can you explain to me where the Mohuma Mobung Agricultural 
and Rural Development framework 2012 to 2016 would fit in to the 
discussion we were having just before tea?  Because we talking 
strategic plans, we talking the interface between yourselves and the 
MEC’s.  There is a particular framework document I want you just to 
help us understand where it would have fitted in? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  The – the Mahuma 
Mobung 
Agricultural 
Development 
strategy 
came 
from 
the 
10 
understanding that… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am sorry can I interrupt you please Mr 
Thabethe?  You do not have to switch if off you can keep it on – the 
microphone on yes.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I actually want you to address the 
framework because if I point you to page 381 of reference bundle no, 
so on to your left are reference bundles.  If you take reference bundle A 
– B my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Gcabashe you will cause confusion in the 
20 
transcripts.  Exhibit HH Court Records A or Court Records B. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is not the Court Record this time 
Chairman.  We are using the reference… 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 37 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh those are the only ones that I have got here. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No to your – behind you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other ones are at the back. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I believe Chairman they must be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Because they be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which one is it? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is B Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reference bundle?  HH reference bundle B. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Exactly HH reference bundle B Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that would be page 361. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  361? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes this time because the page is facing a 
different direction Chairman you will find it on your far left top, far left, 
the page number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But it has the title there it is in bold 
Agriculture and Rural Development Mohuma Mobung and then it has 
Agriculture and Rural Development framework.  I just want to 
20 
understand what this document is Mr Thabethe.  And if it is indeed what 
you were starting to describe you will simply say so.  So what is this 
framework document?  It was drafted as I read this please correct me 
again if I am wrong.  In June 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  This document was 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 38 of 146 
 
– was developed to provide a framework under which we will then 
operate in terms of dealing with specific issues of agricultural 
development.  Those specific issues were in respond to the National 
Development Plan to be able to say how do we then put a framework to 
be able to say how are we going to approach in terms of developing 
agriculture?  Then this framework was developed.  The problem which 
could bring a confusion is that there were exchange of words.  At some 
instance we would call it a framework.  At one instance we will call it a 
strategy but it meant the same document to be able to respond to 
identified issues in terms of developing agriculture.   
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact at other places you call it an 
initiative and then there are those who call it a concept.  So each time I 
have a witness from Government – from the Free State Government I 
try and get clarity on whether it was an initiative, whether it was a 
concept, whether it was a strategic plan or whether it was simply a 
framework document.  There is a lot of confusion certainly about what 
exactly the nature of this document was. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it all refers to the same 
document.  The contents or the document are the same.  The problem 
is that it has been given different names like framework, initiative, 
20 
strategy but it was all in response – the contents of the document talks 
to the same thing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact I – I probably should – you deal 
with it in your May 2018 affidavit but that is the affidavit that is not 
particularly clear.  Maybe I should pursue this particular line of 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 39 of 146 
 
questioning after lunch in case we are able to find better copies of that 
document Chairman because he has set it out in that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what he – what he – what he can be asked is 
what does he call it?  What do you call the document yourself?  What is 
the term that you believe is the most accurate one for this document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The most appropriate I will say Chair 
it is Mahuma Mobung Development Strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Though I must point out to you Mr 
Thabethe that at paragraph 33 of that May 2018 affidavit you refer to it 
10 
as both a strategy and a concept.  But to be fair on the Chairman and 
to enable him to actually read what is written here in paragraph 33 I – 
can I – having pointed that out to you I am hoping that by lunch time we 
have a better luck with a clearer copy of this document.  Can I go back 
to one or two issues that we were dealing with before we started 
discussing strategic plans and that was just in understanding rural 
development and agriculture? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you do that do we put this away or you 
still need it? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I – I think for a minute Chairman because 
20 
it might be unfair both on you and on him for me to refer him to the 
affidavit where he – he actually uses both – both terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I will go back to a 
slightly 
more 
general 
question 
around 
agriculture 
and 
rural 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 40 of 146 
 
development.  Can I give you context?  I am trying to understand 
whether a dairy farm falls within the Department of Agriculture or the 
Department of Rural Development?  I think the Chairman would be 
interested as well in establishing where a dairy farm and forget the 
Vrede Dairy Farm just the fact of a dairy farm would it fall within 
agriculture or would it fall within rural development? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It falls on both.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Agriculture Development specifically 
deals with issues of agriculture whilst Rural Development deals with 
10 
issues of development over and above Agriculture.  It means Rural 
Development can do development on agriculture.  It can co 
development on issues that are not related to agriculture.  Like you can 
develop a village as part of rural development.  So Rural Development 
would go to the Department of Health and say this particular rural area 
has a need of a clinic and assist in the development of a clinic.  So 
Rural Development is broader than agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is much more broader? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes but you can find a dairy on both. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With respect to the idea of a dairy farm 
20 
who developed that idea Rural Development or Agriculture?  Because it 
happened before the amalgamation of the two departments. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  The – the Rural 
Development as a new concept we had to develop how are we going to 
deal with Rural Development?  So initially we started with the develop – 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 41 of 146 
 
the Rural Development Strategy to be able to say how do we deal with 
Rural Development?  There were a number of issues that you look at 
hence in order to be able to deal with Rural Development we had to 
have a kind of a strategy, how are we going to deal with it in the Free 
State?   So it initially started as a Rural Development because it was a 
new mandate in the Province.  We were not very clear what is it that is 
expected.  And the funding part of it was also very difficult because as 
a new mandate it came without the – the budget.  We had then to 
develop a strategy, how do we deal with it?  Because we – we were 
required to implement and develop rural communities.  So we had to 
10 
find a way of how to deal with it.  Hence we had to develop a strategy 
and we called that strategy Mahuma Mobung.  Hence in the beginning 
when I was saying it is very difficult to separate agriculture and rural 
development because when you deal with Rural Development you 
mostly focus on Agriculture Development because those are the 
activities that are happening in most rural areas is agriculture.  But 
then you have to blend in other activities other than agriculture that 
you would want to happen in that rural area. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now you arrived at the Department of 
Rural Development in or about August 2011? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When you arrived in that department had 
the concept of  
1. Mahuma Mobung alternatively 
2. The – a dairy farm been initiated? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 42 of 146 
 
Did you find it there the proposal or the concept?  Either the one 
Mahuma Mobung or the other a dairy farm? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I am not sure whether to talk to 
the dairy in general or to the Vrede Dairy in specific because there 
were other concepts of dairy other than the Vrede Dairy which were 
being developed in the Province.concepts of dairy other than the Vrede 
Dairy which were being developed in the Province. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I – I actually want you to stay with the 
timeline Mr Thabethe.  The timeline is particularly important because I 
want us to move from 2011 to 2012 to 2013 to 2014 which is why I ask 
10 
the question, when you arrived – I will break it up.  When you arrived in 
August of 2011 had the concept of Mahuma Mobung been aired – been 
ventilated? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair you – maybe let me go back.  
It was just after when the Department of Rural Development was 
transferred from Public Works to Agriculture and when that happened 
then the post was advertised.  It means there was a Department of 
Rural Development transferred which required a HOD.  It was 
advertised during that time and then I was appointed.  When I came in 
there was no plan on the table that says, how do we deal with Rural 
20 
Development? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How long did it take you to conceptualise 
this plan which I assume is the Mahuma Mobung concept? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair the name was given by the MEC 
but the thinking behind the document came from the HOD. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 43 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now please there are many MEC’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is who? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I beg your pardon Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Gcabashe.  I think maybe we think of 
the same questions.  The MEC being Mr Zwane and the HOD being 
yourself? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would not have guessed Chairman.  
Thank you.  You have to be specific Mr Thabethe.  Because you know 
10 
the people who moved into your job and into the MEC’s job after you 
left. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And they were acting positions every now 
and again so it is important actually to be – to be specific.  So the 
concept of Mahuma Mobung would have come from you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When did you develop that concept in 
terms of timeframe?  Over what period?  You arrive in August.  When 
did you first start talking about this Mahuma Mobung? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I would not be able to give 
exact timelines because it has been about seven years now since that 
has happened.  But when I came into the Department there was no 
clear plan.  What we had is what was developed at National level.  Was 
a document that was developed at National which was called a 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 44 of 146 
 
Comprehensive Development Plan which was talking to what are these 
issues that we need to look at when we deal with issues of Rural 
Development?  But we have to put it into action like development of 
agricultural parks, like development of agri villages and so forth and so 
on.  So we had as a Province to come with how in the Free State we 
were going to deal with that.  There was also programmes of war on 
poverty that we had to bring on board to say how do we fight poverty in 
the rural areas?  So we had a – the dairy was but one of those 
activities that Rural Development had to develop.  Because we were 
also tasked with the responsibilities of developing small towns.  Rural 
10 
Development had also to assist small towns because they were not very 
viable.  There were no activities that were happening.  So we also 
looked at a number of small towns and in each particular town there 
was an activity that we had developed which – which was fitting to the 
environment of that particular area.  Hence then we had to look at that.  
Now if you look at a dairy as rural development you do not look at it in 
isolation without agriculture.  If you look at developing an agri-village 
as Rural Development you do not look at it in isolation without human 
settlement.  Now you bring different departments because we are 
dealing of issues of rural development and they assist you in that 
20 
particular area that we have identified as a need either in the village or 
on the farm or in a small town.  So those are the things that will then 
dictate how do we deal with that.  But we needed to have a framework 
of how do we deal with that?   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now when you arrived in August of 2011 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 45 of 146 
 
you have told us when you got to the – to Bloemfontein you have told 
us that you really started putting the Department of Rural Development 
together, have I understood you correctly? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What budget had been allocated to Rural 
Development under Vote 11 which was the Vote that the MEC at the 
time Mr Zwane was responsible for? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I would not have the exact 
figures here in front of me now but it was a very small budget and that 
budget was transferred from Public Works to Agriculture which then 
10 
became Agriculture and Rural Development.  It was a very small 
budget.  It mainly looked at the – the administration part of the 
Department.  Your salaries, your operations.  There was very limited 
money to be able to do implementation.  The very little that we had 
been allocated was used to develop in rural areas I think we started 
with the development of community halls because there were no places 
for communities to hold their meetings when they want to come 
together.  So we had built in a number of villages halls for communities 
to be able to – so it was a very minimal budget to be able to implement.  
So you had to piggy back to a number of other departments to be able 
20 
to implement rural development. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Agriculture obviously then had the lion’s 
share of the Vote 11? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Budget? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 46 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When Mr Roy Jankielsohn appeared 
before the commission he mentioned that in or about November 2011 if 
I correctly recollect this Mr Mosebenzi Zwane mentioned this concept of 
Mohuma Mobung to him.  So I go back to asking you would that concept 
have taken root by about November 2011? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That will be correct Chair.  We – we 
were at that particular time doing consultations with a number of 
stakeholders into the concept so that we get understanding whether we 
going the correct route or not.  So a number of stakeholders in 
10 
government and in the private sector which also included the 
legislature.  We just went there and we consulted, we presented to 
them and we were sharing knowledge with them.  They made inputs into 
the document.  So at that particular time we were busy doing 
consultation and getting additional information and comments from 
other people.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Were the consultations aimed at getting ideas from 
stakeholders and the community so that when you then put together a 
document that would guide the Department that would be based on the 
ideas that you got from stakeholders and the community and so on?  
20 
Was that the – the aid or was the position that you were coming to the 
stakeholders and the community with a certain idea and hearing what 
they have to say? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it is correct because the first 
thing to do was to draft – I believe that is why we have a lot of names 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 47 of 146 
 
for these documents.  Somebody had to develop an initiative and say 
this thing this is how we want to do it.  So there was a document on the 
table and then we then had to consult on this document to get other 
people’s input into that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  I am interested in the team you 
gathered around you to drive this strategy.  Who did you have on that 
team? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair by the time I came there were 
people – the Department had not yet developed fully but the people that 
10 
were there were people that came with the function from Public Works.  
At the time when I came there was a Chief Director that was transferred 
with the function from Public Works to Agriculture and there were a few 
of other people that came with the function.  That was the few people 
that I had worked with but in terms of the thinking tank because they 
had also to run around and proceed with some of the work that was 
started when the function was with Public Works.  So there were a 
number of projects that were ongoing at that particular time.  So it was 
at that time still a very small department with very few people.  So we 
had to – I had an opportunity when I arrived to be able to sit down and 
20 
conceptualise and get an understanding of what is this Rural 
Development, put a document on the table, do consultation with the 
document so that you begin to – to be able to – to do something on the 
mandate that was given of Rural Development. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you find Doctor Masiteng in office in 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 48 of 146 
 
Rural Development when you joined the Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where was he located? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  He was in Agriculture. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you find Me Sibahle Dlamini the CFO 
who ultimately served under you either at Rural Development or at 
Agriculture when you arrived in August of 2011? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The CFO was CFO of both Agriculture 
and Rural Development but originally she was the CFO of Agriculture. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the answer is you found her there 
10 
when you arrived? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I found her there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ms Dlamini. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    Dlamini yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But she reported to you even as you 
arrived? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  She reported to both of us.  The HOD 
Agriculture and the HOD Rural Development.  Chair those were the 
difficulties that we picked up because we were two HOD’s but we had 
the service of one CFO. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I very briefly then ask you about your 
understanding of what informed the Supply Chain Management Policy 
document that you approved?  So I am going to ask you Mr Thabethe to 
go to page 332 of Reference Bundle HH – Reference Bundle A.  So it is 
HH Reference Bundle A for Apple. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 49 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now you signed off on this document Mr… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is the document again? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is page 325 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And at page 359 is the signature of the 
Accounting Officer who approved this SEM Policy document for the 
Department of Agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Gcabashe have you moved away from the 
document with different names? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes we have Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because I think we will explore that after 
lunch.  Mr Thabethe’s legal team are working very hard at endeavouring 
to get us a clear copy of the May 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Affidavit.  So I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I meant – I am talking about the strategy, the 
framework? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes I am going to go back to that later 
20 
Chairman because I do need that May 2018 affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To explore – he has explained it in detail 
in that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 50 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I think it is fair to him to then take him 
to what he has already explained in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes thank you Chairman.  So this is the 
Supply Chain Management Policy of the Department of Agriculture? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Let us just start there and this is on page 
3-2-5.  Department of Agriculture - were you Head of Department of the 
Department of Agriculture in April 2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you explain how you moved, when 
you moved from Rural Development? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I may not remember exactly the 
date but what happened was that at the completion of the financial 
year.  The two of us were swapped. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain two of us Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The HOD for Agriculture and the HOD 
for Rural Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mention the names as well. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which was … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were one. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
I 
was 
Department 
of 
Rural 
Development and Dr Morose (?) was the HOD for Agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said at the end of the financial year.  Is that 
the 2011/2012 financial year that you are talking about? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 51 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it was the 2011/2012 - that is 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Basically at the end of February … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  At the end of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or March? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of - of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of March. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So by - by March the two of us then 
were - were swapped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That I become HOD Agriculture.  She 
becomes HOD Rural Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So in April - so at the end of the financial 
year 31 March you then moved from Rural Development.  On 1 April you 
then had started serving in agriculture? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In agriculture and as accounting 
officer. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  So if you go to page 3-5-9 of the 
document that you are looking at your signature appears there.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you have signed off on this document 
on 1 April 2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 52 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When did you get time to read all the 
provisions in this document and develop it etcetera? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair the - this - the Supply 
Chain Management Policy has a requirement that before the beginning 
of the financial year a department requires to have a Supply Chain 
Management Policy because you are going to be spending money and 
you need to have an understanding on what policy are you going to be 
guided. 
I - I have been exposed to Supply Chain Management even 
before.  So Supply Chain Management Policy which I had an 
10 
understanding before when I was Rural Development.  Remember when 
- when this policy was being developed it was being developed for both 
Agriculture and Rural Development.  So I had had exposure.  So there 
was no problem in coming in and signing the policy because it was 
developed for both of us.  So hence I was able to sign it on 1 April. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now when you signed it on 1 April did you 
understand the import of this policy document - the importance of this 
policy document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I did Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I take you Mr Thabethe to pages 3-3-
20 
5 to 3-3-6 of that document?  If you look at Clause 3.3.  I - I am 
assuming you are familiar with the rest of the document preceding this.  
I really want to focus on procurement above the transaction value of 
R500 000,00 VAT included. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is- that is correct. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 53 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please read into the record what this 
document requires of those who subscribe to it because they must and 
therefore comply with it - 3.3.1. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  3.3.1 says: 
“Competitive 
bids 
should 
be 
invited 
for 
all 
procurement above 500 000.” 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now you would agree that that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you say we should go to 
page 3-3-5? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is page 3-3-5 Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then the paragraph is the very - right 
at the bottom … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 3.3.1? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  3.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He is reading 3.3.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now you would agree with me that that 
particular clause is consistent with Section 2-1-7 of the Constitution? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because that section of the Constitution 
talks of equitableness, of fairness, of competitiveness.  It wants 
transparency.  So where you have competitive bids for anything that is 
valued about R500 000,00 those - that process of inviting competitive 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 54 of 146 
 
bids would comply with Section 2-1-7. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it would accept in certain 
circumstances. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - we will get to that sir.  We will get into 
the exception.  One step at a time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja but let him answer the way he answer - he 
wants to answer.  He … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what is the answer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair it will be - it will be 
10 
applicable except in certain circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and then in - in due course you may 
deal with the - the exceptions. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of course this process is supported by not 
just the PFMA but Treasury Regulations, instruction notes, practice 
notes.  You are happy with that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you accept do you not that 3.3.1 as it stands 
alone and maybe when you read it with something else it might be a 
different meeting - meaning.  It might have a different meaning.  It 
might be qualified but as it stands says: 
“Competitive 
bids 
should 
be 
invited 
for 
all 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 55 of 146 
 
procurement above 500 000.” 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That on the face of it, it does not allow exceptions? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Exceptions, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If we go over the page to 3.4 please read 
that clause into the record. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Urgent and emergency cases which 
his 3.4. 
“This is a case where early delivery is of critical 
10 
importance to avoid a dangerous or a risky situation 
and the inviting of competitive bids will delay 
immediate service rendering.  Lack of proper 
planning must not be seen as an urgent case.  
Reasons for such a request must be properly 
motivated, approved by the accounting officer or his 
or 
her 
delegate 
as 
per 
the 
Supply 
Chain 
Management delegated powers.” 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What do you understand by that clause?  
Just in your own words. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it is actually saying Chair urgent 
and emergency cases may deviate from the - the one that we have just 
read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that sentence - that answer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The answer is my understanding is 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 56 of 146 
 
that when there is an urgent or an emergency case you may be required 
to approve a deviation from following the competitive bids that has 
been indicated. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Now I want to explore this concept 
with you at this point.  It speaks of the accounting officer or his or her 
delegate approving a properly motivated request.  Yes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I - I am deliberately staying with 
urgent and emergency cases.  Where the accounting officer himself or 
herself initiates a request under the urgent and emergency cases is it 
10 
correct for that person to be a player and a referee?  That is to initiate 
and to approve because they have decided this is an emergency.  I - I 
am using this as a very theoretical example. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair if - if you may repeat the 
question. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where - I am using this particular example 
- there is an emergency in an area.  Is it appropriate for the accounting 
officer to be the person who both initiates this deviation under urgent 
and emergency cases and having initiated it approves it because he or 
she happens to be the accounting officer? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Let - let me explain it differently 
maybe and put an example. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No problem. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Let - let me use a situation where 
there is an outbreak in agriculture.  Maybe avian flu as an example.  
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 57 of 146 
 
The - the accounting officer comes and says we have a problem.  We 
need to go and acquire vaccines.  You then go to the report that has 
been provided to you.  You do consultations at the - at what extent and 
how difficult and what damage can - can be caused. 
Then you are able to come back to the department and say 
we will - we will have to deal with the situation urgently.  We need to 
prepare a deviation from the normal procurement process so that we 
can address the situation.  So at - at - as - as an HOD you need to be 
very clear in your mind how are you going to deal with it so that you 
can deal with the situation given. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would have thought Mr Thabethe that 
because you are not the only employee or public functionary in that 
department that the people who support the HOD would be the ones 
who initiate who come to the HOD with that report you refer to.  So they 
work out in the field there has been a flood.  There is avian flu.  They 
would pick it up not the HOD. 
They would then prepare the correct documentation and say 
to the HOD in my area that I supervise there is this problem.  Could you 
please release funds or help one way or the other and you would then 
look at this as now the HOD and accounting officer and say it is an 
20 
emergency.  That flooding - that avian flu must be dealt with and you 
then approve. 
So all I am saying is I would not expect the HOD to be the 
one who is out in Thabo Mofutsanyana wherever else to then be the 
same person who both initiates - that is why I am saying is a player and 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 58 of 146 
 
signs off - referee - on a particular proposal. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You are correct Chair.  It is one of the 
options.  When - when you have a situation one option is you would go 
to a meeting all of you and say we have this challenge and then in 
dealing with the challenge as a meeting you will agree how to approach 
it and then when it comes to the development of the document that 
ends with the HOD to approve it is something that you have discussed 
and agreed in the meeting. 
All that happens is that the required official will then go and 
develop the document that has been discussed.  It is not the document 
10 
that will still sit and say what is this, what informs it because you have 
been part of the meeting.  You have agreed on how to deal with it.  By 
the time it comes to you, you read it and you understand what the 
documents talk about.  Then you improve it - approve it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see my difficulty with that proposition 
with the explanation you are giving us is that it opens that door that 
leads to the abuse of a modality of a provision that is intended to be 
used in compliance with the Constitution Section 2-1-7.  Would you 
agree with me? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair in - in all normal circumstances 
20 
the HOD will not do that.  He will allow the process to flow normally.  It 
is only when there is an exception where he will then need to 
understand and in - in most instances those are - those issues are 
being discussed in meetings.  It will not be for the first time that the 
Head of Department will see a document coming in and read it and it 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 59 of 146 
 
would have been discussed in the department.  So he will have an idea. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think the only issue I take with you on 
this Mr Thabethe is that my proposition presupposes that somebody 
else - the idea to use the urgent and emergency cases provision comes 
from a junior field officer or somebody else and it is brought to you for 
your consideration, for you to apply your mind to it and then either to 
approve or to disapprove that expenditure. 
What you are describing is a situation where you as the Head 
of Department are sitting with me and a couple of other public 
functionaries who report to you and we are discussing whether or not in 
10 
my hometown relief should be given under this particular Head because 
the pressure - you are the boss. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You cannot run away from that.  You are 
sitting with the boss.  He has strong views and this is why I say it then 
opens that door to a manipulation of the system if the boss himself is 
part of the initiation of a particular deviation.  Would you agree with 
me? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I would - I would not - not 
always. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand why you would not. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I would not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I think I understand why you would not because I 
think that as a Head of Department you may be required not just to be 
sitting in - in the office.  You may be required to be out there where 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 60 of 146 
 
things are happening sometimes especially if you think about floods. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know and when people are talking Ms Gcabashe 
about what do you do about these floods the HOD is not going to say 
hey let me get out of this meeting because I will be required to 
approve.  Talk alone and come back to me later you know.  So that - 
that is one of the things that is coming to my mind as you ask the 
question you know but you were going to give your own explanation 
why you do not agree.MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, ja.  Chair 
let - let me give another scenario.  There - there are instances where 
10 
the Head of Department has to take a decision on site.  Now I have 
done that on a number of occasions in terms of veld fires.  You require 
a chopper to assist with the extinguishing of the fire.  You do not have 
a submission - you do not have to wait for a submission because the 
fire is not going to wait for you to approve a submission to deviate. 
All you do you take your phone.  You phone the owner of the 
chopper.  You ask the person to fly the chopper and extinguish the fire.  
When you get to the office you require the officials to do the 
submission and give it to you for approval because you have acted 
instantly.  Those are some of the requirements that you are to do. 
20 
So you will not always require somebody to develop a 
submission to approve before the action happened.  There are those 
activities that you have to instruct.  They happen and you deal with the 
- with the action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Gcabashe you - you will take this - you will 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 61 of 146 
 
take the answer further if you want to and probably would like to but 
even that situation Mr Thabethe I do not see why if you are the one as 
HOD who was on the scene who made the judgment call there and then 
because if you were going to follow certain processes and wait for 
people to make submissions to you. 
By the time that process was finished somebody house would 
be destroyed.  If you made the judgment call there and then and it was 
the right judgment call I do not understand why when you come to the 
office you must say somebody else now must make a submission and 
pretend as if there is a submission that was made to you when there 
10 
was no submission. 
It seems to me it ought to be enough that in that situation you 
make a report that says this is what happened and in the circumstances 
it was justified to make this decision.  This is the decision that I made 
and you are right - you are either right or wrong but that is it.  I also 
would not understand the idea of going to the office and say somebody 
must now make a submission because you - you made the decision 
there and then. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I agree with you Chair but there is 
still a paper trail that will be required.  They normally call that ex post 
20 
facto.  You approved after the action but there is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now if for example the officials from whom you 
would normally receive the submissions were not there but you were 
there and you made the decisions.  Who are you going to receive the 
submissions from because otherwise will they be truthful if they talk 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 62 of 146 
 
about something that they know - they do not know anything about? 
I would have expected that they must - you must be able to 
simply record what happened.  This is what happened.  This is the 
decision I made and the framework must be such that it permits in 
certain circumstances - urgent circumstances for decisions to be made 
like that.  Otherwise if you are going to follow certain procedures in 
those circumstances by the time you - you are through with - you - you 
are completely - you have completed the processes many houses have 
- have been destroyed by fire. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I agree Chair.  The - the - that has 
10 
happened before where you - you had taken a decision.  You come back 
to the office.  The required official refuses and you have to leave with 
an unauthorised expenditure because the process determines that there 
has to be an approval.  Sometimes the - the reasoning becomes a 
problem. 
They need a document on the table where you have approved 
because you have spent money and there has to be a document.  If 
there is not such a document the classification becomes unauthorised 
expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean if you are sitting in your office as Head of 
20 
Department and somebody comes into your office running and says 
there is fire in the building I mean are you going to say let us have 
people bring in submissions before you bring somebody who is going to 
- to extinguish the fire.  Maybe the fire needs something more than just 
a hosepipe or will you just phone somebody and say please get the fire 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 63 of 146 
 
engine to come here.  Let those red - red trucks … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I agree with you Chair.  What I am 
trying to highlight is some of the difficulties that we have in following 
the procurement processes.  We - we have had a number of 
engagements with National Treasury giving them some practical 
examples on the ground that at times give us challenges in dealing with 
them. 
Some - some of the irregularities that are there at the face 
value you may think something has not been properly done but if you 
go to the details of what actually happened because if you look in 
10 
general this department had so much irregular expenditure but if you 
were to dig into the details of each one what informs these 
irregularities. 
You realise that some of these are valid but you cannot 
substantiate it because you did not have the required document.  That - 
that is the difficulty we - you would normally have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe you - you must - may still be having 
some questions to - because it is an - it is an important part … 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of - of this.  So you need to satisfy yourself that you 
have dealt with it properly. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Indeed.  Thank you Chairman.  You see 
Mr Thabethe the way - the example that the Chairman uses is an 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 64 of 146 
 
excellent example of a Head of Department being transparent, taken 
accountability and being open about where the idea to deal with the 
problem that has emerged came from. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
It 
is 
an 
excellent 
example 
of 
accountability and that is what an HOD is.  He is an accounting officer.  
He has got to take accountability.  So he cannot ask a junior officer to 
write up the paperwork when he knows that he is the one who actually 
recognised there is a problem, went out and said we - we have got 
provision 3.4 in the SCM. 
10 
We are going to use this urgent and emergency cases.  Would 
you not agree with that proposition? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair if - if I were to agree with her it 
would mean that it will then become an obvious case where you - it may 
even open up a number of cases where the HOD may just decide what 
should happen. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But you see that is exactly what the HOD 
does in the circumstances you described.  The difference is the HOD is 
putting form over substance.  The HOD is making it look as if the 
initiator is somebody else.  Whereas substantively in essence it is 
20 
actually the HOD’s idea that this particular thing should go this 
particular way. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair the - it - it all depends 
where the budget that you want to spend is located.  That - because - 
because in the HOD’s office there is no budget to - to do those things.  
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 65 of 146 
 
So you - you have to have somebody who has a direct responsibility of 
that budget to agree and make a submission that indeed I agree that 
this money should be spent for this particular purpose. 
So that person - because the person sits - he become the - 
the person who should be able to account on that particular budget and 
when you have to decide you have to talk to the person who has that 
responsibility.  In other instances the person may say no not my 
budget.  It cannot be used for that particular purpose.  So if the person 
agrees says okay I agree this has happened or this can - can be done 
using the budget that is sitting with me. 
10 
I am hereby making a submission to you to agree that this 
money should be used for that particular purpose because the budget is 
not sitting with the HOD. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You, with respect Mr Thabethe, I know 
you are a very senior member of government, the point you are missing 
is that at the end of the day the HOD as the accounting officer, you 
described that to us earlier on, is the person who can determine the 
budget for particular units, the same person who can select the unit 
that he or she thinks this money must come from.  I think you under-
estimate the influence of HOD’s. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe Ms Gcabashe could add that the person 
who within the department who  has a budget from which the HOD 
thinks funds for a certain matter should come, would I would imagine 
not be able to overrule the HOD.  That’s my addition. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Do you want to respond to the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 66 of 146 
 
Chairman’s addition? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair if – the, the, the – I want to 
use the correct word, the PFMA legislations does not cater for an 
instance where the  HOD can decide and approve, it says the HOD 
must approve, the HOD must approve, it is different from when the HOD 
comes and say I am writing to Treasury, I am shifting this budget from 
this function to another function, even that the HOD must still write to 
Treasury, to say I am shifting so much money from you to you, so that it 
can also be done on the – so even the shifting somebody must approve, 
somebody above the HOD must still approve so there must still be a 
10 
paper trail, so there isn’t an instance where money can be moved or 
spent without paperwork. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well continue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chairman I think we should actually 
move to the nub of the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Which is Clause 3.5.  I really was just 
trying to have a neutral discussion about what’s transparency, what is 
expected when you are being transparent and accountable, but let’s 
look at 3.5, please read those provisions into the record, because 
20 
those are the provisions that relate directly to the matters around the 
Vrede Dairy Farm.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair can I mention something 
before I move to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 67 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   In an instance where the budget is 
gazetted differently because I want to come to this particular situation, 
when a budget is gazetted for an example for salaries and wages, you 
don’t follow any of these processes to spend the money, you pay the 
salaries, you don’t do quotations, you don’t do deviations, because a 
gazette allows you to spend the money differently.  Why I am using this 
in the case of the Vrede Dairy the budget in the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  May, I’m sorry Mr Thabethe, when you say the gazette 
allows you to spend the money differently, that might sound – that 
might give an interpretation which I don’t think you intend, I don’t think 
10 
you mean that the gazette allows you to spend money set aside for 
salaries and wages for something else. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but when you say differently that’s what I think it 
mean. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, I don’t mean that, I mean 
differently from the bid specifications as given in the PFMA. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Oh Mr Thabethe bid specifications for 
salaries? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair can I explain? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   What I am trying to say is that if you 
read this in general you may also ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The policy? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 68 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The policy.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   You may think that the money that 
has been allocated has got to go through this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All money. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   All money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including salaries and wages? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Including salaries and wages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s what I am trying to say and 
10 
then what I am saying is that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are saying that doesn’t apply to salaries and 
wages? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   And wages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Hence I want also then to bring the 
money that has been gazetted under transfers maybe I must give a 
history on the transfer.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chairman that’s a huge topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    On its own and a very important one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think try and answer the question that Ms Gcabashe 
has put and if you need to in your answer accommodate a certain 
context do that but it helps if the answers are brief and to the point, but 
when I say that I don’t want you to feel that you are being stifled in 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 69 of 146 
 
answering but if you – if they are too long and general sometimes it 
might prolong the proceedings unduly, so maybe let her repeat the 
question, see if you are able to answer it without going too much into 
other issues which she may be planning to deal with in due course, but 
if you feel that the answer you give doesn’t adequately convey what 
you want without you want to convey without you mentioning something 
– let’s try and see that, okay, so I think Ms Gcabashe will repeat the 
question, you see if you are able to answer it briefly but as I say if you 
feel that answering it in a certain way restricts you let’s see how we 
can handle that.   
10 
 
So one we don’t want to restrict you unduly but at the same 
time I don’t want to have a situation where one simple question ends up 
with too  long an answer, you understand? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, we will give it a try and see how it goes.  
Ms Gcabashe do you want to repeat your question so ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I rephrase it Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   What I am exploring with you Mr 
Thabethe is Clause 3.5, I had asked that you read that into the record, 
20 
because I had moved away from the urgent and emergency cases in 
scenario.  You then asked to give a different example and you 
articulated the position with salaries etcetera, but can I explore just 
that little element with you, you see the reason I started with Section 
217 of the Constitution as we started this morning is because 217 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 70 of 146 
 
informs all the other procurement legislation that governs what HOD’s 
do, and policy documents such as this, so 217 speaks of contracts for 
goods and services and when it speaks of contracts for goods and 
services I don’t believe that it has my salary as a Chief Director in 
mind, there is a process for dealing with my salary, merit awards 
etcetera, as a Chief Director.  It really is talking about the type of 
contract you entered into with Estina would you agree? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair that is exactly the reason if 
I was to read this in general I wouldn’t have a problem, but if I had to 
read this in relation to Vrede Dairy that is why I have a problem 
10 
because I have a different interpretation to the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, if the question requires you to give your 
understanding of what this clause means you’re dealing with it in 
general, if the question links that, this clause to Vrede Farm then you 
answer it in the context of Vrede Farm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Before we get to Vrede Farm please just 
read the provision into the record. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay thank you Chair.   The item 3.5 
20 
deviation from bid procedures the Accounting Officer may disperse with 
the prescribed processes and authorise the acquisition of any goods 
and services through any convenient process.  3.5.1, if in a specific 
case it is impractical to invite competitive bids, eg in urgent or 
emergency cases or in case of a sole supplier the goods or the services 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 71 of 146 
 
may be procured in accordance with Treasury regulations 16A, 6.4.  
The reasons for deviating from inviting competitive bids should be 
recorded and approved by the Accounting Officer.  3.5.2, in the case of 
a sole supplier an original affidavit from the company stating that it is a 
sole supplier of the goods/services offered must be provided with the 
offer .  In exceptional cases such as repairs and maintenance of 
equipment, plumbing services, school uniform, medical services and 
medicines, school activities, burial services and gasoline for equipment 
where it is impractical to follow the prescribed procedure one quotation 
is required. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Now I come back to the fact that your 
signature was appended to this policy document. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You would not have signed this document 
had you not clearly understood the deviation processes that are 
permitted, in terms of your own document. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You would also have been aware of the 
content of Treasury Regulation 16A 6.4 which permits deviations, am I 
correct? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You would also have been aware of any 
practice note or instruction note that would have been issued by 
National Treasury explaining how deviations should be treated. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 72 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Let’s go to one of those instructions 
because it really is there to assist HOD’s apply the law and certainly 
the policies they draw or develop that must comply with the law.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   If I may check here because we are 
going to move now to the practice notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   We are talking about this in general. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the questions will indicate if it is general or 
10 
not general, so when it is specific you will know because the question 
will indicate it is specific.  I think you may have a particular part that 
you want to be alert when it comes to it, so – but she will get there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Thanks Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   I am on the general, you know it is 
always easier to work from a general to a specific proposition because 
the general applies across the board, and we will get to your exception, 
I am not going to avoid it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay good Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And we will debate that, and the 
20 
Chairman will intervene I am sure as we debate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe before you proceed Ms Gcabashe Mr 
Thabethe you signed this policy, I find it interesting that it says in the 
case, that is 3.5.2 in the case of a sole supplier an original affidavit 
from the company stating that it is a sole supplier of the goods or 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 73 of 146 
 
services offered must be provided with the offer.  I mean why do you 
want the person who wants to be contracted to be the one who must 
say don’t worry about others, I am a sole supplier.  Shouldn’t you – 
should it not say you must establish that that is the sole supplier, but 
you as the HOD must have your own way of verifying that that supplier 
is a sole supplier, why do you have to say – they are looking for work 
from you but you say they must be the ones who tell you we are the 
sole supplier. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair the reason why that – the 
person you are still required to do an investigation, but the person must 
10 
confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the policy does not talk about you doing your own 
homework, it says you must have an affidavit from the supplier saying I 
am the sole supplier, so in other words if you have got that affidavit it 
is like you have done your job, you don’t have to check elsewhere 
whether that’s true. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair if I may respond to that 
honestly, it comes directly from the PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that may be true, because well you may or may 
not have watched, I have had people, witnesses come here particularly 
20 
in regard to Transnet dealing with various issues of supply chain 
management and referring to the PFMA, but there are certain things 
that I do not understand you know, and I think this one about the sole 
supplier is also one of them, I think I had quite some discussion with 
the Acting CEO of Transnet, Mr Mahommedy I think if I am not 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 74 of 146 
 
mistaken, because I mean I was saying to him what is wrong if you as 
an Organ of State issue a public notice to say we need, this is what we 
need, because if indeed there is only one supplier for the goods you 
are looking for, that is the only supplier who will respond and then you 
will know it is only one supplier, then where you say let me not issue a 
public notice because I think there is only one sole supplier and you 
can ...[indistinct] but that’s – I am just indicating some of the debates I 
was having with them and it may be that it is just something in the 
PFMA and not in a particular policy and as you say maybe you got this 
from the – from some of the instruments but it just seems strange to me 
10 
you know because if I think I know him he is an ingénue in this room 
and I think he is the only ingénue I say okay I don’t give anybody, I 
don’t give notice to the public.  I say okay you do the job, somebody 
else could come later and say I am also an ingénue and I was sitting in 
the room when you appointed this one, but if I had issued a public 
notice everyone who is an ingénue would have said I am interested, but 
anyway, you may or may not have something to say, I’m just indicating 
to you that some of the things might be in the PFMA but I have certain 
issues I don’t understand well, but maybe it is because I don’t deal with 
PFMA matters as much as some of you have dealt with as senior 
20 
government officials. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, thank you Chair, my 
understanding has been that we differentiate between a supplier and a 
distributor, because you may have one supplier and a number of 
distributors, if I may be allowed to use an example, when we had to buy 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 75 of 146 
 
vaccines for animals the Onderstepoort Biological Institute becomes the 
only supplier in the country of those vaccines, but you have a number 
of distributors in different towns, then their understanding is that if you 
talk of a supplier if you want to buy  directly from Onderstepoort then 
you ask Onderstepoort to say are you the only one who is the supplier 
of this, but you will find that in every town there is a vet clinic that sells 
that but they are the distributors, not the suppliers, so my 
understanding has always been that of a supplier and a distributor 
there should be a difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but depending on what you want I mean I don’t 
10 
know the details, but maybe it might be convenient or cost effective to 
get a particular thing from somebody else rather than the original 
supplier, I don’t know, maybe for emergency rather than go to a 
supplier who is 600 kilometres away and there’s a distributor who is 
100 kilometres away and the cost and so on, I don’t know, but obviously 
if you are sure of your facts that this is a sole supplier you might be 
fine but the problem is what if you have got your facts wrong and you 
didn’t give a public notice and if you had given a public notice 
somebody else would have said I am also a supplier, he is not the only 
one, she is not the only one, but let’s move on to something, these are 
20 
debates that may be interesting maybe for other purposes and maybe 
academic if the prescript say so, if it’s the sole supplier that’s what you 
do, and if you do that you have complied, that’s it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   I actually Mr Thabethe want to point you 
to practice note number 6 of 2007/2008 you will find it at flag number 8, 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 76 of 146 
 
in the legislation bundle and the one that’s (A), legislation bundle (A).  
Legislation bundle (A), flag number 8,the title of this particular practice 
note, it is practice note 6 of 2007/2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry you said what’s the divider? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s flag number, divider number 8 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   Yes? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And I deliberately choose this one 
because the year it came into effect would have been 2007, it says so 
on the last page, these are not numbered Chairman, simply because we 
10 
keep adding to them as we lead evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Now what this practice note 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that the – oh I see you did not give them page 
numbers for that reason? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   For that reason Chairman because we 
keep adding in a chronological order, but if it is going to be more 
convenient for you Chairman for us to number them you now then they 
have to go from one to ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well depending – what you could do because when 
for purposes of the transcript it is convenient if one can say what page 
one is going to, what page number.  It may be that there’s a certain way 
of pagination that can be used that would not – that would still address, 
take care of your concern, I’m not sure. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 77 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   We thought this would Chairman because 
if you look at one of the others I will be pointing at it’s actually at 
divider number 10, so we’ve added to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So we’ve got a 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, per 
document though, not page numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But I think we will try and apply our 
minds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be fine, per document. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Per document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be fine for your purposes, I think one of 
these days I preferred something that was from beginning to end in 
terms of numbering, but if it’s easy to find by virtue of the divider then 
it’s okay, but anyway that’s fine, this is on the two page document. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It is a three page document Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, three page ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes, and again of course it deals with 
procurement of goods and services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is the only document under divider 8? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It is the only document under divider 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think that’s helpful ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes, and at paragraph 2.3 it of course 
reiterates that Treasury Regulation 16A, 6.4 provides for deviations.  At 
paragraph or clause 2.5 on the next page it asks accounting authorities 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 78 of 146 
 
or an accounting officer to ensure that the resources required to 
support the strategic and operational commitments of an institution are 
properly budgeted for and procured at the right time, so you must – we 
have now moved away from the emergency scenario, we are at just 
where this particular person by way of example or company, sole 
supplier the accounting authority must budget properly for this, that’s 
what 2.5 essentially says, I am paraphrasing.  2.6 also requires 
accounting officers or accounting authorities to put in place their own 
control measures.  These measures may include the arrangement of 
strategic or specific term contracts with suitable service providers with 
10 
the view to ensuring that the required goods and services are available 
immediately when cases of emergency occur.  2.7 deals again with 
Treasury Regulation 16A 6.4.  Most importantly Clause 3.1 under the 
heading “Reporting of Goods and Services Procured in terms of 
Treasury Regulation 16A 6.4 reads as follows: 
“With effect from the date on which this practice note takes 
effect accounting officers and accounting authorities are 
required to report within ten working days to the relevant 
Treasury and the Auditor General all cases where goods and 
services above the value of R1million VAT included were 
20 
procured in terms of Treasury Regulation 16A 6.4.” 
3.2 over the page reads as follows: 
“The report must include the description of the goods and 
services, the names of the suppliers, the amounts involved and 
the reasons for dispensing with the prescribed competitive 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 79 of 146 
 
bidding process.” 
This is in 2007 that this prescript was issued.  You were aware of it 
when you signed signed the SCM policy document in 2012, were not 
you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I – this practice note talks 
about procurements of goods and services, hence I wanted to come in 
earlier on because what we are talking about here talks to the 
procurement of goods and services, money that has been budgeted 
under goods and services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you may be jumping the gun.  The question 
10 
is whether when you signed the supply chain management policy  you 
were aware of this practice note, that’s the question. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes, I was Chair, maybe I am 
jumping the gun. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you are. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   To go to Vrede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must wait until that question is put to you, don’t 
answer it beforehand. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It is like building a house Mr Thabethe, 
brick by brick. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman I have a 2011 practice note but 
I can probably start with it after lunch, or just conclude with it whatever 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 80 of 146 
 
is convenient to the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well concluding with it would take how long? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   One minute Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let’s do that then. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The other one that you must have been 
aware of Mr Thabethe is at flag 10.2 so you will see on the side there 
are sticking out 10.1, 10.2, so it’s divider 10 and then the three little 
ones. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I’m just thinking now Ms Gcabashe that when 
10 
you said one minute you might not have meant it literally. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It’s the Setswana one minute Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) it might end up being much more than so 
maybe we should take the adjournment and then you can start on it 
when we come back.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   As the Chairman pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the lunch adjournment now and we will 
resume at two o’clock, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am Chairman but Mr Fourie would just 
like to address you for two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 81 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On the efforts he has made at trying to 
find a clearer document for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes thank you.  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any luck? 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Chair some good news.  We managed to obtain 
an unsigned affidavit.  My partner and myself we have gone through the 
affidavit briefly and I indicated to my learned colleague as well we are 
willing to provide the – everyone concerned with the relevant affidavit 
under the express condition I think you will agree if there are any 
10 
differences between the affidavit that he has indeed signed and the 
affidavit that we are providing that the affidavit that is signed persists 
that will then afford us and Mr Thabethe then this evening to go through 
both of the affidavits to make sure that they are in order and at that 
stage I think tomorrow morning we can quickly confirm that it is indeed 
the same affidavit and then we can confirm accordingly.  We also have 
managed to obtain annexures.  So we will make sure that at the very 
latest tomorrow lunch time that they will be available for everyone to 
assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excellent I think that is very good.  Thank you very 
20 
much for those efforts.  That condition is reasonable that until you have 
had a chance and Mr Thabethe has had a chance to compare the two 
affidavits, the signed one and the unsigned one to see that they are 
excellent the same until that happens if there is any inconsistency 
between the two the one that is signed will be taken to prevail and if 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 82 of 146 
 
you confirm tomorrow that they are exactly the same then – then that 
will be that. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Thank you Chair.  My pleasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – and also about the annexures I think that is 
very helpful because there were quite a lot of annexures that are not 
legible as well.  But – so tomorrow is still fine. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  And just on that point of the annexures Chair if 
there are certain other annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  That are referred to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  The door is still open we can provide them at 
any time if the – even if Mr Thabethe has finished his testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay excellent.  I think I can say certainly for myself 
any document that is shaded in the same way that the affidavit is 
shaded if you could – if you can get a clearer copy or that would be 
very helpful.  And there may be others which are not shaded in the 
same way but the whole page is really black or very dark.  So those two 
should be looked at and – and even after the hearing – even after he 
has finished his evidence if need be.  But anything that can be obtained 
20 
before that would be helpful so that one avoids if possible having to 
bring him back just because when he was giving evidence certain 
documents were not legible. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  I think in that regard we will be – we will be led 
by our colleagues. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 83 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Other than the documents that we have 
annexed to our affidavits Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you very much that is very helpful.  
Thank you. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe switch 
your microphone on please.  Thank you.  I had intended just before we 
broke for the lunch recess to bring your attention to practice note – no 
10 
it is an instruction note on enhancing compliance, monitoring and 
improving 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
Supply 
Chain 
Management.  This is the document that you have I believe it was at 
divider 10 and it is labelled 10.2.  And I will really just bring one 
paragraph to your attention for your comment and that will be 
paragraph 3.1.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 3.1.1? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  3.1.1 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Could you please read that into the record 
20 
3.1.1 and having done that explain to the Chairman what you 
understand of just that one clause? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   
“Submissions of procurement plans in respect of 
advertised competitive bids [demand management].  
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 84 of 146 
 
Accounting 
Officers 
of 
departments 
and 
its 
constitutional institutions must submit to the relevant 
Treasury by 30 April of each year.  A procurement 
plan containing all planned procurement for the 
financial year in respect of procurement of goods, 
works and or services which exceeds R500 000.  All 
applicable taxes included.  This procurement plan 
must be approved by the Accounting Officer or his or 
her delegate prior to its submission.  For the 
2011/2012 financial year the said plan must be 
10 
submitted to the relevant Treasury by not later than 
31 August 2011.” 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes now the date of this particular 
instruction note is the 31 May 2011.  Again would it be an instruction 
note that would have been brought to your attention? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether you were aware of this 
instruction note at the time when you started on 1 April 2012 as the 
HOD or Accounting Officer for the Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or soon thereafter – maybe it not be on that date but 
20 
in April? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not Chair.  Why I am saying so mostly 
the instruction notes becomes the documents that are in the custody of 
the Chief Financial Officer.  Mostly those that will be relevant then she 
then or he can advise but the understanding is that each Head of 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 85 of 146 
 
Department should be aware of all instruction notes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would have thought so too Mr Thabethe 
especially given your particular circumstances where you actually 
signed off on the SCM Policy document in April 2012.  So the 
expectation would be that you would really make sure you knew what 
you were signing  
1. Because you were a new broom in the department. 
2. Because you a senior civil servant really or public servant. 
Am I not right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You are correct Chair.  The 
10 
instructions notes when they arrive they get to the Head of Department.  
You go through them and you pass them through to the relevant official.  
You may not remember all of them at a glance.  As you have read it 
through and then passed it on. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But this one is particularly important 
because it speaks of a procurement plan and when anybody speaks of 
plans whether they are procurement plans or any other form of plan the 
HOD would always be involved in that or have I got it wrong? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is correct Chair.  It clearly indicates 
that it has to be approved by the Accounting Officer which means that 
20 
plan should have been seen by the Accounting Officer before it goes to 
Treasury. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Absolutely.  But I think that we are more 
or less agreed Mr Thabethe that at your level of operation in 
government you would have been familiar or you ought to have been 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 86 of 146 
 
familiar with all the prescripts relating to financial matters.  Certainly to 
procurement which is what we are about today.  We are in agreement 
on that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair I agree over and above that 
the – it is prescribes that the CFO should also be there to advice the 
HOD. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So I agree. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The CFO… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before you proceed further.  I just wanted 
10 
to say for what it is worth I note that 
1. This instruction note is addressed to all Accounting Officers of all 
National Departments and Constitutional Institutions that is 1. 
2. Accounting Authorities of all Schedule 3A and 3C Public Entities. 
3. Head officials of all Provincial Treasuries. 
It does not seem to be addressed to Accounting Officers of all 
Provincial Departments as well.  I just thought I must just highlight that 
I am sure what it may or may not mean that it seems to be addressed to 
those people.  It might not necessarily mean that a Head of Department 
in a Province would not be aware of it necessarily.  It is just the fact of 
20 
it being addressed to certain people that I am mentioning. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman substantively instruction notes 
form part of what becomes law because they are provided for in the 
PFMA.  So they really become law of general application.  It is just that 
it is a break as I have understood it they are breaking it down to be 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 87 of 146 
 
able to assist those who are applying those instruction notes or 
regulations.  So it is on that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know I understand… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So it is on that premise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand that but I am – I am just raising it simply 
because there was a question about whether he would have been aware 
of it or was aware of it and he did give an answer – the answer that he 
gave.  But at that stage I had not picked up that for some reason in – in 
indicating to whom it was addressed the National Treasury seems not to 
have included Heads of Provincial Departments.  That is [Chair not 
10 
speaking into microphone] saying what anyone makes of it is another 
matter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not know if you want me to read the 
provision in the PFMA that deals with these? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you do not need to. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To reassure you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a factual thing ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a factual matter of it is addressed to certain 
specific people that might not necessarily mean that there was no 
20 
obligation on those who were not mentioned to make themselves aware 
of it but I just wanted to make mention that I have just become aware 
that Head of Provisional Departments are not mentioned. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe I 
would have preferred to go and now deal specifically with Mahuma 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 88 of 146 
 
Mobung leading into Vrede but I think we will do that in the morning 
because you have explained it so well at one level in your 2018 
affidavit.  So can I park that particular – you know I have structured all 
my questions so I am going to park that aspect and ask you about 
Paras.  Now in your 10 August affidavit it is the one – the last affidavit 
in the bundle.  I will just take you to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember to identify which bundle you are talking 
about. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is Exhibit HH10 which contains your 
affidavits.  At paragraph 5 thereof – it is page 237 of what we call the 
10 
witness bundle.  237 it is literally towards the back – right to the back.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  As I understand 
what is written here it is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And on what page are you now? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am on page 237 Chairman.  237. 
CHAIRPERSON:  237.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you there Mr Thabethe? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As I understand what is written here 
certainly paragraph 5 going into paragraph 6 and 7 it is really part of 
the justification for going to seek Paras as a partner, am I correct?  You 
speak of the Free State not having processing facilities available to 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 89 of 146 
 
add value to the milk produced locally. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You speak of the fact that the milk was 
being transported to various centres in Gauteng from the Free State for 
processing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Gcabashe I just pick up something here 
that I wanted to raise earlier.  You see that affidavit refers to annexures 
but those annexures are not in the same bundle and I do not know if 
they are in any other bundle.  So as you read them you are referred to 
10 
an annexure but you do not know where to find it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman we received it.  We received it 
like this from the legal representatives of Mr Thabethe and I think part 
of the difficulty they have had is in locating documents that were 
seized, legally seized.  So he really does not as I have understood 
things he does not have some of these records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I did understand from his affidavit that he did not 
have access to certain documents but that did not help me where – 
when I was reading this.  Because it says see annexure so and so and 
there is no annexure so and so.  And it may be that that annexure helps 
20 
you understand better what he is saying in his affidavit. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I do not know whether they did – his lawyers did 
get a chance to try and obtain the annexures from whoever seized them 
and met with difficulties or whether some attempts can be made can be 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 90 of 146 
 
made to get them.  Because otherwise you do not get the full meaning 
of what he is saying because you do not have the annexures.  I think 
Mr Fourie maybe wishing to say something.  Maybe he might be able to 
throw some light. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Chair thank you.  You would note from the 
affidavit for Mr Thabethe this specific affidavit is the affidavit that was 
annexed in the founding affidavit that was served in the Poker 
Application.  Now the – I think it was SJS5 as an annexure to that 
affidavit and that was an affidavit that was gathered from Mr Thabethe 
during the investigation if I am not mistaken by the – during the ENS 
10 
Report stadium of matters.  Now Mr Thabethe has indicated the original 
of the affidavit that was signed by him was obviously handed in and the 
copy that he had of his full affidavit was confiscated during the search 
and seizure of the Hawks at that stage.  So the only part of the affidavit 
that he had in his possession was the one that was provided for – or 
provided to him in the founding affidavit.  He had no other options and 
you will note in the founding affidavit the annexure that was annexed 
thereto there is also several parts of the annexure that are missing with 
reference then again to the affidavit of Mr Thabethe in his opposition of 
the founding affidavit in the Poker Application.  He also makes mention 
20 
of that and you will gather that they have omitted certain parts but that 
is a discussion – a hurdle for them to overcome should they institute 
again.  But that is the problem that he has had in providing all the 
relevant documentation as well as in his preparation because they have 
confiscated the relevant documentation and the only thing that he has 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 91 of 146 
 
with regards to this affidavit is unfortunately the documentation that 
they have annexed to their founding papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that part I understand that he gave us only what 
he could get – what he has.  What I am trying to find out is whether 
attempts were made to say to whoever had seized those documents to 
say we are going to the commission and want to be helpful to the 
commission but we do not – we need these documents can you provide 
them and then maybe they refused and whether also the commission’s 
legal team has had any chance to do that?  They might not have had 
because of the short time that they might have had after receiving the 
10 
document – the documents.  So that – that is the part I am 
concentrating on to see whether we can look at attempts being made to 
contact those who should be having those documents and those 
annexures because if they may – if they agree then we can – we can 
get them that is what I am talking about. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Chair I think that would be most helpful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  From our side we have attempted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  At every stage in the proceedings. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  To obtain but if the commission would at all 
assist in that I think it would be beneficial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  Not only in this forum but in other forums 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 92 of 146 
 
proceeding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  If we could get a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  We have not been successful with even a 
response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HERMAN FOURIE:  But if the commission would be able to assist I 
think that would help greatly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you.  I think the legal team should talk 
10 
to whoever to see if we can get the annexures and whatever other 
documents would enable me to have a full and complete picture of what 
Mr Thabethe is con – seeking to convey.  I would image that there 
would be cooperation from various urgencies. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman we will certainly endeavour to 
do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I – I must point out though that few of 
these annexures are in the court bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So for instance the beneficiary list you 
have seen that before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is definitely in one of the bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 93 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I know it is in the court bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think we have a couple of duplicates on 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We – the bilateral agreement on 
agriculture which is MPT3 we have a copy of that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In the court bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then there is the request to go to India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  MPT4 that too is in the bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because these papers were next to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The other court application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those that we got somewhere then simply copies 
must be made and they get attached here and given the – the – be 
marked MPT whatever you know as indicated in the affidavit.  They get 
20 
added in the back of the – of this then one can – can get assistance.  
Those that we do not have then attempts could be made to – should be 
made to try and get them. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will do that Chairman under your 
instruction.  Nobody will accuse us of fiddling with what was presented 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 94 of 146 
 
to the commission by the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I mean the – the – the – I mean if for purposes of 
technicalities one needs to not put it as annexures – put them as 
annexures to the affidavit because when he submitted it they were not 
annexures.  One can put a divider after the affidavit but have exactly 
the same documents marked according to that so that one then just 
goes there.  Because with regard to some annexures one can do 
without but in some cases you want to see the annexure that is referred 
10 
to. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So when we – we come back Mr Thabethe 
to your trip it is really first Paras.  The essential question is how did 
you locate this particular company as a possible strategic partner in the 
dairy enterprise that you were planning to establish?  Where did you 
hear about Paras from? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I had done a research to look at 
countries that are doing very well in milk production and the actual four 
20 
countries came out which we have looked at.  The countries that we 
closely looked at was Switzerland, very strong in dairy.  We looked at 
Germany and we looked at India and we then compared the systems 
and models that they use for dairy production and processing.  The 
model that we felt came very close to what we were doing was the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 95 of 146 
 
model in India which was done by Paras.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I – can I interrupt you otherwise the 
matters I would want to tease out with you – but please do not forget 
where you were going to go to, the rest of what you were going to say.  
So if we bring it back first.  You speak of this research that was 
conducted by whom? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Well I did the desktop research. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You personally Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I personally did the desktop.  Some of 
it I had already looked at when I was still at the National Department of 
10 
Agriculture.  Some of them I found them having been done by the – by 
the Free State Provincial Department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again can I pause to understand the 
interest in dairy both at national department level and at provincial 
level.  You are saying that there was an interest therefore research had 
been done, is this what you are saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At national office? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  In regard to milk production 
20 
this interest that was there when you were at National – at the national 
department and that was there when you were the provincial 
department it was the same interest namely on milk production? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes but the one at the provincial 
department had already been there before I came in.  There was 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 96 of 146 
 
research that was done before but the research that was done by the 
Department was done together with Germany. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The National Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The Provincial Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Provincial Department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  There was a – I would call it an 
initiative without the document that – in front of me now but there was 
a comprehensive study that was done funded by the Department 
together with Germany that was developed and looked at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paras. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank - thank you Chair.  The - the 
reason why we chose Paras it was the type of model they have been 
using.  Paras - what made us to have interest is that they have been 
collecting milk from small producers.  Somebody having five dairy 
cattle, two dairy cattle.  They will then milk and then Paras will send a 
tanker to collect the milk from these small producers, bring it into their 
facility for processing and - and also for - for whatever product that 
they - they were making there. 
Now that model is the one that we envisaged given the 
situation that we wanted to develop smallholder farmers with smaller 
20 
dairies which when we looked at the research in South Africa they were 
closing down because of the cost implication and the model of Paras is 
that they have been encouraging them.  In our case they have been 
closing down. 
So we wanted to use that system so that we encourage them.  
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 97 of 146 
 
The milk gets collected, brought into the processing facility and - and 
they can be given an opportunity to grow.  Now that is the model that 
led us to Paras versus the other models. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I am sorry Ms Gcabashe.  This - maybe this 
question would belong more appropriately to tomorrow when we have 
had a look at your affidavit but I think I would like to put it now because 
then I will follow your answers to various questions much better.  Can 
you articulate what the problem was or what the problems were for 
which you thought a dairy farm was the solution for the Free State? 
10 
You have told me about small dairy producers who were 
closing down but I just want to hear the full story.  This is what was 
concerning me or concerning the Department of Agriculture and we saw 
the dairy farm - the idea of a dairy farm as being a solution to these 
problems.  This is what we wanted to fix because when you talk about 
your choice of Paras I want to link - to see if it links with what you 
sought to - to address. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  As - as 
I indicated one was that the small suppliers were closing down.  
Secondly in the Free State there was no processing facility for the milk 
20 
that had produced in the - which might mean that job opportunities of 
the produce that were - were produced in the Free State would be 
created somewhere else and - and the milk come down for marketing. 
That - that was the one problem.  Secondly the Black 
smallholder farmers had not fully entered in the industry of dairy 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 98 of 146 
 
production.  We wanted to bring them on board.  The majority of them 
had participated in beef production but not really in the dairy industry.  
So we wanted to bring them on board.  Those become the problem so 
that we do not decline the production of milk.  We increase it.  Hence 
we looked at the different model. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us just get that right.  You wanted to 
address the question of small milk producers in the Free State closing 
down? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted to get Black farmers on board onto dairy 
10 
farming? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  Is there a third one or those were the - 
the issues that you sought to address by way of this dairy farm? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The - the third one was to bring 
into the Free State a processing facility - value adding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The - a number of - of issues that arise 
from your answer to the Chairman and I think I would like to explore 
those with you tomorrow when we talk about the research you 
20 
conducted in relation to your choice of location for the dairy farm.  So if 
you have access to David Maree’s transcript.  It is on our website.  It 
would be useful for you maybe to have a look at that overnight because 
he challenges a lot of the assumptions that were made in relation to 
where dairy farms are most productive but I would like to deal with that 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 99 of 146 
 
tomorrow. 
I really would like at this - with your leave Chairman - at this 
point in time to focus on Paras and focus on Paras and India for a 
couple of reasons.  In the examples you were giving now the first thing 
that came to mind again that you will find in David Maree’s evidence is 
one, Paras was not the largest milk producer.  Two, the area where 
Paras was collecting milk for processing relied largely more than on 
dairy farm - dairy milk. 
They relied on buffalo milk.  So I would like you to apply your 
mind to that and to tell the Chairman whether you took that factor into 
10 
consideration that in the area that Paras collects milk from I think it 
was about 57 percent of the milk they collect is from buffaloes.  Now it 
is not we - we do here.  We have a different type of buffalo in any 
event. 
Those are water buffalo.  They are not similar to ours.  So 
much as that is milk that can be used.  In this country we do not have 
that.  So you go to a producer whose not entirely on for with what you 
really want.  So my focus is Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  I - I do 
not agree with the evidence that there is a difference in collecting milk 
20 
from buffaloes and cattle because in India the smallholders are keeping 
buffaloes for milk production.  The only difference is that this is a 
buffalo and this is a cow but the quantities and volumes and the - and 
the model is the same whether you want it from a buffalo or you want it 
from a cow. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 100 of 146 
 
What we have been looking it is that the system that they 
have been using in our case is going to be cattle.  In their case in the 
majority it was buffaloes. 
(Background noise) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am not sure what is happening. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No there is still …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shall we take a short adjournment? 
Unknown person:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will take a short adjournment. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
(Note from technician:  please note there are a few minutes of 
recording missing at the start of this session.  The computer program 
just froze.  We have lost that part.) 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thabethe the simple point as I understand 
it that Mr Maree was making was you are not comparing apples with 
apples, number one.  Number two, they are not the largest milk 
producer in India.  Then there are other issues in relation to our local 
that he dealt with. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In India or in the world? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said in India.  You said they are not the largest in 
India. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No they are not the largest in India. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 101 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In India Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in India as well.  I thought in the … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are not the largest in the world. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Not in India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes; but be that as it may what I have 
10 
understood from your August affidavit and you will find this at page 238 
of the witness bundle.  You say that you had already identified the 
company by the name of Paras Dairy upon where the research was 
going to be conducted.  I am quoting you. 
“Paras were identified through the aid of internet 
assistance.  I then officiated the meeting following 
the protocol through the Office of the Premier in the 
Free State.” 
And you were elaborating on this desktop research when we 
last spoke about Paras.  You - could you continue because I really 
20 
cannot imagine that a Department of Agriculture or a Department of 
Agriculture 
and 
Rural 
Development 
would 
be 
relying 
on 
a 
desktop/Google whatever it might have been source for taking a 
decision to spend large sums of money on this dairy farm in South 
Africa. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 102 of 146 
 
So all I want you to do is to help us understand how you 
stumbled across Paras.  What convinced you that they were the ideal 
partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank - thank you Chair.  I - I thought 
I had answered … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That I have done a desktop research 
across to check the trends of milk production.  Out of which I have also 
indicated that I do not agree with some of the statements mentioned in 
the report of Mr Maree.  Like one, where he says India is not the 
10 
highest milk producer in the world.  There you talk about milk 
production. 
Anyone can Google and check who is the highest milk 
producer in the world is India.  He then classifies it further and says it 
is not the higher milk producer of cattle milk.  Then I agree.  Then that 
makes a difference but milk production they are the highest but not the 
highest in cattle milk production.  Then if - if he does that distinction I 
agree with him but then after I have - I have identified and I have 
looked at the system of Paras. 
It was only then that I requested permission to go and visit 
20 
India.  So that what I have read is confirmed or not.  They do not do the 
way I have seen it.  So it might not be applicable in - in South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were - what were the features of Paras’ model 
of milk production that attracted you to Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the main feature was the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 103 of 146 
 
collection of milk from small producers.  That was what key for me and 
also the success in doing processing of milk that was collected from 
small producers.  They have been doing very well in collecting and 
processing that.  That - that would have been and ideal system for us if 
we would agree that it is a success. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is what you are telling me that the key factors that 
attracted you to identifying Paras was the fact that they collected milk 
from small farmers and why was that attractive to you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  As - as I also 
indicated that it was going to assist us to resolve our problem which we 
10 
had in the Free State of the small dairies closing down.  Now if you 
have got a country that is collecting from those small producers 
keeping them active we wanted to look at that model.  So that we will 
deal with the problem because it was either you upscale the small ones 
or they close down. 
That system was very attractive to say if they can do it in 
India why can we not borrow the same model and do it in support of the 
small producers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do not complete the picture that I am trying 
to get from you.  How did you see that helping with what you wanted to 
20 
achieve in the Free State?  How did you see that helping there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The - the way saw it was that if 
- if we establish a dairy in the Free State that will have the capacity to 
collect the milk we would then be able also to establish even more 
smaller ones to do the collection and bringing it for processing. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 104 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time as I understand the position either from 
you or from previous witnesses the numbers of dairy farmers in the 
Free State was going down significantly.  Is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you wanted was to establish a dairy farm 
which would do what Paras - what you understood Paras to be doing 
namely sell milk.  Not only milk that is produced on a farm but go to 
small farmers and collect milk from them and what - and by it from them 
and sell it or what?  What - what did you envisage? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The - the thinking was that we 
10 
do not only collect and buy from them but we make those farmers also 
part of the - to participate in the value addition of that milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what you said what was key that attracted 
you to Paras was the fact that Paras was collecting milk from the small 
farmers? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now applying that if you were going to do - 
wanted to do that in the Free State what did you envisage?  Did you 
envisage that you would do what Paras was doing namely go and 
collect the milk from - from the small farmers and do what with it? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  What we - what we looked at 
there was that they had the facility what - what assisted them to be 
able to collect the milk because they had the facility.  When they collect 
the milk they will bring it to the facility for - for processing.  So the - 
the situation also then said to us you also need to have a facility to 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 105 of 146 
 
process the milk because collecting it and you do not have a facility at 
close proximity it means you will collect it still and send it somewhere 
for processing. 
So you needed to have a facility whereby when you collect 
the milk in addition to what you are producing in that facility.  Then you 
are able to increase the volumes of processing and provide support to 
the small farmers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you talk about collecting the milk.  Did that 
mean you would buy the milk from the small farmers and then use it for 
whatever purpose or did that mean that you would not buy it?  You 
10 
would collect it and when you have sold it give the money to these 
farmers.  Exactly what - what did you envisage? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair if Chair allows me 
is then to explain the Vrede Dairy Model.  Then it will - it will clarify 
what would then happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I will allow you to do that but maybe later.  If you 
could just clarify this part for me and then later on you could come 
back to it.  So that she can continue on her line of - of questioning. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is correct Chair.  You will 
buy the milk from them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay and then … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then use it in whatever way you wanted to use it 
for - for the farm? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 106 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So Mr Thabethe I am looking at an 
annexure here to Mr Maree’s statement.  It is annexure that sets out 
the 20 major dairy companies and the date itself is relevant for 2012 - 
2012/2013 and this data ranks a company in New Zealand as having the 
highest dairy turnover in US$16.4 billion.  So you have New Zealand. 
Then you have got the USA at number two, France number 
three, Switzerland - that you looked at - number four, USA number five, 
Denmark/Sweden number six, Netherlands number seven, France eight, 
USA nine, Germany 10, Canada/USA 11, Ireland 12, USA takes 13 and 
10 
14 spots.  Germany - a different company in Germany, France, China 
then India comes in at spot 18 and their dairy turnover for that 
particular company was 2.5 billion. 
So if you compare that 2.5 billion just by way of example with 
France which sits at US$15.6 billion with New Zealand which sits at 
16.4 billion.  I remain concerned about the quality of the desktop 
research you conducted.  Particularly where - when the National 
Treasury investigators asked you for a copy of these documents you 
had relied on - your desktop presentation. 
You were not able to produce those.  Should I be concerned 
20 
about the quality of the desktop research you say you conducted? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  I - I do not dispute 
the report of Mr Maree.  The commercial ventures that they are doing 
there would be different from what we wanted to do.  There they are 
doing large dairies, big turnovers, doing agroprocessing.  Our situation 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 107 of 146 
 
was we would not get to that level of their production.  We wanted to 
assist smallholders and those models would not be applicable to us. 
That - that is where I do not agree because he is comparing 
very hi-tech first world dairy production level.  With the one that we 
wanted to do we had compared ourselves to a country similar to us 
having the same kind of challenges, the same scale of farmers.  That is 
what we looked at and said that model will be applicable to us.  In 
terms of commercial value they are doing very well but we - we will not 
be able to apply those models. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You know Mr Thabethe I would understand 
10 
your answer more clearly if you were saying to the Chairman because 
of the nature of what we wanted to do in South Africa we wanted to 
encourage Black farmers to move from red meat - from cattle farming - 
to dairy farming.  We then started off with this group of 10 farmers - 
local African farmers and ask them to do A, B, C, D and E. 
My difficulty arises when I look at what you spent on a facility 
that as we will explore between today and tomorrow never worked in 
the manner that you intended to for a variety of reasons.  So if you 
were going to start small because we are all developing countries you 
do that.  You tried to build a state of the art milk processing plant 
20 
there.  We will deal with that problem tomorrow. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  We 
would not go that route because starting dairies and leave them at that 
level will then collapse again because we had that experience of small 
dairies closing down.  So for us to start small dairies and leave them 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 108 of 146 
 
without properly setting up structures that will assist them not to 
collapse it would not help us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think Ms Gcabashe is talking about that.  
I think she is talking about you starting small but with the aim of getting 
bigger.  Not starting small and leaving it there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In any event Mr Thabethe … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My understanding is that there was a milk 
processing plant in Harrismith.  It continues to be there in Harrismith. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There was a milk processing plant in 
Frankfurt which is further north.  I think about 60 kilometres from 
Vrede. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There was a milk processing plant in 
Standerton which closed down. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the premise that there are no milk 
processing plants in the vicinity of Vrede where you set up this dairy 
farm is not correct.  Hence my example of saying if you had started 
20 
small your 100 farmers you deal with them in terms of the cattle you 
wanted to give them - the dairy cows you wanted to give them and use 
Harrismith - as a quick example - where you then transport your milk. 
I might have understood what you are talking about.  It would 
not have cost you more or less 250 million over a two year period. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 109 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But may - maybe - let us get the factual situation to 
be common cause if it is common cause.  Do you agree that there are 
those milk processing plants in the places in the Free State that she 
has mentioned? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I - I agree that there is a - a 
private processing plant in both those places Frankfurt and Harrismith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  She then says in the light of that it was - it is 
not correct - it was not correct for you to say there was no milk 
processing plant I do not know whether it be Free State or in - or in the 
vicinity. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Both … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you say to that or both?  What do you say to 
that? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Both towns are in the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is suggesting to you that that was not correct. 
What do you say to that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair I - I agree if - if she 
says there - there were processing plant but they were not in a position 
20 
to assist our challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you say earlier on in your evidence that it was 
because there were no milk processing plants that you wanted to 
establish a milk processing plant through the farm as well?  Was that 
your evidence earlier? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 110 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay.  Let - let me go back again and 
try and explain it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the existing processing plant in 
- in terms of capacity you would go in there and sign a contract with 
them and then as a farmer you would then be able to provide the milk.  
10 
So they will come to you, test your milk, agree with you whether they 
will be able to take your milk or not.  So a very limited number of 
existing farmers were able to utilise those because they were not very 
big. 
Hence the trucks that were still collecting milk in the Free 
State to Johannesburg were still more than those that were suppling 
the - the factories that were in the Free State.  So the problem was not 
resolved by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we just need to get - to be common cause what is 
common cause what - what you do not dispute.  So you had said earlier 
20 
on that part of the reason why you went to Paras or you identified 
Paras was because you wanted to have a milk processing plant 
established in - in - on the - in Vrede - in Vrede Farm … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there was no milk processing plant in the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 111 of 146 
 
Free State or in the vicinity of Vrede.  So you now accept that no 
actually there were at least two milk processing plants? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that part was not correct.  So she is right about 
that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  She is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  I think Ms Gcabashe you can take it from 
there then. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair; but as I said I - I had 
wanted to focus on Paras.  You then travelled to India.  You sought 
10 
permission from the Premier - you say in your affidavit - and in fact you 
say at page 12 of the witness bundle paragraph 37.1 you write as 
follows.  You say: 
“My visit to Paras India was approved by Exco 
pursuant to which Mr Ashok Narayan was delegated 
by the Office of the Premier to accompany me to 
India in his capacity as advisor to the Premier.” 
It is page 12 - paginated page 12 - paragraph 37.1.  I have 
your travel itinerary here.  I want to start there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is EXHIBIT HH.  Reference Bundle D for 
Dolly Chairman.  D for Donald and the page number is 1-3-2-3 - 13-23.  
You will agree - sorry Mr Thabethe.  1-3-2-3.  There is in big bold black 
letters number 6-6-9 from the old court papers.  That is the one.  That 
is the page we are on but that is not our reference at all.  Our 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 112 of 146 
 
reference is 1-3-2-3. 
So this is your motivation to the Premier.  First question why 
would you be writing to the Premier and not to the MEC?  I really do not 
know.  This is addressed to the Premier, Mr Magashule from yourself. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  The approval for overseas 
trips has not been delegated to the MEC.  So the approval gets 
submitted to the Premier for approval. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  By all Heads of Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  By all Heads of Department.  By all 
persons in the Provincial Government who wants to travel overseas.  
10 
You get approval from the Premier. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was that the case with all other Premiers 
that you have worked under not just in the Free State but elsewhere? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  When - I have - I have worked 
in Mpumalanga that was the case.  In National the Minister was 
approving. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now the second point is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe before the second point Ms Gcabashe; 
but even if the authority to grant approval was the Premier would you 
not write to the MEC - the person you report to and if he or if he 
20 
approved then he would be the one to write to the Premier to say I am 
asking that you allow my Head of Department to travel for the reasons 
that the gives in his memorandum which I attached - I attach hereto.  
Something along those lines.  Would you write directly to the Premier? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  In fact there is a template 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 113 of 146 
 
on - on which you - you write the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So you address it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The MEC recommends … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For the Premier’s approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I - in any event you - you get appointed by the 
10 
Premier as a Head of Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Indistinct) yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So under purpose in paragraph 1 you say 
- you: 
“The purpose is to request approval from the 
Honourable Premier to allow HOD for Agriculture 
Mr P M Thabethe 
and 
advisor 
to 
the 
Premier 
20 
Mr Ashok Narayana to undertake a trip to visit a 
dairy farm.” 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Not a buffalo farm. 
“…and attend a meeting with a strategic partner in 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 114 of 146 
 
India from 29 February to 4 March 2012 in support 
of the expansion of dairy farming in the Free State.” 
Mr Ashok Narayana who is he? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair can I start by saying a 
dairy farm is irrespective whether you are milking cattle, buffalo, goats.  
It can be any.  It remains a dairy farm.  So it - it does not only specify 
to cattle. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I know that in Botswana what is taken 
of is donkey milk.  I will not call that a dairy farm.  Chairman it is a 
proposition I put.  He is the agriculturist.  I happen to know that it is 
10 
very popular in Botswana. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Donkey milk.  I will not - people use it and 
drink it … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As they would dairy - cow milk.  You 
cannot classify that as a dairy farm Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is Chair.  We also have got a goat 
diary.  We also call it a dairy farm but you only milk goats. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Anyway … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the dairy part relates to the milk? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To the milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not to where you get the milk from? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not - yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as it is - it is a farm for milk? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 115 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You were explaining who Mr Ashok 
Narayana is and I really want it in relation to you.  Who - who is he?  
Where - where did he come from?  Why did he accompany you to India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I - I think it is - it is - the - the 
submissions that I - I sent clarifies who is he. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please clarify that to the Chair. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Mr Narayana was an advisor to the 
Premier, which then accompanied me to the trip to India. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Why Mr Narayana, is he a dairy farmer, 
does he have expertise in dairy farming?  That’s really what the 
question is, why this particular individual? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, why was he chosen as the right person to go with 
you to India, to accompany you to India on this project, on this visit? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I cannot answer Chair the question, 
the person ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you did not decide that yourself? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So who decided that? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   When I did the submission the 
Embassy indicated to me that I will be accompanied by Mr Ashok 
Narayana. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Which MEC? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The Embassy for Agriculture and 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 116 of 146 
 
Rural Development, at that time who signed the submissions 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Zwane. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Mr Zwane. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So you were instructed to travel with Mr 
Narayana? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair it has always been the case if 
– the Office of the Premier is responsible for the protocol so in all my 
overseas trips that I have taken I have been delegated a person from 
the office of the Premier.  As long as it is an official ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To go with you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   To go with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   They were very – because for 
protocol purposes somebody has to go with you from the Office of the 
Premier, because individual provincial departments did not have a unit 
for protocol and a lot of these if you don’t understand the protocols of 
particular countries then you have problems, so it was their 
responsibility to look at the protocols and assist you when you go to 
those countries. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were not going to a government entity there, 
you were going to a private company, so what did protocol have 
anything to do with this? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   All the time protocol people will 
assist you. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 117 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, my question is why, I mean you are not going to a 
government department there, you are going to a private business to 
learn how they do certain things, so why – what’s the relevance of 
somebody who must come for protocol purposes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I don’t know Chair.  All that we know 
is that if you make a request to go overseas the office will then be able 
to allocate you, either in your submission or the person can be added 
in your submission who can then assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if that person adds no value in the trip or in the 
purpose of your trip, they will just give somebody. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   A person will be allocated to you 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you don’t want to say even if the person was not 
going to add value.  Okay, alright, so are you saying you had no say on 
the choice of Mr Narayana as the person to accompany you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who made the choice, who made the decision, now 
you told me that Mr Zwane mentioned this name as the person that 
would go with you, but the person who had the decision was who, was it 
Mr Zwane or was it the Premier’s office? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:    Yes Mr Zwane indicated to me that 
in my submission I must include Mr Narayana to travel with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so he said you must include that in your 
submission to say you want him to go with you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes to go with yes. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 118 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now I can find the record in our files, Mr 
Narayana was appointed to the advisory council of the Premier in 
February 2012, would you know about that?   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No I wouldn’t know Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But does it make sense to you where 
somebody has literally just arrived a month ago in the Premier’s office, 
not even in the Premier’s office, he is part of the advisory council 
which is an ad hoc council, that somebody who has just arrived at 
Advisory Council level is the person who is now your protocol officer, 
10 
would that not be strange to you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I wouldn’t comment Chair because I 
don’t know what were the reasons they used for the choice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know Mr Narayana at the time that Mr Zwane 
suggested his name as the person that you must include in your 
submission?  Did you know him at that time? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Not at close proximity but I had seen 
him in other meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Where I never had any interactions 
20 
with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not had an interaction with him? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t know what his expectations was, you didn’t 
know anything really about him, is that right? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 119 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes all I know is that there were 
people who had been advisors to the Premier who would attend some 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So we – I can give you the reference now 
Chairman it’s page 1316 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the same bundle? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Reference HH, reference bundle D, same 
bundle Chairman, D, 1316. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1316? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s correct Chairman.   There you 
simply have a letter of appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me just see.  Oh that’s the letter of 
appointment of Mr Narayana by Mr Magashule the Premier. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the date is 29 February 2012. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the date of the submission, of the request for 
permission that was submitted to the Premier by Mr Thabethe is 20 – it 
was signed by Mr Thabethe on 24 February 2012, so before – so it was, 
20 
so Mr Zwane must have asked you to include Narayana even before his 
appointment to the Advisory Council because the letter appointing Mr 
Narayana to the Advisory Council of the Premier is dated 29 Feb 2012 
and your submission was made before that, at least you prepared it on 
the – you signed it on the 24 t h of February 2012 and there is no date 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 120 of 146 
 
for when Mr Zwane signed it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the the date when the Premier signed it to 
approve was 28 t h Feb 2012, one day before Mr Narayana was actually 
appointed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So when the Premier signed this 
document Mr Narayana was not a member of his Advisory Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe you were going to address to say this but 
10 
I see that the second last paragraph on the end of the letter says that 
the appointment was to be with effect from the 1 s t of March 2012 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when the Premier approved that Mr Narayana must 
accompany Mr Thabethe Mr Narayana had not yet been appointed to 
the Premier’s Advisory Council. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And the very last sentence also explains 
the status and function of Mr Narayana, the Premier writes and I quote: 
20 
“I look forward to working with you in your capacity as an ICT 
and Project Management expert on my Advisory Council.” 
So he was not a dairy or agriculturalist, he is not a dairy farmer as I 
asked earlier, it’s not an agricultural specialist, he is an ICT Chair.  Tell 
me Mr Thabethe at your level in government are you not able to 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 121 of 146 
 
interrogate who accompanies you on a specialist mission because you 
were going out there with the purpose, at your level are you not able to 
interrogate who accompanies you to places? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair you can recommend in your 
delegation, in your delegation that I would propose then I will then 
decide who the people that I would want to accompany, but those, that 
added in your list you have no control over. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But who else was on your list, now that 
you mention lists Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair in this trip I had asked for 
10 
myself. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You were going alone? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Is that usual? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I had undertaken other overseas 
trips alone to go and look at different issues that pertained the 
Department.  In instances where I needed delegation I will then do so, 
but in some instances where you want to go and visit and verify you 
then go alone. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Did you not have a support team within 
20 
your department that you were working with on this particular project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   There were teams in the department, 
all that I needed was to go there and confirm number one the existence 
of the company, and what activities do they do and whether they may 
have interest in assisting us. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 122 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But surely Mr Thabethe that is exactly 
why we have a High Commission in New Delhi if I’m not wrong it’s New 
Delhi, they are there to support not only organs of state like Provincial 
Governments but even ordinary business people who travel to those 
countries, why did you have to get onto a place and physically go to 
India?   We have a High Commission. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair there are certain aspects that 
you need to verify as an agriculturalist to physically go there so that 
when you proceed you know what you are dealing with, hence this trip 
was not a very long trip, it was to go there, verify, talk  to the company, 
10 
engage in discussions and then come back.  The intention was not to 
spend a very long time, just to go and verify. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Who paid for Mr Narayana’s return trip 
ticket, was it the Provincial Government? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the Office of the Premier within the Provincial 
Government or was it your department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It was my department Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well then the question that Ms Gcabashe asked 
earlier becomes even more important, you have identified the need to 
20 
go on a trip to India for a certain purpose for your department,  As far 
as you are concerned it is sufficient if you were the only one who went 
there.  You are told now you must have somebody else that must go 
with you and payment for that person will come from your Department’s 
budget, surely you must ask yourself the question is there a need for 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 123 of 146 
 
my department to spend money for this person to travel to India and 
back, what is the value that this person is going to add to what I am 
going to India for, surely you have to ask that question as an 
Accounting Officer, as the Accounting Officer of the Department, do you 
know not agree? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair it is not as easy going into 
asking questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not be easy but I am very interested in 
understanding what it is that makes it not easy, because some of the 
things in our country have gone wrong and people have kept quiet 
10 
because they say it’s not easy.  What is it that makes it not easy for 
you to ask questions? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair I would go back and say 
the office is responsible for protocol, if you, if the norm is if you go 
overseas then a protocol person must go with you, that was my 
understanding and if this is the understanding you would not be able to 
question because there are instances where even after this trip where I 
had gone overseas also carried the cost of the protocol person that will 
assist you in the trip, because you have initiated the trip, they allocate 
the person to you to be able to travel with you.  If in my own thinking 
20 
there could be a lot of other things that could be the reasons for 
somebody in the protocol to accompany, but I don’t want to do 
speculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you don’t have to do speculation, but do you 
agree that as the head of department, as the accounting officer of the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 124 of 146 
 
department, if you are going to now, if your department is going to 
carry costs for this person to travel to India and come back, stay there 
for a few days and your department is going to pay for those costs 
there is a duty on you to say if I am asked the question what value is 
this person adding, what am I going to say, because if you don’t have 
an answer isn’t the position that you should say to whoever starting 
with Mr Zwane who made the suggestion and maybe to the Office of the 
Premier, say but why must we spend, why must my department spend 
so much money on somebody flights when really we don’t need him, 
why, I need to understand as an accounting officer how will I justify 
10 
this, don’t you have to say that? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chair I didn’t do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you didn’t do it but should you not have done it as 
an Accounting Officer, the Accounting Officer ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mic Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, as the Accounting Officer of the 
Department, as Head of the Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair in instances where I would 
have had a problem in paying I would have indicated that I do not have 
the money. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So must I take that answer to mean that you did not 
have a problem with paying – with the Department paying for Mr 
Narayana’s trip to India in circumstances where you yourself could not 
say what value he was adding to the trip, you didn’t have a problem 
spending taxpayers money on that? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 125 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I do not have an answer for 
that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But can you see that as an Accounting Officer and as 
Head of Department you should have an answer, because you have 
been entrusted with a budget, and it is your duty to make sure that that 
the funds allocated to the Department are used properly and for proper 
purposes, there should be no cent that is used without justification.  
Here comes a situation where you are told effectively to pay for 
somebody’s trip for which you don’t have any justification for them to 
take that trip and to be paid from the Department, do you agree that 
10 
you should have raised that issue? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just the last comment on this aspect I 
underscore the fact Mr Narayana was not an official, he was not a 
public functionary, he was not an employee of your department, he was 
not an employee of the Premier’s Office and yet you spent government 
money on a private individual who I am sure could jolly-well have paid 
for himself if he wanted to go to India.  It just does not sound right, Mr 
Thabethe?   
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair in the past we maybe also 
after this trip we did pay for non-government people in my department’s 
specifically farmers.   If I were to identify a trip to go overseas and we 
would like farmers to go and have exposure we would then recommend 
that those farmers go with the Department at the cost of the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 126 of 146 
 
Department.  So that has happened before but I am not trying to justify 
this one, I am saying that paying for other people who are not working 
for government we have been doing and motivated for it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Now Mr Narayana was a director of 
companies, so he is not a farmer who needs the exposure that you 
appear to be speaking of when you say you would take somebody from 
your area of expertise and competence, agriculture, with you on a trip.  
This is a businessman who is a director of companies, who has his own 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he does consider that he is not justifying this 
10 
one, is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that here it was not justified? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, what I say Chair I should have 
questioned as the Chair was indicating to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   But I didn’t question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and looking back you accept that you didn’t 
question. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Paragraph ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that, of course Mr Thabethe part of what 
concerns one with this situation, but we will explore a lot of things is to 
what extent could there be many other instances where government 
officials to what extent where there would be many situations where 
government officials should have questioned how taxpayers money was 
being spent but did not question with the result that a lot of taxpayers’ 
money was or may have been wasted, but if they had questioned and 
said no, no but I am not going to be party to this because I don’t see 
the need maybe taxpayers money would have been saved, so those are 
10 
the issues that come to mind you know, you understand? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mr Thabethe I am still looking at that 
letter of motivation that you prepared and my understanding of 
paragraph 2.1 is that it dealt with just conditions of service, costs 
related to conditions of service, why was paragraph 2.1 which maybe 
you should read into the record put here as a motivation, paragraph 2.1 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m terribly sorry Ms Gcabashe, I’m terribly sorry, I 
20 
only realised now that you are moving away from paragraph 1.1 so I 
just want to ask one question on that paragraph before you proceed to 
the next one. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Paras at this time when you requested the 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 128 of 146 
 
Premier for permission to travel to India was Paras already a partner 
with the Department of Agriculture in the Free State, were they already 
a strategic partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No, not yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Why then in paragraph 1.1 did you say you 
wanted to – you were going there in order to attend a meeting with a 
strategy partner in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I think maybe the wording Chair, but 
the intention was looking for a strategic partner.  We visited there 
because we wanted an A strategic partner and I think we had used the 
10 
same wording also in the country when we say we met with strategic 
partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you see I don’t understand that because 
somebody doesn’t just become your partner, business partner, or 
whatever partner, a certain process precedes that and you are not 
saying a potential strategy partner, you are saying you are going to 
meet with a strategic partner.  So then I am wondering could it be that 
already some processes had gone before you prepared this letter and 
Paras was for all intents and purposes already a strategic partner and – 
or was the position that they were not, you were going there to explore 
20 
or to see what they were doing and how they were doing it with a view 
that if you are satisfied about certain things with them then maybe they 
could be a strategic partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair it might be that we are not 
using the correct word, because locally we normally refer to people who 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 129 of 146 
 
are in the industry our strategic partners, if I may use an example in 
the Free State you will have Grain South Africa, when we refer to Grain 
South Africa we say they are our strategic partner because we are in 
the same industry.  That is why I am saying maybe then we – our 
choice of words might not be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you are right but it may be that Grain South 
Africa you already have an existing relationship with them, it might not 
be formal, but maybe you have interactions with them that’s why you 
call them, you might call them strategic partner, but here you talk about 
an entity that on your version you had not had any interactions with 
10 
before this, so but I hear what you are saying.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  If I might point out 
that – oh you were actually going to try and just help me understand or 
help the Chairman understand more importantly the reason that 
paragraph 2.1 forms part of the motivation for you to go to visit Paras.  
You may want to read paragraph 2.1 into the record just so that we 
understand what is written there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you could please start by reading it into 
the record. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   
“Provincial Treasury received the final preliminary 
allocation letter from National Treasury on the 12 
December 2011 an amount of R1 million in the 
2012/2013 which is 0873 million in 2013/2014 and 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 130 of 146 
 
873 
million 
in 
2014/2015 
has 
been 
allocated 
additional to our baseline to carry through cost on 
improvement in conditions of service.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that second – was that first figure there intended 
to be 1 million you have got 1 thousand million rand which I guess 
would be R1 billion is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes it is intended to be R1 million 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
There 
are 
three 
000 
there. 
 
Oh 
ja 
it 
is 
R1 000 000 000.   
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You are the author of this motivation Mr 
Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You were the author? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I confirm that it is R1 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was intended to be R1 million but you did not write 
R1 million. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was intended to be R1 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wrote R1 000 000 000.00. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is intended to be R1 million Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you confirm that you are the author of 
this document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am – I am Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So when we go to the next figure which 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 131 of 146 
 
you have written here as .837 million we can safely assume that you 
are talking about R873 000.00?  I do not know this is really a question? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   What is the million doing there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry I – well ja it is R873 000.00 so but 
there is a million there but it – it might be correct technically because it 
says 0.873 million. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are lawyers Chairman so maybe we do 
not understand numbers.  But we take comfort with the fact that you 
said that is R873 000,00 that is what you recording there? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now what has money that has been 
allocated over a three year period additional to your baseline so as to 
cover carry through costs on improvement in conditions of service got 
to do with a trip to Paras in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  If you – if you write 
a submission for a trip to go overseas you must indicate that you have 
the money to undertake that trip.  That is the reason why we then 
indicated that yes indeed money is available because you cannot get an 
approval to go when you do not have budget allocated for that purpose. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will let you… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will pass Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that paragraph Mr Thabethe does not say we have 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 132 of 146 
 
got the money for this trip this is where – this is where we – this is 
where it is parked.  It says  
“Provincial Treasury received the final preliminary 
allocation letter from National Treasury on the 12 
December 2011.”   
On that sentence I do not – we do not know yet that this is about 
saying this is where we have got money from.  And amount of – I will 
now read R1 million in 2012/2013, R873 000,00 in 2013/2014 and 
R873 000,00 in 2014/2015 has been allocated additional to your 
baseline to cover carry through costs on improvement in conditions of 
10 
service.  From what you are saying here it looks like this money that 
you are talking about relates to the improvement of conditions of 
services, is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  If I may explain it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In instances where you may not have 
enough money in the Department then you make a submission to 
Treasury for additional allocation.  That normally happens during the 
budget adjustment.  So in this instance we had then been informed by 
National Treasury that we have been allocated additional money.  
20 
Otherwise when – when at face value when they would have looked at 
the budget they would have told me that you do not have money.  You 
cannot travel.  So I had to motivate that even though it has not shown 
in the budget yet we had already received an additional allocation from 
Treasury which allows us to continue the expenditure on that allocation. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 133 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that allocation – additional allocation was for 
something else not for a trip to India, is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No there – it was part of the condition 
of service where you then also pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was for the improvement of conditions of service. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  For the Department.  It means it is 
not [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but does that not mean conditions of service of the 
employees of the Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No – it is – it – that is what they call 
10 
it.  It is conditions of operation of services because it is money that you 
are given to be able to do your work.  Then it is the Department that 
then classify where you want it to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you are given this money on the basis that 
you can use it for any of your operations? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you mean – what you saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes you are given and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it is up to you what you use it for. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To allocate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within the Department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is this reference to conditions of service?  
You say it has got nothing to do with conditions of service of the 
employees of the Department? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 134 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No it – the condition of service it 
means it is money that is allocated to you to do work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any operations within the... 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Any operations within the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It means it improves you to deliver 
service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then we look at the next paragraph and 
10 
you link this trip to the SOPA address that is the State of the Province 
Address and you say that the Department will deliver a dairy parlour 
and milk processing plant in Vrede Sesotho integrated project and 
QwaQwa.  Those projects are expected to create additional jobs for the 
people of the Free State.  So the intention when you went to Paras was 
that you were going to create – you were going to build these 
processing plants in thes areas and thereby create jobs for the people 
of the Free State? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But you say in paragraph 2.3 … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe before you go that far Ms Gcabashe.  In 
relation to 2.1 – paragraph 2.1 I got the impression earlier on that what 
you were saying is at the time you asked the Premier to grant you 
permission to travel to Paras you actually did not have money sitting in 
the Department to pay for that trip but there was money that was on its 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 135 of 146 
 
way by way of this allocation referred to in this paragraph from which 
you could then take the money to pay for the trip, is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I want to ask the question what was so urgent 
about undertaking this trip before the money came through properly?  
Why did it have to happen at that time even before this allocation came 
through properly? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thank you Chair.  The money was 
already there because it was allocated during the adjustment 
appropriation and we had already received the letter from Provincial 
10 
Treasury that the money has been allocated.  It means it was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was there where?  I got the impression that you 
were saying it was on its way, the approval has been granted for it to 
come but it had not yet arrived.  That is the impression I got, was I 
wrong? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes the letter of allocation was given 
already on the 12 December to the Provincial Treasury.  That we are – 
we have given you the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that all that is required before you can use the 
money or is – once you have got the letter the money must go into the 
20 
Department’s account or not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair in the Province normally the 
money remains with Provincial Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes it remains. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 136 of 146 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So once you have got the letter you are as good as if 
the money is sitting in your Department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Back to paragraph 2.3 where you note that 
the allocated budget of R17 million for the completion of 3 dairy plans 
would only be sufficient to cover the initiation phases of the project 
hence there is a need for a strategic partner to partner the Department 
for the completion of the projects within the specified period to 
comprehensively cover the value chain in terms of markets, further 
10 
inputs and other unintended occurrences.  So you are indicating here 
that there is an allocated budget of R17 million let me pause there.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For the completion of three dairy plans.  
Let me pause again.  R17 million for the completion of three dairy 
plans. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  A plan? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  A dairy plan. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us talk more about that.  What plans are these 
that are so expensive?  What plans are you talking about? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair the development of dairy 
plans is costly.  First of all you have to do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us start with what is a dairy plan? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 137 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes that is what I am trying to cover 
Chair.  You need to do a feasibility study.  You need to do an 
environmental impact assessment.  You need to do a fully-fledged 
business plan.  You need to do water allocation because the 
consumption of water in a dairy is also very high.  So you need to do 
those analysis.  You need to do designs for those dairies and in all 
these you need to get experts to assist you to do them.  And then when 
you have concluded then you will say I have a dairy plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your dairy plan is a combination of all these 
plans? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is a combination of a number of 
things that need to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I might have not covered all them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but basically what you are talking about is 
something that is really – I want to say basic but that might convey a 
wrong meaning but something quite essential. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the sense that you want to know whether this 
project – this dairy project – this dairy milk production business or 
20 
project that I want to undertake whether it would be sustainable.  
Whether it will give me what I am looking for. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. Not only in a 
dairy but also in a number of other agricultural activities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay. 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 138 of 146 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Had – I want to pause for one minute to 
reflect on the R17 million for the three dairy plans. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Prior to deciding on these dairy projects 
did you sit down and work out any kind of costing for what you thought 
was a bright idea?  Did you put money to the thought and work out an 
estimate on what it was going to cost you from beginning to end to put 
up these three dairy projects which you mention in paragraph 2.2? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair you can do a desktop study but 
without having done the due diligence you would not be able to say how 
10 
much it will cost.  You may have an idea you want to build a house of 
not exceeding R1 million but then the designs that you require will then 
inform you how much it will cost.  That is what we had in mind this is 
what we want to do then the studies and the plan will then come back 
and tell us this is the cost.  Then once you have the cost then you 
decide whether you want to implement the plan you will have the money 
or you will not be able to implement the plan because you may not have 
that level of money. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you will pay R17 million for something 
that you might not follow through on simply because somebody had a 
20 
bright idea and said let us have a few dairy farms in the Free State? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair hence you do what you call a 
preliminary study.  You do a preliminary study and your preliminary 
study will be something that you will mostly rely on desktop information 
because you have not done the details.  That preliminary study then 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 139 of 146 
 
will inform you whether you can proceed and appoint.  Now a 
preliminary study tells you that yes indeed that area is suitable but you 
may spend money and discover that in terms of the environmental 
impact assessment you cannot do it, it is declined.  But you would have 
spent the money to do the environmental impact assessment.  You do 
the analysis of the water.  You do the analysis of the soil.  You check 
them either you get a positive or a negative.  You will never have 
information that informs you what – whether you can do it or not without 
having spent money.  So you have to do your assessment and you pay 
for those assessments and then the answer comes back to you and say 
10 
yes you can do it or no you cannot do it.  It is like prospecting for 
mining.  You go there and you drill and after you have paid and drilled 
you either yes there is coal here or no there is no coal here but you 
have spent the money.  So if you want to do a diary you have to do an 
environmental impact assessment whether it will say yes or no and you 
pay for doing that.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But this is precisely the point.   
1. You must budget.  You must have a budget.  If I am going to build 
a house I must make sure that I save for a period of five years so 
that when I eventually have enough money I then follow through 
20 
on getting designs etcetera, etcetera.  I do not start with the 
designs and then decide that the house is too expensive.  It – 
this is putting the cart before the horse and it is not – it will not 
the be the first time as you will see between today and tomorrow 
that I will be making the comment.  It cannot be right Mr 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 140 of 146 
 
Thabethe that simply because I have a bright idea tax payers 
money should be thrown into finding out whether this particular 
idea is practical or not.  You see your mining idea your mining 
example.  I go to the bank so I am taking on an obligation.  I am 
responsible for dealing with that bank.  It is not the same with 
tax payers’ money.  You cannot dream up something it cannot be 
right that is all I am saying.  It just does not sound right that you 
dream up something and then you throw money at the dream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think give him a chance to comment on what you 
saying, what you saying to him. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you say Mr Thabethe about these 
propositions? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair I do not agree.  You – I do 
not know maybe it is only in the agriculture industry but I believe it is 
also in other industries.  Planning is not as cheap as we – sometimes 
we think.  You have to do a proper plan and you pay for the plans.  If 
we are to develop plans for agricultural development we have to do 
them properly and it requires money.  Plans at instances are being 
developed and they become negative and you have paid for those plans 
20 
development.  At a face value you may think yes in this site that I have 
bought I can build a house and after you have done the survey your 
engineers come and tell you; you cannot build this building here.  So 
those are the things that will happen because you will never know until 
you have done the study.  So that is what happens in agriculture.  You 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 141 of 146 
 
have to spend for your plans and designs and surveys and then you 
come back and you say yes we can proceed or no. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I – can I proceed on the same paragraph 
you then say:  There is a need for a strategic partner to partner the 
Department for completion of the projects.  In other words you did not 
have the money for these projects, it is a question. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair we have realised that we 
would want to assist the dairy industry but in our coffers we will not 
have enough money to do so hence we then looked for strategic 
partners to assist us and deal with this particular issue. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again tomorrow I will go through the 
Dawie Maree document with you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And address some of the propositions that 
you make. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I notice I had not realised it is 
twenty-five past four already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe – well if you want we go up to half past 
but if whatever you have would be better dealt with tomorrow that is 
20 
fine.  I do want to ask Mr Thabethe some question.  Now Mr Thabethe if 
you were still going to have a feasibility study undertaken why did you 
have to undertake a trip to India before a feasibility study was done?  
Because as I see it the trip to India could wait until you have a 
feasibility study that gives you a basis to say okay maybe we will 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 142 of 146 
 
proceed because a feasibility study and other plans that you talked 
about could have effectively said forget it is not viable to do – to 
pursue this idea.  But if the feasibility study were to come later and say 
that you had already undertaken the trip to India you would have 
wasted tax payers money.  Why could the trip to India not wait until that 
had been done? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it has to inform what you want 
to do because when you do the feasibility study then you must be 
informed by what do you want to do?  If I put an example.  We might 
have done a feasibility study on dairy production but there would be no 
10 
factors that will inform us to say after the dairy then what?  What would 
be the process and what would you do and the how part?  So that was 
very critical to assist us because the model that we have been looking 
at we wanted to do we did not have and we have been looking at 
strategic – different strategic partners.  We have looked at partners in 
South Africa like I have mentioned before and said we would want 
somebody to come and partner with us to achieve 1234 and we were 
not able to get anybody that says yes we are interested we want to 
work with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you mean by this time you prepared this request 
20 
to the Premier to give you permission to go to India you had already 
approached other entities within South Africa to see whether they could 
be your strategic partners in this project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh do you remember some of them? 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 143 of 146 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The major partners Chair that we had 
interacted with them I think in one of my – I am trying to think in one of 
the affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the documents okay we can identify it 
tomorrow. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Later yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can get the names. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I go back to my question.  Why travel to India first 
before that study is done rather than have the study done and then if 
10 
the result of the study suggest that this is something worth pursuing 
then maybe then go to India but it could say it is not sustainable then 
you would not go – you would not spend the money you would have 
spent on the trip? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair the intention is to look at best 
practices.  What we have learnt in the industries.  Different role players 
do things differently.  You may do the feasibility study and when you 
get to an agreement with a strategic partner you find that some 
information are lacking which they require to be part of the strategic 
part – of the feasibility study.  Because when you do that feasibility 
20 
study you indicate what information do you require and then it is then 
done in line with the information that is being required.  So if you do 
not know who you are going to be dealing with let me use an example.  
You going to be producing milk that it is only for local – I am trying to 
get the correct way.  But it has to be informed by – by your plans 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145 
 
Page 144 of 146 
 
moving forward.  Are you going to be cultivating for pastures?  If yes or 
are you going to be feeding the cattle standing there.  Those things are 
very critical because you may either do the soil analysis or you may not 
do the soil analysis.  So it is very critical to be informed by the – by 
what kind of systems do you want to run. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would have thought that the feasibility study and 
whatever other studies that may need to be done the brief to the people 
who are going to do that would be this is what we are thinking of doing.  
Do the study, do the research, do whatever is necessary to see whether 
it would be viable or whether it would not be viable if it is done along 
10 
this model but maybe viable if it is done along - on the basis of another 
model or it is guaranteed of success if you do it with another model. 
So they look at the whole picture and they - they know the 
conditions in the Free State.  They know the conditions in Vrede.  They 
know what is happening to dairy farmers around.  They know the 
markets and - and maybe you say to them look at what is happening in 
other countries if there is something that we might have to look - look 
at in order for this kind of project to be successful here. 
They go and do that.  They come back with a study that says 
you know what if you are going to use this and that and that model here 
20 
in Vrede it is not going to work but if you are going to use this model 
that we see is been used in India by Paras then this has a chance of 
working.  Then you undertake the trip to - to India to look at Paras.  
That is - that is how - that is - that is my thinking.  What is wrong with 
that thinking?

MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it can be done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Along that way.  It - it might be the 
expensive one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because now you have to do research 
on - on a number of models and - and your cost will then increase 
because those people that would apply will have then to look at 
different scenarios and it might escalate your cost.  Whereas when you 
are very specific to say look at this model then your costs are confined 
10 
to that specific model. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you think it - it may depend in certain 
circumstances you say it may be cost effective to do the trip to India 
before you do the study but in other circumstances maybe … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  May … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be acceptable to do it later depending if - if 
the study suggests that it is worth doing it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay.  You reserve everything for tomorrow. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would like to Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It has been a long day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  We will adjourn then today.  Do you 
request that we start earlier or we can - we should stick to 10? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are in your hands on that one 
15 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 145

Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in terms of your estimate of how much time 
you will need. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mic - mic Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Yes in terms of your estimate of how 
much time we might need tomorrow have you got an idea whether there 
is a need to start earlier or not? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think we will only finish after lunch quite 
frankly Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  We can start at 10. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So if you would prefer to start early at 
half past nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We could do that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But we are likely to finish even if we start 
at half past nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are likely to finish after lunch not 
before lunch. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that - that is fine.  Then let us just start at 10 if 
we would finish anyway.  Okay, alright.  We - we are going to adjourn 
until tomorrow.  Tomorrow we will start at 10 o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 16 AUGUST 2019
