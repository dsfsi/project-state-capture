PROCEEDINGS ON 30 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good.  Let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there are a few housekeeping matters 
just to address and also an update to conclude in essence the evidence 
of yesterday before we move to the evidence of today.  If I may just be 
permitted to address you on that update? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair you will recall at the commencement 
which was many weeks ago of the aviation section of evidence.  When I 
introduced the topic of the North West ground handling transaction 
which Mr Natasen’s evidence yesterday completed at least in this 
evidence session.  I indicated that one of the concerns of the 
commission 
as 
it 
had 
been 
investigating 
the 
matter 
was 
its 
understanding that there had been a series of criminal complaints laid 
in relation to the matters that were investigated and presented 
beginning as early as 2016.  And the concern was why there had not 
20 
been movement in relation to those cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We indicated then Chair that we had taken 
steps to engage with the relevant authorities about that.  We have – we 
received an initial report to which I made reference at the outset. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 3 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the evidence.  That is a report there is no 
need to go there now but just to refresh our memories it was a report 
from the let me just have it here – the Lieutenant General National 
Head for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation colloquially 
known as the Hawks because the commission had engaged with the 
Hawks to say we are aware of these complaints the first of which laid in 
2016, the second of which laid in 2017, the third of which laid in 2018 
and we have seen no movement in relation to those cases.  They gave 
us a report of what steps had been taken in relation to the 
10 
engagements and it concluded on the basis that the investigation needs 
speedy conclusion.  Those were the notes of the report from Lieutenant 
General Lebeya.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What was it – what did the conclusion say? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That there should – the investigation needs 
speedy conclusion.  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Chair we – we interrogated the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because we wanted to understand precisely 
20 
what has happened since 2016 to 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes and why there had not been a speedy 
conclusion all along. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Until that point indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 4 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair that precipitated correspondence, further 
correspondence and seeking’s’ of clarity.  The report itself indicated 
certain bank statements had taken very long to be produced, had taken 
– had been requested again.  That there had been an attempt to 
consolidate the cases.  Chair the upshot that I report to you today is 
that none of the clarity that we have been – well attempted to be given 
has actually advanced the matter.  It raises more questions in fact than 
it answers.  And I raise that with you today Chair because it is our 
proposal that we continue to engage to try to understand why three and 
a half – well it is three years since the first complaint. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  These matters have not progressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Chair it is with a view in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Once we get to the bottom of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To make recommendations in our submissions 
to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About what you may consider in a report in due 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair our thinking there is if this can be 
explained by matters of incapacity. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 5 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well that is one thing and it may well influence 
the type of submissions we would make to you in relation to 
recommendations following from the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is also concern though that there may 
have been delays in this prosecution of the matter for other reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we have – we are in the process of 
engaging those matters with the Hawks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I – my request to you today is that we 
continue to probe the matter.  That we update you as and when we 
believe we have a full picture.  I would not be in a position today to 
give you a full picture because there is much that still needs to be 
interrogated but we would do so in advance of making any submissions 
to you Chair about what our proposed recommendations may be in 
relation to these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am disinclined to deal with it simply on the basis 
that whatever we may need to do may only be done at the time of 
20 
preparing the report. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certainly it would be important at that stage to know 
as much as possible about these types of delays, what causes them 
and so on.  But I think that we should seek to assist if we can in  
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 6 of 153 
 
1. Understanding why either nothing or very little has happened and  
2. Seeking to have the action that is required to be taken to be 
taken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we may have to consider – I think the first thing 
is to try and get as much information as possible as to where – what 
has been done and then one option might be to then bring this to the 
attention of the – the leadership of whatever and law enforcement 
agencies are involved whether it is the Hawks or the SAPS and maybe 
ask them to see to it that something is being done and maybe to 
10 
consider holding certain people accountable. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may well be that we should consider whether 
senior people should not come here and explain what has happened. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we do not need to – if we can avoid let the time 
that we have which is limited for the hearing of witnesses who would be 
telling us about various matters let some of it be taken by … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those matters but at the same time it may well be 
20 
that it might send the right message if people were to be called and to 
come and explain publicly what is happening.  Because if it is a 
question of incapacity, not having resources one would expect them to 
come – to be open with us and say look the reason why there has been 
no action is because we just have too few police officers or something 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 7 of 153 
 
like that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then give a full breakdown of what is there – 
what is available and so on.  But also one would want in that situation 
to understand what efforts have been made to bring that situation to the 
attention of senior authorities you know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say look we cannot carry out our functions in this 
area, in this community because we do not have enough resources and 
this is the situation or whether people just have not done anything. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe you could think along those lines and 
obviously whatever we do we have got to look at what power we have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we do not want to be accused of doing 
anything that does not fall within our powers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair that was just to conclude that 
aspect of the North West ground handling transaction for present 
20 
purposes.  If I may then move to today and one or two procedural 
aspects.  Chair there has been a request – Mr Mainganya who is going 
to be sworn in shortly is the Chief Risk Officer of the Industrial 
Development Corporation.  Some of the documents that the IDC has 
provided to the commission in their endeavours to assist with the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 8 of 153 
 
investigation are commercially sensitive.  There are two pages of a 
particular annexure that are commercially sensitive and which there has 
been a request that we ensure are redacted from the public record 
when the bundles of today go onto the website.  Chair the legal team 
has considered the two documents or the two pages of a document that 
appears in three places in the bundles after receiving the letter and we 
have no difficulty with the suggestion that they be redacted.  As a 
matter of fact I do not even intend to take Mr Mainganya to those 
documents today.  And so with your leave our proposal would be that 
that arrangement be made.  It is set out in a letter which those 
10 
documents will be and Chair I can just hand that up to you if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair you will see that it is a letter addressed 
by Cliff Decker Hofmeyr who are  the attorneys acting for Mr Mainganya 
today and the relevant documents in respect of which redaction is 
sought are set out from paragraph 4.1 on that page over to 4.3. Chair 
my suggestion is this morning I was able to identify those documents 
with the legal representatives as they appear on the paginated pages in 
the bundles.  And so my proposal is that if you are inclined to give the 
ruling you do so with reference to the documents referred to in the 
20 
letter and then we will simply ensure that the correct paginated pages 
of the record are redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I would like to have sight of the actual 
document. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 9 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair let me take you to that then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but in the meantime I will just read this letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no maybe even without looking at it I have just 
finished reading this letter.  Maybe what we can do is – maybe I can 
make the order with a rider. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I – the order could be revisited should it become 
necessary. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on just in case  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on it might appear that there is something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Particularly when I have not looked at a lot of things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So in that way then one can always relook at it 
and either withdraw the order or keep it as it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So is this identification of the relevant documents 
fine? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  The information contained in the 
documents identified in paragraphs 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the letter dated 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 10 of 153 
 
28 August 2019 from Cliff Decker Hofmeyr addressed to the secretariat 
of the commission will be included in the commission’s record only in a 
redacted – redacted form.  Is that adequate? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that adequate? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright thank you.  I think I must then say we 
will make that 1 and 2 will be the order in 1 above may be reconsidered 
at a later stage should circumstances dictate its reconsideration.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair we are indebted.  Chair the 
final procedural aspect is just to update you insofar as Rule 3.3 Notices 
in respect of Mr Mainanya’s evidence is concerned. Chair as you will 
see when we commence with Mr Mainganya’s evidence it comes in two 
parts.  There was an initial affidavit in respect of which a Rule 3.3 
Notice was issued to an implicated person.  Pursuant to that notice 
being issued we received an application for cross-examination from the 
implicated person but that was subsequently withdrawn.  There was 
then a further affidavit that was received from Mr Mainganya on 
20 
Wednesday of last week and it was a supplementary affidavit.  It has 
been placed in the folder that – in the bundle that we will come to.  In 
respect of that affidavit there were three further Rule 3.3 Notices that 
needed to be issued. They were issued on the Friday of last week first 
thing in the morning. That means implicated persons obtained a week’s 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 11 of 153 
 
notice of todays’ evidence.  There has been only one response to that 
and that was a response received yesterday from Mr Komane’s 
attorneys.  Chair that correspondence indicates and if I may just beg 
leave to hand it up to you Chair before I go to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair the way it has been put together is the 
covering email that you see there is actually the email that the 
commission sent in response to the letter that was received from Mr 
Komane’s attorneys.  Second in the documents that have been handed 
to you is Mr Komane’s lawyer’s letter.  The essence of it Chair as I 
10 
understand it is that Mr Komane places on record at paragraph 1 of the 
letter which you will find on the second page of it that he denies any 
involvement in the alleged payments that are described and we will 
come to that in Mr Mainganya’s evidence.  He goes on to raise concern 
that the allegation is based purely on hearsay evidence with no 
corroborating statements, affidavits or documents supporting the 
allegation and furthermore lacks merit and is conceived to be 
unsubstantiated and the concern is that it makes it impossible for their 
client to respond to it.  At paragraph 3 concerns are raised about the 
public interest in the commission and the prejudice to Mr Komane both 
20 
in private and his public capacity should the allegations be made public 
alternatively his client be associated with the allegations and then at 4 
they are concerned – they raised the concern that he has not been 
granted adequate time to respond to the notice and has not received all 
the necessary information to properly respond.  And if you go to the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 12 of 153 
 
last paragraph on that page it concludes on the basis of a request that 
Mr Komane be furnished with the founding affidavit of Mr Mainganya or 
any corroborating evidence that might exist in order for him to assess 
the merits and obtain the necessary further legal advice and assistance 
he is entitled to.  Chair the letter on its face did not make any claim in 
relation to the proceeding of Mr Mainganya’s evidence.  But out of 
caution yesterday evening a letter was sent that is the first letter in the 
pack to the representatives and it was made clear to Mr Komane’s 
representatives that it was the intention of the legal team to proceed 
with Mr Mainganya’s testimony.  You will see that at paragraph 3 of the 
10 
email.  It further went on to indicate that if Mr Komane intended to 
object to the commission proceeding to hear the evidence of Mr 
Mainganya that he was invited to send a legal representative to the 
commission to make such representations. And it continued in 
conclusion to say if no legal representatives appear to make such 
representations the commission will proceed with the evidence of Mr 
Mainganya and your client will be able to bring whatever application he 
intends to bring and to provide his version to the commission in due 
course.  Chair the other thing I can update you on which is not 
reflected in this email is of earlier this morning the other affidavit of Mr 
20 
Mainganya as well as an affidavit of Mr Rama which will be referred to 
in todays’ proceedings have been sent to Mr Komane in response to his 
request.  Chair I am not aware of any legal representative today for Mr 
Komane and so it is my proposal that we continue with the evidence 
and of course we are eager to receive any information from any 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 13 of 153 
 
persons related to the mandate of the commission and if in due course 
Mr Komane seeks to do so or makes an application to cross-examine 
any witness we will place that before you Chair for determination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and I see that on the last page of his letter – his 
attorneys letter it does emphasise that he intends to give his full 
cooperation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the inquiry and just once again does make the 
point that the lack of notice, lack of time and minimal admissible 
information against him is unfair and prejudicial.   
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that the important thing is that he knows that 
the witness will be giving evidence today and he has been advised that 
he could be here if he wishes to object.  And he is not here or his 
lawyers are not here.  And whatever prejudice may – he may suffer 
would – at least he will be given a chance to present whatever 
challenge he wishes to present.  So I think it is okay we can proceed 
and he must simply be given whatever it is he is entitled to from the 
commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he might not have been given yet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and if what we have given him in his 
view is inadequate and there are further documents that are relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He will certainly engage with us on that. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 14 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may then ask Mr Mainganya’s legal 
representative just to place herself on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before we proceed with the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Please come forward.   
ADV THABILE FURMAN:  Shall I walk up to here Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  There.  Switch that off and go there.   
ADV THABILE FURMAN: Thank you Chair.  My name is Thabile 
Furman. I am the RDC’s legal representative and therefore Mr 
10 
Mainganya’s legal representative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THABILE FURMAN:  I am from Cliff Decker Hofmeyr Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If I may request the witness 
be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let it be – ja.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Mark Phakamile Mainganya. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 15 of 153 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair and Mr Mainganya 
before I proceed with the questioning of Mr Mainganya with your leave 
Chair I would just like to place todays’ evidence in context because it 
has been some time since we heard the aviation evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it has been a long time. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in order for today’s evidence to make 
sense in the scheme of the evidence that was presented previously if I 
may just take a moment to locate it?  Chair one of the investigations 
that was presented in the aviation session related to jet fuel supply 
agreements that had been concluded between South African Express 
and South African Airways with a company called EML Energy.  You will 
recall we had the evidence of Ms Loock and Mr Vaughan.  Both of them 
dealt with this particular jet fuel supply engagements with their 
20 
respective state owned entities and EML.  Their evidence was that a jet 
fuel supply agreement had been entered into between South African 
Express and EML Energy in circumstances that did not follow 
procurement processes at a time when the fuel was already being 
supplied to SA Express by SAA. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 16 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so it – it on its face appeared to be a 
duplication of supply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was at a price 30% higher than the price that 
SA Express was receiving fuel from SAA and the further evidence of Ms 
Loock was that EML after it was awarded the contract for jet fuel supply 
ended up never being paid for jet fuel supply because all – the only 
performance that it rendered was in relation to refuelling and defueling 
of aircraft which was in a small proportion.  I think her evidence was 
10 
about R80 000 whereas the contract was for many many more 
thousands beyond that.  Chair that was the background of Mr Loock’s 
evidence from the South African Express airways side.  What Mr 
Vaughan gave us insight into was that actually prior to that South 
African Express airways contract there had been a decision of the 
board of SAA to set aside certain jet fuel transactions for certain 
identified parties?  There was a process that was run to try and bring 
what were referred to as black industrialists into the jet fuel supply 
sector and the consequence of that was that EML was one of three 
parties that were identified for that 20% set-aside of jet fuel.  As it so 
20 
happened on Mr Vaughan’s evidence despite them being short listed 
and recommended for appointment they were not actually appointed in 
the initial 2016 tender.  There was a later appointment of EML in 2018.  
So that is the context against which Mr Mainganya’s evidence is heard 
today and it might not be readily apparent why we would be hearing 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 17 of 153 
 
from a witness from the IDC in circumstances of jet fuel supply to SA 
Express but the reason for that and it will be traversed with Mr 
Mainganya in his evidence is that off the back of these contracts with 
SAA and SA Express a funding application was made by EML Energy to 
the IDC and it received funding and that funding transaction has been 
investigated and will be explored with Mr Mainganya today.  And so 
Chair with that background in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for that background. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may then commence with Mr Mainganya’s 
evidence? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Which one of the … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Files should – I should … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair first of all if we could just enter into the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
There 
are 
three 
files 
comprising 
Mr Mainganya’s evidence today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They are all in the DD13 range and they are 
20 
files DD13A, B and C.  If we can enter those into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only one of them has got his affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The rest are annexures? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct … 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 18 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
other 
documents. 
 
The 
file 
that 
has 
Mr Mainganya’s affidavit or statement will be EXHIBIT DD13A and then 
there are two other files.  They are lever arch files.  One will be marked 
EXHIBIT DD13B and that is the one whose first annexure is Annexure 
VDR 1 and the other lever arch file will be marked EXHIBIT DD13C and 
that is the one whose file document bears the logo of IDC and is dated 
30 January 2017 with the heading “New Application”.  That will be 
EXHIBIT DD13C. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we will spend most of today in DD13A 
which contains the affidavit - the first and second affidavit of 
Mr Mainganya but we will on occasion move to the other documents.  
Mr Mainganya so my suggestion to you if I may is to keep A readily 
available in front of you and then when it is necessary to go to Bundles 
B and C I will identify that. 
The second thing is just to ask that you put your microphone 
on and we find that if you bring it closer to you it sometimes amplifies a 
20 
bit better.  Thank you.  Mr Mainganya could you just for the record 
clarify for us what your position is at the IDC? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  My position is that of the Chief 
Risk Officer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and when did you join the IDC? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 19 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I joined the IDC in 2014, 
September. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and what are your qualifications? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I am a Chartered Accountant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and before joining the IDC in 2014 
what did your career involve? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Banking, risk management in 
banking and before that I was in Public Service as - as an auditor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we can then just pick up the first 
page of your affidavit and you will find that at page 1 of the Bundle 
10 
DD13A.  Mr Mainganya this is an affidavit as I have it that you deposed 
to previously as compared with a statement … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But just for completion sake can you confirm 
that this is your affidavit and that it is contents are true and correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if I can take you to your 
second affidavit that you provided to the Commission.  You will find that 
in the same bundle at page 32.1 - 3-2.1. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you just confirm for the record that 
that is the second affidavit that you provided to the Commission and 
that you confirm its contents as true and correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we can then just return to the

first page of your affidavit and that is at paginated page 1. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to pick it up at paragraph 3 there.  
You have already told us about when you joined the IDC but in that 
paragraph you go on to explain some of the committees that you serve 
on.  What are those? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So some of them are the Special 
Credit Committee, the Credit Committee and the Post Investment 
Committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicate also in that paragraph about a 
10 
reporting line to you from the Risk Management Department.  Can you 
explain to us how that works? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
So 
the 
risk 
management 
department reports to me.  It is a second line function.  So it is not 
directly involved in the transactions but it assesses them before the 
transactions are submitted to the committees. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just raise your voice a little higher if you can. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya what I would like to deal with 
next just for us to be able to navigate your evidence today and 
understand the IDCs processes is to have your assistance in describing 
to us how the processes of the IDC work when it receives an 
application for funding and Mr Mainganya I have been guided in that by 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 21 of 153 
 
an affidavit that was prepared by one of your former colleagues - 
Mr Rama - which had also been supplied to the Commission and for 
ease of reference that appears at page 38 of the same Bundle A. 
That is DD13A.  Can you confirm who Mr Rama is and 
whether he is known to you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Mr Rama was an employee of 
the IDC.  He - he was a - specifically involved in the Chemicals 
Business Unit assessing the deal maker. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  It may be that your voice is soft by nature. 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make another attempt to speak up a bit.  Thank you. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So Mr Rama was an employee of 
the IDC.  He was a deal maker in the Chemicals Business Unit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Mainganya.  That is much better I 
think. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we could continue in that frame for the 
20 
rest of your evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just from an audibility point of view.  If you go 
to the last page of that affidavit.  You will see it is the final page in the 
file in front of you - DD13A - and it is page 61.  Could you just indicate 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 22 of 153 
 
for the record the date on which this affidavit was deposed to? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  7 June 2019. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now what Mr Rama does in this 
affidavit is to describe the end to end application process in the IDC 
and so what I would like to propose to do with you is to go to that and 
then ask you to explain it to us but we will just use the pointers in his 
affidavit for that purpose and you will find that at page 3-9 - 39. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the second page of his affidavit and you 
will see a heading there “End to End Application Process”.  Do you see 
10 
that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So he begins with what happens by the 
Pre Investment Business Centre at paragraph 5.  Can you tell us about 
what that centre does when it receives an application? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So that centre would be the first 
recipient of applications from wherever they come from especially in - 
in Gauteng and then you have other applications that come from the 
regions but that centre in Gauteng essentially does a pre assessment 
of the transactions. 
20 
That is to - to check if among other things they - they are 
within the mandate of the IDC to fund and to do a preliminary basic 
assessment before they were forwarded to the business unit … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  For proper assessment. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 23 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And - and what happens if it - if an application 
proceeds past that Pre Investment Business Centre’s evaluation?  
Where does it go next? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it - it will go to the - the 
relevant department in which that unit falls.  So if it is chemicals it is 
sent to the Chemicals Business Unit.  Also they assess the assessment 
that has been done to determine if they can proceed to do a due 
diligence on that application. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there is reference to a person called a deal 
maker.  Who is that in the structures? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So a deal maker would be the 
persons that - that would be involved in the due diligence mainly in 
preparation of the transactions for submissions to the committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And could you tell us a bit about that due 
diligence process?  What does it involve? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the - I would say three 
distinct phases.  It involves getting different expertise from the various 
people in the unit.  So one person would for instance be marketing 
expertise.  One would be the technical expertise.  One would be the 
financial.  So - and then there are various other units that are involved 
20 
in the due diligence. 
So for example the - the Environmental Unit which goes on to 
check the environmental compliance of the client.  Then the other 
would be the Legal Department which will review the legal aspects of 
the transaction.  Then you also have the - the fixed assets valuation 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 24 of 153 
 
unit which would value the assets. 
So - so all those people will be assembled for a specific 
transaction and - and should it be assessed as readily passing for due 
diligence.  That is the team that will go to the client and do a due 
diligence on that client. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when the due diligence is complete what is 
the next phase of the process? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the next phase is that each - 
each member would - would compile his report and the deal maker 
would - and the team leader in that unit would be appointed and the 
10 
team leader would - would compile the assessment which is the 
submission now that should be serving at the committee from all the 
various members and that assessment - that submission report would 
then be sent to - to the Risk Management Department which would do 
an independent assessment of that submission and then they - they will 
raise various issues that they might have with the transaction and then 
there would be a to and from with the units where they - they try to 
address some of the risks that are raised by the risk management 
department and - and then post that if it is still proceeding meaning if 
adequate measures are included in the submission  to deal with some 
20 
of those risks. 
It may be ready for - for submission to the Credit 
Committees. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And are the Credit Committees the ultimate 
decision making bodies in relation to the application? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 25 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes depending on the amount 
that is requested it will go to various committees all the way up to 
board committees depending on the requested amount.  If it is 
approved by that committee that is a final decision. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can I just get one point of 
clarity.  You spoke about the team leader producing the submission 
report and then you spoke about that being evaluated by the risk 
management committee. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh, huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is there also a peer review that happens before 
10 
it goes to Risk Management? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So - so just - so that I can get it right 
the submission report … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is prepared? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then it is peer review - reviewed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh, huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes and - and the head of the 
unit must also sign off on the report … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
And 
the 
- 
the 
executive 
responsible must also sign off on that report depending on the level. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 26 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can I say just from the basis of 
what you have described now it sounds like a multistage process … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With various endeavours to ensure accuracy in 
the process.  Is that a fair description? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  We try to do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then after a decision to fund has 
been made there has been reference to a Post Investment Committee.  
How does that committee become involved? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay.  So - so after a decision 
is made it does happen sometimes that various amendment to the 
approved transactions are requested.  So that committee is mandated 
to - to deal with those amendments.  It is - it is composed of four 
executives which all the time one of them would be the executive in 
which the - the application comes from and so each member of that 
committee assesses the request.  It is not a committee that - that sits 
and discusses.  So the submission is sent electronically to each 
member and they assess the request and they either agree an approval 
or not of the requested change. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do they generally do so quite swiftly after 
the submission?  Is there a sort of timeframe on resolving the request? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  So - so the committee was 
formed specifically for that purpose. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 27 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That we may deal speedily with 
a requests that come from the client.  So - so - and hence it is - it is 
electronic. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It - it goes at the same time to - 
to all the members, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have a sort of sense of the average 
time?  Are we talking about days after receipt? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I - I do not have the average 
time but each member tries to process it as and when they receive it. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  When it becomes relevant I - I will 
seek clarity on the timing in relation to the specific decision that the 
Post Investment Committee made in this case. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we may then go to this particular application 
for funding and you will pick up how it originated in the IDC again in 
Mr Rama’s affidavit … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that would be at page 41 - 4-1 of Bundle 
DD13A and you will see at the first paragraph on that page paragraph 
20 
11 Mr Rama describes how he received the EML that is a reference to 
EML Energy Business Plan.  Could you read there what he records? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So he says: 
“I 
received 
the 
EML 
Business 
Plan 
from 
Mr Billy Cobbinah a senior account manager in the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 28 of 153 
 
Development Funds Department via an email of 
17 May 2016.  He introduced the application to me.  
The email trail within Mr Cobbinah’s email suggests 
that the email originated from Mr Edward Komane 
the 
Divisional 
Head 
Industrial 
Investment 
Facilitation Economy Department.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if we could go and take a look 
at that email.  You will now need to move to DD13B and it is right 
towards the beginning of that file. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Sorry. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if you go to the - DD13B.  It will be one of 
the other files next to you on your left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The page - 63 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  6-3.  Could you please describe for us the 
email that appears in the second half of that page?  Who it is from and 
who it is to? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it is from Edward Komane.  It 
is to Billy. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could you give the full name - Billy? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Billy Cobbinah. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just for the record Cobbinah is spelt C-O-
B-B-I-N-A-H and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 29 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Komane that is Edward Komane, K-O-M-A-
N-E.  Mr Mainganya on what date was that email sent? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  May, the 17 t h 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if you could just read for us 
what it says? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It says: 
“Hi Billy, as discussed on the phone now see 
attached and let me know if you need any additional 
information.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And signed off by? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Edward Komane. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who is Mr Billy Cobbinah? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Mr Billy Cobbinah is - was an 
employee of the IDC employed in the Development Funds Unit within 
the IDC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if you go to the top of that 
page there is an email between what I understand to be Mr Cobbinah 
and Mr Rama.  Can you tell us when that was sent? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That was sent on 17 May 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It appears to be shortly after the email that was 
20 
sent from Mr Komane to Mr Cobbinah.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does Mr Cobbinah say to Mr Rama? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  “Can you do this deal 
fast for a potential client?  I have asked for the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 30 of 153 
 
audited financial statements.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to get somethings correct.  You have got the IDC 
and then you have got divisions within it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is one of its divisions Industrial Investment 
Facilitation? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something else? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
That 
is 
where 
apparently 
10 
Ms Edward Komane works.  It is - it is the Economic Development 
Department … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  But it is not of the IDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that.  Repeat the last sentence.  It is not 
… 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is not a unit of the IDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So that is a - that is outside of …? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  No that is fine. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just for - for my own clarification purposes 
can we understand these emails to be a third party Mr Komane is sitting 
outside the IDC … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Forwarding something that he had discussed 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 31 of 153 
 
with Mr Cobbinah to him.  Is that as you understand the bottom email? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is what the email says yes 
Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the - the higher email is between two 
IDC employees as I understand it.  It is Mr Cobbinah the forwarding it 
to Mr Rama both of whom are IDC employees.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just repeat what Mr Cobbinah’s position was.  
10 
You - you did - I think you did say it earlier on. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
Yes 
Chairman. 
 
He 
was 
employed by the IDC in one of our units called Development Funds 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  You did not say what his position was?  Do 
you remember what his position was? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
I 
think 
it 
was 
a 
Senior 
Accountant Manager. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  I am sure we will get - find it 
as some stage. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If we can then just move 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 32 of 153 
 
ahead to the actual decision that was made in relation to this funding 
but before we leave the page that we are on.  I do just want to indicate 
Chair that Mr Komane’s email at the bottom refers to see attached 
document. 
If you go over to page 65 - 6-5 - you will that that is the 
attachment to the email and what I would like to just draw to the 
attention for the purposes of the record because it will become relevant 
later in the evidence of Mr Mainganya.  Is at page 71 - well - sorry.  Let 
us start at 65.  What is that document Mr Mainganya? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It says business plan 2016. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And whose business plan is it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  A the top it has got EML Energy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have - had you seen this document before? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we move in the business plan to paginated 
page 71 - 7-1 - you will see a heading there “Product and Services”.  
Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you read for us what EML Energy indicates 
there in the business plan are its products and services? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It says: 
“EML Energy is selling Jet A1 and other - and offer 
the 
following 
services: 
 
refuelling, 
defueling, 
calibration, storage, maintenance and repairs.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Can you just explain to us what - 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 33 of 153 
 
what would a business plan of this nature from a potential applicant for 
funding then - how would it be treated then by the IDC? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so remember I referred to 
the Pre Investment Business Centre.  So a business plan like this 
would have gone to - to that centre for evaluation before it goes to the 
business unit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who would be the person who did that 
evaluation in this case? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  You mean in any of the people 
you have mentioned so far? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  At - at the pre business centre 
… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It would have been none of 
these people so far. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  If we can then just jump ahead so that 
we orientate ourselves in time.  As I have it this email with the 
application and the plan comes through in May 2017.  There is a final 
decision to approve this funding on 6 February 2017.  So I would like to 
20 
jump ahead to that and then in the evidence we will go through the 
stages towards the decision but it is quite useful for us now to 
understand what the decision was if we may … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will find that decision in the same 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 34 of 153 
 
Bundle D that is DD13B at page 2-6-4.  Mr Mainganya as I understand 
it this is the minutes of the meeting at which the decision in relation to 
EML’s funding application was taken.  Is - is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just explain to us when that was. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  6 February 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you involved in this decision on that day? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I was not involved here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I - I can see down the page under the heading 
“Apologies”.  It appears you gave your apologies for not having been 
10 
present.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would you ordinarily be on the committee 
that was deciding this application? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But as it so happened you were not there on 
that day.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No, I was not there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if you go over the page to 
2-6-5 what is that? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  This is a funding request by 
EML. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is this what was decided by the committee in 
relation to the funding?  If you see under the heading 3.1 “EML 
Engineering and Construction (Pty) Ltd (“EML”)”.  It says: 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 35 of 153 
 
“The committee was requested to approve the 
following:” 
Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  I see that.  So - okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that what they did approve? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  This is what was requested.  
What was approved it is on the following page. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  The decision. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we could just take a bit of time 
10 
with sub paragraph 1 of 3.1 on page 2-6-5.  I would like to understand 
the two facilities in respect of which funding was sought.  Can you 
explain to us what the first facility was which you see under sub 
paragraph 1 on that page? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the facility was for working 
capital.  That was for six million that was requested to be funded under 
the MSEP program which the IDC manages. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will come back to explore what MSEP 
means. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
But 
for 
present 
purposes 
thank 
you 
Mr Mainganya and tell us what the terms of the loan was going to be. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It says: 
“The loan will be used to fund working capital and 
will have a term of 42 months, six months capital 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 36 of 153 
 
moratorium and sculptured payments as follows:  
instalment one to 12, 220 000; instalment 13 to 24, 
120 000; 
instalment 
25 
to 
36, 
160 000.  
Repayments will be in 35 instalments of 166 000 
and a final payment of 190 000.  Interest will be at 
four percent.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  so can I just clarify there I 
understand a term of 42 months - I had to do a quick calculation in 
advance of today’s evidence - is three and a half years.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And those payments that you see one to 12, 13 
to 24 and 25 to 36 are those monthly payments? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  These will be monthly 
payments. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when it says one to 12 that is month one to 
month 12.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Over the period and so the full period if you 
add the six month capital moratorium would be three years plus six 
months which is four years.  Is my understanding correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Which is 42 months.  Sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well 42 months is three and a half years.  Is 
the capital moratorium within the 40 …? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Within the 42 months. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Excellent.  So the full term of this loan is three 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 37 of 153 
 
and a half years.  The 42 months. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  The 42 months, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then tell us about the second 
piece of funding that was approved. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So that was: 
“A 6 500 000 plant and equipment subordinated 
loan facility to be used for the upgrade of plant and 
equipment and the purchase of bowsers.  The 
facility will have a term of five years and is 
expected to achieve a 13.8 percent real after tax 
10 
return.  Repayments will be in the form of cash 
sweeps from year 2021 to financial year 2024 
maintaining a minimum cash balance of one million 
with cash sweeps occurring every six months 
beginning 28 February 2018.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya can you just confirm for me what 
was the term of this plant and equipment loan? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Five years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then can you help me with 
something because I am - this was approved in 2017.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are in February 2017 as I recall it. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So a five term would take you to 2022.  Is that 
correct? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 38 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So help me with the last sentence there then, 
it says, 
 
“Repayment will be in the form of cash sweeps from financial 
 
year 2021 to 2024 maintaining a minimum cash balance of 
 
R1million”, 
 
Isn’t 2024 beyond the term of the loan facility? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So the term of the loan facility 
would start from 2021 in terms of repayments.  It will start from 2021, 
2022, 2023, 2024 so it doesn’t start from February 2017, the 
10 
repayments thereof, only start from 2021. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    We’ll look at that, is that your clear 
understanding of how it works? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes so from the date of 
approval until 2021 there are no cash sweeps. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But there are repayments preceding that, is 
that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So repayments would only 
occur if there’s cash but contractually the client is obliged to start 
repaying fro 2021. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Okay we’ll need to explore that a bit further 
when we go to the cash flow statements that were prepared by the 
finance department, because the understanding you’ve given now does 
not accord with my understanding of that schedule but you may be able 
to clarify for us but as you understand it here, it’s a five year loan for 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 39 of 153 
 
planting equipment and that is a loan that they receive the cash for in 
February – well at a point in 2017, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And as you understand it did they only have a 
repayment obligation that began in 2021? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Okay thank you and then over the page at 266 
can you assist me there, is it your understanding that those two loans 
were then approved? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes that’s correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And just deal with paragraph 3 at the top of 
that page, if you will, there was another facility sought and approved, 
what was that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So it’s a guarantee facility of 
R62million to Total South Africa and R3million to Engen Africa for jet A-
1 relating to the SAA contract, the facility will have a term of 12 
months. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, Mr Mainganya I’d then like to go 
back to the topic of MCEP and for that purpose I’d like to move to page 
2 of your affidavit.  Now you’ll recall your affidavit is in DD13A.  Mr 
20 
Mainganya at page 2 of your affidavit you’ll see half way down there’s a 
heading 4.1 in bold, “Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement 
Programme 
Qualifying 
Criteria”. 
 
Is 
Manufacturing 
Competitive 
Enhancement Programme abbreviated as MCEP? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 40 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And please tell us what that is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one sec, I haven’t got to the right page, 
what’s the right page on his affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    His affidavit page 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 2 okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Apologies Chair.  So we’re midway down the 
page and we’re dealing with the heading in bold there, “Manufacturing 
Competitiveness Enhancement Programme”.  What is that programme 
Mr Mainganya? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So MCEP is the programme of 
10 
the Department of Trade and Industry for which some of it’s funds are 
managed by the IDC, the IDC’s Development Funds Department is a 
custodian of the MCEP programme within the IDC and it assesses 
applications for funding from the MCEP programme prior to these 
applications being submitted to the various IDC Committees for 
approval.  I’m informed that MCEP is aimed at assisting, manufacturing 
of value adding companies that need funding for working capital or 
companies with at least 51% BEE shareholding that need capital 
equipment.  MCEP is priced at a rate of 4% fixed for four years for 
working capital and seven years for capital equipment among other 
20 
criteria.  MCEP is not available for start up companies, MCEP is only 
applicable to manufacturers under standard industry classification code 
3…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    M Mainganya do you mind if we just stop 
there for a moment, I’d just like to get a little bit more clarity in relation 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 41 of 153 
 
to the working capital loan that was approved for EML Energy that we 
just looked at.  Did I understand you correctly to say it was approved 
under this MCEP programme, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And if we can just pause at that 4% fixed 
interest rate, is that a preferential rate? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   It is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    What would the ordinary rate be if you didn’t 
qualify for MCEP funding? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So this client was priced at 
10 
prime plus three. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right and that was the interest rate on the 
planting equipment loan was it not? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct – no, no it was 
4% but if there was no MCEP it would have been prime plus three. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No I was talking about the planting equipment 
loan, the second loan was priced – the subordinated loan at prime plus 
3% wasn’t it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   No it was not it was priced at 
13.8%. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right what was that prime plus what at the 
time? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   No this is a different – this is a 
real after tax return it’s not linked to prime. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Oh I see so where is the prime plus 3%, 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 42 of 153 
 
where does that come from? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So for every facility whether it 
qualifies for MCEP or not, we calculate what the IDC pricing would 
have been had it not qualified.  So for this client it would have been 
prime plus 3%. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, so at the time, 2017, do you recall 
what prime was? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   No I don’t Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If I said to you it was around 10% would that 
sound right? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:     So it’s in the schedule that we 
[indistinct] yes Chair, around 10%. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you so that means you’re comparing a 
difference of about – of 4% with 13% correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, then if we can go on because you 
were going to deal with the criteria, so as I understand your evidence 
MCEP is something that you must qualify for to get this preferential 
rate is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then there are qualifying criteria, is that 
right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And the first of those you indicated at the 
bottom of page two what is that? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 43 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   It says, 
 
“Only applicable to manufacturers under standard industry 
 
code classification code 3”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you can I ask you what your 
understanding of standard industrial classification code 3 is? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So the MCEP programme has 
various codes, so this should actually be level 3, so level 3 will have 
many sub-categories under it according – classifying it industry 
according to where it comes from, if it’s under 3 there will be various 
industries falling under 3. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So just – what is a standard industrial 
classification code, where does that come from? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   I stand under correction but I 
think this is a universally used industry classification code. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If I could take you to – in that same bundle 
page 37.1 you’ll find it just before Mr Rama’s affidavit commences, this 
is a SARS document reflecting standard industrial classification codes, 
is that what MCEP is referring to when it talks about standard industrial 
classification codes? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   I think so, but MCEP has its 
20 
own codes, has its own classification which are not grouped according 
to this one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Do you know that as a fact? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes I’ve got them here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Oh we haven’t seen those so maybe what you 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 44 of 153 
 
would need to do is assist us over the tea break to make those 
available to us. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    What then, until today we had understood 
these to be the standard industrial classification codes the ones that 
you see at 37.1, what is code 3 under the standard industrial 
classification code that you understand to be the MCEP code? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So the one I’ve got here, it 
says the DTI, SIC codes Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement 
programme MCEP, then it lists standard industry code level 3 and then 
10 
under level 3 it lists various industries starting from 301 all the way to 
395. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Mainganya I have not seen that before so I 
would like to take a look at it over the break and then we can come 
back to this point if we may in your evidence. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If we go over to page three where you were at 
the top bullet of your affidavit, you give the other qualifying 
requirements which are not pertinent for our purposes but at b) you tell 
us that the EML application was pre-assessed to have met the MCEP 
20 
requirements, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Who did that assessment? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   It was done by Mr Billy Cobina. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what was he – what was the basis he gave 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 45 of 153 
 
for identifying it as having qualified for MCEP funding?  
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So in paragraph c) I say, 
 
“Subsequent to my meeting with the Commission’s legal team 
 
above and for purposes of preparing this affidavit, I received – 
 
I interviewed the IDC’s Mr Billy Cobina who pre-assessed the 
 
EML transaction to determine whether it qualifies for MCEP.  
 
He 
indicated 
that 
he 
approved 
and 
recommended 
the 
 
transaction for MCEP on the understanding that EML will, as 
 
part of it’s operations, be involved in blending and value 
 
adding on some of it’s products”. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I don’t want to jump to 2018 yet if 
we may that’s why I’ve stopped you there because I just want to stay 
faithful to the chronology at this point.  This fact that it had been 
qualified for MCEP funding was referred to in the submission that was 
made to the Committee that took its decision on the 6 t h of February 
2017 and so I’d like to take you to that document so that we could 
explore it a bit if we may.  You’ll find it in DD13C, so it’s one of the 
files on your left-hand side and we’re looking there at page 554 which 
is right at the beginning, what is that document Mr Mainganya? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So this is a submission to the 
20 
special Treasury Committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Is that the Committee that made the decision 
on the 6 t h of February? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Thanks correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And in the scheme of the processes of the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 46 of 153 
 
IDC what is this document? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So this document is a basis on 
which funding decision is made it contains the requirement of the 
client, it tells what facilities are required, it describes the business, 
what it’s going to do, it describes the industry, it summarises the due 
diligence that was done and based on that it recommends to the 
Committee that the facilities be approved. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, I’d like to pick up a few aspects of 
this submission because they will be relevant to the further evidence 
that that you give and it could then ask you to go to page 557 in that 
10 
document.  The third paragraph on that page deals with the fuel farm 
that EML Energy had, can you tell us about that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So it was indicated in the 
submission that Denel had donated a fuel farm to the client, that is the 
premises on which the client was conducting its business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you and in this paragraph the compiles 
of this submission are dealing with the valuation that was given to that 
fuel farm, can you tell us about what is recorded there? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So it says, 
 
“EML had later revalued their assets using an independent 
20 
 
valuer to [indistinct] R14.3million, however the assets were 
 
valued by the IDC’s evaluations department at R7.4million”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you we’ll pick that up later but just so 
that I can understand does that mean EML in its books had given it a 
particular value but when the IDC did its due diligence it gave it a 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 47 of 153 
 
different value – a lower value? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you. If we then go to 559 the second 
paragraph there talks about the tender that EML had been involved in 
to supply jet fuel to SAA, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And what is recorded in that second 
paragraph about that tender? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   “It has been established that 
 
there are three finalists for the tender, the budgets have been 
10 
 
set-up in a manner where it has been assumed that EML will 
 
be awarded a third of the full tender as per discussions with 
 
SAA to remain prudent within the budget as the allocation of 
 
the tender has not yet been provided should a larger amount of 
 
the tender be awarded this will increase sales and nett profit 
 
further”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair I note that we have just gone 
past quarter past, it may be an appropriate time to take the break.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let’s take the break but we’ll take a rather longer 
tea break today let’s resume at quarter to twelve, I just need to attend 
20 
to something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair well it will also facilitate us 
looking at the document, thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 48 of 153 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mainganya we were on 
page 559 of bundle DD13c when we broke for the break.  And I was 
asking there about the second paragraph on that page where it is 
recorded that in the submission to the credit – the committee that was 
deciding this application that it had been established that there are 
three finalists for the tender. That is a reference to the SAA tender, is 
that correct? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what is your understanding of what 
else is recorded there about the stage in that tender that EML was at at 
the time that this funding decision was taken? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Sorry the question is? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The submission indicates that the tender 
process had not yet been finalised, is that your understanding of it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does it indicate was the stage of the 
tender process that had been achieved by the time this submission was 
20 
made? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the tender had not been 
approved at that stage it was still adjudication. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed but it does go on to say the budgets 
have been set up in a manner where it has been assumed that EML will 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 49 of 153 
 
be awarded a third of the full tender as per discussions with SAA.  Let 
us just stop there.  If a tender process had not been completed how 
could it be that any reliance was going to be placed on what volumes 
EML would be awarded? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So in the submission the team 
says they in doing their marketing due diligence they interviewed SAA 
and SAA at that stage informed them three bidders had been short 
listed and one of them was EML.  And they also informed them that 
maybe the allocation would be equally among the three.  So the team 
had to make assumptions in doing their financial model therefore they 
10 
took the 20% of litres that was earmarked for BBBE suppliers and 
divided it equally among the three short listed bidders  S&S Dimension 
to do the financial model.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that a customary approach for the IDC that it 
would assess an application prior to the tender in fact being awarded? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes sometimes it does happen 
that when a client comes it is still bidding but the tender requirements 
for example would be such that when it is awarded it need to buy 
certain equipment.  Therefore clients would come to us and say I have 
bid for this thing the requirements that I will need working capital.  The 
20 
requirements that I will need to prove that I have financial means to 
buy in this case the jet fuel from the suppliers.  Therefore we would 
adjudicate that but as a condition of our approval would be that the 
disbursements or the facilities can only be done once confirmation of 
the tender has been awarded so it does happen. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 50 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just in terms of how you assess the 
viability of the application is it customary to rely on representations 
from a state owned entity about how much is going to be allocated to a 
particular bidder? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So in conducting the marketing 
due diligence the team indicates that it wanted to verify the assertions 
that the client had made.  So the client had said I have put a bid for 
this tender at SAA therefore as part of DD the client wanted to verify 
that and ascertain the fuel requirements from SAA and ascertain what 
the client was saying with regards to the allocation for BEE suppliers. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Please just try what you tried earlier on 
when we could hear you quite well. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just try that again. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but it is fine you can continue you do not have 
to go back to the answer you have given. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mainganya do you know 
20 
who your – well the due diligence team of the IDC dealt with at SAA on 
this question? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So in Vimal’s affidavit he does 
indicate I just cannot recall the name now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it was Mr Soqwezele. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 51 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is – does that ring a bell? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes it does ring a bell ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you know what position he held in SAA? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does – is it any cause for concern for you that 
reliance was being placed on a particular allocation of the 20% to EML 
in circumstances where the approval processes within SAA had not yet 
been completed? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes in our risk report we did 
10 
raise that risk that there is a risk that this tender might not be 
approved.  So it was a concern. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well I am interested in a slightly different thing.  
I know that you identified a risk and you also identified a risk in 
relation to how long the tender was going to be awarded for but this is 
a slightly different thing.  This is the IDC going to a person within SAA 
and saying how much is this tenderer going to be awarded so that we 
can do our cash flow forecasts on the business.  Is that customary? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So what is customary is to verify 
the assertions made by the client.  I do not know to what extent in this 
20 
case the client revealed the tender processes.  So in his affidavit he 
indicates that before the client could talk it was required that a non-
disclosure agreement be signed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry who is he? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Vimal. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 52 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Rama? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Mr Rama that a non-
disclosure agreement be signed so that confidential information 
regarding this process may not be disclosed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that was a non-disclosure agreement 
between SAA and IDC? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because certainly the client could not know 
10 
anything about that process, could it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you go – well there you – submission 
goes on in the last sentence on page 559 to say: 
“Should a larger amount of the tender be awarded 
this will increase sales and nett profit further.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That means it would be better for EML rather 
than worse, correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could it not also be that a smaller amount of 
the tender could be awarded/ 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It could. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But that is not reflected here is it? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 53 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we can then go to page 564.  When the 
decision to approve the funding was made on the 6 February 2017 there 
were certain conditions precedent that applied to that funding, is that 
correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the one I am interested in we can pick up 
at the bottom of page 564. Can you tell us what those conditions 
precedent relate to in the last block of that page? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So condition number 1 … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well before we get there what are they 
conditions precedent for?  
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the underlined second line. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay so you would remember 
three facilities were approved which is the working capital facility, the 
subordinated loan facility for equipment and the guarantees.  So these 
conditions for the loan for the subordinated loan and for the guarantee.  
So there are conditions precedent for all the facilities that were 
approved. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And if we could just focus on the 
second one.   
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the second one says there 
must be a signed offtake agreement between EML Engineers and 
Construction and South African Airways with the terms to IDC 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 54 of 153 
 
satisfaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you understand that was put in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I thought – I thought I understood where 
you were.  I thought it was the last block at page 564. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair we were at point 2 in that last 
block. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And that related to the requirement 
that there be a signed offtake agreement between EML and SAA with 
terms to the IDC’s satisfaction?  And MR Mainganye I was just asking 
10 
you what is your understanding for why that was included? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is because it is a key basis on 
which the funding application was made. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What – what risk is sought to be protected 
there for the IDC? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it is the risk you have just 
raised that it may happen that the client is awarded fewer litres than 
the one that are modelled which would mean based on those litres the 
client cannot afford to repay the facilities.  So IDC needed to be happy 
with the allocation that the client had got before it could proceed with 
20 
the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is it fair to say whatever terms were arrived 
at were important for the IDC to interrogate? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then if we can go over to page 570 and this is 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 55 of 153 
 
the point – this is the document that reflects the point that you made 
earlier about the risk committee having identified a concern in relation 
to the tender.  Just to help us remind us in the processes when does 
this risk committee get involved? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No, no remember I indicated 
that when the submission has been compiled by the business unit it is 
then sent to the risk department to assess the application.  Then the 
risk department writes a report of that assessment and it attaches to 
the submission to the credit committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So this is the risk report 
produced by [indistinct]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Mainganya that is exactly as I 
understood it and I am indebted to your explanation for it.  So the 
committee that is deciding whether to approve this funding is not only 
getting the submission prepared by the leader of the particular unit 
where the analysis has been done but they also are getting the risk 
department’s appraisal of that submission, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we could then look at the first heading 
20 
on that page which is entitled Material Risk Considerations and it is the 
second bullet there that I am interested in which is highlighted as the 
material risk. What was that risk? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the risk says the tender was 
issued for a period of three years however based on discussions with 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 56 of 153 
 
SAA the tender may be extended for five years.  The risk remains that 
the tender may not be awarded for five years resulting in a mismatch 
between the IDC loan tender and the awarded tender.  Furthermore 
should the tender be awarded for five years it may expose the IDC to 
financial loss as the tender may be challenged by any other bidder and 
could be rendered unenforceable in terms of the PFMA.  This will 
expose the IDC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just pause there?  Are we to 
understand from that that the assessment of the contract that was used 
– should it have eventuated that was used to assess the financial 
10 
viability of EML as a recipient of this funding was based on a five year 
contract from SAA? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is despite the fact that it was known to 
the IDC that the tender had only been advertised for three years, is 
that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Again my concern is a similar one to the 
previous one.  Why would the IDC be comfortable in assessing the 
financial viability on the basis of a term for the contract that had not 
20 
been the advertised term? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay so – so at this stage when 
the decision is made it is not known how many litres a client has got 
and the allocation. So – so the modelling is based on a five year period 
since the facilities are five years but the tender is for three years so 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 57 of 153 
 
when the tender is eventually awarded it will then have the exact 
allocation of – of the litres that are given to the client and based on 
that allocation then the IDC would determine if it proceeds with the 
facility or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But why model on five years when to the 
knowledge of the IDC the tender was only for three years? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So – so remember the – the 
main facilities that are granted for – for purchase of fuel is the 
guarantee.  So – so that one is modelled for twelve months.  It is a 
short term facility.  Then there are two other facilities.  One is for 
10 
working capital, one is for equipment.  Now what is normal is the 
equipment you would model it along the lifetime of the – of the 
equipment because those facilities are secured by the underlying 
assets.  So those are the [indistinct] that were taken into account in 
doing that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the working capital loan? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  The working capital loan was for 
four years.  So in the submission the team indicates that should their 
client allocation be for three years the remaining facility at that point in 
time would be minimal therefore the IDC took a view on risk on that – 
20 
that remaining facilities could be serviced by other revenues other than 
the SAA contract.  Because the client was already trading. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where is that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something he could check over lunch? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Possibly.  Let us do that Chair. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 58 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I raised it Mr Mainganya because I have not 
found that in these documents. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay I will get it – I will give it 
to you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would be useful if you could check that for 
us. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Assuming that it is not there thought would it 
not be more prudent to model for the purposes of financial viability 
10 
assessment on the basis of the known tender period. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes ideally we should merge the 
funding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we can go over to 571.  You will see 
at the bottom there there is a heading Pricing, do you see that?  
Apologies 571. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So there is a heading at the bottom pricing, do 
20 
you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just read for us the first bullet there? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   
So working capital loan client qualifies under EMSEP alternate pricing 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 59 of 153 
 
equal prime plus 3 using decisions [indistinct]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and that is a recordal of your earlier 
testimony as I had it.  You said if they had not qualified under EMSEP 
then the alternative pricing would have been prime plus 3 correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This indication that the client qualifies under 
EMSEP, do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know if anywhere else in this 
submission it was indicated to the decision making committee the basis 
10 
on which it had been determined that EML Energy would qualify under 
EMSEP? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No I can only think of reference 
to value adding part. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And is your recollection that that may 
be somewhere in this submission? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand mr Mainganya from your affidavit 
that and we looked at it just before we went to this document that when 
you went to Mr Kobena after your engagements with the commission 
20 
and you asked him why he had qualified EML for EMSEP funding he 
told you and I am quoting here from page 3 you do not have to go there 
for present purposes but as I read it here he said to you. 
“He approved and recommended the transaction for 
EMSEP on the understanding that EML will as part of 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 60 of 153 
 
its operations be involved in blending and value 
adding on some of its product.” 
Is that what he told you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I tell you that I have read this submission 
very closely it does not mean that I do so always without error but I 
read it very closely and I have not found any reference to blending or 
value adding in it, would that surprise you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It would not but there was 
reference to value adding. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could you take me to that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay.  Can I refer to [indistinct 
– not speaking into microphone] 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed certainly.  If we can do it quickly then 
maybe we do so now otherwise Chair with your leave we can maybe 
pick these two aspects up after the break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just so that we do not delay ourselves too 
20 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya should we leave it for the break? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would that be preferable. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 61 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But just so I can understand where we are.  
You agree with me that there is no reference to blending anywhere? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you do recall a reference to value add. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will find that for me? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you so much.  We now should go to the 
document that you made available to the commission over the break.  
10 
Chair we have managed to make a copy for yourself.  If I may beg leave 
to hand that up? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair it is a copy that Mr Mainganya had with 
him and so it does have some handwritten annotations of his.  He is 
happy for us to work off this document now notwithstanding those 
annotations but he is going to provide us with a clean copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For when it goes into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair my suggestion is that we slot it in after 
the codes that we had thought were applicable and that would mean 
paginating it at page 37.3.  If that is suitable?  Otherwise we could give 
it a different exhibit number I am in your hands on that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us make it 37.3 if you think that will – that should 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 62 of 153 
 
work? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it will because then it comes in the right 
place in the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes in the right place ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we can just work with it separately now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will replace the clean copy in your bundle 
as well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Mainganya I understand your evidence 
10 
earlier to be this is the applicable set of standard industrial codes that 
applies to EMSEP, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indebted to you for pointing that out to 
us this morning.  Tell me which of those codes it was determined 
applied to EML? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It does not say but the only one 
I could see that refers to petroleum is code 332 petroleum and 
synthesises. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we go down there is a column the third 
20 
column is SIC code and then we read the first one of those is 0301.  If 
we move down to 0332 is that the one you referring to? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The one you have ringed actually in pen? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes, yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 63 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that what you understand Mr Kobena 
determined or is that you looking at the code and working out what it 
might have been? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is me looking at the codes.  
Because – so if you look at that codes 332 it also has sub-codes 
between under it which I have indicated there but the submission and 
he did not indicate which of those particular codes applied to this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But EML was neither a refinery nor a 
synthesiser was it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No it does not say so on the 
10 
application. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So why would you identify that as the 
applicable one? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Because the sub-codes talk to 
the crude petroleum. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I beg your pardon? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  The sub-codes that I have 
referred to talk to crude petroleum. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Crude petroleum? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay could you get us those sub-codes over 
the break? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Right subsequent to you 
interrogating this pre-assessment. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 64 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the EML funding qualifying for EMSEP with 
Mr Kobena you then I understand and that is if we go back to page 3 of 
your affidavit at paragraph C on that page. Chair that is DD13a.  We 
are back in the smaller file.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes page 3 you say? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I would actually like to pick it up at D on 
that page.  You say at D there  
10 
“Mr Kobena subsequently informed me on the 23 r d 
May 
this 
year 
that 
the 
DTI 
in 
an 
email 
correspondence dated 3 May 2018 had confirmed 
that fuel storage and blending is not covered by the 
EMSEP program.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was EML ever doing anything other than fuel 
storage to your knowledge? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in May 2018 if I read this and correct me if 
my understanding is incorrect.  In May 2018 the DTI confirmed that 
EML would not have qualified for EMSEP funding, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So in my supplementary affidavit 
this is a point that I am referring to. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 65 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go there. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will find that at page 32.1 in the same 
bundle.  32.1.  That is the commencement of your supplementary 
affidavit. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya and then if you go over the page 
to 32.2 that is where in paragraph 5 you deal with EMSEP is that 
10 
correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you want to tell us about that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So I wanted to clarify that – that 
confirmation from the DTI was referring to a different transaction.  
Because the IDC was considering a different transaction and it 
requested confirmation from EMSEP – from DTI whether that would 
apply.  So the response in that email was confirming that it would not 
apply. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I understand that but if the DTI admittedly 
20 
in relation to a different funding application in May of 2018 said fuel 
storage does not qualify for EMSEP that would I assume apply to any 
application for funding based on fuel storage, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And EML was never doing anything other than 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 66 of 153 
 
fuel storage, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would not have qualified when it was pre-
assessed by Mr Kobena? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry just say that correctly. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes I agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Thank you.  I would then like to 
move if we may back to your affidavit and just to conclude the question 
of EMSEP is it fair then to say that the committee relied entirely on Mr 
10 
Kobena’s pre-assessment that this funding application qualified at least 
on the working capital loan for the preferential EMSEP rate? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes he is the one who did the 
assessment.  Usually the team would also motivate during the meeting 
as to why it deems it qualifying. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did they do that to your knowledge? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I cannot confirm I was not there.  
I do not know anything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed you were not present were you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you done anything to investigate whether 
there were justifications given or whether the committee just relied on 
that sentence that we read at page 571 – you do not need to go back 
there.  But the sentence just stipulated client qualifies under EMSEP.   
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I cannot confirm if there 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 67 of 153 
 
discussions on that or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move to page 4 
I think that is where we were and look at the engagements with South 
African Express.  We have traversed this a bit already in your evidence 
because we were dealing when we looked at the submission that went 
to the committee.  With some of what I am going to suggest are curious 
features … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the way in which the SAA tender was 
approached by the IDC and you will recall the issues we traversed 
10 
there was taking a funding decision despite the fact that the tender had 
not been approved. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have given your comment on that. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then deciding to run a financial viability 
model on a five year contract in circumstances where the tender was 
only for three years.  Is there any other aspect of the engagements 
between the IDC and SAA that you would like to comment on? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Not at this stage. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Well then we can go over to page 5 
because there we deal with the financial viability assessment … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was made of the EML application and you 
will pick that up under the heading of 4.3 in bold on that page.  For this 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 68 of 153 
 
purpose Mr Mainganya we are going to need to look at the cash flow 
model that was produced by the relevant team insofar as it was 
submitted to the committee. 
Now it is in the Bundle C Chair but what I have done for 
today’s purposes is just provided us with bigger copies because there 
are lots of numbers on the page and it is just easier to see.  So if I may 
beg leave to hand it up.  Chair this is a duplicate of the page in the 
bundle and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My suggestion is just for today’s convenience 
10 
we work on the A3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am handing up two pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The idea is that we work with them together if 
we can.  They come from different parts of the bundle.  So just for 
record purposes the one page is paginated MPM 5-7-6.  That is actually 
the one we need to start with and it appears in DD13C and then the 
second one I want to work with Mr Mainganya appears in your affidavit.  
Well it is an annexure to your affidavit … 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is paginated MPM 21 and that is in 
DD13A but for ease we will work on - I understand you have also been 
given a larger copy Mr Mainganya and your legal representatives as 
well.  I will work on my smaller copies because we seem only to have 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 69 of 153 
 
received three.  Mr Mainganya the document at 5-7-6 what is that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So during the discussions with 
the legal team it - it was identified that there was an error in the cash 
flow. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, before we get to the error.  Can we start 
with 5-7-6? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry and I should have said to you 5-7-6- is 
the cash flow statement that appeared in the submission  
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja, ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was approved in February 2017. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So I just want to know what this 
document is.  Right. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay.  So these are the cash 
flow projections derived from the financial model.  They are used to 
determine the repayment - the ability to repay the facility. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just in layman’s speak I assume the people 
in your Finance Department will look at the application for funding. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How much is sought? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 70 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Will look at the position of the business. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Its cash flow and will determine whether on the 
terms for the loan that are being proposed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The loan will be serviced.  It will be - the 
company will be in a position to pay it back.  Is that a fair summary? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So if we can just look at this page 
10 
because for those of us that do not work with these spreadsheets often.  
It sometimes requires a little bit of deciphering.  First of all just read 
for us the heading of the document. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So 5-7-6 its “EML Energy 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statements for the Year Ending 28 February”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then below that there is an 
underlined Rand denomination with an apostrophe and three zeros.  
Can you explain to us what that means? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Thousands. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And let me just ask you here I understand that 
20 
to signify that when we look at the table … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  We have got a whole lot of numbers 
there.  Those are - those are other than where it is a date indicated.  
Those are Rands.  Is that correct? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 71 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is - it is money being signified - funds? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right, but often those numbers do not exceed 
five digits.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So does the R’000 mean we must add three 
zeros to any numbers that we see in this table? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So just to help us if take that first 
10 
column audit and it is headed “February 2015”.  Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a number in brackets there - (47).  Do 
you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is not R47,00.  Is it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No.  That is 47 000. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  47 000. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So every number in this table we must 
20 
add three digits to. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In a sense multiplied by 1 000.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Right.  Then I would like to know under 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 72 of 153 
 
the heading “Senior Debt” do you see that halfway down on the left 
hand side? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is that describing? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is a working capital facility 
that was approved.  The six million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So just to remind ourselves three was 
an approval on 6 February 2017 for a working capital loan of R6 million 
at four percent interest.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay and then just help me if we move across 
from that “Senior Debt” and follow it through the columns.  If you go to 
July 2017’s column.  Chair that is about four - five along from the left 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you follow it down to where it is in line with 
“Senior Debt”.  There is a R6 000 there.  Do you see that?  Well there 
is a 6 000.  We have to multiply it by 1 000. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it - it signifies six million.  Correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that showing us the six million that would 
have been made available through the loan facility to EML? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why is it shown as coming into the cash 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 73 of 153 
 
flow position of the business in July 2017? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So that - that is a peak period.  
It is a period when the full facilities would have been disbursed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so it is coming earlier but it 
reaches six million in 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In July 2017? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right, because the approval was in February.  
So as I understand this it is anticipating that by what you call the peak 
10 
the full facilities … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Will have been made available and that is why 
we have six million there.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then help me.  The next line under that - still 
under “Senior Debt” says proposed IDC loan repayments.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we follow that across that line 
starts in February 2019 with an amount of 2.640 million.  Is that right? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So those are the repayments. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the loan of six million … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Of the loan (intervenes). 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 74 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was extended in … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  By July 2017. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct; and if we track that along - please 
correct me if I am understanding it incorrectly but there is a repayment 
of about 2.6 million in February 2019.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a next repayment in February 2020 of 
1.4 million or thereabout … 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there is a repayment in February 2021 
of about 1.9 million.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that insofar as capital of the loan is 
concerned is repaid by February 2021.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we could then go to the next line.  What is 
that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So that is the interest.  So the 
20 
first line was just showing the capital.  Now there is a - the four percent 
interest. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So those start to be repaid from what I 
can understand here in July 2017.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 75 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you track those numbers through and 
if I am understanding this correctly by February 2022 that is when the 
last interest payment of 38 000 is made.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So just so that we are on the same 
page.  The working capital facility of six million according to this cash 
flow statement was going to have been fully repaid capital and interest 
by February 2022.  Is that right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  February 2022 … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that 38 (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  38 000 ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the final payment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand Mr Mainganya’s evidence on 
this facility and it would be towards the interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So am I right Mr Mainganya that the repayment 
takes place and is concluded by February 2022? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us move to the second facility 
that was available.  That is under the heading “Mezzanine Debt”.  Is 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 76 of 153 
 
that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what does that signify - the “Mezzanine 
Debt”?  Which loan was that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That was a 6.5 million facility for 
equipment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the interest rate on that was? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is the 13.8 percent real after 
tax return. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and again I understand this cash 
10 
flow statement to work in the same way in this line as we did with 
“Senior Debt” but please just check me if I am incorrect. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we take July 2017 again because that is 
always the peak when the full funds will have been extended you see 
an amount of 6.5 million there.  Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does that signify? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Again it signifies that it is fully 
disbursed at that time. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So by July 2017 EML has received 6.5 million 
for the plant and equipment loan.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go down the line again what this 
is reflecting on my understanding is the repayments of that loan.  
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 77 of 153 
 
Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So they start in February 2019.  Is that 
right - with an amount of 2.1 million? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a second payment in February 2020 of 
2.1 million? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there is a third payment in February 2021 
of 2.1 million/ 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So insofar as the repayments on that loan are 
concerned they are completed by February 2021.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  The capital portion? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Again capital.  Right; and then there is 
something called - on the left hand side - “Bullet Payment”.  What does 
that mean? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So that is the interest on that 
20 
facility because it is not priced like the first one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the first one incurs interest 
as time goes.  That is why the repayments start when it is disbursed.  
This other one is priced like an equity instrument.  So the return on it is 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 78 of 153 
 
achieved at the end.  That is why it is referred to as a bullet facility at 
the end. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, okay.  So the liability to pay the interest 
only kicks in later.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  So we start collecting the 
capital first … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  And then the return is collected 
later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand this document the first 
10 
interest payment is in February 2021.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is in the amount of 2.7 million? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the second interest payment is in 
February 2022.  The same amount 2.7 million.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so again similar to the working capital loan 
the plant and equipment loan is similarly repaid by the end of 
February 2022.  Correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that - February 2022 - is five years from 
the decision in February 2017.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Right.  You in your evidence 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 79 of 153 
 
wanted to talk about an error … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I stopped you and I apologise.  Let us 
understand the error that was brought to the attention of the IDC by the 
Commission’s investigators.  What is the error on this cash flow 
statement that we are looking at? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So you will recall that the client 
said it had got equipment donated to it by Denel of 40 million and - and 
we valued it at seven million ourselves.  So - so that donation is 
reflected as income in the hands of the client but it is asset.  It is not 
10 
cash. 
So when we do the cash flow statements we must take it out 
because the client did not receive cash.  It just received assets. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so in - in this cash flow 
statement the - the income should have been reduced by the value of 
that donation to take it out … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  And that is the error that 
happened.  It was not adjusted out. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what amount was the error? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the - the adjustment is about 
to - to add back that income.  I think it will be around 6.903. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  About 6.9 million.  Right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 80 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now Mr Mainganya how could an error like this 
occur in your rigorous processes that you have described? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Chair, I - I think an error like 
this should not happen. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could you - Mr Mainganya if you would mind 
just as bit closer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I think I am - I have given up your voice.  It seems 
10 
to be just low by nature. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Sorry.  Sorry, sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if the technicians have … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will try and remind you to bring it closer. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether there is anything the technicians can do. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson.  I was saying 
it is regrettable that this error was not picked by all the processes … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
Including 
the 
peer 
review 
processes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because Mr Mainganya if I may just come in 
there.  It is - it is - I mean your description of it with respect is a very 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 81 of 153 
 
simple description.  It is not a complex matter. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That it should not have reflected a R6.9 million 
cash position insofar as the Denel asset donation was concerned.  Is 
it?  It is not complex - the error? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems something that could and should have been 
easily picked up. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes Chairperson.  The - the 
amount should have been added back.  I do not know how it was 
missed.  It should have been added back … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Because it was not a cash 
receipt.  It was an asset receipt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did - did … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we probably want to ask the same question. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the chances that it - it was a genuine error?  
What are the chances that it was not a genuine error in your own 
assessment? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that something you are unable to …? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No, no, no.  I - I have engaged 
with the team that prepared the financial model and I also showed them 
this error.  They indicated to me this was a genuine error in the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 82 of 153 
 
assessment.  I - I did not get the impression that it was done 
intentionally when I - when I interviewed them. 
I interviewed both the financial specialist and the head of the 
department and - and hence I requested them to - to do another 
calculation.  To say had this error not been done what would have been 
the impact on the cash flows? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not your question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No it - mine was close to it Chair.  So mine has 
10 
not become not necessary any further.  Mr Mainganya when was the 
error first made known to you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I think it was around May when I 
had interviews with you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With the Commission. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and what steps did you take?  You 
have indicated to the Chair you did go back … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To engage with the financial team.  I also 
20 
understand from your affidavit you asked them to look at the numbers 
again in a sense … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is the second spreadsheet that you 
have in front of you Chair and it is at paginated page 21.  That is in 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 83 of 153 
 
DD13A.  Mr Mainganya why did you ask for this recalculation of the 
cash flow statement to be done? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Chairperson when - when the 
Commission pointed this to me they wanted to know whether the 
business would have been viable should this error not have been done.  
Hence I request this to be redone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Mainganya I understand your affidavit 
to say it would still have been viable.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  I am saying the facilities 
the - the working capital - the first one - would - would still be repaid in 
10 
2021 but the - the “Mezzanine” one facility would be repayable a year 
later than was anticipated. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is that last part that I want to explore a bit 
further with you Mr Mainganya when you say the “Mezzanine Debt” 
which for our purposes I want to suggest we call the plant and 
equipment loan because that is how it was referred to in the decision 
making.  I understand you to say the plant and equipment loan would 
have been paid later. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Repaid later but only one year later than on the 
20 
original calculation.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  However Mr Mainganya if you go back to 
page 5-7-6. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 84 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Remember we had determined on that page 
that the plant and equipment loan would have been paid back by 
February 20 - 2022.  Do you see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we look at that same line on page 21 which is 
the reconstructed cash flow statement. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see that the plant and equipment loan 
is only repaid in February 2025.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is more than a year later.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is in fact three years later. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  Oh, so - so 
Chairperson remember the terms of the - of the equipment facility are 
that you only deduct payments such that there is cash available of a 
million.  So when you repay the client must remain with a million.  So if 
- if every year when we test the model we find that should we ask for 
repayment the client would have a million less. 
There is no repayment due in that date.  So - so because of 
20 
this error which had shown that the client was having more cash than it 
had.  The - the team modelled repayments earlier than the terms of the 
facilities.  The terms of the facilities say that the repayments must start 
in 2021 but because it was showing an erroneous cash they were 
starting earlier than the terms of the facilities. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 85 of 153 
 
So - so as per agreement - as per agreed on the credit 
approval the repayments must start from 2021 to 2024 but they started 
earlier because of this cash.  So when we correct this adjustment we - 
we start sweeping with the terms of the facilities from 2021.  So the 
terms of the facilities said the client must have repaid by 2024 as per 
agreement but on the restated model it repays by 2025.  That is what I 
mean when I am saying it repays a letter than the first model. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Mainganya.  You will recall when 
we were looking at the decision taken on 6 February 2017 … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I said we may need to come back to it when we 
looked at the cash flow statement and your clarification now has been 
helpful in that regard but I would like us just to go back there if we may 
so that I can be sure I am entirely understanding your position.  You 
will find that in DD13B and it is at page 2-6-5. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see under two there that deals with 
plant and equipment loan.  The one we are interested in at the moment.  
Correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now it is just the wording here does trouble me 
because it seems on its face to be contradictory … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you may assist me there.  It reads: 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 86 of 153 
 
“A R6.5 million plant and equipment subordinated 
loan facility to be used for the upgrade of plant and 
equipment and the purchase of bowsers.  The 
facility will have a term of five years and is 
expected to achieve a 13.8 real after tax return.  
Repayments will be in the form of cash sweeps from 
year 2021 to financial year 2024 maintaining a 
minimum cash balance of one million with cash 
sweeps occurring every six months beginning 
28 February 2018.” 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not understand that.  Can - can you assist 
me there? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I - I looked at that Chairperson.  
So -  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you could just come a bit closer. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so it was contradictory to 
me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hence I looked at the actual 
20 
agreement.  The actual agreement does actually correct that.  So it is 
not 2018.  It is 2021 in terms of repayment on the actual subordinated 
agreement with the client. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So was this an error that was then picked up 
before the agreements were concluded in your … 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 87 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  View. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the approval that was given did not make 
sense at point two.  Did it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  The facility was only 
supposed to start from 2021. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then help me with one last part. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would you refer to it as a loan facility of 
10 
five years when it ends up being a loan facility of eight years? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I think it refers to the repayment 
period - the five years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So there is basically a holiday of three years.  
Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes because this is an equity 
instrument. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So they get to fund their plant and equipment 
from July 2017 … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Huh-uh. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But they only have to re - start repaying that in 
2021. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 88 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you but you agree with me that it cannot 
possibly have been that they started cash … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Ja, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sweeping in … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  February 2018. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go back if we may just to that page 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just so that I follow that part.  Is that 
regular for them to have that holiday? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson.  We - we 
model what the client can afford.  Sometimes because the cash flows 
are smaller in the beginning.  We give clients a moratorium.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you recoup … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later whatever they would have paid earlier? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  Hence - hence you 
can see the return on this facility is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Much higher to compensate for 
20 
that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That we give them a holiday for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go back to 21 but maybe before 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 89 of 153 
 
we do that just to pick up on the Chair’s question.  Of course all the 
time - correct me if I am wrong - the IDC is deciding which applications 
to fund.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Just for the record you need to … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Give the positive answer. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not the head nod. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is assessing at any point in time which to 
fund and whether it has three years receiving no repayment in relation 
to a particular applicant as compared with others.  I assume would be 
something it takes into account.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  That is correct 
because the - the subordinated facilities are treated as an equity 
instrument.  So the return on them is - is much higher. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But delayed. 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Delayed.  Hence the period is 
longer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is - it is - I would suggest to you a 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 90 of 153 
 
balance that has to be struck when financial viability is assessed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You get a bigger return at the end … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you do not get repayment in the interim and 
I assume you would have to take into account that impact on the rest of 
the IDC’s decision making albeit that we dealing with fairly small 
figures here.  I accept that. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Oh yes, yes.  So we - we assign 
capital in terms of how much we can provide under these facilities and 
10 
whether the other facilities do compensate for them because we have 
many facilities.  Others are repaying during the period of moratorium 
that we grant to other facilities. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - where you give a client a holiday as - as we call 
it now - the compensation that you structure into the whole 
arrangement whole deal you just mentioned that later on the 
repayments are higher. 
Would the aim be to achieve the same benefit for IDC as IDC 
would have achieved if there had been no holiday or is the position that 
20 
because you have been given a holiday IDC will structure the 
repayments in such a way that it must end up getting more from you as 
a client then otherwise would have been the case if there had been 
holiday - holiday? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 91 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other - is the aim to similarly achieve the same 
thing because you just want to assist the client or is there an element 
of saying well we must punish you a little bit in order to discourage 
people from wanting to get into holidays. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay Chairperson.  Thanks.  So 
I would not say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that something that you are not sure about? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No, no, no I am sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I can explain it to you.  So it is 
10 
not a punishment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not use punish. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is not a punishment to the 
client … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  But it is an assistance to the 
client because the type of clients that we fund some of them are 
struggling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So in the earlier periods they 
20 
are not able to pay but over time they get more contracts the business 
survives, so we give this facility as if the IDC is investing in the 
business but because we are suspending our cash flows the clients 
must compensate us for that in the end.  So – and also these facilities 
are subordinated, meaning other creditors are paid first that the IDC, 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 92 of 153 
 
so there’s more risks to the IDC hence we say the client at the end, 
when the business is viable and making money they must compensate 
us for that risk that we’re taking so that we can plough it back and fund 
other clients with the return that we get but as is in this case we model 
it such that we are only able to get that money if the client’s business 
succeeds as well.  So should the client fail other creditors will be paid 
first then the IDC that is the assistance we are giving to the client, I 
don’t see it as a punishment. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, no, no I understand that I think what I’m 
looking for is whether you say, if we hadn’t given this client a holiday 
10 
over, for example,  a five year period we haven’t given this client a 
holiday of, what two years, for example the first two years and they 
start paying on the third year, whether you look at simply putting 
yourselves in the same position you would have been in financially in 
terms of what you get or whether you actually make more, you seek to 
make more money by reason of the fact that there’s been some 
holiday? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   We try to achieve both. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh you try to achieve both? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   We try to be compensated for 
20 
the longer period and we try to be compensated for the riskiness of the 
facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mainganya just in 
relation to page 21 you were explaining…[intervenes]. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 93 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you back in his…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    We are back in his affidavit which is DD13A.  
This was the recalculation done when you went back to the finance 
team, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did mention the page but…[intervenes] 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    21 Chair but it’s also on the big A3 that I 
handed up which might just be more convenient to look at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    This was the reconstructed cash flow 
statement done by the finance team when the error was drawn to their 
attention, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It does not, as I understand it, account for the 
increase in the interest rate that ought to have been paid by EML if it, 
as we’ve agreed did not qualify for MCEP funding is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   That’s right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    That would have increased its interest 
payments from 4% to 13% correct…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wasn’t sure whether he wanted to add something? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Apologies did you want to add something 
there Mr Mainganya? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the previous question. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes Chairperson for this I just 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 94 of 153 
 
wanted to only adjust for the impact of the error, I didn’t want to adjust 
for anything else. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Fully understood. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes, so I didn’t correct those 
other repayments that were repayable as per that facility and I didn’t 
change any figure other than to correct the error. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, do you agree with me though, that 
if this was properly to have been assessed at the time, this application 
for funding, two things would have had to have changed in the cash 
flow statement analysis that was produced by the finance department.  
10 
The first is that the facility would not have qualified for MCEP funding 
and so the interest rate on that loan would have had to have been at 
prime plus 3%, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then the second thing is that the error 
would have had to have been removed, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So had no errors, and the Chair has already 
questioned you on the error of whether the R6.9million was a genuine 
error and you’ve given your evidence on that, we will return to the 
20 
question of whether the MCEP error, I’m putting that in inverted 
commas at the moment, was also genuine in your view because  there 
have been further developments and investigations around that but for 
present purposes at least those two things would have to be corrected 
for the committee to be in a proper position to assess the financial 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 95 of 153 
 
viability of this application, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:    So you want us to show what 
the interest would have been had it not qualified for MCEP? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Mainganya I don’t suggest it’s necessary 
that we do that exercise, I’m working at the level of principle. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Okay yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So just to establish that you and I agree at 
least those two errors would have to have been corrected. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you I then just want to understand the 
10 
rationale because I read your affidavit to say you still think this would 
have been a financially viable loan to fund, is that right as you sit here 
today? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Why would the IDC want to extend loan 
facilities that end up extending for eight years in a situation where they 
only maybe have a tender which is, as I understand the submission, the 
sole source of revenue of EML at the time for three years, is that 
usual? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So Chairperson the IDC being 
20 
involved with this client was not seeing it as it will only fund it for that 
period of three years and exit.  We raise the risk of the client having 
one contract and in mitigation of that the client indicated that it was 
working on other contract and as we’ll see later the client was able to 
attain other contracts.  So although for this loan the primary source of 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 96 of 153 
 
repayment was a SAA contract the IDC was seeing it as helping it to be 
sustainable to be able to bid for other contracts hence we were 
investing in the client, getting sufficient equipment to not only get the 
SAA contract but to be able to bid for other contracts and for the point 
you are raising there is a risk in that, in that the client may not get 
those and again to the point you’re raising it is why those other 
facilities are marked at a higher rate because the IDC carries more risk 
but we do set up clients like that with an initial contract and we push 
them to find other revenues so that the business doesn’t end on 
completion of that contract.  So that’s why we were prepared to take 
10 
the risk to put the client, since we’ve invested a lot in the equipment 
the client was having which had a lifespan extending more than five 
years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And what if they can’t get other contracts? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So that is a risk we are in as a 
Development Finance Institution, sometimes clients are not able to get 
other contract, sometimes the businesses close, sometimes they get 
other contracts, sometimes it does happen that we suffer losses and 
they cannot repay our facilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What – I mean I can understand the idea on the part 
20 
of an institution such as IDC of saying we are – we are prepared to 
take some risk in order to assist maybe a certain sector of business or 
society and so on but I wonder what measures the IDC would take to try 
and make sure that it’s decision to take that risk is a reasonable one, 
particularly where you’re looking at people who might be depending on 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 97 of 153 
 
tenders you know, they tell you we have hope that we’ll get two or three 
other tenders and they might not even know who else will be tendering 
for those tenders, what are their prospects, what will their prospects of 
getting those when they don’t even know who else will be bidding for 
them.  It seems different to me from somebody who say, look this is the 
business I have now and here is another business that I’m going to 
start, here’s my business plan you can look at it and they motivate.  
You can assess the risk in a certain way there are not too many 
variables but I’m just thinking if it’s an entity that is talking about 
getting other tenders in Johannesburg, in Pretoria, in Bloemfontein, I’m 
10 
just making examples, you say, but we have no idea whatsoever what 
your chances will be, are  you able to shed any light as to how those 
risks are assessed? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes Chairperson and thanks for 
that question.  It is a difficult space that we find ourselves in because 
on the other hand we have to play that role of assisting new entrants in 
the industry and we try our best to estimate on a balance of 
probabilities that the client has a reasonable prospect of getting that 
tender but we must always remember that our funding only flows on him 
getting the tender.  So we won’t give him money until he gets it but 
20 
then we also try to do a pre-assessment of the ability of the client, so if 
somebody who’s never been involved in this business come to IDC and 
say I’ve bid for this fund me and we will ask questions.  Do you 
understand the industry, are you in this industry?  So in this particular 
client what the submission says, it says that, this particular client had 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 98 of 153 
 
been in existence for ten years and as we know most of the clients we 
fund, the small businesses fail within their first year.  So this one at 
least as per application had been there for ten years, it is in this 
industry but the client  is coming to us and saying, I’ve been doing this 
on a piecemeal I don’t have the right equipment to be able to bid for 
bigger businesses and for me to bid for SAA it requires me to have this 
licensing regime, it requires me to have this equipment but then on that 
basis we assess, we say at least this client has survived for ten years 
in this business we can take some risk on him that he will be there 
even 
post 
the 
SAA 
tender 
because 
of 
his 
previous 
record, 
10 
so…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looking at the track record.   
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Looking at the track record, so 
– and it’s not always the case Chairperson in other difficult sectors we 
have to still try to facilitate, especially the entrants of new black 
people, sometimes they just have the technical knowhow and then they 
don’t have the equipment so we also give them business support.  So 
as you’ll see later on in this client we said he must go for corporate 
governance training, we gave him support in terms of appointing a 
financial manager, we assisted him with a financial support.  So in 
20 
addition to the funding we try to give them non-funding support so that 
they survive post that client but it is a risk that things don’t always 
happen as we planned. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Chair I note that we are at the lunch break 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 99 of 153 
 
time if it’s convenient we can take the adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think let’s take the adjournment and we will 
resume at two, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I note that this Friday afternoon is a very empty – it is 
a very empty hall.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can just assure Mr Mainganya that it is has got 
10 
nothing to do with him, 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed not, indeed not.  I think it is a 
combination of Friday afternoon and lots of figures that we have been 
dealing with.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If we may proceed then. 
Chair there were two aspects well there were three aspects that Mr 
Mainganya was going to follow up for us on over the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The one related to the sub-codes.  I indicated 
20 
to him that as his evidence progressed after that point they no longer 
became material certainly for my purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I am not concerned that we go to those sub-
codes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 100 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The other two I do want to just reference 
quickly in fairness to Mr Mainganya and then one or two follow up 
questions and then we will proceed.  Chair for this purpose we need to 
be working with DD13b. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you pick that up at page 189.  Chair the 
question arose in the context of the issue around the tender with SAA 
being for three years but then the loan assessment being done on a 
five year basis and the question to Mr Mainganya was well how could 
10 
that really have occurred?  And he indicated that there had been an 
assessment as to what the extent of the exposure would be over at the 
end of the three year period and I asked him to draw our attention to 
where that was in the submission.  And that you will find at page 189 as 
I have it.  In the second paragraph there this is part of the submission 
that went to the committee on the February 2017 date, is that correct 
Mr Mainganya? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what the paragraph you have 
drawn to our attention is the second paragraph there it reads: 
20 
“Through the outcome of the due diligence the team 
has assessed that the accountants used by EML for 
monthly reporting should be changed this has been 
included as an undertaking.” 
And then the relevant part begins in the next sentence. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 101 of 153 
 
“The IDC exposure to the senior loan outside the 
three year period of the SAA contract is 1.12 I 
assume that means million.” 
And then it goes on and says: 
“A mitigant is that there is R1.8 million cash in the 
bank at that point to repay the facility.” 
Is that what you wanted to draw to my attention? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya the R1.8 million that is reflected 
there is a product at the time of that error still being included in the 
10 
cash flow statement, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the error would have to be taken into 
account to know what the actual cash in the bank position would be 
after the three years, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I have it from your reconstructed model 
that would reduce to about R1.1 million, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya of course the R1. – you have 
20 
traversed this with the Chair already but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am sorry I think I got lost.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You went to 189. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  189 the second paragraph there Chair. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 102 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the last sentence of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was seeing that 1.12. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that 1.8 but I was not seeing some of the figures 
you were mentioning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that last – well second last sentence says 
there is going to be an exposure on the senior loan that is the working 
10 
capital loan of R1.12 at the time.  That is million but the mitigant that is 
identified is that there is going to be about R1.8 million in cash in the 
bank, correct?  
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I have also understood your evidence to 
be is you recognise that because of the error that had been included in 
the cash flow statement at the time that R1.8 million figure would have 
to be reduced, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it would go down to about R1.8 million, is 
20 
that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  R1.1 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apology from R1.8 to R1.1, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So there is less available cash than is recorded 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 103 of 153 
 
here at the end of the three year period? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If the error had not occurred, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would that have influenced you materially if 
you had been making this decision? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No because the amount of cash 
available is more or less equal to the outstanding balance then.  
Because there is R1.1 outstanding and then there is a balance of cash 
of R1.1. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And just to conclude this Mr Mainganya 
of course that whole cash flow model depends on a range of 
assumptions made after the three years in which the contract which has 
been tendered for would apply, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you in a sense if I can understand and make 
sure we are on the same page when IDC looks at its modelling if the 
SAA contract had been awarded on the terms of the tender it then has a 
realistic sense assuming performance under the contract and on both 
sides what is coming into the company for three years, is that right? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But after those three years so this was in 2017 
after 2020 everything else we see in those cash flow statements are 
projections, they are assumptions, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes that is beyond the actual 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 104 of 153 
 
contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is.  And you traversed with the Chair earlier 
well that is part of the risk as I understand it that the IDC evaluates, 
Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the basis for those assumptions 
and the figures put into the cash position of the business thereafter? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So in the submission the team 
indicates that it has grown the projections by the inflation rate beyond 
the contract among other assumptions. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would that mean that they assume for the 
purposes of the model that what has been secured in the tender with 
SAA for the three years is likely to continue plus inflation? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So they assumed in this one like 
they indicate that the submission would be for five years and they also 
assumed that the client will get other contracts on termination of the 
SAA contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And contracts of a similar value, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No not really contracts from 
different other suppliers not necessarily of a similar value. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But if you are and correct me if I am wrong but 
if you are increasing off a base for inflation you are assuming that base 
remains the same thereafter which would assume a similar value of 
contract being obtained elsewhere would it not? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Or more or less. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 105 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed but … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They put a figure in and a I understand the 
figure assumes a continuation of the same cash receipt over time as 
was secured for the three years plus inflation? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes so that they start at the 
base and put some growth assumptions on the company and they 
indicate in the submissions which other prospect that the client was 
pursuing and they model assumptions based on that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  The second aspect that I asked for 
10 
you to look at over the break related to whether there was any 
reference to the justification for EMSEP funding as being the value add 
that EML would bring and you drew my attention in the same volume 
Chair to page 222. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Mainganya I had introduced that 
question on the basis that I had not seen a reference to value add as 
the justification for the EMSEP approval or qualification in this 
submission.  What you have drawn my attention to is right at the bottom 
of that page 222 where there is a reference to the approach that ACSA 
20 
Airports Company South Africa takes to people in the position like EML 
would have been in its contract with SAA, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what it records there is ACSA sees through 
putters.  Chair you will remember that phrase of through putter from the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 106 of 153 
 
evidence of Mr Vaughan.  The real essence of it was that a company 
like EML was going to purchase the fuel from one of the big – the oil 
majors Total etcetera and then was going to utilise the pipeline at the 
relevant airport as a through putter to then provide that fuel plus a 
margin that SAA would pay into the aircraft.  Is that consistent with 
your understanding of through putter status? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So what is recorded here is ACSA 
sees through putters as a value add to the process as they will be 
sourcing the fuel, purchasing the fuel, transporting the fuel, storing the 
10 
fuel and testing the fuel before it is put into the planes.  You and I 
might have been at cross purposes insofar as I was interested in it 
being presented as the justification for the EMSEP qualification in this 
submission.  Do you know whether this is what Mr Kobena took into 
account when he indicated to you when you followed up with him about 
this topic that there was a value add that EML was going to be 
contributing? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  So in one of the 
correspondence and also in the investigation that we will talk about it 
does draw reference to that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To this. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That was indicated in the 
submission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Do you hold the same view that it 
is a value add as understood under the EMSEP program when an entity 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 107 of 153 
 
purchases fuel from one of the oil majors and enters into an 
arrangement to then put it into the aircraft thereafter.  Is that the sort 
of value add that EMSEP is interested in? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So I would understand that the 
client does not just simply take and put he does something so in the 
submission there is a quantification of what that value add amount to 
but I do not know if it is sufficient to qualify for EMSEP purposes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If it was simply purchasing the fuel, 
transporting it, using the pipeline and putting it into the plane is that 
the sort of thing that you think would qualify as a value add? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No I would not think that is 
value add. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Sorry, apologies I have taken two 
files.  If we can then go back in your affidavit Mr Mainganya and my 
hope is Chair that there are not too many topics to still deal with with 
Mr Mainganya so we look on good terms to complete this afternoon.  I 
would like to pick it up at page 6 if we may?  Mr Mainganya that is in 
DD13a.  And it is under the heading on that page in bold 4.4 Request to 
replace the SAA contract with SA Express SOC Limited.  Now Mr 
Mainganya for this point I do not want to have you move back and 
20 
forward between files unless it is necessary because the document I am 
going to refer to now is one we have looked at before and I just need to 
quote from it.  But if at any point you want to go and look at the 
document feel free to tell me that.  It was in the conditions precedent of 
the decision in February 2017 that a requirement that there be a signed 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 108 of 153 
 
agreement with SAA was stipulated and I just want to read how it was 
framed in that condition precedent.  It said: 
“A signed offtake agreement between EML Engineers 
and Construction and South African Airways with the 
terms to – the IDC’s satisfaction.” 
Do you recall that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when this was approved given everything we 
have traversed previously in your evidence as I understand it at that 
point the tender had not been awarded, correct? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understood your evidence it was a 
protection for the IDC to say well it is a condition precedent of all of 
these agreements both loans and the guarantee facility that there must 
be a signed agreement between EML and SAA with terms to the IDC’s 
satisfaction, Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right then as I understand your affidavit that 
does not materialise that contract, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So then what happens? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So around the 26 July the 
basics and chemicals team requested an amendment to the approval of 
the conditions set by the special grade committee.  Amendments that 
are requested by transaction teams are presented in the form or a 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 109 of 153 
 
memorandum addressed to the post investment committee which is 
comprised of the divisional executive directly responsible for the 
transaction.  The divisional executive responsible for transaction 
support and post investment management.  The Chief Risk officer and 
the general council.  The post investment committee abbreviated PIC 
does not usually sit as a committee and does not have a chairperson as 
each member considers the requested amendment independently and 
indicates his or approval or objection. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we could just stop there Mr Mainganya.  You 
indicated that earlier in your evidence today that you do not convene as 
10 
a committee and that it is done on an almost round robin basis and I 
said to you in that evidence when it became relevant I had ask you in 
relation to this decision where the submission was made on the 26 July 
2017 whether you recall how soon after that submission was received 
the decision was taken? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I do not recall exactly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it have been a matter of days in all 
likelihood? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So some members could have 
approved it on the same day, some a day or two later. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed but we are not talking about more than 
a week or so, is that fair? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  In other words yes you agree? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes I agree. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 110 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is just the record does not always reflect the 
manner in which you have indicated the answer. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So shortly after the 26 July 2017 a 
decision was made and what decision was that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the decision was to agree to 
the requested amendment that instead of the SAA contract the SAA Ex 
contract would be used at the offtake. That is [indistinct]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Thank you.  So now we have a 
substation of funding that was premised on a SAA contract being 
10 
replaced by a SAA Express contract, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to go to that actual submission 
because the aspects of it that we do just need to traverse.  You will find 
that in DD13c and it commences at page 631. Mr Mainganya you will be 
in file c. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay. File C. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At page 631.  Thank you.  Can you confirm 
what document that is at page 631? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it is a memorandum 
20 
addressed to the post investment committee.  It is from the basics and 
speciality chemicals business unit.  Its reference it is for EML 
Engineering and Construction.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And is this a submission that you 
have been discussing they went the post investment committee to 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 111 of 153 
 
change the funding from a SAA contract to a SA Express contract? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if you just go to page 634 
it is a few pages on.  Under the – the last table on that page where 
there is capital letters APPROVED ahead of it.  I see there in the third 
line the chief risk officer identified, is that you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so that is your signature? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you were part of the group that approved 
10 
this change from the SAA contract to the SA Express contract, is that 
right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And this occurred just a few months – a few 
days after the 26 July 2017, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to look at the actual wording that 
was used in this request to the committee of which you were a member 
and you will find that at page 633.  You will see there that the request 
under 1 if you could read that for us.  What is the first request that the 
20 
business unit makes to your committee? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is requested that the IDC 
consent to change NCP to allow EML to draw funding based on the SA 
Ex award letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then under 2. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 112 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is requested that the first 
drawdown be changed from 6 August 2017 to 30 September 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that was to push the drawdown date out 
slightly, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay I would like to focus a bit on point 1 
though because you will correct me if I am wrong but this is a request 
as I read it that there be a consent to change the condition precedent 
that is the condition precedent that we saw previously related to the 
need for a signed agreement between SAA and EML on terms 
10 
satisfactory to the IDC to a term which now stipulates that EML will be 
allowed to draw funding based on the SA Express award letter.  Do you 
regard an award letter as being different to a contract? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why would the request be being made to 
allow funding purely on the basis of an award letter in circumstances 
where previously it had been of some importance as I understood your 
evidence to the IDC that they actually had a signed contract in place. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No.  So this memorandum is 
requesting the change from SAA to SA Express and in support for that it 
20 
is indicating that here is an award letter from SA Express. So – so I 
think if we – if we go to page 632. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the page back yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is the page back.  So I 
think that paragraph after item 3.  So which says as part of the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 113 of 153 
 
approval process condition precedent 6.1.7 of the guarantee facility 
was for EML to obtain a signed offtake agreement from SAA Limited.  
So it is that condition that is requested being changed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it remains a CP but instead 
of the contract being SAA the contract become SA Express.  So – so if 
you read item number 4 it does not mean that on award payment will 
happen because the CP will now read we must get an offtake from SA 
Express.  It is not saying based on this letter we can pay.  It is saying 
based on this letter can we change the condition. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that how you understood this document at 
the time? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. Yes that is how I 
understood it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because can I say to you that language is not 
readily apparent to me certainly as an outside reader of this.  And the 
reason is because when this document talks about the change it talks 
about a change and only ever makes reference to an award letter that 
has been received from South African Express.  Do you accept that just 
in terms of the words? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes, yes.  No I can 
understand but in support of what I am saying it is factual that upon 
this change being made the client started requesting payment and our 
teams and legal team said no we cannot pay you we still  need the 
contract first.  So that is my understanding it is just changing the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 114 of 153 
 
condition.  Disbursements could not happen on the basis of this letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you understand the position to be that 
at 27 or call it 29 July when the approval was given the IDC had not yet 
seen the agreement? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes at that point and it is not 
there – the agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is only the award letter? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  There is only the award letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is right. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And let us just go to that award letter because 
it is a few pages on it is at 635.   
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the award letter that you refer to? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes this is the one that was 
attached to this memorandum. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I understand your evidence to be this you 
understand is not a contract but – and you also – your evidence is that 
as at this date the IDC had not seen a contract, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But thereafter it was obtained, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And disbursements were made only after it was 
obtained, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 115 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were its terms interrogated at all by the team 
in the IDC? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes I spoke to the legal team 
they indicated that they did review the contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did they engage with South African Express at 
all about it like they had engaged with SAA previously? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No they did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because as I understand it from Mr Rama’s 
affidavit and correct me if I am wrong there is no second due diligence 
that is done when a change of this nature occurs, is that right? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes there is no second due 
diligence in the sense of restarting the process but they still requested 
to do diligence on the terms that have changed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right if we at 635 the one thing I just want to 
probe with you there is if a due diligence is not done when a change of 
this nature takes place I assume interrogating the prescribed litres of 
fuel that were going to be procured from EML would not have been 
interrogated at all would it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So with regard to that the team 
indicated in the submission that based on these litres then they redid 
20 
the financial models that we have been discussing and then re-verified 
the supporting prices to those litres to test if the client would be able to 
make sustainable income from this new contract.  So that is the extent 
of the interrogation that they did in checking that what the client bid 
was supported by reasonable prices from the suppliers and then they 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 116 of 153 
 
use those litres to do a new model and based on that they indicated in 
the memorandum that based on the model the client would still be able 
to afford the facilities that were granted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in fairness Mr Mainganya to the IDC I 
expect in this process you are not on the lookout for fraudulent 
contracts being concluded with state owned entities are you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is a risk that is always there 
in the current environment so hence the legal scrutiny must do 
reasonable processes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  To satisfy itself that the contract 
that is presented to them is valid and that is the line between doing 
forensic process on the contract versus doing reasonable measures to 
check what you getting could be from a reliable institution. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So we have to think about the 
risk of fraud when we do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh the reason I raise it Mr Mainganya and this 
is not evidence I assume of which the IDC was aware at the time but 
the 8 million litres that were going to be provided according to this 
20 
letter of award to Pilanesburg airport the commission has received 
evidence was wildly in excess of the number of litres that airport would 
ever need annually but I assume that was not known to the IDC at the 
time? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No I did not know it. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 117 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the process of review that was undertaken 
did not reveal that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No it did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we could go Mr 
Mainganya back into your affidavit. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we will pick it up at page 8 if we can.  At 
page 8 the heading begins 4.5 drawdowns paid directly to EML.  Do you 
see that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes I do. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya I know at the time you may not 
have been aware of a particular invoice for a consultant that was 
included when the drawdowns were sought by EML from the IDC but 
you have seen Mr Rama’s affidavit before.  Have you not? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you assist us with what that particular 
invoice in the order of 1.5 million that was submitted to the IDC in 
respect of the drawdown related to? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That invoice related to a fee for 
consulting services that was invoiced by an entity called Mamela 
20 
Property Trust to EML. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what were the services that were alleged 
to have been performed for that invoice? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it was alleged that Mamela 
Property Trust had assisted the client in compiling its business plan 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 118 of 153 
 
and getting funding from the IDC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to that invoice if we may.  You will 
find it in DD13B and it is at page 4-5-6. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is this the invoice that we were speaking 
about? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who is it from and to? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
It 
is 
addressed 
to 
EML 
Engineers and Construction.  It says - it is from Mamela Property Trust. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the date of the invoice what is that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  3 July 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the contact person on the invoice? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It is Eddie Komane. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That name came up earlier today.  Did it not? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  That is correct.  He is the 
one who referred the business plan to - to Mr Billy Cobbinah. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was back in the middle of 2016.  Is that 
right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So his name appears here again on an invoice 
and what was the work for which this invoice of R1.5 million was 
raised? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It says scope of work facilitation 
or raising of funding from the Industrial Development Corporation of 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 119 of 153 
 
South Africa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what is your understanding of this invoice 
being forwarded to the IDC as justification for a drawdown on its 
facilities? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So this - this invoice never 
featured in any of the funding requests that were made by the client.  
So it became apparent to the IDC only at the time when the client was 
requesting disbursements from the IDC.  At that point in time when a 
client requests disbursements we request that they include supporting 
documentation as to what the money will be spent on. 
10 
So as you will see in - in Mr Rama’s testimony he indicates 
that at that time among the invoices submitted by the client was this 
invoice at which point he says he indicated to the client that this will 
not be paid from the IDC because at no point in time was the IDC made 
aware that there is these services and the IDC did not budget for this 
service. 
Therefore he indicated to the client that this invoice must not 
be paid by the IDC.  So then the client submitted invoices excluding 
this one which is for equipment and working capital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this invoice was it - well I see that it - it seems to 
20 
be addressed to EML but I hear you talk as if it was directed at IDC or 
did I misunderstand something? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay.  So - so the client … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was sent to - it was sent to EM - EML … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 120 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And EML sent it to IDC? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  That is correct because 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  As part of expenses? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but how could - how could that happen? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so for - for approved 
expenses it is normal.  Remember Chairperson so we gave the client 
6.5 million and on that he says I am going to buy this equipment.  I am 
10 
going to buy this vehicle.  I am going to pay these salaries.  So - so 
before we pay the client must give us those invoices that he has 
received from the sellers of that equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So we can justify giving him 
money.  So - so we are saying in that pack of invoices he included this 
one but then we said this thing is not part of what we know to be your 
funding requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is not equipment or anything like that. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Exactly, exactly.  So it shall not 
20 
be paid from the money from the IDC because at no point did you tell 
us that there is a - there is a consultant that is helping you to do the 
business plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why did he even go there?  Why did you - do you 
even have to say you did not tell us?  I mean that - if there was such 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 121 of 153 
 
an arrangement it was between the two of them.  Is it not? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chair but - but we - the - as 
per (indistinct) he had to make it clear to the client that none of our 
money should be utilised to pay for this client - for this invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, no, no I understand that completely.  I do 
not know about Ms Hofmeyr but I mean - I mean on the - on - on the 
assumption that EML had asked Mamela Properties Trust - Properties 
Trust - they are raising funds - Properties Trust to facilitate or raise 
funds for them.  That must be their - their own business. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  How - how could they even begin to think they can 
pass that on to you.  That - that is my - that is - that is my reaction you 
know and - and I am kind of thinking maybe you - ID - IDC should have 
been much harsher … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Oh, oh, oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To EM - EML 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I understand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - maybe I missed something. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Your problem.  So we will see 
later … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Because later we discover that 
despite us saying do not pay this the client went on to proceed to pay 
this invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From - from the money obtained from …? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 122 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so then - he then shows us 
a contract between him and Mamela Property Trust and then in that 
contract it says Mamela had - had indicated that part of the funding 
request would include the services that he rendered.  So - so it is the 
reason that EML was sending this invoice. 
He says Mamela had indicated that it will be part of the 
funding requirements.  Which is a point we were saying no it is not.  We 
are not going to pay it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know Ms Hofmeyr.  Just - I think I would have 
been very harsh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair.  I - I - with respect I share that 
sentiment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you think it was sufficient for Mr Rama 
simply to say we are not paying it because it was not in the original 
terms or might he appropriately have said we are not paying it because 
20 
the IDC does not pay R1.5 million only to be used to facilitate the very 
funding that the IDC is making available? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No I think he should have gone 
further Chair. He should have even elevated this matter … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 123 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  To the IDC and … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Mr Mainganya because as we will 
discover … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If this had been flagged at an appropriate time 
as being a basis on which EML was seeking drawdowns … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the facility … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Possibly more about the arrangement might 
10 
have been uncovered.  Is that not so? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you; but as I have the evidence all that 
happens is Mr Rama goes back and says we are not paying it.  Right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You may not use the funding for this purpose.  
Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what happens? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that it is obvious that there had been no 
facilitation that was lawful that would have happened? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chair.  Up to this point in 
time all the approval committees have never been made aware … 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 124 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That there is a facilitation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is it IDC policy not to fund where there is a 
facilitation? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Exactly.  We will never pay that 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I was moving onto what happened 
because you began in one of your answers to the Chair recently to talk 
about when it was picked up that despite the indication that it should 
10 
not be paid it was paid. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you explain to us how that came about?  
The - the uncovering of the payment. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay.  So - so in terms of our 
processes after we have paid the client the money then after some 
period once he has bought the - the items he needed.  We go and do a 
verification that indeed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do a verification? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  We go to the client now and say 
did - where is the equipment that you bought and everything.  So it is 
at that point that we discovered that he actually utilised some of the 
money that we had indicated to pay this invoice. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 125 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what further inquiries were made in that 
regard? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You mentioned an agreement that was sought. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  So then at that point 
in time be - because the team had changed that did the initial 
application.  So Mr Rama was no longer part of the team.  A new team 
went in and as they do the audit they discovered that this payment has 
been made and - and then they take the client on as to why did you pay 
this because in our budgets we do not see an expense item like this. 
10 
Then - then the client says I had to pay this because I had 
entered into an agreement with this Mamela Property Trust that would 
help me to compile my business plan and the client now indicates that 
because Mamela is aware that the funds have been paid therefor it 
demanded its payment and the client says in an email addressed to the 
team it says it felt it had to pay this invoice. 
It is then that the matter was reported back to the - to the 
IDC because until that audit we did not know that the - the client had 
utilised some of our money to pay for this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when about was that reported back? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So we became aware of this 
around 4 May 2018 as the Credit Committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is a date on which an application was 
made for further funding.  Is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  That is a date when 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 126 of 153 
 
an application is made for further funding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at this point 12.5 million has been extended 
to EML and that was drawn down in August 2017 as I recall it.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then in May 2018 - early May 2018 there is 
a further application by EML for about R8.5 million of funding.  Is that 
right Mr Mainganya? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That is correct.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was this issue of the payment of 1.1 
10 
million made known to the committee that was asked to approve that 
further funding? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes.  Now on - on 4 May it - 
it is at this point that the Credit Committee becomes aware because 
now the time must submit the new funding request from the client and 
they must also explain how the other money was utilised.  So on 4 May 
they report back to the team why the client needs more money now. 
Among other things the contract had not started yet and the 
client had bought the equipment in anticipation of this and the client 
had paid salaries and now it was running out of working capital and we 
20 
said no but how did you use the money that we gave you and then it - it 
is at that point that the team reports back that among other things that 
were paid were - were for - for this business plan. 
So - so at - at this stage if - if I recall it was reported to the 
committee that an amount had been paid for helping the client to do the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 127 of 153 
 
business plan.  So at the committee it was not reported in this manner 
as a facilitation.  It was reported as a legitimate expense incurred to 
assist the client but then we said we did not budget for this and - and - 
so - so Chairperson sometimes our clients do use people to help them 
compile the business plan but our condition is that it must be made 
known to the IDC the scope of services to be provided. 
So - so the Credit Committee took issue with this matter that 
okay provided the client helped you with the business plan but you 
should have alerted the IDC that there is this service provider as well 
and we would have needed to assess if it is legitimate because the 
10 
team indicated that in all their processes up to this point in time they 
had not seen any consultant doing their - their work. 
So when this was tabled to the Credit Committee we did not 
approve it at that point because we were not happy with this.  We sent 
the team back to obtain further clarifications from the client as to - as 
to how it is going to remedy this and - and at that point in time there 
were other breaches that the client had - had done on the facilities. 
So the Credit Committee did not approve the application at 
that point in time pending resolution of those issues. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya I understood that the Credit 
20 
Committee did approve the request for the 8.5 million additional 
funding initially.  Was I wrong? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Initially declined it … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  And then they sent them back … 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 128 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  And then they came back on 
18 May. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And on the 18 t h it was approved? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes.  So on 18 May the - the 
issues that were raised by the committee were tabled and the client 
indicated how it addressed them.  Now the - the IDC is - is at a point 
now where it had disbursed these facilities the 12.5 million and - and 
the client indicates that the - the contract from SA Express has not yet 
materialised and then in the meantime it had bought the equipment and 
10 
it had obtained the compliances that it required that were budgeted for 
but now it had run out of funds … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  And then the client indicated at 
that point in time that it - it had received two new contracts.  One was 
from an entity called Fly Africa and one was from GAAL the airport in 
Polokwane and then it requested funds to - to serve those contracts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Then the committee requested 
to know the client how is it going to pay back this money that it had 
20 
paid for - for facilitation fees and at that point the client - sorry before 
that.  A letter of breach was sent to the client indicating our displeasure 
with what had happened with the facilities and requested how it is 
going to remedy that situation and the team indicated in their 
responses that the client indicated that the - the funds would be 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 129 of 153 
 
reimbursed from the proceeds of a - of a grant I think it was expecting 
from the other suppliers and then we put a condition as a committee 
because it is not the - the 1.5 that was paid. 
I think 1.1 million was paid.  So the committee indicated to 
the client at that point in time that it - it may not pay any further monies 
for any services related to - to this point in time and then it is then on - 
on the strength of those contracts that were provided to the IDC and - 
and in view of the equipment that had already been spent on the 
facilities that the - the committee approved that application. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I could just a few aspects of that.  What 
10 
precisely did the client convey to the IDC as the reason for the fact that 
the SA Express contract had not been implemented? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I - I do not recall what it said.  I 
think among other things it indicated that IDC released the guarantees 
late as a reason to justify and then it could not provide the guarantees 
to the oil companies.  Therefore it could not order fuel.  That is what 
was indicated in the submission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it have been prudent to possibly engage 
SA Express at that stage to understand from them why the contract had 
not been implemented? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I think so among other things … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That should have been done. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see Mr Mainganya if that had been done 
the Commission has received evidence already that the irregularity of 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 130 of 153 
 
that contract that had been awarded to South African Express … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  By South African Express to EML … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had already been picked up in South African 
Express in October 2017 and an investigation had in fact been initiated 
as early as that.  We are now in May of 2018 … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When further funding is being requested from 
the IDC … 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the only explanation that the IDC as I 
understand your evidence was given by the client … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For non-implementation of that contract … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Related to some delay in guarantees.  Is that 
right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes but - but - that is right and 
then you must recall this funding that was approved was suspended. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed.  It was suspended a few days later 
when a media article … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  In May. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Broke. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so when we became aware 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 131 of 153 
 
of that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  We suspended it … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Immediately. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed.  All that I am interrogating now is 
when EML comes to the IDC for more money … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In May 2018 … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A few things have happened … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Between the 12.5 million that it received … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In August 2017 … 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And its application for more money in 
May 2018.  I would like to list those for you.  The one it is that it in 
breach of a specific indication from the IDC that it not use those 
monies to pay a facilitation fee.  It had done so.  Correct? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you can just say yes for the record. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  It had and that facilitation as a 
facilitation of the very funding that it had secured from the IDC.  
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 132 of 153 
 
Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I understood your evidence to be 
previously that is irregular in the view of the IDC’s processes.  Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It had then never yet implemented the 
substitute contract for which the 12.5 million had been provided to it.  
Correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And notwithstanding that as I understand your 
10 
evidence the IDC did not take further steps to try and get to the bottom 
of why that implementation had not taken place.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So the steps what are taken was 
the breach that was communicated to the client in terms of indicating 
that the IDC at that point in time may call the facilities if those 
breaches are not remedied and then - so at - at that point in time the 
committee - these - these issues that you are raising were raised in our 
risk report that we did as you would see in my affidavit.  The fact that 
the - sorry I am on page 10. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA: 
 
So 
on 
page 
10 
in 
our 
assessment of the situation we did indicate that the client had failed to 
meet the condition regarding the off take contract.  There was no off 
take contract from Fly Africa.  The SA Express contract that you 
indicated had not - had not materialised and been implemented at that 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 133 of 153 
 
point in time. 
So - so these matters that you are raising were - were 
debated at the committee.  Now the question was what do we then do 
with the facilities that have already been approved by the client.  Now 
at that point in time two things could happen Chairperson.  So one we 
can call the facilities. 
Take the security and close the business or two we can 
review the client what it says it is going to do to remedy these 
breaches that have risen and three we consider the facilities that we 
have disbursed.  Are they - are they collateral?  Are they supported by 
10 
hard core assets? 
So - so those - those are the two issues that often arise when 
clients do not - do not respect our - our agreements.  We reach a point 
where we have to close down the business.  So - so the - the committee 
was confronted with that.  Does it close down the business and sell the 
equipment or does it request a remedial plan and based on the 
remedial plan that the client had indicated. 
Being indication that it had obtained further contracts.  Being 
indication that it had obtained additional financial support I think from - 
from Total or Engen one of the other guys and then it - it indicated that 
20 
it had obtained the - the JIG accreditation which we paid over - I think - 
over a million to get that accreditation by other international operators 
so it can be able to - to supply fuel and - and whether we - we close 
down and the fact that at that point in time the client was employing 
about five people and - and the division of closing down would be those 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 134 of 153 
 
jobs lost. 
So - so those are the issues that the committee had to 
contend with versus these breaches from the client and - and given 
those two indications the committee decided to - to support the client 
further to avoid closure of the business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya was the fact of the facilitation 
fee not on its own enough of a red flag to make the IDC cautious about 
further extending funds to EML? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So - so Chairperson to my 
collection this fact that this was - this facilitation fee only came to the 
10 
IDC when we did the investigation to - to the people but - but when … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya if I could just come in there 
because I understood your evidence to be previously that it was 
brought to your attention specifically the agreement between Mamela 
Trust and EML was called for and you actually made it the condition of 
the further extension of the loan that there be some arrangement with 
EML about the fact that it was going to reimburse the 1.1 million.  Did I 
understand that incorrectly? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No you not - you not incorrect.  I 
am saying when it was reported to the Credit Committee it was not 
20 
reported in this fashion that it was a facilitation.  They said the client 
had paid a consultant who helped them to do the business plan at that 
point in time.  The committee had not seen this invoice.  The - the 
matter was reported to the Credit Committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I see.  So you had not at the time seen either 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 135 of 153 
 
the invoice or the Commission Agreement? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes at the - it was not presented 
there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this 1.5 did you ask EML exactly what it is that 
was done by Mamela Property Trust, the properties trust that Mamela 
Properties Trust understood to constitute facilitation raising of funding 
from the IDC. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes Chairperson when we 
investigated this the client sent a long email to the IDC, it is just that I 
10 
don’t have it now which indicated to the IDC what services this Mamela 
Property Trust is alleged to have performed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was it really, was it preparation of the 
submission, what was it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   You would recall Chairperson in 
the beginning we – the advocate referred to a business plan 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may have but I remember I told you I have – I’ve 
given up trying to hear what you say because I’m – I hear some things, 
I don’t hear others but I’ve given up, I think it’s the nature of your 
20 
voice. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   (Indistinct)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so what is it was it preparation of the submission 
or what was it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes, I was ...(intervention)  
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 136 of 153 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In essence? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   I was saying that business plan 
that advocate referred to earlier in the beginning it was among other 
things that are alleged to have been done by this Mamela Property 
Trust in return for this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    For ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that understood to be the raising of funds, 
generally speaking, when somebody raises, can anybody raise funds 
the way it’s understood in business or do any facilitation without talking 
to the person who is being asked to provide funds? 
10 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So Chairperson I think perhaps 
as the Advocate proceeds it will become clearer what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I’m ahead of – okay alright. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Because we were asking the 
same question in the committee, what has exactly this person done to 
deserve these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well the reason why I was asking, I was going to 
ask it much earlier but the reason why I asked it now was because Ms 
Hofmeyr talked about whether it wasn’t a sufficient bad flag to IDC so it 
brought back that question in my mind to say but if you as IDC know 
20 
that there is nobody who has been talking to you on behalf of this client 
to try and raise funds, if you are shown an invoice that says somebody 
is demanding money because they facilitated or raised funds with you, 
not with somebody else, and you know that there is no such you know, 
isn’t it – shouldn’t that have said to IDC hang on maybe that is fraud 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 137 of 153 
 
here.  
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   So indeed Chairperson the 
credit committee that initially rejected this application was very 
displeased with this and it is especially for that reason that it said a 
letter of breach must be issued to the client and it is for that reason 
that they sent the team back to the client to obtain explanations as to 
exactly what happened, so I fully agree with you, we were not happy 
with what has happened here Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Mainganya I appreciate everything you 
10 
have said about the steps that were initially taken, the breach letter 
sent, the feedback that you obtained, but the fact of the matter is the 
IDC did decide to extend another R8.5million to EML, did it not? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   It did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It did, and back to the Chair’s question isn’t 
just the mere fact that there’s a facilitation fee of now R1.1million, 
which is not an insignificant amount is it Mr Mainganya? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   It is it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It is significant isn’t it, I mean especially if it 
is for preparing the business plan that we looked at previously that is a 
20 
business we should all be getting into because as I see that business 
plan it’s about 10 pages long it is not particularly difficult together.  
Why was this not more of a concern to the IDC, when it agrees to 
provide R8.5millon more funding? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   It was a concern Advocate, also 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 138 of 153 
 
what was a concern was the money that we had already incurred on the 
client, we had to recover that money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And as I understand your evidence you made 
a brief reference to a media article, what happened with the media 
article and how did that influence the IDC’s processes.  If you would 
like a reference for that, it’s at page 9 of your affidavit and it’s at 
paragraph B on that page, where you refer to media reports on the 27 t h 
of May 2019. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes, okay, okay, so the relevant 
– it says however on 27 May, remember this facility was approved on 
10 
18 May so on 27 May various negative allegations were published in 
the media regarding EML.  Upon this media allegations being brought to 
IDC’s attention, and my attention I immediately communicated to the 
Head of the Basics and Chemical Special Unit that no draw-downs 
should be allowed on these facilities until all the allegations referred to 
in the media above have been resolved, and then I have attached proof 
of that correspondence, so in a sense what happened immediately after 
we approved we read about these fraud allegations concerning our 
client, then I told the business unit that they shouldn’t allow any 
disbursements until we understand the nature of these allegations.  We 
20 
then engaged S A Express to say we have funded this client, we read 
about these things in the media, can you tell us what is happening 
because we will not disburse on these facilities, so at that point in time 
S A Express indicated to us that they are investigating, they have 
launched an investigation and then there were several to’s and fro’s 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 139 of 153 
 
between us and S A Express regarding these allegations but to 
ultimately we never got to disburse these facilities, because we were 
telling the client that until we get a clearance on the allegations we will 
not disburse and that is where we are.  We never got to disburse on 
these facilities, up to this point in time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Mainganya just a few follow up questions 
there, who did the IDC engage with at S A Express? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   I do not remember but I was 
forwarded with the email correspondence, I think at some point in time 
it went all the way to the CEO of S A Express. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I have not seen that correspondence to the 
best of my recollection so maybe you can provide that to the 
Commission, but ...(intervention)  
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes, yes, we will provide it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But what I’m interested in is whether in your 
testimony you said that they were going to, you were told they were 
going to launch an investigation, is that what they said? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes, they said we cannot tell 
you anything because this matter is currently investigation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Currently under? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did that suggest it was already being 
investigated, or pursuant to the media reports it was going to be 
investigated? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   I think – it gave me the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 140 of 153 
 
impression that there was an investigation under way, I don’t know if it 
was started because of the media or it was already proceeding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Well it will be useful to have that 
correspondence because we know from the evidence of Ms Loock that 
she raised this for investigation as early as October 2017 within South 
African Express, and if you are engaging them in May of 2018 that 
investigation should have been well underway if not completed by then, 
so it would be of interest to the Commission to see that correspondence 
if we can. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right, the next thing I just want to ask is a 
follow up, is it fair Mr Mainganya to say but for the media reporting on 
this issue those draw-downs would have occurred? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   No those draw-downs were 
dependant on contracts being provided to IDC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Which contracts were those? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   The Fly Africa contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So that would be another prerequisite? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But the fraud that had taken place and the 
20 
irregular procurement in S A Express was the subject matter of this 
article, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So it could have been the case that EML had 
secured other contracts pursuant to which funding would have flown but 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 141 of 153 
 
this issue around S A Express would not have been unearthed, is that 
correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson did help us 
because at that point in time we had not disbursed any facility so these 
allegations when they became apparent to us we realised that we 
cannot proceed, hence we stopped facilities, so they were crucial in us 
stopping this decision, because I was not aware at that point in time 
that there is an investigation currently happening in S A Express. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to be clear what was not made 
available was the second request for funding which was the 8.5million 
10 
but by this stage in May 2018 there had already been 12.5million 
released, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, for the purchase of the 
equipment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well and the working capital loan. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, that’s correct, that’s 
correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What has happened in relation to that, has 
there been repayment on that loan? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So Chairperson because we 
20 
refused to release funds on this facility the client couldn’t supply any 
other funders and then in fell in breach with our facilities.  What has 
happened is we have had to perfect security, we have had to go to the 
Court and we’ve perfected our collateral and so our security that we 
funded in the vehicles and everything we took it under an order of the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 142 of 153 
 
Court. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So just so I have it clear there was never any 
repayment of the loan by EML, is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Then if we can move to page 11 Mr Mainganya 
because this is where the further investigations of the Commission 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr, did you say that you – there 
was some security that you called, you called back or whatever? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:   Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in what form was that, where was the security? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Chairperson when the client 
came to us he had requested money to purchase ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Equipment. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Equipment which included 
bowsers, tanks, so these are motor vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  And that is the security which 
we took as part of our facilities, we registered a general, a special 
notarial bond over those assets, so meaning we would look to either 
20 
realise them to recover the money that we spent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are still going to do that, you haven’t realised 
the money? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson we have not 
realised at this stage but we are holding the security because we have 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 143 of 153 
 
to find the best way to realise it such that the institution does not suffer 
a loss, so which may include offers from prospective companies who 
use that equipment or it may include other operators who are able to 
use that facilities, which we have improved, so we have not disposed of 
the equipment at this point in time because the perfection of the court I 
think was granted, I don’t recall the date, we had to go through the 
court process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you had to wait for the litigation? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes we had to go through the 
court processes to register that bond. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but in the meantime when you talk about vehicles 
if you talk about a year later they’re depreciating and all of that, I’m not 
suggesting that there might be a better way in which you could have 
done, I’m just stating what would be effective there, just sitting, if they 
are parked somewhere for a year because I guess in the nature of your 
job you don’t use them you have to sell them, if they are parked 
somewhere for a year they are depreciating. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson what you are 
saying is correct and that is what happened in these instances, if we 
decide to foreclose, it comes at a huge risk to us, that’s why we really 
20 
have to balance that decision when the client can’t afford to pay our 
facilities we have to think which is the best way to protect what we 
have spent, because if we take them back we risk selling them at a far 
discounted price, now we have to look is there another operator who is 
in this business, who can use these facilities, therefore sometimes we 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 144 of 153 
 
invite prospective bidders, so we sell the business as a going concern 
so that we don’t suffer as much loss as we would have suffered if we 
just disposed them individually in pieces, but the court processes do 
add another risk to that because we can’t do anything until we get legal 
right to those assets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I don’t know if you are able to say this, if you 
can’t then you can’t, I get the impression that you are unlikely to get to 
recover much through them, if you bear in mind exactly what you had 
given this client. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So it is possible Chairperson 
10 
that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  There are challenges. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I did enquire from the team that 
is handling this what is happening, and they indicated at that stage that 
there was a prospective offer on the business that is close to what our 
facilities are but I cannot say anything about that, I haven’t 
interrogated the offer but you are correct, the risk that we may suffer is 
there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Mainganya in your experience does 
foreclosure usually involve loss? 
20 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Mainganya if we then move to page 11 this 
is where you pick up a topic there at 4.7 in bold entitled Billy Cobbinah, 
before we go through this, because this is really the concluding aspect 
of the evidence Chair, prior to your meetings with the Commission’s 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 145 of 153 
 
investigators on this topic were you aware at all that there may have 
been irregular conduct on the side of the IDC in relation to this funding 
transaction? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I was not aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And can you then take us through what was 
disclosed to you in your engagements with the Commission, and then 
what further steps have been taken by the IDC in that regard? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay, so in our engagements 
with the Commission it was put to me whether I am aware that Mr Billy 
Cobbinah is a trustee of this entity called Mamela Property Trust, I then 
10 
indicated that I am not aware and then, but I will go back and 
investigate, so when we went back to the office we instructed a forensic 
investigation into this whole aspect of this transaction, upon becoming 
aware that Mr Billy Cobbinah is a trustee of this entity which had 
invoiced us.  Do you want me to proceed? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So then the investigation was 
concluded and indeed it was confirmed that Mr Billy Cobbinah is a 
trustee and it was also confirmed that he had not declared this to the 
IDC, we have a policy that all employees must declare their conflict of 
20 
interest, we have a conflict of interest register, so he did not declare in 
any manner in that register that he was a trustee of this thing.  And 
then furthermore during the investigation Mr Cobbinah confirmed that 
he received money from Mr Edward Komane.     
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What was the amount of the money that he 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 146 of 153 
 
indicated he had received? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  It was R50 000. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   R50 000? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how did he receive it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I think it was paid in cash. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Mainganya was the interaction between IDC 
and Mr Cobbinah when this confession was made recorded? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  I understand it was Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, certainly when we met previously 
10 
we did request that we have that recording made available to us, could 
you assist us with that, we haven’t yet received it. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Okay we will Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But as I understand it there’s a forensic 
investigation and in the course of that there is an engagement between 
the IDC and Mr Cobbinah, is that correct. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You indicate now it was recorded and you will 
make that recording available to us, correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And in that interaction Mr Cobbinah admits to 
having received R50 000 in cash from Mr Edward Komane, is that 
correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What then followed in relation to Mr Cobbinah? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 147 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  In relation to Mr Cobbinah we 
instituted a disciplinary hearing, and then on conclusion he was found 
guilty of the charges that were put to him, being failure to declare, and 
a breach of our code of conduct in accepting this payment, he was 
found guilty and it was recommended that he be dismissed, and he has 
been dismissed and then we reported this matter to the Police as well, 
we opened a case against him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand from your supplementary affidavit 
that Mr Cobbinah also indicated to you further information in relation to 
Mr Rama’s involvement in the funding transaction, can you explain to 
10 
us what Mr Cobbinah relayed to you? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So he also indicated that he 
made a similar offer, him Mr Cobbinah, to Mr Rama that he will also be 
given R50 000 if he assists in getting these transactions approved. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you take that further with Mr Rama? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, he was included as part of 
the investigation for – first to ascertain the fact whether it is correct, he 
did also admit that is correct that an offer of an amount was made to 
him, he does not indicate what the amount was, but he confirmed that 
this was made and then that was also not reported to the IDC, so we 
20 
also instituted disciplinary hearings against Mr Rama, and we started 
the hearings, and then before we could conclude Mr Rama resigned 
from the IDC, so that disciplinary hearing couldn’t be concluded but 
also a case against him was reported with the SA Police. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Mainganya insofar as the 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 148 of 153 
 
evidence that you have presented here today is concerned there’s 
certain just concluding aspects that I would like to get your comment on 
if I may, and it is really in an effort to try and draw together what 
evidence we have heard from you today.   
 
The first is that do you agree that pursuant to being made 
aware of the information related to Mr Cobbinah in particular by the 
Commission the IDC has established that corruption did take place in 
this funding transaction. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I also would like to suggest to you that in 
10 
the course of the evidence it has become clear that certain aspects of 
the IDC’s process in deciding to fund EML Energy was inadequate, and 
I would like to give you the respects in which I suggest they were 
inadequate for your comment.  The first is that this application should 
never have been pre-approved for MCEP funding, do you agree with 
that? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Can I comment on that one? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So Chairperson on that one the 
confirmation from DTI that this is not included came post-approval of 
20 
the transaction, a year later.  What the team indicated is that in their 
motivation they anticipated that there would be blending and value add 
and as part of our processes to approve this transactions we do invite 
the MCEP people to sit in our credit committee, so at that point when 
we approve this transaction they were also part of the credit committee, 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 149 of 153 
 
so the committee didn’t take that decision lightly, it was together with 
the people who are responsible MCEP and at that point in time it was 
not clear that this particular industry doesn’t qualify for MCEP so it was 
made clearer by DTI a year later, so I agree, now that we know but at 
that time we didn’t know that it doesn’t qualify for MCEP. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mainganya if I can just follow that up, it was 
a false representation to that committee that EML was involved in 
blending at all, wasn’t it? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, EML was not in blending as 
far it was indicated, so what the team motivated as I understand it, 
10 
because I was not in that meeting, that that was anticipated to happen 
later but at that time it was not in blending at all. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well when – as I have your affidavit when Mr 
Cobbinah was pressed on this with you he didn’t use language about 
anticipation, he said he qualified them as pre-approved for MCEP 
because EML was involved in blending and value add, did I recall your 
affidavit incorrectly? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  No I think he said there was 
going to be blending. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, I didn’t read your affidavit in that way.  But 
20 
you accept now that it should not have qualified is that correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you accept that it was falsely represented 
at the time that they were involved in blending if that had been the 
representation? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 150 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Chairperson ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the same that the two of you have just talked 
about? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where he says he understands that they said it was 
going to happen. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  So I am trying to say I do not 
10 
know if the team intentionally named a false representation or whether 
they understood that it would qualify then, so that is what I am trying to 
say, I do not know if they intentionally made a false representation or 
they understood it to be value adding at that point in time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that an aspect that was traversed with Mr 
Cobbinah in his disciplinary? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  If I am correct in his disciplinary 
he was still asserting that it qualifies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  There was an error in the cash flow 
forecast that was done, that was not picked up by the IDC, is that 
20 
correct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there was an unauthorised payment for a 
consultant for facilitation that took place notwithstanding which there 
was further approved funding to be given to EML? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 151 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, just before your next question, is it 
accepted that whoever made that payment or made the decision that 
payment be made, the 1.5, that – no I think I may be confusing this, 
from IDC you just made a payment to the client and the understanding 
was that the client knew from what they had been told that IDC is not 
going to pay this 1.5, is that right? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chair that was a written 
instruction to the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes so the actual payment to Mamela Trust 
10 
would have been from the client to Mamela Trust? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not from IDC as a payment to Mamela Trust. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  That’s correct Chair, that’s 
correct, it was made by the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed, but just to follow that up Chair that was 
known to the IDC that that payment had been made when it decided to 
provide further funding? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson, this is 2018 
20 
now, when it has become known to the IDC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   Mr Mainganya there are certain 
reporting obligations under PFMA for the IDC in relation to irregular 
expenditure and losses resulting from criminal conduct, are you aware 
of those provisions? 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 152 of 153 
 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it the IDC’s intention to report on this aspect 
insofar as there has been losses incurred by it resultant from this 
conduct? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson we do report 
them in our annual report. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And in going forward is the IDC 
intending to put any other measures in place to not permit a repeat of 
this type of corrupt activity? 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Yes Chairperson we have 
10 
certainly learnt a lot from this experience, first in terms of enhancing 
our due diligence processes, I think with regard to verifying the 
contract we could have done more work in that regard.  Also with 
regards to the review processes on due diligence, I think we need to 
enhance that process to avoid the reoccurrence of these errors, and we 
have also looking at all other transactions that we approved involving 
some of these individuals to identify if there are any other events of a 
similar nature, and based on those findings we will enhance our 
processes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair, those are our questions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Mainganya, if a need arises 
for the Commission to ask you to come back we will ask you, but for 
now you are excused, thank you very much. 
MR MARK PHAKAMILE MAINGANYA:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Next week it is SABC and ... I think, ja. 
30 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 153 
 
Page 153 of 153 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, we will adjourn for the day.  We adjourn.
