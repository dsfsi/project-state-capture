ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The first page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us mark it U6. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  U6.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be U6.  And then the – that is now – and then this one would 
be… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be Exhibit U. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  File… 
CHAIRPERSON:  U7 [indistinct]. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It will be still U6 but in File 7 because U6 is preserved for 
this witness.  We are locating them according to the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this one should be what? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  U6 in File 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U6 in File 7.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is – we retain that File 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We retain that ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we will refer to it as Exhibit U8. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Might I just ask Ms Rabisheli to just quickly go and mark 
the witness’ before we commence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Chairman this witness is going to testify 
about the Huarong Transaction.  The Chairperson has been appraised of this 
transaction by my learned friend Mr Maleka when he first addressed the Chairperson as 
to what the evidence relating to Eskom would entail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Briefly the Huarong Transaction is where a certain 
company called Tribus approached Eskom unsolicited with an unsolicited proposal and 
said to Eskom I will fund all your capital projects.  And then it placed certain conditions 
to that.  And then we will see how that then proposal evolved and became a proposal 
20 
from Huarong Energy Africa which is the Huarong normally referred to as the Huarong 
Transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just make sure I have got everything that I should have here.  
In Exhibit U6 I expected to find the witness statement at the top but I am finding AP – 
Annexure AP1 and that might be because it has not been put back because I did take it 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 5 of 191 
 
out. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this morning I believe I asked the protectors to make sure it is 
put in. Do you know where it is?  Oh is it supposed to be on U8? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no there is no U8.  There is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we have just done Exhibit U8 with you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no Chairperson we did not do 8.  We said U6A in 
brackets (A). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  [Laughing] 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon if I was not… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There must be some… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Quite clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There must be some letters you swallowed. [Laughing]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh my I could have, I could have.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this small one that is marked File 7 you say it should be UA? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  [A] in brackets yes.  Small a 6 a in brackets. 6[a]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And this other one? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is U6 the main one.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see the one is in alpha – in alphabet another is [Laughing] a 
number. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what may have – when you said a I thought you saying 8. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No thank you. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 6 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Those are the two that we are going to refer to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those markings are fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the statement is supposed to be on the big file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The main statement is supposed to be on the main file 
because it goes with all those annexures in the bigger statement.  Have you managed 
to locate Mr Chair?  I could hand up… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I have seen this – no, no it is fine I think I have seen the 
supplementaries they may have put them together. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they put the supplementaries  together with the main statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supplementary should go with the main statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Behind it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It goes into the small file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must be on the small file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It goes into U6[a]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay no that is fine.  And then the main one is supposed to be  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To go in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just under the AP1. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Under the… 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 7 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  File divider or not? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just under the file divider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just under the – before A 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Below File… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before AP1? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  This file seems to be too full.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will attend to it during the tea break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it might be – it might be fine – we might manage.  Okay 
alright. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we will manage ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you very much.  I was just mentioning to the 
Chairperson that then this Huarong proposal was placed before Eskom and we will 
demonstrate how it was pursued throughout although it was very clear that the terms in 
the Huarong proposal were very onerous on Eskom and it was made quite clear to 
Eskom that even this Huarong Energy Africa was not going to be able to deliver on 
what it was promising but never the less it found its way and it got signed and we will 
show how those terms are onerous bypassing the processes that were supposed to 
have been followed and we will demonstrate how all the rules and procedures were 
20 
flouted.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Chairman the – this evidence will fall or 
we will address terms of reference 1.4 and 1.9.  There are notice – notice – Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just think I must mention this. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 8 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the whole legal team can remember as they deal with various 
procurement issues. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Matters yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And witnesses.  That where there has been non-compliance  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Non-compliance can be a bonafide error. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or can be deliberate.  It will be deliberate where the objective or the 
motive is corruption. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is important that as you lead witnesses you apply your mind to 
which one you are seeking to make out. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That we will do thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there may be difficulty if during the evidence an issue is 
treated simply as a non-compliance without going a step further. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say it was not just non-compliance. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The motive was corruption. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To later on ask that a finding be made that is corruption. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 9 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  The notices… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course – of course… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That becomes much more important when we looking at an 
implicated person responding. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chairperson the notices were served on the 
impeded persons but their fourteen days has not lapsed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We have had a reaction from a Mr – the representatives 
of Mr Shaun Maritz I believe that Mr Van Der Westhuizen or from his law firm someone 
is here but they are – they were requesting in their letter which they – which was 
brought to our attention yesterday seeking all the annexures to the affidavit of Mr Pillay 
and we have made arrangements because they could not be emailed to them because 
20 
of the – it is quite bulky document.  But a copy we have been promised by Mr De Beer 
that it will be made available within the next hour to them,. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of all those annexures yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 10 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  If the Chairperson is satisfied

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Pillay.  Thank you.  Mr Pillay you have got two files in

01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 12 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  We are going to start with your evidence in the 
main statement.  Could you for the record tell the Chairperson in what capacity are you 
employ – are you – first employed by Eskom, am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes I was initially employed in the capacity of Senior 
Manager of Funding and currently in the role of General Manager so responsible for the 
treasury of Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  How many years have you been with Eskom now? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  7 years. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now before we deal with that can you just tell us 
about your qualifications? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair I have a BSC in Mathematics and I have also done 
a couple of other courses but that is the main my qualification. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  A BSC in Mathematics. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now – now where you are now you General 
Manager treasury Eskom what are you responsibilities? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair I am overall responsible for the treasury for the 
running and the operational functions of the treasury.  But primarily responsible for the 
20 
financing and the funding of Eskom.  The risk management and also – excuse me – the 
risk management and also the operations being the back office responsibility of the 
treasury Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then as a General Manager treasury Eskom who do 
you report to? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 13 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I report to the CFO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then who reports to you from the managers 
that serve within that treasury department? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  There are five that – colleagues that report into me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  At the moment Sinendile Schweni, Mandla Malieka, 
Vincent Makuva, Francois Venter and Gertrude Malukwane. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now we as you know you are here to tell us about 
the Huarong Transaction am I right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you please tell the Chairperson when for the 
first time were you approached by Tribus about this transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in 2015 they approached me or my office when I 
was still the senior General Manager or the General – the senior manager in Funding 
Execution and they were referred to me by one of my colleagues to approach and to 
contact me with a potential financing solution. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is they? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Tribus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Tribus Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And in specific Rajeev Thomas Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just explain to the Chairperson what – 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 14 of 191 
 
what is it that was proposed by Tribus in full – what is it that they wanted to do – what is 
it that they were offering to Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair they – the Tribus team are engineers by 
training or largely engineers by training, they are engineers management consultants 
so they have the technical capacity.  So they in the initial response they teamed up with 
a group called Mazi Capital and the combination would provide the technical solutions 
for the capex of Eskom and also the financing solution. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you say in paragraph 2 of your statement 
that then later on instead of Tribus continuing then you were approached by Huarong 
Energy Africa? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair.  So Chair from the initial meeting there was a 
couple of engagements with them and their relationship and partnership transitioned.  
They ended up coming to us with a consortium of Tribus and Huarong Energy Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Huarong Energy sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes in simple terms what was Huarong offering you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Huarong was offering again similar to the Mazi Capital 
proposal they were dealing with the financing.  They are a Chinese company in – a 
Chinese company with both domiciled and locationed in China and in Hong Kong and 
they largely the parent company is responsible for asset management overseas and 
20 
they then have a number of subsidiaries Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  And then in paragraph 3 you allude to what Tribus 
the meeting between Tribus and the Minister of Public Enterprises at the time, could 
you just tell the Chairperson about that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in one of the discussions that we have had with 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 15 of 191 
 
the Tribus team they did not indicate who at the time but they said that it is part of their 
team they have someone that knows the Minister of Public Enterprises he has good 
political connections. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who was that Minister? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Minister Lynne Brown at the time the Minister of DPE. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then tell us then after that now you are made 
aware that they say that they had met the Minister did you enquire as to what happened 
at the meeting with the Minister? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair at the time one of the senior managers or senior 
general managers in Eskom who was working in the office of the CEO Mr Brian Molefe 
10 
at the time approached me to indicate that there is meeting.  They got correspondence 
from the Minister’s office so they were contacted by the Minister’s office to indicate that 
there is a meeting and the meeting would take place in Cape Town.  Mr Molefe was 
also invited to the meeting but he could not make it. He was represented at that 
meeting by Mr Freddie Ndou who left Eskom last year but so that is the meeting.  I just 
had verbal feedback from him at the time following the meeting that the – it is basically 
an introducting meeting with the minister and the feedback was that the Minister said 
you must go and contact Eskom and follow Eskom processes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you cannot recall when exactly within your 
timeline that happened? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So it – if I – just on reflection on the timeline is that if I 
look at the timeline – so they met us in 2015 and it was around May that they met us.  
Mr Molefe left Eskom around end of 2016.  So it was probably around middle of 2015 
that this happened.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in the same paragraph you deal with a 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 16 of 191 
 
meeting that you attended with the Minister. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in that meeting there were some issues that the – 
at that stage we – and just for background Chair is that we secure funding from the 
World Bank and there was an issue with one of the projects that we – that Eskom is 
rolling out with regard to the World Bank.  My relevance in that meeting is the World 
Bank given its responsibility, the treasury is the touch point.  I joined that meeting 
accompanied – or I accompanied the Treasurer at the time to that meeting and to 
elaborate Chair is that in the meeting when the Minister started the meeting she in 
10 
passing mentioned that oh the – she met with the Tribus team and she informed them 
that they must follow Eskom processes.  That was that – during that meeting Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 4 you deal with how you 
looked at that proposal.  The very first sentence.  You looked at the proposal by 
Huarong how did you view it?  Was it going to be beneficial to Eskom and if so why did 
you feel that it was going to beneficial to Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the – what we deal with in paragraph 4 it is the 
comment that I make there is that in the initial discussions with both the – with the 
Tribus team and the Huarong Energy Africa there was nothing at the initial experiences 
that raised alarm bells.  It seemed as if it is a legitimate proposal.  They seemed like 
20 
business people.  They had – they had previous dealings with Eskom in a different 
capacity.  So at the initial impression I was not concerned about them and Chair I think 
given the course of the nature of our work we manage and we meet a variety of people 
and some you obviously meet and you realise this is something contentious and so that 
was not my impression at the time. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 17 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I know this is out of sequence but you deal with 
your – the change of your attitude towards the approach in the same paragraph. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay maybe you could just deal with it so that we do not 
have to come back to it. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja Chair and I think also the reason for raising it here 
from my perspective was during the course of the discussions – so the discussion 
started in 2015 the first encounter then we had an engagement with them informally 
through an RFP process.  And then it – things were still following the processes that we 
– that we were used to.  Up until a period where we realised that and also towards the 
10 
end there were certain discussions that were happening with the Chairman at the time.  
He was – at that specific point he was not the chairman Mr Zethembe Khoza he only 
became chairman later in that year.  And then towards the end of the process that 
followed Chair they had direct contact with Mr Shaun Maritz.  I in the meetings that we 
had with them indicated that this is a problem for me.  I also indicated to them that I will 
suspend all activity with them if they continue on this path.  And I will elaborate on that 
at a later stage Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And let us move on.  And then in paragraph 5 you 
repeat what you have said in paragraph 1 about the approach by Huarong.  But then 
you mention certain persons in that paragraph could you just have a look at that 
20 
paragraph and tell the Chairperson the significance of you mentioning those persons in 
that paragraph? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  So Chair the – we received a formal unsolicited 
proposal from them in June of 2016 and this was – and as normal Chair when we do 
engage with external parties we try and impress upon them or we impress upon them 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 18 of 191 
 
that there is a formal process with – that Eskom has to follow from that procurement 
perspective and we also indicated to them when we – they provided unsolicited 
proposal but was also important here Chair is that the particular individuals Mr Rajeev 
Thomas and his colleague Wim Terblanche they had dealings with Eskom prior – 
previously.  They met with other people within Eskom so – and when I say other people 
would be in the – in the capital formation so our capex where we do our capital 
development programmes that is – those are the people and I specifically mention Mr 
Poobie Govender here.  And a variety of things – and a number of people that they 
have met and spoken to. Even – I think even prior to meeting us that was the 
impression that I got. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you – then Eskom decided to issue a RFI.  
Could you just tell the Chairperson about that process what it entails? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  So Chair and this was also a given my period at 
Eskom a new process – not a new process but part of the commercial process normally 
we would issue RFP’s this was an unsolicited proposal and we wanted to make sure 
that there is other better proposals that – because I think their impression also was 
Chair that we – this was an unsolicited bespoke proposal and we could just follow the 
un-bespoke route.  We then wanted to make sure that there is no similar proposals or 
better proposals out there and we issued a RFP to the market Chair.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Before you get to that what are the options that Eskom 
20 
has?  If you are approached by someone unsolicited and can you source for – from 
people without taking or following the procurment procedures or when you are 
approached as in the manner in which Huarong did then what is the best option to 
follow in those circumstances? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The best option to follow would be the RFP process that 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 19 of 191 
 
we have initiated here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And the other forms of funding that we do raise are 
normally market based so it is quite transparent it is in the capital markets.  And this 
was when it is unique or different proposals we would then put it through a RFP 
process Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you have in paragraph 6 just highlight it what 
are the requirements that you wanted anyone who was responding to your RFI to 
meet?  Could you just highlight those for the Chairperson please? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair we highlighted that it should be innovative 
10 
funding.  At this stage Chair Eskom relied a lot on government guarantees to be able to 
secure its funding and so we were looking at funding that would not utilise government 
guarantees.  And then the funding should be greater than 15 billion.  The financing 
does not contravene any of our loan covenants that we have.  Chair there we – 
currently we have a debt book of around 420 billion and we are – certainly want to 
make sure that we aligned to the covenant so that you do not trigger any untoward or 
events of default in relation to the existing book or debt.  Eskom’s solution does not 
require equity so because we are an state owned entity and we cannot do equity of 
specific or equity injection.  Financing option is in line with Eskom’s current costs or 
better.  The financing solution involved reputed organisation with funding track records.  
20 
And then the funding term is attractive to Eskom.  Funding solution can be implemented 
within a reasonable short period. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then in paragraph 7 you deal with the funding plan.  
Could you just tell the Chairperson why - what is a funding plan and who is responsible 
– which department within Eskom is responsible for creation of that plan? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 20 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  So Chair the funding plan is the responsibility of 
the Eskom treasury.  We developed the plan.  And the plan forms part of Eskom’s 
overall corporate plan.  And the plan is basically Chair the programme or the strategy 
that Eskom will embark upon over a five year period.  We then in line with that 
developer funding plan given the organisational financing requirements, the capital 
requirements and also the business requirements.  We develop a funding plan and this 
is the detail of such a funding plan that we have Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just take us through that because it 
becomes relevant when we compare what was being offered and the financial situation 
and position in which Eskom was at the time? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja so Chair basically and this is largely the what we 
have seen over the number of years the combination of funding sources.  So in the 
table Chair there is the domestic bonds and that is largely the bonds that are listed in 
our JSE, government bonds and there are similar other entities that also list these 
bonds.  And Eskom has quite an extensive programme is raising funding in the local 
bond markets.  Then we from time to time Chair would issue bonds or loans in the 
international capital markets where we would go and source funding and issue and list 
bonds in the international markets.  What we also have Chair is our commercial paper 
programme and that is our end funding.  So Money Market what is conventionally 
known as Money Market those would be our commercial paper loans.  We also 
20 
approach and are engaging with development finance institutions like the World Bank 
African Development Bank.  Some of the multilateral institutions and they also provide 
funding.  Chair they have mandates obviously in Africa, in the energy sector, in the 
electricity sector so they have dedicated funding for that.  And then we have export 
credit agencies.  This is basically funding that governments provide to their export 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 21 of 191 
 
orientated companies so that if a company exports to South Africa or is executing a 
project within South Africa in Eskom their government would provide a guarantee so 
that we can source the funding for that.  And then lastly Chair is what we term 
structured products and that is a label that we give to what we would go out from time 
to time to secure funding from what is available in the market such as innovative 
funding sources. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you give a total of all of that in the end, 
what was that amount? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was 43 billion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then – now then you have… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was for a period of five years? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  For five years Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then you, then you deal with the 
responses then to the RFI, RFP Program that you embarked upon and you mention 
who responded to that, how many people were there?  Could you just summarise that 
please? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in the RFI that we received we, we received about 
12 responses and they are listed there under paragraph 8, Chair.  So there was a 
variety of, of responses that we got from Absa, Deloitte Capital, Huarong, Wave, J P 
20 
Morgan, Nedbank, Peu Capital Partners and Total Utilities Management Services, 
Regiments, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Charters, Superstars Group, Afriset 
Investments Ltd. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just to, something that I did not clarify.  Am I correct that 
Huarong was simply set, was a company established purely for the purposes of offering 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 22 of 191 
 
the proposal to, to Eskom am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That that was the, they proposed that this is a structure 
that they set up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And it would provide the service for Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So it was a special vehicle set up for that proposal? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was a structure that they put in place and if, if I look at 
the, from 2015 to date it was something that they were working on.  So it was to 
address a specific requirement of Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then can just moving on to paragraph 
10 
9 where you now start dealing with some of the annexures attached to your, to your 
statement. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  So Chair in, this is the RFP, the RFI Process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And then towards the end of December Chair so part of 
the RFI response that we got there was a term sheet and a term sheet basically is just 
the high level of a framework with what would go into the main agreement that we 
would sign eventually and during December Mr Anoj Singh contacted me.  So before I 
go there Chair is, I have the, the outcome of the RFP Process in my normal 
engagements with him and reporting to him shared with him these responses.  At this 
20 
stage it was, I was not aware if he knew any of these in particular were wrong at this 
stage.  It was unknown to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were reporting to Mr Anoj, Anoj Singh at the time? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Anoj Singh, he, he was, he was the CFO at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 23 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Could you turn to the, to the time, to the 
term sheet that appears at page 31?  It is Annexure AP2.  Could you just read what is 
there and the amount that was being offered and then we will go through some of the 
terms that are critical and that are relevant to the entire statement that that you have 
put up? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So: 
“19 December 2016 strictly privately and confidential term 
sheet asset finances for the purposes of providing a solution for 
the various capital projects at Eskom Holdings Ltd.  Summary 
terms and conditions approximately US$1.5 billion”. 
10 
And that was the heading of the term sheet. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and, and just the, what, what does it say was this a 
binding term sheet at the time and what is, what is, what is contained in that very, 
maybe the three lines, first three lines. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The first three lines it was for discussion purposes and it 
was a non-binding term sheet. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then I would like you to turn over to some of the 
terms that are critical which you are going to have to refer to later on.  If you go to page 
34 there is a facility fee there.  Could you just read out what, what was proposed as a 
facility fee? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “Facility fee of 1.6 percent of the amount of 
the program value is payable by Eskom on signature of 
[indistinct].” 
And [indistinct] refers to an asset lease finance agreement. 
“This is for the development cost and arrangement cost and 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 24 of 191 
 
cost of set up for the EPC Panels.” 
And EPC Panels Chair is the Engineering Procurement and Construction Panels and, 
and the working of the solution. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that that 1.6 percent would be the 1.6 of the US$1.5 
billion? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And how much is that in Rands? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  In, in Rands it is roughly I think $24 million. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then the next one is annual fee, annual 
commitment fee.  How was that? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was eight, 0.8 percent. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That would also be 8 percent of the billions that you are 
offering? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  0.8 percent of 1.5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  1.5 billion, yes and then can you calculate how much that 
was? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That is roughly I think off the top of my head probably I 
think 24, 25 million. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you have a cancellation fee.  You could read that 
paragraph please? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “A cancellation fee of 0.2 percent of the 
amount of the program value shall be payable by Eskom.  If 
Eskom repudiates, terminates or cancels the term sheets once 
the binding term sheet and the mandate letter are signed by 
both parties or accepted by both parties.” 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 25 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And your 0.2 percent would be how much? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The, the 0.2 percent in this case would, of the 1.5 billion 
would be roughly I think 15 billion, $50 million, sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  50? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So it is 20, no sorry, 30 million, sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  30 million.  Thank you and then we have that is the, 
those are the clauses and then so this was, this term sheet is what was being 
proposed, but before you finish with that could you turn to page 37 please Mr Pillay? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you read 2.18 please? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “Escrow account, if the lender so desires 
and without fee subject to the compliance with applicable 
regulations including but not limited to arbitrage regulations the 
proceeds of the loan will be deposited in an escrow account 
acceptable to the lender.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Could you just explain that?  Was Eskom going to 
have control over that account? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The proposal here was that Eskom would, they would 
control the account and the management of that account. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then, sorry before we get to, to the signing of 
20 
this term sheet could you just then tell the Chairperson what happened?  Now you are 
at a point where you have it and you want to deal with it as to what are the processes 
that you followed at that point. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  Chair so in, in December 2016 Mr Anoj Singh 
indicated that he had a call from Rajeev Thomas and the discussion was that to sign 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 26 of 191 
 
the non-binding term sheet and that would give him indications or comfort that he can 
give to his partners that that there is a good working relations and we can proceed with 
the, there is, there is common understanding, if I can call it that around some of the, the 
proposals and, and we can, but it was also important here Chair.  It was obviously sent 
to us, to me to look at it.  I was very uncomfortable with the fact that we are signing 
term sheets.  It is, it is not common for us to sign term sheets in this way.  I raised it 
with Mr Singh and he said it is just a non-binding sheet.  What we did do Chair was to, 
to look at it to make sure that the non-binding nature of it is contained. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Then they processed, oh sorry Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, oh sorry.  They processed, sorry [intervenes]. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Just that they proceeded to sign both Mr Anoj and 
Rajeev Thomas signed.  At this stage also Chair what was, what, what was also 
important is that we as part of the, the legal process that we follow that we need to get 
confirmation that the person who signs is duly authorised to sign.  So it was a 
non-binding term sheet and I think we in that regard there was no formal indication and, 
of that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you talk about a trip then to China.  Who 
attended, who, who, who went to China and what was the reason? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  So Chair we. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you, you sort to satisfy yourselves that there was something 
that said it was not binding? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 27 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where, where do I find that in, in the document? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The first part that I read. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have got it Ms Norman you can just tell me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  If I may just direct the witness.  It, it will 
be at page 52.  Page 52 Chairperson there is a non-binding clause in there.  Thank 
you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Page 52 is the non-binding clause, yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you, could you read it to the Chairperson? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “Non-binding, the term sheet is indicative 
10 
only and not exhaustive and may require that further additions 
and amendments as advised by the respective legal tax and 
advisors it will not be legally binding on any party and it will not 
give rise to enforceable rights and obligates except the terms 
set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 which will be legally binding as 
set out in the last part in signing the term sheet.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Now at this point just in reference to what 
the Chairperson has asked you was the legal, internal Legal Department of Eskom 
involved? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No.  The, it was, we only relied on White & Case to, to 
advise us on this and obviously I for, for my own purposes also looked at it to ensure 
that the non-binding nature of it is contained. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is, is it, is it normal that you would sign things like these 
even if you say, I know that in your evidence you said it was not usual for Eskom to sign 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 28 of 191 
 
term sheets, but this has got legal terms in it?  Is it normal that you would not go to your 
internal Legal Section and say look at this is this appropriate can we sign it? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  So, so the, the, in our case to Ms, Chair the 
question is that we do not normally sign term sheets.  It was not Eskom process to do 
that and it was certainly unprecedented to sign term sheets and we did not, we did not 
go to our legal.  We relied on what White & Case the external legal advice gave us in 
reviewing this. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We are going to deal extensively with that advice, 
because if, if unless there was another advice.  The one that you are talking about is 
where they advised Eskom not to sign? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then I am just trying to understand how then you 
relied on it. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the, the, Chair the, the reliance on that was when we 
received this and even in the signing of this term sheet I updated as indicated earlier 
Mr Singh about the developments that White & Case had reservations around it and his 
view was it is non-binding so why worry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will deal with that Mr Chairperson extensively with 
the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  White & Case opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then after then the signing of the term 
sheet then there is a trip to China.  Could you tell Chairperson about that trip and who, 
who went? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 29 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair the signing of the term sheet happened in 
December.  We were scheduled to go and to China, Mr Singh and I.  We were in 
discussions with the China Development Bank to secure a facility.  We had secured a 
facility of about 5 billion through the Chinese Government, China Development Bank 
and that was part of the negotiations that we embarked on and that trip was extended 
to, to go and meet the Huarong Team as well as an introductory meeting.  Also 
accompanying us and I was part of the delegation or the group was Prish Govender 
and Poobie Govender. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and so the Andre Pillay referred to there in third 
person that is yourself.  Am I correct? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and what happened then in China?  You are 
there now.  You have travelled all the way from South Africa.  What, what was 
discussed and what was agreed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair in the, in the discussion was obviously other 
than my sharing of the agreement and the facility with Mr Singh there he had first 
introduction to the Huarong Team and the proposal.  So he met them personally as part 
of the meeting and they discussed the proposal Chair and what was, what was certainly 
shocking or surprising to me Chair was that he, he hated the transaction.  It did not 
make sense when they explained it to him.  He was almost dismissive of it, but it, what 
20 
was in the experience and in the meeting was also quite telling to me was the, the, the 
Chinese delegation on the other side was not fazed by his actions or reactions or the 
responses that he gave and, and, and only after reflection I realised that this was a 
concern or a red flag to me.  Also in the meeting what was quite interesting Chair is this 
is the first time I am now exposed to the individual who from the Tribus Group that is 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 30 of 191 
 
the political connection and a gentleman by the name of Rex Madida introduces himself 
as a political deployee at that meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now before you went to China what was the attitude of 
Eskom towards the proposal?  I would imagine you would not just travel to China 
without at least discussing and knowing exactly whether you are interested in it, 
whether you want to pursue it or you want to put an end to it.  What, what was the 
attitude of Eskom before you travelled? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It, it was certainly explorative and initialled introduction 
of Mr Singh.  It was also the first time that other than the call that that I understand from 
the discussions with Mr Rajeev the call in December it was the first time that he met 
10 
Mr Singh.  Similarly my colleague Mr Poobie Govender was also, he was also the first 
time that he met Mr Singh during that trip.  So it, for me also Chair was that that is the 
impression, but that this is the first time that they meet each other and, and that is what 
they told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you, you said that somebody was introduced or introduced 
himself as a deployee? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said his name is Rex Madida? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Rex Madida.  He. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you, you did not say everything that you seem to have been told 
20 
about him when he was introduced.  You want to include that if you look at that last 
sentence of paragraph 10 of your statement? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you look at the last sentence of paragraph 10 of your statement I 
think you did not say everything that you are supposed to. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 31 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were told about him or that he told you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  So he. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He introduced himself Chair as a political deployee of 
the ANC in KZN.  So deployed to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that is verbatim almost his words to, to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Then were there any 
10 
agreements concluded in China either or, or otherwise? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No.  So, so, so Chair we had a discussion broadly about 
the structure, the nature, the, the entities that are involved and at the end of the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, before you go, go there.  This meeting was happening in 
China.  Is that right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  In Beijing China, Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Rex Madida who says he is a, a deployee of the ANC in KZN.  
As far as you know how does he come to be part of that meeting? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair, he is part of the, the, the Tribus Group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So he is part of the Tribus Group and they had also 
travelled to China for this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From South Africa? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  From South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he had travelled with them as far as you know.  He had not 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 32 of 191 
 
travelled with the Eskom delegation? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no.  I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You found him there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We found him there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ours was internally approved Eskom paid trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  You will still 
answering the question on whether or not there was agreement with the agreement 
reached. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair so there were no agreements reached.  We largely 
discussed the, the proposal.  Towards the end of the day after the, the first day 
Mr Singh indicated that he is leaving the three of us there.  He is going back to South 
Africa.  He has go, he has been called back.  We had subsequent meetings and we 
were still discussing the, the, the transaction in particular.  They were trying to explain 
to us what is the, the financing and what the cost is.  Just the cost of the financing and 
we, we had quite lengthy discussions around that and that was basically the discussion.  
We, we left them that day.  Went back to our hotel rooms and then came back to the 
South Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then you do in paragraph 12 with the proposal and your 
20 
interactions with Mr Zethembe Khoza. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair what I [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry again.  I may have missed something.  How did that 
meeting end in, in China? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair it was, it was a very cordial meeting.  We 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 33 of 191 
 
greeted and we left and, and important Chair is that subsequent to the meeting I 
received a letter in January from Mr Rajeev Thomas to basically confirm what their 
understanding was of the discussion.  I responded to the letter and, and, and I think 
one of the elements that that I did highlight to him in the, in my response letter to him 
was firstly we will have to follow Eskom processes.  We; that the pricing that we 
discussed is subject to our own internal analysis and, and approval processes and I 
also mentioned to him in, in that letter that we would have to secure Board approval for 
us to go forward on, on this, on this proposal or on this discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the purpose of your trip to China was it not to meet with the 
funders you had, you had raised some money? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  So Chair the first, first day almost a whole day was 
dedicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  To, to that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And so the trip was then extended to accommodate a 
meeting with, with Huarong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and who initiated that meeting with Huarong?  Was it Eskom, was 
it Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Huarong approached us.  They understood I think in 
20 
part of the discussions with us they, they learnt that we were travelling to China and 
then they raised; it was not the first time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We were, we were also in earlier travelling to China they 
also wanted to have a meeting, but our program did not allow for that. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 34 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  The people you were dealing with from this group Huarong they 
were based in South Africa, but they have their headquarters in China or what? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair the, the, the South African. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would they want to meet you in China when they are based in 
South Africa? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is my query. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY: So Chair the, the South Africans are from the Tribus 
Group and they had a consortium with the Chinese partners and they are based in 
China and in Hong Kong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the South African part of the group. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is based in South Africa, but the Chinese leg of the group is based in 
China? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No, now I understand.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just following up on the Chairperson’s 
question you mentioned the letters that were exchanged after the trip.  Maybe let me 
take you there.  If you could go to page 404 and that will be Annexure AP8, AFP8. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 404? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  404 Mr Chairman.  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that will be towards the end of the bundle [intervenes]? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 35 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, it is towards the end yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Annexure AP8.  There is an eight on the, on the, yes.  
You just turn there, thank you.  Could you just read the first line of that letter and I will 
just take you basically to what we, what you agreed in principle.  Okay.  Could just read 
out the first sentence? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  So the, the first sentence: 
“Thank you for your letter dated 18 January.” 
The letter I referred to Chair. 
“We thank you for hosting the delegation, the hospitality, 
10 
generosity and arrangements made is highly appreciated.” 
And then I deal with some of the principles of the, of the transaction and if, if I may. 
“Eskom considered the range of benefits that this proposal 
presents and it is, and for this, these reasons we have resolved 
to pursue this proposal.  We in principle agree with the benefits 
you have listed in the above mentioned letter and we comment 
as follows and then the large commitment volume of 1.5 to 6 
billion provides a significant funding solution for Eskom and 
[indistinct] of funding sources, unguaranteed funding.  This was 
certainly the objective of the request for information issued on 
20 
7 October to which you had responded.  Therefore it is a 
benefit that would largely discount in our analysis.  The 
improved financial management of this, of these projects by 
Eskom but maintaining control of the asset.  Created asset is 
held in a SPV for the duration of the lease period thereafter 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 36 of 191 
 
transferred to Eskom.  The legal accounting and governance 
implications will have to be resolved.” 
So that we did not resolve. 
“The cash flow minimum, cash outflow prior to completion, this 
is a considerable advantage of the proposal, balance sheet.  
These benefits will have to be tested by the accounting 
treatment of the asset to be created.  The long term tenure, 
basically the duration of the facility most likely for 10 years as 
opposed to three to 5 years of a banking facility.  These are 
certainly fair comparisons, but should rather be contrasted with 
10 
the exiting long term unguaranteed debt as Eskom does not 
rely on five to 3 year bank facilities for funding purposes.  
Project based fund allocation provided most efficient use of 
funds, the use were also addressed in comment three.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then in the way forward, because that is 
important. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The way forward also Chair and if I may just touch on 
the pricing comment that I made earlier is that I highlighted; their view was the, we have 
agreed on the pricing and my response was Eskom will based on its own analysis 
evaluate the pricing and engage HEA and then the way forward. 
20 
“As you aware Eskom has signed the indicative term sheet with 
HEA on 21 December that will be presented to the Board 
Meeting scheduled for the 3rd to 4 February for consideration 
and approval for further negotiation and conclusion of the 
facility agreement.  Therefore based on the outcome of the 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 37 of 191 
 
Board Meeting we will be granted the resolution and mandate 
to engage HEA formally.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that letter was a response to the letter that 
appears at page 400.  Am I right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Marked AP7, which you received from Huarong Energy 
Africa. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And in that letter if I may just, the benefits that they were 
offering to you they highlight them.  Could you just read those out? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The benefits that they highlight is and it is in line with my 
letter that I responded to. 
“A large commitment of 1.5 billion non-South African 
Government guarantee required.  Better financial management 
for Eskom without giving up control of the asset created.  Asset 
is held in an SPV for the duration of the lease period thereafter 
transferred to Eskom.  Cash flow minimum, cash out flow prior 
to completion.  Balance sheet no liability prior to completion.  
Long term tenure, most 10 years as opposed to 5 years of a 
bank facility.  Project based fund allocation provide most 
20 
efficient use of funds essentially to get funding without, 
immediately impacting Eskom’s financials and new balance 
sheet.  Potentially Huarong China will need to be, be brought 
in.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If you turn to page 402 they seem to make a final 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 38 of 191 
 
proposal and they tabulate what is it that would remain unchanged from their first 
proposal, page 402.  The same, same, same letter that you are reading from, the next 
page. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry it is AP7? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, it is AP7. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair, the question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The question is if you turn over the page they seem to 
make final proposals to you.  If you read the paragraph: 
“During our discussion…” 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “During our discussion in Beijing we 
10 
highlighted the above to you and further made a final proposal 
with respect to this offer.  HEA will offer a final rate of LIBOR 
plus 720 basis points which is a discount of three basis points if 
and only if the following conditions are met:  all fees and 
charges are described in the term sheet, submissions remain 
unchanged.  We require a formal response from Eskom to our 
proposal.  Once again our offering is a substantial volume and 
value to Eskom’s capital program.  We truly hope your team will 
consider all aspects of this structure as specified above and 
make a decision as soon as possible.” 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then the liable, could you just explain briefly what it 
means. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In simple language. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the, the LIBOR is the London Interbank Overnight 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 39 of 191 
 
Rate that is basically in London at a rate at which banks lend money to one another 
and that is the rate.  Currently it is about 3 percent and, and, and it is, so when you, 
when you look it, it could be at, at, at just that I, at an indicative level 3 percent plus 7.2 
percent. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then, thank you Chair.  Then you take us then to 
what then happened when all of these things came or presented before the BTC and 
the IFC which are the Committees of the Board.  The Board Tender Committee and the, 
and the IFC.  Could you just take the Chairperson through those? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the submission to the Board and my, my 
comments in the letter referring to the, the February date that was in discussions with 
10 
Mr Singh that that is the meeting that will happen.  I, I do not normally attend that 
meeting.  So the, the Huarong submission amongst two other submissions was 
proposed and the, the instruction or request from him to submit it he, he said that he 
wanted to show, demonstrate to the Board what are the issues that we are dealing with 
to resolve some of Eskom’s financing requirements. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and also part of it Chair is the, if you look at the 
proposal it is not just a financing proposal that they lend money directly to Eskom.  It is 
also linked to a, a capital program that this specific money would be used for the 
expansion of that capital and that required as stated in, in that paragraph 12 Chair that 
20 
it required the Board Tender Committee that is responsible for that.  The IFC is just 
responsible for the financing part of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chairperson whether the 
resolution by the IFC which is the Board Investment in Finance Committee, the one that 
that is appearing at page 058 whether that was the resolution that was taken in 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 40 of 191 
 
response to the submission that you made at page, was made by, to it at page 054? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That will be AP3 please, AP3 and. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  AP3? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair the, the resolution, the resolution was that 
we are mandated to negotiate, but not conclude the Financing Agreement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  With Huarong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Who mandated you to do it? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That is the Board IFC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that was signed, if you look at the date? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was signed the 21st of the 6th 2017 and this is an 
extract of the minutes by Suzanne Daniels. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then your understanding then after that was that you 
were supposed to proceed with the proposal and conclude the proposal, what was your 
understanding of the resolution by the IFC? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair my understanding was that we can start 
negotiations but we cannot conclude that this is an agreement that we can sign, that 
was my understanding of proceed but not conclude. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would negotiate up to the level where you would feel 
confident that if this was signed it would be good for Eskom, but you would not sign? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY: We would not sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 41 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then you deal then with the 
corporate plan which is AP4, could you just talk to what you say in that corporate plan 
and why was it necessary and what happened in the preparation of the, of that 
corporate plan.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair, so the corporate plan as explained earlier 
Chair was the five year plan for Eskom, we refer here to the corporate plan that was 
being prepared between January 2017 for submission to – sign off by the Board first 
and then submission to government during February.  During that corporate plan 
submission Chair there was a slight change in what Eskom was doing, we then 
introduced private sector participation programs and in the corporate plan Chair there 
10 
was an allocation made to private sector participation programs in the order of 65billion 
of that program but only about 52billion in the corporate plan was allocated specifically 
to private sector participation Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So before we go further in paragraph 13 there’s 
something that I missed in paragraph 12 you deal with the role that a Mr Themba 
Khoza was playing during the time that he presented the submission to the IFC and to 
the BTC, what was his role there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair at the time and apologies for going back to 
what I indicated is that at the stage Mr Khoza is only an ordinary board member, he was 
the Chair of the Board Tender Committee but he was also a member of the IFC and 
20 
what was also from – I normally would not attend IFC, Mr Singh apologised and 
because of these particular items he requested that I participate in the meeting, but in 
that meeting Chair Mr Khoza made the comment that it’s fine you can bring it to BTC 
but we will approve it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have approved? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 42 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No we will approve it, it’s fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes, so this was even before it was brought to the 
BTC? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Even before it was brought to the BTC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you were still dealing with what was 
happening then, the preparation of that corporate plan, in paragraph 13. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja, so Chair during the preparation of the  corporate 
plan there was the introduction of PSP’s and this was new to Eskom, and the allocation 
was done but the PSP program Chair was also very interesting from my perspective 
that it contained funding and engaging with funders and investors, certainly my 
10 
colleagues raised a concern around it, I was concerned about it, I approached Mr Singh 
to ask so why is this outside of the Treasury.  He made a comment to the extent that 
you are too busy with other things so he has allocated this to a newly formed role under 
the Prish Govender. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then who assisted Eskom in the preparation of the 
corporate plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair at this stage, and I reflected on this comment if I 
may that at this stage it was McKinsey, it was the previous year that it was McKinsey 
and Trillion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  McKinsey? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was McKinsey in 2017 but the McKinsey and Trillion 
assisted us in the corporate plan in 2016. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and why was it necessary for them to assist Eskom 
in drafting its corporate plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   They were there brought in as consultants and I think 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 43 of 191 
 
Chair just from my own experience being within the organisation there was the 
impression created that we are not capable to do this so we will bring outside help in 
and it was also largely my experience of the time that these were the people that 
assisted Mr Singh at Transnet.  They knew each other very well and I think that 
discussion happened, what was also if I may add Chair that the – we were never 
formally as a direct report set down and gave instructions to say these people will help 
you, that was never the experience.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, then this inclusive in the corporate plan is the 
funding plan, am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair.   
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So how did you draft your funding plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the funding plan that we drafted the – we as 
the Treasury so there’s the funding plan in 2016, and the funding plan in 2017, the 2017 
funding plan obviously at this stage we drafted that ourselves but the funding plan in 
2016 was the funding plan that we were told by Mr Singh, or not told by Mr Singh, as I 
said earlier that he did not really share this with us, I was in a meeting, the Trillion and 
McKinsey representatives were in the meeting, we discussed the corporate plan and 
they arrived at our offices in the Treasury to say that they are assisting Mr Singh and 
they need certain information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was that the first time to your knowledge that you got to know 
20 
that they were going to be involved in the preparation of the plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was – in the meeting it was clear when we had 
discussions with them in the room that broadly they are, they were basically helping us 
with everything Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But at the first meeting where the preparation of the plan was 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 44 of 191 
 
discussed did Mr Singh say I’ve brought them in for this or that reason or did they just 
rock up and nobody asked why are you here, what are you doing here? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair nobody asked and we get into the meeting 
and the meeting starts and we discuss what has to happen Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Singh would have called that meeting? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He would have called it, he would have chaired it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I assume that being in the matter you would have taken it that he 
– they were coming with his knowledge or at is invitation? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because obviously being the Chairperson of the meeting if he didn’t 
10 
know about their coming he would have asked them to leave or something, or asked 
them what they were doing here. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And whose responsibility was it to draw up 
the corporate plan and the funding plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So it is the Treasury and I would be largely responsible, 
not largely I would obviously have to sign it off for submission into the corporate plan 
following discussions with Mr Singh around that yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then is it correct that the funding plan is what 
20 
appears at page – in fact the corporate plan as a whole is AP4 Mr Chairperson, it’s that 
thick document and then the funding plan that you’re referring to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I saw the Corporate Plan starts at page 59  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That’s correct at page 60 the actual plan and then it goes 
up to page 383 but reference is going to be made to certain portions of the funding 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 45 of 191 
 
plan, thank you.  Could you please Mr Singh just – Mr Pillay I beg your pardon, could 
you please turn to page 152. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She has apologised Mr Pillay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair I have been called worse Chair, I’ve been called 
Anjay Gupta as well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If you in fact if you start with page 60, what year, financial 
years are those, as they appear on that page? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair it’s for the financial year 2017/18 to 2021/22 Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that’s a five year plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  If you turn to page 152 that’s where the 
funding plan is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  152 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What I would like to find out from you in the drafting of 
this funding plan ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think he’s still looking for it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you still looking for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, page 152. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  152. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Here we go, thank you Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That’s the funding plan. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Now in the drafting of this funding plan are 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 46 of 191 
 
there areas where the wrong proposal was included? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No we did not include that in our funding plan Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then if you go to the page 153, this is where you 
deal with matters such as funding progress, could you just take the Chairperson to 
where what you said when you dealt with the liquidity reserves of Eskom?  Just that 
paragraph. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the liquidity reserves Chair Eskom deems it prudent 
to maintain a liquidity buffer that covers the average three month organisation cash flow 
requirements as at 31 December 2016 Eskom had liquidity reserves of R27billion and 
this excludes committed bank facilities of R6.2billion which serves as a further support 
10 
to the liquidity buffer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then if you go to page 155 you deal with the 
(indistinct) of government guarantees, and Eskom debt could you just highlight the 
areas that are relevant to your evidence to Your Chairperson please. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the relevant and is that Government has 
allocated R350billion as part of guarantees, we at this stage of this report or the funding 
plan we have committed R253billion of that to specific funding and then we had 
available at that stage R97billion and what we were negotiating at the time was 
R82billion of that R97billion Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then lastly under Eskom debt what did you convey 
20 
there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair here we basically just give an overview of the 
debit of Eskom and if I may as at 31 December 2016 the total net interest bearing debt 
for the various domestic and international funding sources amounted to R340billion 
government guaranteed debt currently constitutes 54% of the Eskom total debt and 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 47 of 191 
 
excludes only the drawn portion of the loans and outstanding government guaranteed 
bonds, the undrawn portions of the loans and unissued bonds are included in the 
committed government guarantee amount of R253billion, so we basically just wanted to 
give an overview of the status of the debt at that particular point in time Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And at that stage what was the financial position of 
Eskom, did it look good to you or did you feel that you didn’t need any help or funding 
or was Eskom an ailing entity at that point? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair at this stage the – what happened was that we 
applied to the Regulator for 16% tariff increases from the period 2013 to 2018, the 
regulator only awarded 8% tariff increases and that would have had a significant impact 
10 
on the financial position of Eskom, 2016 I think from if memory serves Chair from 2015 
onward it was a very difficult period for Eskom financially, and certainly the funding that 
we listed here or the liquidity that we list here of 27billion was fairly high it showed that 
in our funding activities we were doing fairly well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Chairperson I have noticed it’s twenty 
past eleven, I don’t know if the Chairperson would like to take the tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will take the short adjournment and we will resume at 
twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson I have 
requested the witness I think the figures that he gave when we were dealing with the 
percentages on the term sheet are not correct.  So with your permission I have 
requested him to recalculate them during the lunch break and just simply submit a 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 48 of 191 
 
piece of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With all the calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you please proceed then Mr Pillay if 
you go to page 162?  There is release of government guarantees.  What does that 
mean and what is the effect of government guarantees being released, could you just 
expand on what is it that you intended to convey there? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair here based on the – apologies Chair.  Based on 
the corporate plan that we were preparing that it showed that the financial position over 
the five year period would improve.  Therefore there would be a less reliance on 
government guarantees to secure the funding.  And also Chair the issue at the time 
certainly my impression given the time that we were doing this from a political 
perspective there was frustration particularly from Mr Singh that we are relying if we 
have to use the guarantees we have to go back to government every time and ask 
them.  And I think it was also the norm at Transnet that they did not have to rely on 
guarantees so part of this was largely a frustration that we constantly we cannot just do 
whatever we want to do.  We constantly have to rely on guarantees.  What we did in the 
20 
treasury Chair under the government release programme was to look at in – as the 
corporate plan and the overall financial position of Eskom improves how would we be 
able to source funding on an unguaranteed basis?  The difference Chair would be too 
specifically that you would get on a guaranteed basis it is easier because you know 
government is standing behind it and if do on a unguaranteed basis you might not get 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 49 of 191 
 
the amounts you were looking for and at the price you were looking for.  But that was 
certainly the move towards unguaranteed portions of that.  Chair also just important 
here to note if I may that it was also a period where we were looking at where Eskom 
was looking at the Nuclear Project and guarantees would have been important to 
secure that.  Also Chair was the at this particular point in time the guarantee 
programme that we had expired on the 31 March 2017.  So it also expired and we 
would have to go to government and ask them to extend it so those were two critical 
points related to the release of government guarantees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But release of government guarantees basically refers to a position 
where you were given a government guarantee but you no longer need it. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   You do not need it and you do not utilise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you do not – you are fine. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Financially for purposes of that particular project. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Does not also having a 
guarantee, a government guarantee also used as a safety mechanism because 
20 
government knows exactly what you getting yourself into because it has provided 
guarantees.  And what – and the risks that are attached to unsecured – unguaranteed 
lending because government does not know what you are doing?  You go and you 
source funding it is – there is no guarantee.  Government does not know how much 
debt you amassing at that point.  Am I correct in my understanding of how they work? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 50 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair if I may?  The – so the use of the government 
guarantee obviously gives them a better credit quality that is basically standing behind 
you and Eskom has two ways – we are implicitly guaranteed because we are a state 
owned entity and we are explicitly guaranteed through this 350 so that is the.  The 
issue on just going and doing what we want to do without the government guarantees 
we have a borrowing programme that we submit.  Government has to sign that off.  So 
the notion of just going and doing what you want is not really true because you still 
have to go to government and say we are encumbering government Eskom through this 
facility so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Basically government guarantee to an entity such as Eskom is really 
10 
for purposes of assuring lenders, potential lenders or investors or funders that the – if 
they give you loan they will be paid back. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And also I think important Chair is that government is 
also basically close the abuse of the guarantees is I can call it that that is – that it is 
specific just to our capital programme.  So we cannot use the guarantees to go and 
raise money for operational purposes such as salaries.  But you are correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  And then – you then in paragraph 
15 am I correct that you would like to correct the date there that appears in the first 
20 
sentence of that?  Instead of 2019 to read 2017. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  On my statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Back to your statement please.  Back to your statement 
paragraph 15.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry please which date? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 51 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I think we should have a little bit of air conditioner. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes [indistinct] been hot. [laughing]  Thank you.  Thank 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think some will say more than a little bit but… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Pillay? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair just to reference which – the date Chair? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The date 14 March 20 – did you – is it 2019 or 2107? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No this is 2017 apologies. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  2017.  You would like to correct that date?  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have it correct on mine.  So I must have corrected it when I 
was reading the statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Here you deal with the signing of 
another term sheet, am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And why was it done and what were the reasons 
advanced for doing it? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair in this instance the – and this was in March you 
may recall Chair we travelled to China in – on – in January. We have the board meeting 
that says negotiate but do not conclude.  They visit South Africa in the Huarong 
delegation visits South Africa – visits South Africa in March and there is a letter to Mr 
Singh that suggests they are here they would like to have a meeting and sign the term 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 52 of 191 
 
sheet.  And this was relayed to us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean at that stage are they still talking about the term sheet – 
signing the time sheet? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Signing of a binding term sheet yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A – oh – binding one this one time.  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  And Chair I think also the – so we were then given 
the term sheet.  We looked at it.  And we wanted to make sure that at least that there is 
the non-binding elements to it in that term sheet.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was giving – who was receiving the term sheet? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So we were receiving the term sheet from Huarong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay their proposed term sheet? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes their proposed term sheet for signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And they have also tried in their attempt to water it down 
slightly so that it looks more binding in nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We also – I mean – we received it and we were told by 
Mr Singh we are – he wants to sign the term sheet.  So we again Chair if – we reviewed 
it, we looked at it with white and case and we were looking at some of the elements in 
there that still suggest to us this is not – we – it is – there is some binding ele- non-
20 
binding elements to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So largely – was it largely similar or identical to the non-binding one 
that had been signed or was there a vast difference between the two? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  There was significant difference between the two Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  The difference is related to any issues of importance 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 53 of 191 
 
that you want to highlight? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in particular they took out in the clause the non-
binding conditions they took that out.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  What we – what we insisted on was that it still stipulates 
that the term sheet will be superseded by the signing of the terms would be 
superseded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  There is also indications that the –it is only indicative 
and that what we also insisted on Chair was that we maintain that we would need all 
10 
the government approvals that is required for it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the signing of a term sheet such as this a normal step prior to 
signing a contract? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair.  It is certainly – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the term sheet actually it is called a term sheet not time sheet. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It is certainly not normal to ask Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And it is not as I have indicated Chair that it was – it was 
not something that we do as part of our process in the treasury that you would sign the 
term sheet that is binding.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you find out or did you understand what the need was to sign 
a so called binding term sheet if in any event there was still going to have to be a 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 54 of 191 
 
contract to be signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the – it was quite clear that the signing of the 
binding term sheet suggest that if the – we sign the binding term sheet – if we sign the 
contract the fees as stipulated in the term sheet becomes payable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why not wait until you sign the contract? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was our concern as well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And certainly at this stage Chair we relayed that to Mr 
Singh even the concerns of white and case we relayed that to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Following up on the 
Chairperson’s questions maybe we should go to that term sheet at page 385.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Excuse me Chair the? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  385.  That will be AP5 maybe if you look at the divider. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that the one that you are referring to?  And if you turn 
20 
to page I just want to see where the signatures are – page 394. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  394? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Is that the area where there are signatures? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Who signed that document? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 55 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It is signed by Mr Anoj Singh on the 14 March of the 
third month in 2017. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And Mr Sathlaseelan Gounden of the Huarong the 
chairman of Huarong Energy Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes was it signed here in South Africa? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was signed in South Africa.  It was signed in our 
offices. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And if you go to this document just to highlight 
certain things.  You have told the Chairperson that you said it was indicative but if you 
10 
look at the – you read the very first paragraph just under the shaded area that has got 
approximately $1.5 billion.  Could you just read that into the record please? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  
“ The parties agreed that this term sheet shall [indistinct] it legally 
binding obligations on each party and shall be in full force in 
effect upon its signature until such time as the asset loan 
agreement and the other related definitive agreements are 
concluded between the parties.  Unless inconsistence with the 
context or safe where the contrary is expressly indicated a 
reference to a party includes the party’s successors entitled and 
20 
permitted assigned and nominees.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and if you go to paragraph 5 on the same page what 
does it read? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It indicates in the introduction: 
“Please note the terms and conditions set out in the term sheets 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 56 of 191 
 
are indicative in nature and do not purport to summarise all the 
conditions covenents and other provisions that would be 
contained in the definitive legal document which shall be 
satisfactory to all parties.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Just above the signatures at page 394 could you 
just read what is contained in there?  Kindly – beginning with kindly. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   
“Kindly sign the space provided thereby accepting the terms and 
conditions of the term sheet.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So what were the reasons given by Mr Singh when 
10 
he wanted to have this signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the reasons here was it is – I have explained 
the context and the concerns that we had and his view again was it is a non-binding 
term sheet they are here it shows our cooperation so we can sign. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And when it was being signed or about to be signed was 
this referred to your internal legal department? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when he said that to you did you not point out that right at the 
beginning it says quite clearly it is binding? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja he was aware of the – of that Chair.  I mean – we.. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  From the first term sheet he was aware of our 
reservations and concerns around this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he still said it was non – not binding? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Not binding he was comfortable with it Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 57 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he explain to you the basis – his basis for saying it is non – it is 
not binding when it clearly says it is binding? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He never explained?  And you said your concerns with it were mainly 
that it still had non-binding fissures or what were your concerns again if you can 
articulate them again? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  My concerns were it is obviously the binding elements to 
it but the comfort that I took Chair was the non-binding commitments as indicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So the – those elements which you regarded as non-binding 
the fact that they were non-binding was to Eskom’s advantage because then Eskom 
10 
was not going to be bound – legally by them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  By them yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that – are you saying they were non-binding fissures because 
the document said so somewhere in regard to certain specific fissures or is it their 
nature that makes you say they were non-binding?  Why do you say there were some 
non-binding fissures? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair certainly my understanding or interpretation of 
this the – it was as per paragraph 5. 
“Please note that the terms and conditions set out in the term 
sheets are indicative in nature and do not purport to summarise 
20 
all the conditions and covenants, warranties and other 
provisions.” 
So there what was the concern was the – and we subsequently discontinued to engage 
Huarong on this in particular the fees related to this facility Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry from what page were you reading? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 58 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  385 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right at the bottom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please note that the terms and condition set out in this term sheet 
are indicative in nature that is one and do not purport to summarise all the conditions, 
covenants, warranties and other provisions which would be contained in definitive legal 
documentation which shall be satisfaction to all parties. 2 are in respect of certain 
special conditions which are in addition to other standard terms and conditions typical 
of the transaction of this nature and remains subject to completion of requisite due 
diligence constitute a statement of mutual intent of the parties with respect to the 
10 
contemplative transaction.  [laughing].  Well the last part I read seems to suggest that 
maybe this document may have been intended to be a document indicating a serious 
attention between the parties to conclude an agreement in the future.  But that first – 
that opening portion which says it is binding then goes against that. So it seems to have 
some inconsistencies within itself.  Okay but you say that what gave you comfort was 
what part what I read – part of what I have read? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That Chair and also if I may the roman numeral three iii 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That states: 
“The constitute of statement of mutual intent of the parties with respect to the 
20 
contemplated transaction and does not contain all matters upon the agreement which 
must be reached in order for any transaction to be consummated and therefore does 
not constitute a binding commitment with respect to the transactions although 
undertaking set forth in confidentiality and other will be binding upon the parties.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that last bit you have read seems to suggest that there are certain 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 59 of 191 
 
parts of the document that are binding and other parts that are not binding?  The ones 
are not confidentiality and other other are binding.  Okay alright so maybe that is what 
Mr Singh also based his view on? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I am not sure Chair it certainly that was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible that he also looked at what you looked at and for that 
reason – for the same reason as you thought well it is not binding.  So that is possible it 
seems to me. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then if you to page 386 of 
that same document paragraph 7 or clause 7 thereof if you read that what does it say? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   
“Notwithstanding the afore-going however in the event of 
cancellation of the proposed financing agreements after signing 
this term sheet the cancellation fee referred to below will 
20 
immediately become due owing and payable by Eskom.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that?  What clause? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 386 Mr Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh number 7? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 60 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Number 7 that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So it says the cancellation fee becomes due owing 
and payable after – if you cancel? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And the – then it goes back to the amounts that we 
have read earlier on the percentages that you were supposed to pay off the amount 
that was to be … 
Yes.  And the – then it goes back to the amounts that we have read earlier on the 
percentages that you were supposed to pay off the amount that was to be … 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes because that – those amounts that is 0.2% that you 
spoke about earlier.  Now you look at this – you are told that you must – we are going 
to sign this term sheet and you looking at these conditions you are concerned about 
them.  Why did you not go to your legal department internally?  I am not talking about 
outside legal advice I am talking about internally.  Why did you not at that point say to 
legal Mr Singh says you must sign this thing I have got some concerns about it. It my – 
these terms might not be favourable to Eskom?  Why did you not do that at that point? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair so the – at this stage I admit that we relied on 
white and case for that. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The other aspect Chair that is also important at this 
stage the legal of Eskom also reports into Mr Singh largely and he was aware of the 
fact that we required this legal assistance.  He agreed that we can rely on white and 
case for that. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 61 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  We are going to deal with the white 
and case advice shortly.  So then this gets signed and what was then the next step after 
the signing of the second term sheet now we have the first one that was signed in 
December now we have the second one that is also signed and the percentages if I am 
correct they remain the same on the clauses that we referred to earlier, am I correct?  
That is the percentages to be paid? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For due diligence, for cancellation, yes for commitment 
fees all of those remain the same? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay thank you.  And then thereafter what happened? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the – it was signed.  The process that was 
followed still based on the – the process that I followed based on the board resolution 
was negotiate and do not conclude.  So even the term sheet Chair we discussed that 
even after the signing by Mr Singh there was still up until the last point unhappiness 
with some of these or discontent with some of the terms particularly the financing of 
that.  And we raised it with white and – with Huarong at the time.  So certainly from my 
perspective the board resolution was negotiate but no – do not conclude.  That was my 
approach to it Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And I may Chair also just – if I may Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Just context.  The one thing that – and this is a personal 
being in the organisation at the time is a couple of points Chair is that Mr Singh was 
going to sign this thing regardless of what I say.  
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 62 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was my experience.  What also an issue at the time 
Chair was I was responsible for the treasury.  In that particular earlier that month he 
arrived in the office and I was sitting in a meeting with external people he arrive in the 
office and handed me an envelope and his words to me were “here is a love letter for 
you.”  I concluded on the meeting but was quite anxious to see what is in the letter in 
the envelope.  In the envelope was the financial profile of one of my colleagues called 
Marius Homewood.  I read or I looked at it and went to his office to ask “What is the 
situation with this letter?”  His words to me were: “Tell him to leave, you must get rid of 
him.”  And there was no basis for it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was somebody reporting to you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That reported to me at the time.  And the instruction was 
“you must get rid of him”.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What was his name again? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Marius Homewood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So he instructed that you must get rid of him.  I took it 
quite serious Chair and I – and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from your – from your point of view this was like out the blue? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was out of the blue but I will give context Chair.  It was 
20 
part of what we saw in the organisation happening.  My predecessor may have been in 
the same situation.  There was another colleague that was – even though in the public 
domain we present this as if it is amicable and agreed to that people would leave 
because they are not willing to cooperate.  And this was the similar situation with Mr 
Homewood.  In an executive forum of probably 300 people at least Chair the discussion 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 63 of 191 
 
around this corporate plan that we discussed now and there was a particular question 
around the release of government guarantees that we discussed earlier and he asked 
someone from treasury – I was unfortunately not there, he asked Mr Homewood to give 
response and Mr Homewood was quite clear that we can only achieve this if you as in 
my own words Chair “if you as the leadership fix this place” and that is my own words 
and I do not think that Mr Singh took it quite well and that was the basis of coming and 
saying to me “get rid”.  So that was the environment that we were working in.  It was 
also reflective of the – at some point – so when my predecessor left Chair the treasurer 
of Eskom would chair the alcol the assets and liability committee.  When Mr Singh 
arrived he proposed to chair those meetings and in some of those meetings he would 
10 
tell us as the treasury team if you cannot do this I will get other people do what I want.  
And that was the environment that we were in Chair.  And just to give some context that 
he would sign it regardless of what we would say about it.  And if you do not cooperate 
that might be your fate.  So there was also consistently throughout that period an 
element of self-preservation and also Chair maybe a bit of over confidence from my 
side to think that if you leave they are going to bring people in that will do whatever they 
want to do.  I just wanted to give that context Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the name of your predecessor? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Her name was Caroline Henry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  We have dealt 
with annexures AP7 and AP8 those are the letters you exchanged between the 
Huarong group after your trip to China.  If you go to paragraph 16 this is where we deal 
with white and case advise and I would like to go to that because of what is it that they 
communicated very clearly to Eskom.  Am I correct that you met with these lawyers on 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 64 of 191 
 
the – according what they say on the 12 March 2017 or you met with before that date? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair.  [indistinct] reference. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  AP9 I beg your pardon.  I beg your pardon it is AP9.  AP9 
that would be page 407. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where did you meet them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I met them in London and this was the introducting 
meeting.  Mr Singh and I met and we had meetings to see investors in London.  They 
came to the hotel that I was – where we were staying and to discuss this particular 
transaction. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.T you Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is that – the Huarong Transaction or another Transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This particular transaction and what they were work – 
assisting us on Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh a different transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no this Huarong Transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Only the Huarong Transaction? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes to my knowledge yes that is what … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  On that page which is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do they represent Huarong? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 65 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no they were representing us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they were representing you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  Huarong was represented by Norton Rose at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Assisted them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Mr Chairman the comments that they make are 
very important to what you are going to be dealing with later on.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With your leave may I just ask the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To read most of those? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you please read from what they say to 
you – this was written to you by Mr Adrian Lawrence. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just read out what he says in the – in 
that letter – in that email sorry. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So in, the email was from Mr Lawrence on 12 March at 
20 
20 past, 22 minutes past 10 to Andre Frank Pillay and he cc’d his colleague, 
Stuart Matty, Huarong Term Sheet. 
“Dear Andre, it was great meeting you on Friday and as 
mentioned please find below some initial thoughts on the term, 
term sheet.  As discussed it will be helpful if you would provide 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 66 of 191 
 
details of Huarong, other personnel you have met and this 
would give some better sense of Huarong China’s subsidiary 
involvement.  You will note below we have also suggested 
Huarong, HEA to suggest, to be requested to provide further 
information to this in this regard given this would appear to be a 
first one of the first moves of China Huarong outside of China 
into Africa.  Senior involvement would be likely.  Please do let 
me know if anything further at that stage would be helpful.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and following that they raise some concerns about it.  
Could you just highlight what those were? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair so, so they, when they looked at the, the term 
sheet Chair and this was if, if we look at the time.  This was now before the signing of 
the, the term sheet. 
“As discussed the term sheet is onerous on Eskom and 
ambiguous at best as to what is being offered by HEA and so 
our strong advice is not to sign at this stge.  This is particularly 
the case given.  It is expressed to be binding and provides for a 
high cancellation fee which is highly unusual.  Instead of 
looking at the mark up of the term sheet it may make sense to 
consider clarifying certain key thresholds queries at this stage 
20 
including the term sheet status by HEA has been set up to 
provide asset finance solutions for Eskom.  Further details 
should be requested.  The background to Huarong setting up a 
subsidiary before discussions with Eskom commenced and 
what is this subsidiary will be doing other than dealing with 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 67 of 191 
 
Eskom.  The term sheet states China Huarong is a parent 
company of HEA.  HEA should provide a structured diagram 
and details of the background of its Directors to justify this.  
Note that HEA does not appear to be a China Huarong 
subsidiary on its website.  HEA stated as the lender for the 1.5 
billion up to 6 billion.  HEA should identify the source of these 
funds and when and how they will be communicated.” 
Should I continue? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes please. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “So the term sheet states HEA has the 
10 
interest of international funders and investors including CDB.  
Does this mean that China Huarong is not funding HEA?  It 
seems unlikely HEA CDB would fund through HEA for the on 
lending and so then is HEA simply an arranger equally?  Would 
i.e. CDB accept a due diligence of HEA?  Will China Huarong 
guarantee the obligations of HEA?  Who will guarantee the 
obligations of the SPV to EPC Contractors?  Who will cover 
costs overruns, constructions risk, delays?  To be closely 
examined by what HEA brings to Eskom.  It appears, a, it 
appears any certainty of construction costs is through the 
20 
arrangement of specific EPC Contractors, turnkey, EPC and 
model mentioned in the term sheet and so will be priced in that, 
by, by the EPC Contractor.  It is unclear that HEA will be 
bringing money to the, to the structure.  If HEA is simply 
providing arranger service it should be judged including as to 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 68 of 191 
 
the track record in comparison to other arrangers and priced 
on, on that basis.  Eskom to consider careful the involvement of 
HEA in EPC arrangement given Eskom is ultimately paying the 
projects and it is Eskom’s projects that are involved.  In 
particular noted that HEA looks at preapproved EPC 
Contractors and Eskom could have concerns with i.e. all 
Chinese EPC Contractor tenders and then HEA reserves the 
right to take the, the final decision on selecting the EPC 
Contractor.  Presumably the four EPC Contractors and, and 
one EPC Company HEA referred to would happy deal with 
10 
Eskom directly and so access arranged by HEA replicates what 
Eskom can do also.  The structure contemplated is effectively a 
limited recourse structure financing with possessory security in 
HEA would hold the shares in the SPV and will hold the finance 
assets during the duration of the loan with various other 
security features i.e. escrow accounts to be considered further 
how much secured financing will fit in with Eskom’s 
undertakings with other lenders i.e. negative pledge issues.  
The term sheet appears to be a blend of various different 
concepts and ideas and terms from other sources and does not 
20 
fit together very well.  Passed experience HEA and/or its 
personnel in banking such structures to be confirmed.  Term 
sheet key financial terms.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “Financial terms appear onerous generally 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 69 of 191 
 
including based on 1.5 billion were applicable.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Sorry.  No, no I am just going to ask you to just highlight the 
concerns just in terms of topics. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because we have dealt already with the percentages.  
So if you just, the cancellation fee was one of the matters that they were concerned 
about. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair so the financial terms, the key financial 
terms. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They raised concerns with that and the, the financial 
structure.  They raised concerns with those. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So and in fact they raised the cancellation fee 
expressly.  They raised signature fee of the alpha, the due diligence fee, [indistinct] 
commitment fees, interest rates, security deposit.  So all of, and early prepayment, so 
all of these matters are raised by White & Case? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Case, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So this I see is two days before the signing of the. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Term sheet, am I correct?  So this was addressed to 
20 
you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So who did you give this document to when you received 
it? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair the, I mean it was cc’d to, to; so it was to 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 70 of 191 
 
me.  I, I; the term sheet I, I, I forwarded this to I think to my colleague [indistinct] the 
document.  I may have sent this to him, but I have also discussed this document with 
Mr Singh.  He was in London when we met with them.  He joined the discussion, 
introductions took place and I raised that this are the concerns that that they were 
raising. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now from the reading of the White & Case 
summary as you have put it there is nothing in the term sheet that addresses these 
concerns.  Am I right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  At, at, at the term sheet. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The signed one? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The signed one, no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So what means is that although they had altered you and 
Mr Anoj Singh to these concerns the term sheet was signed in the manner in which it 
was and in the manner in which they were criticising? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes and, and with those non-binding elements as 
indicated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  No what, what I am trying to understand is where in 
this email from White & Case is it indicated that you could sign that or that term sheet 
could be signed, because you did not sign it, but where is it in here that it could be 
signed? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so not in this term sheet.  There is, there is an email 
from them, correspondents from them that they have highlighted some of the, the 
changes to the term sheet. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  No, but in this one there is nothing [intervenes]. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No it is not here.  It is not here. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 71 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In fact in this one it is actually cautioning you, no. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  It is, it is certainly saying no, do not go head. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but then two days later it was signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Signed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and you say Mr Singh was at this meeting.  
These concerns that they raised in the letter were those raised exactly the same? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Concerns were raised at the meeting? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  At, at the meeting the high level concerns in terms of 
conceptually what, what, what they were unhappy with, but these concerns I certainly 
10 
raised with him in terms of the specifics of what they were concerned about. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and, and at what point if any at any point was this 
ever shared with your legal internal? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was shared with our legal internal at a, at a later stage.  
So, so what happened Chair was the; so after the term sheet signing and again I refer 
back to, I was in the IFC Board Meeting.  The only and, and not even Mr Singh, the 
Board for me is the, is the ultimate decision maker.  The Board said to me I was in that 
meeting.  I represented, negotiate but not conclude. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And I took. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I took that I agreed with Mr Singh even though there was 
these concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 72 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The Board said I must negotiate, but not conclude. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And the intention was to, to, to resolve some of these 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If we could not resolve it then we go back to the Board 
and say we cannot resolve certain issues.  We are not happy to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Now let us move forward then.  You mention 
in paragraph 16. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going back to his statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To, to his statement.  I beg your pardon, yes Mr Chair, 
page 6.  You mention Mr Koko in the last sentence of that paragraph.  What are you 
saying about him there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the, the, the situation at the time was we are 
going to, we are going to sign.  It is not, it is non-binding it is just a show of the 
cooperation.  At this stage Mr Koko was the CEO, the Interim CEO of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That that is now you are talking about. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  At. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you say in paragraph 16 of your statement? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  16, Chair towards the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay right. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Singh’s attitude was, Mr Anoj Singh his attitude towards the term 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 73 of 191 
 
sheet was that it was to be signed?  It was going to be signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Be signed, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Koko’s attitude was also that it was to be signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  To be signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair and, and, and just for completeness is that after 
the review as I have explained I sent an email with this to Mr Singh to say given my, the 
looking at the non-binding nature he was going to sign it in any case regardless of my, 
my input.  This is the term sheet for signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in your memo that you are talking about are you saying you 
10 
forwarded the term sheet to him? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  With, with the amendments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With this amendments that you were suggesting? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Based on the White & Case advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, but did you, did you say anything about what your attitude 
is to, at that stage, to it being signed?  I know that earlier you had made your position 
clear, but when you were sending that memo did you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Include that as well what your attitude was?  Did you say well you 
sign if you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no, not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wanted to sign or. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 74 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I still say do not sign. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you just said nothing about signing or not signing? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I, I said this is, for signing this is the, the term sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  From, from, from what I can recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Also Chair what was my concern and maybe I must 
allow for the process Chair to, to deal with that element. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no, not that is fine but, but you, you say that as at that stage 
10 
and probably earlier than that your understanding was that your view as to whether it 
should or should not be signed was not going to change anything? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, it was not going to change, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And Chair to confirm if I may that my discussion and 
negotiations with White & Case was certainly to address all those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The concerns of White & Case our own concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The structure of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The, the process that followed was certainly to deal with 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 75 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chair and then in paragraph 
17 could you tell the Chairperson what you, then the next plan was? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Huh-uh.  So Chair the, the, again back to the, the 
resolution that I had this was the, the information that we took to the, to the meeting, 
the Board Meeting of, of February was the resolution negotiated, do not conclude and 
this was on an RFI basis.  Eskom following its processes Chair does not conclude 
anything or I was, I was, it was introduced to me that you can contract from an RFI.  I 
was very uncomfortable with it.  I engaged with and, and with, with the commercial 
colleagues and I was very uncomfortable.  I made it known to Mr Singh we are not 
going to proceed until we do an RFP. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that was, and that was issued on, after the signing 
of this indicative term sheet.  An RFP had still to follow the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But then this, this follows a day after you had given, you 
were given the advice by White & Case? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, it looks. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody has done anything about the air con. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That that is also my feeling Mr Chairperson.  I do not 
20 
know, but I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
[Chairperson talking to unknown person] 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I, I think there was a report back ready to be given to me as 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 76 of 191 
 
soon as there was a break for me to be given. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am told that apparently there is no electricity now.  We are 
operating on the basis of a generator and that apparently there is no air con when we 
operate like that.  So [laughing] so. 
[Laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I do not know whether Mr, Mr Pillay can do anything about that. 
[Laughing] 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I have done my best during the break Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is interesting that we have not had load shedding for some 
10 
time until when we are hearing witnesses from Eskom. 
[Laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, we, we will make, make do with what we can. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  The question that I put to you was 
this proposal that you cannot contact without having an RFP happens a day after the 
meeting with White & Case? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And apparently a day after you had received 
20 
communication at least? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From White & Case? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Now what, what, who did you intend at this point to contract 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 77 of 191 
 
with? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair, just clarify. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At this point who did you intend to contact, to contract 
with? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So at, at this stage Chair the RFP went out to the market 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So we, we received the, the initial RFIs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And this was now to see what RFP responses we get 
10 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and we certainly I think the, if, if the Huarong 
transaction was not part of the RFP from our process would not have been entertained, 
but it was for the wider market RFP, but not just bespoke for a particular; it was not a 
closed RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did, did the RFP mean that Huarong could also make proposals? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just open to anybody? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was open to anybody Chair and my insistence was 
20 
that they must submit even though they are now following this seemingly parallel 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They must submit because our legal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 78 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Dictate that we should do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And they did so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So this feature of this, these steps that were taken relating to 
the signing of these term sheets created the impression at least that it was intended 
that a contract would be signed with them.  Is that right?  Would you say that is fair 
comment? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That that was certainly their expectation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I do not know what Mr Singh’s expectation was at the 
10 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  As, as my superior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But it is certainly not my expectation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But I, we had to follow the due process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying is when one looks at the terms of the term, 
term sheet, term sheets it does not seem to me why you would sign the term sheet if 
you do not contemplate that you may or will sign a contract in due course with that 
20 
entity.  Do, do, do you understand that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any entity with whom you sign this type of term sheet, term sheet 
could legitimately say to somebody we are having discussions with Eskom with a view 
to signing a contract.  Is it not or anyone who reads what is written there would be 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 79 of 191 
 
justified in thinking that it looks like there is a contemplation at least that there might be 
a contract between the two depending on the discussions and negotiations that might 
follow and maybe other things? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you, do you think that is a fair? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Comment to make? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and, and, and would you say that having that kind of arrangement 
as expressed in that term, term sheet is inconsistent with a process where other people 
10 
are invited to make proposals unless they are also going to go through the same 
process of term sheets? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and as, if I may Chair it is also uncommon for us to 
sign term sheets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair, but I would like to Mr Pillay to read 
the reasons why at this point you were suggesting that the must be an RFP that that 
had to be issued, because you, it is, it is quite specific as to why you felt that a 
20 
particular, in fact please just read it without me putting words into your mouth.  Could 
you just read paragraph 17? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Paragraph 17. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  “Eskom also maintained that it cannot 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 80 of 191 
 
contract from an RFI process and that the proposal had to be 
subjected to an RFP process.  I engaged Mr Singh on this 
matter and we issued an RFP to the market on 13 March 2017.  
Eskom’s Treasury indicated that it established the appointment 
of a supplier of, for innovative finance solution could be made 
on the RFPs issued.  Hence, hence the, the RFP was issued.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then whose proposal were you [intervenes]? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry, could not, sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could not, yes.  Whose proposal were you referring to in 
that paragraph? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The process that that the proposal had to be, on, on this 
specific one Chair was the Huarong one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So in other words you are saying to them you cannot 
contract to Huarong. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This is to Mr Singh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, to Mr, you are saying to Mr Singh you cannot 
contract to Huarong until you have gone the RFP route? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  So. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Is that what you, you are conveying there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  What, what we wanted to convey that generally that the 
general process is that you cannot contract from an RFP, an RFI.  That is my 
understanding of the, the, the [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must go through an RFP first? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 81 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Everyone must go through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Who does it; regardless of who you are and how you 
came in.  You need to go through that process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but then the last sentence says: 
“ET indicated they established that the appointment of a 
supplier for the innovative finance solution could not be made 
on the RFI issued.  Hence the RF, RFP was issued.” 
Now who were you referring to?  Who was the supplier for the innovative finance 
supplier there? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the, the innovative finance solution there, remember 
the RFP was issued for innovative financing solution. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then does the proposal of Huarong fit in within that 
concept? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  So everything that we have in that paragraph the 
proposal and we know the substance of that proposal. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Proposal, yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That fits in within what you were proposing that do an 
RFP. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  P, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Following upon my earlier. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 82 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Question was it wrong for a term sheet to be, to be signed with 
anybody in terms of Eskom processes if ultimately the transaction is one that required 
an, an, an RFP? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It, it, certainly Chair. I can confirm that.  It is not Eskom 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was, it was wrong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In, in that situation, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then what became of that RFP process? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the RFP process was, was issued.  We received the 
responses and following from the responses the, the Huarong proposal was still in that.  
It was still one of the proposals Chair that the, the, the Board resolution, we did not go 
back to the Board.  It was part of the proposals that was evaluated and shortlisted.  So 
we continued as on the Board proposal to negotiate but not conclude. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now then in paragraph 18 you deal with the 
memorandum by Mr Calib Cassim.  What was the purpose of that memorandum? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The, Chair and, and, and just for clarification this is now 
a, a, a period from March.  Mr Singh has now left the organisation.  Mr Cassim is now 
the Acting Financial Officer appointed at the end of July.  So this is an initiative by 
20 
Huarong and certainly one of those initiatives Chair that they, there was a, a Brics 
Summit happening in China.  Our Interim CEO, Mr Johnny Dladla, and the Chairman, 
Mr Zethembe Khoza were scheduled to attend the Brics Summit and during, in the run 
up to the summit we were presented or discussed with Huarong.  I also participated in 
the meeting.  There was a scheduled meeting between myself and Mr Rajeev Thomas 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 83 of 191 
 
to discuss this term, this binding, non-binding cooperation agreement, but certainly in 
his email as well Chair his, his emphasis was on the signing of the, the, the cooperation 
agreement, but also the signing of the, of the, the loan agreement.  In, in our discussion 
I removed the fact, the signing of the loan agreement, because we have not gone 
through our full processes.  The, also we looked at the, the cooperation agreement to 
make sure that it does not contain any commitment whatsoever.  Our legal, our internal 
legal has looked at.  White & Case has looked at it and they reviewed it to make sure 
that it does not bind anyone, because my personal experience in the term sheets wold 
not want to be repeated here and we removed the insistence from them to sign the loan 
agreement.  Also Chair important to, to highlight here is that during the trip and before 
10 
the trip Mr Johnny Dladla and Mr, Mr Singh it would have certainly been inappropriate 
for me to, to string them along.  We, we highlighted to them the risks and the issues 
that we have been having with these transactions particularly the signing of the term 
sheets.  Fortunately Mr Dladla and Mr Cassim at this stage agreed with us and, and 
when they got to China the process with these term sheets Chair they follow a 
diplomatic process or bureaucratic process where the term sheet that is agreed upon 
goes to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.  It makes its way 
formally to the various Presidents who would sign off on it, whatever form or whatever 
document it is and that was the intention and that was largely driven by the, the 
Huarong Group.  They were, were driving that whole process.  Mr, Mr Dladla Chair in 
20 
the, in the, in the process of departing we, we engaged with him and he was certainly in 
agreement with us.  So this, this, this agreement ended up not being signed, this 
cooperation, Agreement of Cooperation Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  From what you are saying then you said look 
because your processes that is the Treasury or Eskom processes had not been 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 84 of 191 
 
completed therefore no agreement could be signed accept for the cooperation one that 
was proposed, but then there is correspondence marked AP11 where Eskom applied 
for exchange control approval from the Reserve Bank on 31 July 2017.  Now this 
happens three days after the proposal of the cooperation agreement.  At this point that 
is when the approval is sought from SAB. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Had all the processes that you referred to earlier in your 
evidence had they been, had they been completed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No.  So Chair this is the, the with, with, with the, with 
signing of international agreements with foreign currency we, we would have to seek 
10 
SAB approval for that and that was part of the process as part of my initial Board 
resolution to sign and negotiate, not sign.  We had to get SAB approval for that and that 
is normal for international transactions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Look, but my, my understanding is that you had not 
reached agreement on the transaction at that point? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, so it, what we. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  What, what we normally would do we would, we would 
do a high level submission to the SAB basically to say this is the transaction.  They 
must review the transaction and they gave us the; that approval Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If you; that that approval did it have conditions? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  There, there were conditions to that Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What were the conditions? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The conditions of that Chair was the, the fact the, it must 
be other conditions if I may read in paragraph 20: 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 85 of 191 
 
“Amongst other conditions from the currency and exchange 
manual of the authorised dealers was that no upfront fee or 
commitment fee, raising free or other administration fees were 
payable by the borrower.” 
Those were the, the conditions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no, please. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes you may proceed sorry. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now then you get the approval from SAB as in AP11.  
Was then paving the way for the signing of the agreement between Eskom and 
Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, certainly not Chair.  We did not even have a legal 
review of the, this agreement.  We did not have, because there were, were elements of 
this that would need Government approval.  There was an SPV element, a Special 
Purpose Vehicle element.  There was our, an internal sign off.  We, we also in the 
Treasury had to review the, the, the cost of this facility.  Even though in, in the Board 
submissions I indicate at a high level that given the pricing, the specific pricing, not the, 
20 
all the fees.  I was fairly comfortable in my, my high level assessment of it, but those 
were certain steps that we still had to follow.  Our process dictates that we, we, we 
negotiate, we conclude and then we go through our Assets and Liability Committee 
process that would then look at all the documents and then suggest to the CFO or who 
is delegated to sign or to say we are happy, we support, you can sign and that step did 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 86 of 191 
 
not happen so the SAB was part of that process that we had to undertake. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then in paragraph 20 you deal with those 
conditions that SAB had placed. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just mention them without reading them 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the one was the – there has to be money has 
to flow into Eskom’s account, the financing was based on a turnkey principle whereby 
Huarong Engineers constructed and provide financing with special purpose vehicle and 
that is set up, built and asset – the asset required by Eskom, therefore funds will flow 
from the lenders to the investors as arranged by Huarong into the SPV.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So in other words they’re saying you can’t – you must 
wait until you’ve got funds into your South African account? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We would have to have funds in our account. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Before you could conclude any agreement with Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And at that point no monies were paid?   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Monies were paid and certainly in my Chair, we did not 
review, we did not complete our processes from the RF process we did not complete 
our processes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then on the 14th of August you received 
20 
a memo from Ms Gavella Palaschus Flask from your legal, internal legal which was 
addressed to Ms Suzanne Daniels.  What were her concerns, we have it in AP12 and 
that’s page 436.  Maybe she gives a background, if you’re there, about the transaction 
as a whole but in the end she makes certain recommendations, maybe you could just 
read those recommendations to the Chairperson, they will appear, they appear at page 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 87 of 191 
 
440 to 441. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the recommendation is that it is recommended 
that the Group Executive Legal and Compliance reviews the submission from Group 
Capital to the IFC regarding the Huarong Asset Management Project and oppose any 
approvals if such are against legal advice or set out in the memorandum.  Request 
reasons from the relevant signatories and officials as to why the buy-in term sheet was 
signed without proper legal governance processes and request reasons as to why the 
Group Capital and Eskom Treasury persisted with the wrong transaction funding 
despite legal advice regarding the terms and (indistinct) and the fee letter. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now what were the processes that she was talking about 
for the signing of the binding term sheet in paragraph 12.2? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair as I have indicated there is no process for 
signing a binding term sheet, I think at least you would have legal consideration of it but 
there was no formal process in our processes that would inform how do you sign a 
binding term sheet because it was unprecedented. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and the matters that she was raising here did you 
find that there was merit in these recommendations or you felt that there was no reason 
to worry about them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the – and certainly my view and the timing of this 
20 
is also important because on the 15th of August we go to the committee again.  I was – 
some of the responses from White & Case, White & Case raised their issues with me 
personally, I was comfortable that they in an independent way write to our legal to raise 
these issues, I was also comfortable with the review by our corporate finance on the 
structure, because in my mind that is the process that we need to follow.  I was not – 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 88 of 191 
 
we were not beholden to the transaction, we wanted the process to follow and come to 
a logical conclusion do we do it or not, so I was not concerned about it, I was 
comfortable with the comments that it shows people are applying their mind and if we 
agree to it there’s no sense from – that we would create the wrong that we are dealing 
outside of process or we have agendas with their proposal Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then the very next day you appear or you 
submit, make a submission to the IFC Board am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And did you ask? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair this was the ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you now in the statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg our pardon Mr Chair, in the statement we are on 
page 7, paragraph 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the reference is to AP13 that appears at page 443.  
Could you just read out to the Chairperson what is it that you sought from the Board, 
from the IFC Board. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Excuse me Chair the reference ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 443. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Of AP13? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  443, it’s AP13, one three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you read there while you are checking may I confirm that 
the Chief Financial Officer would be the Head of Treasury at Eskom, or whether r he 
would be or she would be separate from Treasury? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the Head of Treasury would report into the Chief 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 89 of 191 
 
Financial Officer Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON  Oh so there’s a Head of Treasury? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there would be the Chief Financial Officer. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the relevant time you were the Head of Treasury. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Head of Treasury yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you still are? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you  Chair, could you proceed then Mr Pillay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the resolution requested here Chair was IFC 
Board mandates Eskom Treasury to conclude a financing agreement with the 
associated agreements amounting to R1.5 to R6billion, delegate the power and 
authority to the Chief Executive Officer to – or equivalent. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And what – this submission if you look at page 445 you 
prepared the submission, am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it was signed by the Group Executive according to 
this on the 14th of August. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The day before. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2017? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because the meeting was on the 15th, is that correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 90 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, so ...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Group Executive there being Mr Anderson?  
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no  here it was – he was replaced Chair, he left the 
organisation on the 27th of July. 
CHAIRPERSN:  Oh, this was now? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This is Mr Caleb Cassiem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who succeeded him during that period? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So otherwise he would have been the one who had to sign here if he 
had still been around? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you go to page, of the same transaction, 
submission if you go to page 445 on top could you just read what you’re motivating 
there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The approval of a transaction that will contribute towards 
the alternative funding initiatives as contemplated in corporate plan which includes the 
borrowing plan of R337billion for that particular period from 2017/18 to 2021/22. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 3.4 you indicate that due 
diligence will be done on this company, or on the engineering companies. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this is part of the process that we would need 
to follow, that we would still have to conclude still the loan agreement and facility 
agreement would be reviewed for our head of legal for sign off and his delegate the 
environmental issues and also that Eskom has not contracted with EPC Contractors 
and that is something that we would have to look at. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 91 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then thereafter you deal with your interactions then 
again with Mr Khoza which you had already mentioned earlier.  Could you just briefly 
state to the Chairperson what you wanted to convey in that paragraph? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair if I may Chair the outcome of this Board 
Resolution Chair is so in the – as was pointed out Chair that it was signed on the 14th, 
the meeting was on the 15th, there’s two, I engaged with Caleb Cassiem who was the 
new CFO around this he was literally into is job probably more than two weeks.  I was 
not comfortable with the transaction.  We went to the Board and we indicted, we left 
with a resolution that says go and do a review of the process, follow process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, in paragraph 22 you mentioned Mr Themba Khoza, 
10 
why do you mention him there, at page 8 of your statement? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair what at this stage what is quite clear to me that 
Mr Khoza was quite involved in the process if I can call, refer to it respectfully as an 
invincible hand in this whole thing, he ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And at this stage he was still a member of the Board and not the 
chairperson. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If memory serves he was the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was by this time? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  At this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So at this stage Chair if you look at the minutes th ere 
was a change in the Board, there was some replacements that the Minister effected so 
there’s a couple of changes there was a new CEO, a new CFO and in this instance also 
a new Chair of the IFC Committee, Mr Simphiwe Dinga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I know that in terms of what we have been told that there was a 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 92 of 191 
 
time when Mr Brian Molefe came in and I think around the same time more or less Mr 
Arnoj Singh came in, the other who is the people you are talking about, or are referring 
to other people when you say there was a new CEO and a new CFO? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this is in 2017 August, and in July Mr Singh left 
the employment of Eskom and Mr Molefe I think he left in if memory serves in 
November 2016 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay, okay no that’s fine ,so as at this time that you are 
talking about who was the CEO or Acting CEO? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  At this specific point was Mr Johnny Dladla Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And when Mr Arnoj Singh left then he was replaced I think you 
10 
have mentioned the name? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Caleb Cassiem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, we’ve already dealt with the White & Case 
matter, we’re not going to refer to that again, but again Ms Pallashia writes again on the 
22nd of August 201 raised similar concerns and they’re relevant, they are similar to the 
ones that ones that you had raised in the earlier memo, is that correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and then on the 24th September Mr Mohamed Kahn 
also directed a memo where he raised various concerns from the funding side seeing 
20 
that this was – this appeared to be very expense, it was going to be a very expansive 
for ...(intervention)   Transaction for Eskom, is that correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then when these matters were raised I would 
imagine that you had copied to these memo’s and then did you bring them to the 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 93 of 191 
 
attention of the persons that you are responsible for the signing of the contemplated 
agreements? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair so this was shared with Mr Cassiem and also 
importantly Chair was the – this was part of the process that had to follow, that Legal 
had to give their opinion and this was subsequently the meeting, the IFC meeting of the 
15th that said go and follow your processes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then in Mr Khan’s memorandum which appears 
as AP16, but at page 471 he has some conclusions there, could you just take the 
Chairperson through those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page 471 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page 47, what are the matters that he highlights 
there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So he highlights the financial comparison of traditional 
funding options versus Huarong proposal indicates that Huarong proposal is more 
expensive relative to Eskom’s traditional sources of funding, where Eskom can also 
contact a fully wrapped EPC on an EPC basis.  High level review of the term sheet also 
indicates that certain provisions provide rights of Huarong that could result in risk being 
born by Eskom that Eskom is unable to mitigate.  Given the cost implications risks and 
20 
uncertainty around the legal commercial and regulatory aspects as detailed in 3.4 
above the overall conclusion is the proposed Huarong solution is onerous and more 
expensive than Eskom’s traditional sources of funding.  It is therefore recommended 
that all funding options should be exhausted before the Huarong option is considered 
and that the detailed legal risk and regulatory and commercial due diligence be 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 94 of 191 
 
performed prior to signing the ALFA, the asset loan framework agreement.  It has been 
noted that IFC has requested that the full legal review be conducted before signing the 
ALFA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then after this then it is communicated what do 
you see happening then on the 6th of October 2017 as you deal with it paragraph 26? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Paragraph 26, Chair then you may recall that I’ve 
indicated and things move so fast in Eskom that on the 6th of October Mr Johnny Dladla 
is removed and replaced by Mr Sean Maritz.  He took office, Caleb Cassiem and I, so 
he then, it certainly Chair from the time that he took office in less than a month we had 
a meeting with the Huarong individuals and I think a bit of background to that Chair is 
10 
that the issue and my certainly my reluctance to advancing the ALFA or the ADFA was 
that, and hopefully in my supplementary I can cover that in a bit more detail Chair is 
that Eskom wasn’t, this Huarong facility would not provide immediate liquidity to Eskom, 
it will not alleviate the liquidity challenges that we are facing.  I made that abundantly 
clear to in my meeting and my last discussion with the Huarong team that this will not 
provide the solution that we are looking at, we are not even focusing on this 
transaction, they have had a meeting with Mr Maritz and then at a later stage on the 
20th Mr Cassiem and I are invited to a meeting with them, they then suggested we 
should give them at least something to consider that they can look at a short term 
liquidity facility that would assist Eskom, but it was also clear Chair that this was the 
20 
entry into us getting to the long-term facility, this proposed shortened facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now as you were meeting them now with Mr Sean Maritz and Caleb 
Cassiem where is the RFP process? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the FRP process has been concluded Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 95 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And we are still in discussions with them around the 
terms and the issues that was raised in the proposal and also doing the process that 
was indicated, Mr Mohamed Kahn’s submission, the legal submission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the RFP process as I understand only gets concluded when you 
sign an agreement is it? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair, so when you – that’s the ultimate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but you haven’t signed an agreement present to the RFP 
process. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no we haven’t signed, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So therefore it can’t be concluded. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have asked for proposals and you have received proposals, isn’t 
it? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is still a process of determining which one of these various 
proposals will be chosen? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right, so that process hasn’t been completed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, and the Huarong one it was so we were looking at a 
couple of the proposals from the RFP Chair, the Huarong one was one of them. 
20 
CHAIRRPERSON:  Yes, now you are having this meeting with the Huarong 
representatives to discuss their proposal or to discuss their – ja their proposal I guess, 
isn’t it, am I right, for all intents and purposes whatever you are discussing you are – 
they want you to reach an agreement with them. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 96 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we know that you definitely don’t want that but other people that 
are involved from Eskom their situation might be different. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Different yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so now meeting with one entity which has made a proposal when 
there are other proposals, other entities that have, that are competing with that entity is 
that permissible in terms of Eskom’s processes where there is an RFP process, in other 
words is it – are you allowed to meet with one and discuss their proposal and meet with 
another one or is there another process or meeting with them if they are part of those 
who have responded to the RFP is not a problem. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair what traditionally would happen is that we 
10 
would go to the RFP process we would, there would be an independent evaluation that 
takes place, independent from us, that would be participating in the process, the – and 
they would then indicate, firstly they would say this is the proposed shortlist, then they 
would suggest this is the list or alternatively this is the list that we see that there’s 
potential in, let’s bring them in for a meeting and we normally refer to it as a beauty 
parade when they come and discuss the proposals that we interrogated and understand 
it better, so the reason for mentioning that’s the process that we follow Chair and that is 
the discussion that we have with them, and then we would go into a negotiation phase 
with them around that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so meeting with them alone in this process wasn’t by itself 
20 
wrong, what may have been wrong is that this prior step that you say normally takes 
place, which is done independently, didn’t take place, that’s what made it wrong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This discussion yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Just following on that you had said 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 97 of 191 
 
that – did – are you aware that there was an evaluation process of the RFP tenderers? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes there was an evaluation process to my 
understanding there was ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then who was the successful bidder, if I may put 
it that way? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So there was a number of successful bidders, and we 
engaged the J P Morgan transaction amongst others, the Huarong transaction and 
there was a proposal posed from ABSA and R & B from memory that ended up being 
the proposals that we were pursuing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and what ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry – successful or shortlisted? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Successful that we were going to pursue, or they were 
evaluated and they were ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  They would receive further consideration. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Consideration and we need to negotiate and understand 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and ultimately there would be only one successful one? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We might look at all of them again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you might look at all of them, oh, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  All of them, so they were not competing ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But successful in terms of moving to the next stage, okay, alright. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The next stage. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  And then in AP18 there is a memo 
at page 478, if you look at page 479 that’s under your hand, am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  AP18? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 98 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  479. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair, it’s 478. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you, Mr Chairman I’m sorry, it has just been 
brought to my attention that it is one o’clock, may we adjourn for lunch? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay we will take the lunch adjournment, and we will resume at 
two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Ms Norman.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Just to state that Eskom has 
10 
responded to your call and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I suspect Mr Pillay has something to do with it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So there is – yes.  And in fact Eskom’s legal counsel is 
also here.  I am – thank you very much.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman 
could we just go back to page 34 so that Mr Pillay can give us the correct figures to 
those amounts that we dealt with in the morning before we forget that part.  That would 
be at page 34 you will give us the amounts for the – for number 5, 6, 7 for all those 
fees, the exact amounts. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Thank you Chair.  The facility fee in number 5 would 
amount to based on $1.5 billion.  The… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright let me get there. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 34 Mr Chairman. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 99 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Let us start with the facility fee what is the 
amount there the 1.6% of the… 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  1.6 is 24 million US $.  The annual commitment fee is 12 
million US $ and the cancellation.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry the second one is what 8%, 0.8%. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much is that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  12 million US$. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the cancellation 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And the cancellation fee would be 3 million US$ Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The percentage figures are correct you just wanted to give us the 
exact amounts? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  What those amount to in relation to this facility, the 
20 
indicative facility Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no it is just that I understood Ms Norman before lunch to 
have said that there were figures that were not correct and you were going to correct 
them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair the ones that he gave earlier. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 100 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Because in my [indistinct] response Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The figures that he gave earlier Mr Chairperson were not 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he gave some figures oh okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because – because – I had – yes because I had asked 
him to calculate quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I missed them – those ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Pillay let us go back the Chairperson had 
10 
asked you about your interaction with Huarong when the RFP process was in place and 
your answer to the question was that you had a couple of these companies. Can I just 
find out other than meeting with Huarong what other companies did you meet with who 
were involved or at least shortly stayed within the RFP process? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the – as mentioned earlier it was J P Morgan 
they proposed a monetisation of our home loan – of our bad debt book and then there 
were two specific proposals from ABSA and RNB at the time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And we both – we engaged with those. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then in your statement then you 
20 
move on if you go back to paragraph 27 where we left off.  You have – am I correct you 
still have the RFP process which is still proceeding and then you say then you were 
asked by Mr Shaun Maritz to prepare a short term facility proposal which you were 
going to address to Huarong. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 101 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  How does that happen if you have the RFP process 
and it is not complete and then you start with another proposal can you just explain to 
the Chairperson how did that happen? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the recommendation here was and in light of 
my earlier response that Eskom was the long term facility would not address Eskom’s 
short term facility and liquidity requirements and that is the engagement between Mr 
Maritz and the Huarong counterparties or the Huarong team.  In the meeting on the 20th 
we discussed this and they then proposed should we not look at a short term facility.  
Mr Maritz’ proposal was that can we not look at a proposal what would a term sheet 
look like for a short term facility and then we can and later on as you will see Chair that 
10 
we take that to the board to recommend that we take it – so this is outside of the RFP 
process now Chair.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay so does that mean that then that process was 
abandoned or you simply introduced another proposal to Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This was a recommendation that we should go to board 
and ask them given the emergency of the liquidity that we go – we do not issue another 
RFP for short term facilities we take this to the board and we recommend this.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  A short term facility. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then that short term facility appears at page 400 – 
20 
proposal appears at page 478 and it is a memorandum prepared by yourself, am I 
correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Apologies Chair just the… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes 478 to 479.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 102 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes you prepared that memorandum? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is it correct that then you had incorporated in it some of 
the terms that are contained in the term sheet like your annual commitment fee and 
your cancellation fee? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In the same manner as they appear in the term sheet? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair as a – the proposal or recommendation – or 
the request was in aligning to the indicative term sheet and the alignment is there but I 
obviously adjust the percentage and the prices in line with the short term facility 
10 
proposal. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And was a similar proposal extended to J P Morgan 
ABSA and all the other entities? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no Chair this was – the recommendation was to 
directly provide this to the Huarong team the proposal for a date for them to consider a 
short term facility to a direct lending to Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now at this point let us just get our facts right.  At this 
point we know that Huarong has not demonstrated that is Huarong Energy has not 
demonstrated any financial muscle to Eskom at this point we know that legal white and 
case and legal internal had advised against this transaction and what then informed 
20 
you and Eskom that is you because this is under your hand. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To decide that instead of following and finishing up the 
RFP process as you should or ought to have let us rather propose a short term facility 
now with the same company that you know has not demonstrated that it can even 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 103 of 191 
 
deliver on the first promise that it made. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  Chair so the discussion at the meeting on the 20th 
that Mr Maritz arranged with the Huarong team the issue was that Eskom need short 
term liquidity.  The other proposals that we had was still being discussed and it would 
not result in short term funding for Eskom immediately.  So this was a process to – and 
hopefully we can demonstrate later on that Mr Maritz wanted to stabilise as his initiative 
of saying to government that he is controlling the liquidity challenges of Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But why choose Huarong 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So they approached him – they approached him with 
that facility and that is why I was – he was invited to that meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does this mean that while you were having a discussion with 
Huarong on a transaction that may be could be said to have been for a long term and 
while you were also waiting for the RFP process to run to its final conclusion in regard 
to a long term transaction an idea came up that a transaction should be made with 
Huarong for a short term – for a short term.  Is that right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair a short term facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and that was necessitated by the aginate for liquidity on the part 
of Eskom as you understand it. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the long term transaction would have been for how long? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was our long term facilities Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Was largely for about a fifteen year transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But that is a long term facility. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 104 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so a short term such as this one would be between three and 
seven years? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Three to five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And this proposal then as you would 
agree with me it still had some of the onerous terms that all the lawyers were 
complaining about that it was just including Mr Khan from finance that these terms were 
onerous.  So this short term facility was still going to come back with [indistinct] 
commitment fee at 0.8% of that amount it was still going to come with the cancellation 
fee of 0.2% of the 1.5 US billion US$? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the – my approach or because I signed it was 
certainly to go and look at the to align the cost one of the things that white and case 
raised that the fee seemed to be so high. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We benchmarked that and look at what would the short 
term facility be value and the range at the time given where market was around 3 to 
5%.  The facility upfront fee it is convention for us to pay upfront fees for our facilities.  
They range between anything from 80 basis points so 1.8%.  It is standard that we pay 
those upfront fees and the proposal here the indicative proposal – let me not use the 
word indicative the proposal here was at the short – the lowest spectrum of that.  Yes 
20 
Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  And then you say then Mr 
Maritz then you made the proposal and then what happened sorry I skipped one set. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this proposal was submitted as requested to 
the Huarong team.  Verbally they indicated that it is not achievable given if you – what 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 105 of 191 
 
we have put in this proposal and what they came out with their long term facility in 
terms of fees.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They indicated it is not achievable.  They also for them 
to execute this in the discussion was they would need a government guarantee for that.  
Whilst the other proposal was not for a government guarantee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  To enable them to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the idea of a short term transaction who did it come from? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The idea so the.. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The initiative to say let us have discussions that is Eskom and 
Huarong about a short term transaction did it come from Huarong or did it come from 
Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the discussion with Huarong and this is at the 
time when I was still engaging with them the – they were agitating for signing the long 
term facility and I indicated to them that your funding is not our solution.  We – our 
liquid – we were under severe liquidity constraints and Mr Maritz knew that as well.  I 
think he was well aware of that.  And that is where the discussion became between him 
and them and that is why that meeting came about Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So I certainly did not propose to them give us short term 
money. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Okay.  Yes, yes.  But from what you say it looks like it 
came from the meeting that you did not attend between Mr Shaun Maritz and Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair there was definitely a meeting prior to the 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 106 of 191 
 
meeting of the 20th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you – if you were talking about a short term transaction what 
was the applicability of a request for proposals route?  Was it not applicable if it was a 
short term transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the – it would have certainly – it would have 
competed with the ability to execute any of those proposals within the liquidity 
requirements that Eskom had Chair.  So it would have been applicable.  At this stage 
we were still discussing as indicated earlier with the various institutions ABSA, RNB 
10 
and J P Morgan at the time. There was no finalisation in terms of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that where the – where there is urgency that the 
transaction be concluded then you do not have to go through that route of requesting 
proposals? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No so Chair so we did not abandon the other proposals 
because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I accept that you did not abandon them in regard to the long 
term transaction I am talking about the short term transaction so my question is 
whether if it is a short term transaction Eskom was free to just choose whoever they 
were happy to conclude the transaction with without opening this up to other interested 
20 
parties? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair and this was the indication that we would 
rather pursue a short term facility.  I must also add Chair my recommendation in the 
discussion was that it is very easy you do not even have to do a proposal.  If Huarong 
team are so convinced that they have money that they or funding that they can provide 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 107 of 191 
 
to Eskom they can go into the market and buy our bonds.  The bonds are guaranteed 
by government.  There is no need for any process with a due diligence any process 
they abandoned that.  They did not like that or they were not willing to do that.  And 
they will much rather wanted to pursue a short term facility on a different basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure if I am following.  The request for proposals route you 
have said it was applicable in terms of the long term transaction and you insisted that it 
should be followed when Mr Anoj Singh when you thought that he was maybe not so 
committed to following that, is that right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes that and we continued to do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and you – your position was that route should be followed namely 
10 
the request for proposals? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. So now in regard to a short term transaction you did not insist in 
the same way.  So my question is, is that because that route is not applicable when you 
are dealing with a short term transaction or is that simply because it is not applicable if 
there are – there is urgency in the conclusion of the transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair so the – my understanding would be that 
because of the urgency we would almost follow a bespoke process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So I am just trying 
20 
to follow your answers to the Chairperson Mr Pillay.  If Huarong had found the proposal 
on short term facility had found it to be favourable Eskom would have accepted that and 
you would have conclude an agreement? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So it was a proposal. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 108 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And if certainly and it was not cast in stone it would have 
obviously required negotiation.  They wanted government guarantees it would have 
been quite a long process but it was not – this is a final basically term sheet for you to 
accept or not and it was basically for negotiating purposes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, that is not the question.  The question is you had 
made a proposal to them. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And if they found that proposal to be acceptable in every 
respect then you would have concluded an agreement based on that proposal with 
them? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes obviously we would have to negotiate the 
agreement yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You would have conclude… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No what she means is you make a proposal with them.  You are 
happy with the proposal. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they say they are happy too there is nothing to negotiate. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You move to signing. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – she is asking whether that is what would had happened.. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair and that… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then by doing so you would have avoided the RFP 
process that had commenced in so far as the long term is concerned and you would not 
have embarked on any other process other than what you would have initiated and 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 109 of 191 
 
what would have been accepted by them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja as indicated to the Chair it would have not been – 
there would not have been a RFP process this would have been a proposal that would 
have done almost in a bespoke way that we would take to the board and say to the 
board, there is an urgent need for an emergency basis this is what we propose. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes save that in your memorandum nowhere do you 
mention any emergency.  There is nowhere in the memorandum that you submitted 
where you mentioned that this is an urgent situation and we need this facility. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Look Chair I think it would have been very risky to say 
that to the Huarong team. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have said it to the board when you sought the board’s 
approval. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair we would not have said that to Huarong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Then they would have said to us if you have a pressing 
matter or an emergency funding the terms would have been completely different the 
prices would have probably been double. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they might have taken advantage of you. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  But is there anywhere else where you raise 
the urgency of the matter with the board? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So there is… 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 110 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  In the discussion Chair.  So the board if in the – if 
memory serves Chair in all the board meetings the February board that we have 
reviewed the August board we give updates to the board around the liquidity.  And Chair 
I think the – what was very important in this period particularly if I may Chair the period 
from July up until January of 2018 so it was a very difficult time for Eskom.  We were 
literally and some may recall Chair that in the media there was the noise that Eskom 
will not be able to pay salaries.  The board was fully aware of that.  Of the fact that 
liquidity was a constraint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  okay so just – yes, no just to make sure that we make progress 
10 
easily what Ms Norman has put as a – asked you is whether you at any stage 
mentioned the issue of urgency to the board in relation to this proposal for a short term 
transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So there was a – after this proposal there was a board 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Where this was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at the time that you made the proposal to Huarong. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not approached the board as yet|? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For their approval of this proposal. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 111 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were going to approach the board. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If Huarong was amenable to this proposal? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is when you would have mentioned why you were not 
following the RFP route? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And the process yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Maybe just to follow up on that 
could you please turn to page 488.  The minutes of the board – of the IFC dated 27 
10 
October.  That would be AFP I beg your pardon – 19.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair 488? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes 488.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That deals with it is an extract of the minutes of the 
board.  Am I correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  488 is matters for committee approval yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Resolved that yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then what was resolved by the board? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So – so what was resolved by the board is contained in 
my statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes could you read 4.1.2 please? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   
“That the short terms facility of up to 2 billion for six to twelve 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 112 of 191 
 
months for execution and drawdown by 30 November 2017.  
Short term facility will be based on the term sheet of the long 
term facility subject to amendments.  The short term facility may 
be settled early in the event of Eskom’s successfully incurring 
other funding.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What did you understand when the board said the short 
term facility would be based on the term on the long term facility because we know that 
the long term from your evidence was going the RFP route?  So what was meant by the 
fact that the short term facility would be based on the long term facility? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So it was that the term sheet and the terms as I have 
10 
detailed it in largely based on that terms that was detailed in the letter, the proposal 
letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Those would be the terms. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So at this point then had the RFP process con – been 
concluded? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No.  No Chair sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I am just trying to understand then going forward 
what would have been the process?  You have the RFP it is parked because you 
following the short term facility.  The board resolves that go and negotiate on the short 
20 
term based on the long term. How would you have done that in the final adjudication of 
the RFP? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the long term RFP process was continuing.  It 
did not stop.  We were still going through that process.  This was a process just to 
secure the short term facility.  And that is what – it was a direct submission to the board 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 113 of 191 
 
to say to ask the board for the approval for that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Let us move on Mr Pillay.  Let us go to 
– you deal with Mr Shaun Maritz in paragraphs 29, 30 signing the agreement.  Could 
you quickly tell the Chairperson what happened? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eskom chose to deal with Huarong in regard to the short term 
transaction only or chose to deal with Huarong only in regard to the short term 
transaction.  Did it consider other proposals which related to long term by other entities 
that had been made to see whether any of those could be used for a short term 
10 
transaction on better terms compared to Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair at the particular period in time we were dealing 
with the liquidity risks within Eskom.  Also important Chair there was also the 
governance related issues.  So the financial institutions at the time were saying to us if 
you do not clean up your board, if you do not change your management of board, if you 
do not resolve certain issue do not even come and talk to us for funding we will not 
advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the other entities? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Other entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that was their attitude. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Generally that was their attitude in the markets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And hopefully in the supplementary I can touch on those 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 114 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That the investors and the investor community were 
reluctant to advance anything or any facilities to Eskom during that period Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Could you please then take us 
through paragraphs where you deal with the signing of the agreement by Mr Shaun 
Maritz and how did that happen? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair there is also if I may at the board meeting so 
what happened in this particular period of time and I think it was on the 24th – 25th 
October there was a request from the board to do a Round Robin Resolution for the 
short term facility and the proposal that was made Chair.  The – we were asked to 
10 
submit a proposal – the – to update the board’s submission Chair and our initial 
recommendation was to close down the Huarong facility.  There was discussions so we 
sent this to the CFO who engaged Mr Maritz on it.  He was adamant that we need to 
follow process with the long term facility and still pursue the short term facility.  And in 
the submission that is what he ultimately signed and submitted to the board for this 
Round Robin Resolution Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In paragraph 29 at the end you say that Mr Maritz 
was not duly authorised to sign the agreement.  Why do you say that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair what happened and if I may just a bit of detail 
20 
around it is the meeting Round Robin Meeting was called.  Some of the board members 
were quite uncomfortable with a Round Robin Resolution of this magnitude.  They 
asked the company secretary to convene a meeting, a special meeting.  That was 
done.  When the meeting was convened or the meeting was to start Mr Maritz and Mr 
Khoza were not participating in the meeting at all.  They were as per the feedback later 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 115 of 191 
 
on they were on their way to go and see the Minister in Cape Town.  Following the 
board meeting and certainly again Chair myself and the CFO were in the meeting.  We 
understand the outcome of the meeting.  It was clear do not proceed.  You can proceed 
with the short term and there were certain conditions.  Mr Maritz returned from Cape 
Town and he was quite adamant – he – he was – he sent a message through to say 
“prepare the long term facility I am going to sign.”  But what is important Chair is that 
this also takes place on the – this is on the 27th Chair that this happens.  On the 25th 
around about the 25th he sends an email to the CFO to say “why are we not signing this 
facility:”  I am cc’d on the email and we respond with all the documentation, all the legal 
comments.  Mr Mohamed’s recommendation.  All the white and case report everything 
10 
and we say to him ‘we have not followed due process we cannot proceed.”  His 
response was “I am going to sign.”  So that is before the – implicitly saying or explicitly 
saying he is comfortable to proceed.  That is on the 25th.  Then the meeting happens on 
the 27th and then on the return from Cape Town he signs the facility.  No short term 
facility just the long term facility.   
CHAIRPERSON:  As at that time the short term facility had not been – because it was 
rejected by Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the board said we should continue and seek 
the short term facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So that was not even done.  We did not even start that 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in effect he went against the board’s decision or advise, is that 
right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 116 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then he immediately signed the long term transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the time, when he signed the long term transaction how, how 
much time had lapsed since the Board had, had made the decision that there should be 
further negotiations? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair from memory I think the meeting ended round 
about noon and they returned from Cape Town only later that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and he signed the following day? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He signed on, on that day if. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same day? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The same day if my memory is, Chair he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Signing the long term transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Signing the long term facility Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the long term transaction had not been approved by the Board, 
because even if the process had not been completed. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Had not been completed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what were the other entities who had made proposals?  What 
did they say about this or what was, what did Eskom tell them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Because we were still negotiating with them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This is the; we, we did not tell them that we are 
abandoning or we are stopping.  That was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was separate financial or funding activities that we 
were pursuing Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 117 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but at some stage you must have gone back to them. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We were still going to pursue that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I mean the long term transaction has been signed.  Is it now 
by? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Mr Maritz? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they that is now those entities are still under the impression or 
were still under the impression that the process had not been completed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  All processes were then, were not completed 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but obviously they were still, they, they would know your 
process.  Is it not? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if they make a proposal they must be interested in knowing 
what process will be followed until conclusion is reached.  So they would know your, 
your processes? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, so you would have had to go back to them and say something 
like well we have chosen Huarong or whatever. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair if I may just clarify.  We were going to pursue 
those because they were addressing a particular funding requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  These, there proposals were not competing necessarily 
with one another.  They were [intervenes]. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 118 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, they were not competing? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright.  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So we did not have to go to them and say to them we 
have concluded with Huarong.  You, we, we have to suspend or conclude the 
discussions with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well maybe, maybe Ms. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe I could just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe, maybe Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ask you some questions.  Maybe. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Through those questions there will be more clarity. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Pillay initially I had used the word 
abandoned.  That is the RFP process was abandoned and you said no.  The process 
was not abandoned. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The process was continuing. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am just trying to see is, is that how Eskom does its 
20 
procurement processes?  That it would have parallel processes running at the same 
time, because I am just trying to understand what is then that Eskom seeks to achieve 
when it does that. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So, so Chair the, we go out to the market.  We look at 
the funding plan as we have presented earlier and we, we ask the market for 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 119 of 191 
 
responses.  We then look at what is the, what of the funding requirements or the, the 
capital spend, spending requirements does the particular proposals address.  We, we 
do not go out and say, necessarily go out and say we just want one proposal that we 
want to address one specific need.  The proposal and that is why we say it is innovative 
funding solutions.  So that we can address a number of things and, and also as I, I think 
what was mentioned earlier when we look at our funding plan and these address 
certain requirements in our funding plan we then adjust with approval, internal approval 
and Government approval we adjust our funding plan. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But then that opens a door for Eskom to be able to favour 
a particular company over others as is in this case, because correct me if I am wrong 
10 
you have got other proposals.  Let us say six or 12 responses that you have got and 
then you say I am going to evaluate these and they are evaluated according to, to your 
evidence, but then in the midst of all this you decide that you know maybe this company 
can actually give a short term facility and I am going to give this company a proposal.  I 
am just trying to understand is that an acceptable procurement process? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair just too also just elaborate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Is that the, the proposals that we receive are very 
different and distinct.  So the one proposal if I may an example is that it details with our 
municipal debt problem that we have.  The other facilities deal with our, our derivative 
20 
book that we have.  They are very different these proposals.  So they were not 
competing with one another.  The, the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your RFP would it have told the potential entities that would be 
interested to make proposals what your funding requirements were and asked them to 
address in effect anyone more of the requirements in their proposals.  Is that how, how 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 120 of 191 
 
in effect it would have been? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words any entity reading your request for proposals would 
have been able to look at your funding requirements in terms of that request and then 
be able to say this is the requirement that I would like to have a transaction with, with 
Eskom and not that one and another one might say I want, I am interested in more 
requirements than one and another one might say I am interested in all of the 
requirements because I can meet all of them.  Is that how it, it could be, it would be? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair, because they look at Eskom in total. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in that event in, at least in theory you could have some that are 
competing.  Is it not? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That are interested in the same requirements? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where you have to choose? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in this particular case are you saying having had regard to 
the proposals from the different entities that Eskom received there was no competition 
20 
in regard to your funding requirements? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Mr Pillay.  So what it means 
is that Huarong was in, in a league of its own? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 121 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They were, they were separate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So it, it could not even compete with Absa because 
of what it was offering? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Offering, yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just quite, it is quite interesting but you know one is, one does 
not know much about Eskom other than Eskom and lights [laughing] so; but, because 
normally when you talk about request for proposals normally what you want is 
competition from different entities. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to make sure that you as a Government entity can get, can 
choose an entity that will give you the best value for as little as you, you, you can pay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that that is that is part of the requirement of procurement.  So, 
so but you say that in this particular case when you look at the proposals each one was 
interested in a requirement that was different from those required by other people? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And we do also if I may Chair just add to your earlier 
point is that there are some RFPs that were issued that are very specific. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We are going to the International Bond Market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 122 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and this would be the requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And then we would be specific and then they are 
competing with one another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chairman.  You then in, in the following 
paragraphs you deal with your, with the, the trip that you did not join to, I think it was to 
China, to the USA, sorry between, on the 12th to 15 October 2017. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In paragraph 30. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Paragraph? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 30. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So maybe before that, sorry we skipped an important 
aspect.  After the signing of this agreement. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Huarong sent an invoice. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair before the invoice gets issued to us Chair what 
is important is the, the, the signing happened on that day of the long term facility by 
Mr Maritz.  So the following day because I was in the Board Meeting I approached the 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 123 of 191 
 
company secretary and indicated that based on the proceedings at the IFC Board 
Meeting which indicated that we should not proceed.  Mr Maritz went ahead to proceed.  
There was an informal meeting by the company secretary convened with the Chairman 
Mr Zethembe Khoza, the Chairman of Audit and Risk Mr Sathiaseelan Gounden, 
Mr Caleb Cassiem the CFO, the Chairman of that IFC Board Mr Dingaan Simphiwe and 
myself and the discussion was around the fact that Mr Maritz signed without the 
authority from the Board to sign and in the comment Chair when, when we discussed 
this and Mr Maritz indicated that he went to see the Minister and the Minister said it is 
okay if he can sign.  My response was the Minister does not get involved in those 
things ordinarily.  He does not have the delegation to do so.  The Board has, has, has 
10 
indicated that we should not proceed.  I mentioned the fact that Chair that we were 
dealing with reportable irregularities in Eskom fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  If we 
proceed with this it will amount to that Chair and then as indicated Chair was this, it is  
signed and approximately three days later we issued with a, an invoice to pay and, and 
Chair I think important here is the, is when we were served with the, with the invoice to 
pay upon receipt of the invoice this is where, where, where I took the step that this is 
now not, I would have to delegate the payment down and I took the decision and 
alerted all my colleagues in the Treasury to say no one must pay this invoice and if 
anyone enquires around the invoice they must approach me and I will deal with it, but 
no one, no one executes on this invoice and, and. 
20 
[Background noise] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, before you proceed the, the amount to which Eskom was 
committed by Mr Maritz when he signed that transaction was how much?  It was a; a 
financial commitment of how much? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 124 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then after that you can tell us what the invoice, how much that 
invoice. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Invoice was for that you were served with three days later. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  It is exhibit, it is Annexure 20.  That 
would be at page 491 Mr Chairman.  That is where the invoice is Mr Pillay or maybe 
start with the agreement, because the question from the Chair is that how much was, 
was, was Eskom supposed to pay and how much was the invoice. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the invoice Chair was based on a commitment of $2 
billion and [intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us start with the. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Financial commitment arising from 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The signing by. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Sean Maritz.  What was the financial commitment that went that 
went with that signature. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That you will find Mr Pillay at page 492. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  492 that is where the signed is, the signed agreement is. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair and. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If I may it is $19.2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  $19.2 million? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 125 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I remember you said you have a BSc in Maths so you might be 
very good with converting that quickly. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair it is, it is roughly a current exchange of 14 
probably around R275/276 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  That was the, the whole transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was the fee that would have been paid Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then, and then the invoice that you were served with three days 
later. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was for how much? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Is this invoice Chair of 19 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the, the whole transaction in terms of financial commitments for, 
for Eskom was also the same amount? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words this, this transaction that Mr Maritz signed had 
financial commitment, obligations for Eskom.  Is it not? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you know how much? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It, it is this.  Immediately payable is the 19.2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Dollars. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 126 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is payable? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same amount? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The whole amount? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean before these people could do anything? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair and, sorry Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is my question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this is the, the contentious part of this Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And certainly my, my frustrations with, with, with the 
Huarong Team and, and certainly do not want to be dramatic Chair, but I indicated to 
them that we as a State Owned Entity and as a public entity cannot pay and we do not 
even get a paperclip.  Those were my exact words to them.  We, I also indicated to 
them that we are going to pay your retirement and Eskom is going to get nothing.  It, it, 
it certainly was part of the build up to a very unpleasant relationship towards the end 
20 
with the Huarong Team Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you were having a meeting with the individuals that you 
mentioned a few minutes ago including Mr Sean Maritz and Mr Zethembe Khoza. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think two others and yourself. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 127 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You, these features of, this particular feature of the transaction that 
Mr Sean Maritz had already signed was discussed as well? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, it was not discussed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not discussed.  What was the purpose of that meeting? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The purpose of the meeting Chair was to, to confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That the individuals other than Mr Zethembe and 
Mr Maritz were not authorised or Sean was not authorised based on the Board Meeting 
of the previous day to sign. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but the, this feature of this transaction was known to the Board 
before and maybe that is part of the reason why they might, they said no you need to 
negotiate.  They did not approve. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  It was certainly a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  From, from, from this at the outset Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but now Mr Sean Maritz was saying he had consulted with the 
Minister and the Minister had said he can go ahead. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And sign. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he felt he could sign even though he knew that the Board was 
against that. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The, the Board was against it Chair and the CFO 
submitted to him. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 128 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  In email correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Advising him not to sign based on the, the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, on the process. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not necessarily on, because of this clause.  Maybe it might have 
been one, one, one of them, but it was based on the process? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But from your side this was one of the issues that you had a problem 
with? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Payment? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Just to follow up on that point you 
20 
see at page 492 Mr Pillay that the, the 60 percent program development fee within 
three, payable within three days after signature date.  So that is what the, the invoice 
seems to relate to? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 129 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, so did Mr Sean Maritz say that the Minister said he could go 
ahead and he could or should go ahead and sign this transaction.  Did he say this in 
the presence of all the people who you mentioned in that meeting or was he mentioning 
that to you separately? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No.  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was in the presence and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and also that was my response in the presence of 
all. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of all those people? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Of all the people, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Then we. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And, I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You, you will know this bundle I think much better than I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is a, it is your statement, statement and annexures.  Is 
there, is there any document maybe an email or a memo that you might have sent to 
20 
somebody within Eskom where you may have recorded that this is what you were told 
by Mr Maritz? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no, no Chair.  Unfortunately not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is nowhere.  Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 130 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that meeting did it have minutes that were taken that are 
available? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, Chair.  It was basically an informal meeting as I 
indicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I alerted the company secretary.  He convened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then you deal briefly with the relationship 
10 
between you and Mr Maritz where he had shown you a particular report saying that that 
you had a house in Plettenberg Bay.  You want to quickly to, to that paragraph. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair this is in the, in the lead up to the signing and, and 
some of the, the issues that I list here were, were certainly my experiences.  So on, on 
a particular day and, and I think it arose from the fact that I, I did not seemingly or did 
not cooperate with the process or wanted to assist with, with the Huarong long term 
facility and this I viewed as a, as a way of trying to, to put pressure on me or to 
intimidate me Chair.  He called. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Where are, where are you now Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 31. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  31, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 31? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 131 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair and, and he called me to his office and pulled out 
a piece of paper that was a folded piece of paper.  I could not read on the paper, but it 
was, there were a few lines typed on the piece of paper and he indicated to me that 
there is a whistle blower your report that indicated that I have taken a bribe from a 
particular Russian company for a facility that we have concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who, who, who is that saying that to you now? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Mr Maritz Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And this is, this is before the signing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This is now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Before the signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So I, I, I said to him at the time that I would cooperate 
with the investigation if any.  I also invited him that it is, it is very easy to assess. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If we have signed a transaction with the Russians, 
because there was nothing on our books. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That; so it is a very easy, I, I, I was not worried about the 
Russian transaction per se, but I was more concerned about what appears to be him 
trying to intimidate me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm, hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and I did not even read the piece of paper, what 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 132 of 191 
 
was written on the piece of paper Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that is the, the one that I deal with in, in, in that 
paragraph 31.  The other Chair was also roundabout the same period.  I was called to 
the office of the Chairman and he mentioned to me that you must be very careful that 
Sean does not want to work with you.  Basically indicating you are a problem.  That 
and, and, and it certainly alerted me and I became very concerned about my own 
career and my own time at Eskom because of, of, of these.  I do not sit, I think you can 
call them threats or signals that was given to me Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and is it correct that you did participate in a 
10 
disciplinary enquiry that Eskom initiated against Mr Sean Maritz? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair.  I participated in the Bowmans enquiry that 
was initiated in, in I think in February 2018. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  To deal with Mr Maritz’s, the particular transaction Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then you had testified that SAB had given conditional 
approval to the transaction with Huarong, but on the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you cover there is some important things in paragraph 30 
20 
towards the second half of the paragraph. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you cover those? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Must be careful, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About, about the pressure. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 133 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He said I must be careful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The pressure from. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And other people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He has just mentioned now Chair that the Chairperson 
called him and said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He must be careful. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because unless there is an. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is also the question of Mr Madida that he mentions there.  
Did he mention? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he is not saying Mr Madida mentioned, put pressure on him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are we in paragraph Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at, I am at. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Paragraph 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 30, paragraph 30. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes, yes oh you missed that last paragraph.  Could 
you please talk to that Mr Pillay?  Thank you.  I am indebted to you Mr Chairperson.  I 
simply looked at the date for the meeting to the U, USA, yes.  Could you just talk to 
what you are referring to there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in, in following the signing of, by Mr Maritz Chair I, 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 134 of 191 
 
I personally, this was very unsettling the signing of this transaction Chair.  One, 
because it, I was linked to it and also Chair I asked him why are you doing what you 
have done and he indicated to me that the Chairman is putting pressure on him to do 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mr Zethemba Khoza? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Zethemba Khoza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is what Sean Maritz said to you? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He said to me over and above the Minister said I can 
10 
sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He said the Chairman is putting pressure on me to sign 
this facility.  It was also as part of what I deal with here Chair is that Mr, Mr Khoza and 
Mr Rex Madida had quite a, a, it appeared a relationship.  There was some interaction.  
I recalling coming to the World Bank IMF Meetings and Mr Zethembe Khoza or we 
accompanied Mr or I accompanied Mr Zethembe Khoza and the phone, his phone was 
basically on the desk between the two of us and the phone rang and I could see that it 
was Mr Madida.  They had a conversation in vernacular and after the call he 
immediately wanted to enquire about the status of this deal and when are we signing it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Then we covered paragraph 31 
Mr Chairman.  Could you proceed then to paragraph 32?  Why did then SAB after it had 
given conditional approval why did it suspend that that approval on 4 August 2018? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The SABS. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 135 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait before you do that you, you confirm that nothing ever came out 
of that suggestion or allegation about you receiving a bribe from a China, a Chinese 
group or something? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The, the Russian group Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Russian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Russian group, ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the, the, the; I, I in preparation for this I enquired 
with our Head of Audit and Forensics just to in preparation for this to confirm the, they 
confirm that there were no such allegations or process that that was followed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you, you never heard, heard about that allegation after, after the 
10 
time when it was raised by him? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no Chair certainly not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes, you may proceed then and answer the 
question of the suspension of the approval by SAB. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair a number of things happened.  At this stage 
Chair after the signing the National Treasury was fully aware of these developments.  
They were also concerned about what was happening at the governance and a 
leadership issue.  I think also important to mention here Chair when I became aware 
that Mr Maritz was going to sing that transaction given that email correspondence and 
20 
that is where I, I have raised it with National Treasury.  I, I, the only, because in the 
organisation I could not go to the Chairman.  I could not go to Board Members.  I, the 
only remedy I had was to speak to the CFO or take other steps Chair.  I, I on that, on 
the day roundabout that period Chair I got into my car and I drove to the National 
Treasury.  I sat at the, waited for the DG in his office and when he had a few minutes I 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 136 of 191 
 
alerted him to the fact that this thing will happen.  He immediately responded and 
drafted a letter to the Director-General of DPE to say, to give him, say, to instruct that 
we must not proceed or to inform him that as the shareholder Minister he must 
intervene Chair and, and also important after that I, I remember a subsequent meeting 
after that event going to National Treasury to the Director-General.  Mr Maritz in a 
meeting was suggesting that quite annoyed with the fact that who is speaking to 
Government and who is telling Government what we are doing and that was the 
comment that he made.  So I was convinced that it was in relation, I do not think he 
knew who it was, but I think it was in relation to that act, because at that I did not know 
who to approach to say this thing is coming Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was the DG of Treasury at that time?  Was it Mr Fuzile? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, it was Dondo Mogajane Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and you then deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And, and I am sorry Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh I beg your pardon Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you went to National Treasury and you spoke to the DG 
there about this transaction that was about to be signed.  How long thereafter was the, 
was the transaction signed by Mr Maritz?  How long did it take after that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think it was a few days Chair.  I think. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If memory serves it was roundabout, when this email 
correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was clear that he was, intends to sign. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 137 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Roundabout that period.  So it was probably three or 
four days later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and then following that then you deal 
with the exchange of correspondence between SAB and Eskom. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair at, at this stage the, the, the and this is now a 
period I think in, in January that we deal with here Chair that the National Treasury is 
10 
fully aware of what has happened at Eskom.  We have also and I will hopefully get 
Chair in my supplementary explain National; the SAB is also aware of what is 
happening within Eskom and for that reason they responded to say the approval that 
we gave you in August we suspend that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And, and then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You deal with what you have put before, a letter from the 
National Treasury, the letter to the National Treasury, sorry written by Eskom.  Could 
you just deal with those?  In fact Eskom wrote to two DGs.  To the DG of DPE and to 
Mr Dondo Mogajane.  Now those letters are contained at pages 503 and 504, the first 
20 
one, but there’s a duplication of the one to Seseleke, you will find that these are written 
by Mr Caleb Cassiem on the 11th of January 2018. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  These letters they seem to still request for approval of 
the sort-term funding? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 138 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this was part of the process as I’ve indicated 
that we would have to go through to Government to say, as part of the due diligence 
process, so we’re concluding on that process that closes it out that says we have 
approached Government with this proposal that we received and Government 
responded by saying you do not have the authority to proceed, and that was the spirit 
of that, of that or the intention of that letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, so is it correct that these letters are written at the 
time when now there is also a demand for payment? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So what happened Chair the letters are dated the 11th of 
January 2018 so what ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry what page do the letters appear on? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Page 50. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon, the first one Mr Chairman appears at 
page AP23 at page 502, 503, then all the letters right up to 506 but there’s just one 
duplication and 507, it’s a duplication so they go up to 506. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Pillay you were still answering, you were 
still talking about now these requests to the DG of DPE and the DG of National 
20 
Treasury happens at a time when you already have now the invoice from Huarong, am I 
right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, so you are still requesting short-term facility with 
Huarong? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 139 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So basically Chair what we have done is to write to 
National Treasury and indicate to them everything that we are considering in relation to 
Huarong, but at this stage Chair the discussions with Government was quite clear, we 
are not going to proceed with this so we basically to complete so if I think if anyone had 
to come and say to us did you follow process, there was the Legal that did not support 
it, internal was not supported, even Government said do not proceed, and this was to 
close that process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just read what the final request by Cassiem is, 
that is the very last paragraph from page 503 but the last paragraph that appears at 
page 504, just to see what is it that he was actually requesting from the Director 
10 
General of the National Treasury? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair he request – in the light of the above, so 
Eskom requested the Director General to consider the merits and provide comments to 
the transactions in the context of utilisation of Government Guarantees for both the 
long-term ADFA and the short term facility within the approved borrowing limits.   
Formal application for utilisation of the Government Guarantee and PFM representation 
to the Minister and to the Minister of the Department of Public Enterprises and the 
Minister of Finance will be lodged following the response from the DG to this letter.  We 
remain available for further engagements to these transactions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, can you please explain to the Chairperson if then 
20 
the purpose was to close now because Government doesn’t want to deal with this, 
Government doesn’t want to proceed with the agreement, why was it necessary then 
for the long-term ADFA agreement to be part of the request that was being made to 
National Treasury at this point? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the – so we have not formally as Eskom gone to 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 140 of 191 
 
Government to close this out and that was the intention of this, was to go to 
government and say this is what we are dealing with, we would have to get your 
approval if you want to proceed and we just wanted to close that process that in the 
event that we are enquired why did we arrive at not signing we can demonstrate that 
Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But how are you closing it if you are applying to use 
Government Guarantees, because here formal application for utilisation of the 
Government Guarantee and PFMA applications would be made, how then is that 
closing the issue? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair we did not go to Government and say to 
10 
Government we don’t want these transactions anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew that they would say no? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We were in discussions with them ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, privately, informally. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Privately, informally we were in discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you knew that they would not approve? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We knew that they would not approve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had to approach them at a formal level so that they could 
formally say no, and that would enable you to say we can’t sign, is that what you are 
saying? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But then following on the Chairperson’s question but the 
agreements have already been signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 141 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So this  happens after the agreement has been signed by 
Sean Maritz, after the invoice has been issued and then you approach the National 
Treasury to say can we utilise – we will make an application to utilise the guarantees. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair to clarify the questions somewhat? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes this is after the signing of the agreement, this is not 
happening prior to the signing, it’s after the signing an invoice has been issued and 
then this request says to Government, that is to National Treasury we are going to, we 
want to utilise Government Guarantees for both the long term, ADFA, and the short-
term facility. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, Chair this is I suppose I need probably to explain it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I’m not explaining it well probably Chair.  Is the – Mr 
Maritz signed, the Board said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that was to close out the Board saying no process.  
Mr Maritz did what he did, it was not part of our process otherwise he would not have 
signed, so we were closing out our process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you mean you were closing it out? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So we were going to Government and saying to 
20 
Government we would have ordinarily come to you and asked for you to approve it, that 
was the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Ms Norman’s question you know goes to what purpose would 
that have served when the agreement had already been signed, in other words I mean 
it’s known that the Board had not given approval for the signing, okay, so if an issue 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 142 of 191 
 
were to arise about why that agreement was signed those who were against the signing 
of the agreement who did not support the signing of the agreement didn’t have to 
approve anything other than simply saying well Mr Maritz decided it upon himself to 
sign, ask him.  So what was the point of asking for a guarantee from Government when 
the agreement had already been signed, what purpose would that have served.  I think 
that’s the thrust of her question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair my understanding of it was it would certainly 
we knew that there was the possibility that Huarong would come back to us to say we 
need the cancellation fee, we were frustrated and repudiated, so we wanted to 
10 
demonstrate that we followed our process and that would, and I understand what you 
are saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But  how do you follow your process by asking Government for a 
guarantee after the transaction has been concluded because your process is that you 
ask for a guarantee before the transaction is concluded. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Mmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you asked for the guarantee after you are not following your 
process. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair I think your earlier comment, the issue here 
was we’ve had discussions with Government in that period, from January to when it 
20 
was signed again.  Government wanted – and in our discussions with Government, with 
National Treasury at the time was let’s close out this process, tell us what you wanted 
to do with this transaction and then we will formally respond and say to you no we don’t 
have the authority to continue that was the spirit of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It still doesn’t make it clear, what purpose would it serve?  A 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 143 of 191 
 
transaction has been made and when you talk about government in this context I think 
you talk about National Treasury, National Treasury knows because you spoke to the 
DG, knows that they said no to that transaction, and the transaction, and you know that 
the transaction has been signed.  One would expect you to go back to – to go to 
National Treasury not to ask for a guarantee because the transaction has been signed, 
but to tell them, confirm to them that actually it’s been signed without any guarantee, so 
if you were approaching them to tell them that then one would understand, because 
then you would be saying I came to you DG to tell you that there was a transaction to 
which was about to be signed, which was wrong for Eskom and that should not be 
signed and you did what you did but it was signed and so any discussion of guarantees 
10 
is water under the bridge, you understand that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you agree with that or ... 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no I certainly agree Chair, I think our intention at this 
time was just to get that confirmation from Government that they would not support this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And up to that stage you didn’t have anything in writing that they 
didn’t support it? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  But maybe just lastly the 
20 
attractiveness of the Huarong proposal was the fact that it did not require any 
guarantees, what then changed for you now to say to Government we would like 
guarantees because I mean it defeats the whole purpose of having pursued that 
proposal in the first place. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair if I may the – upon reading it appears as if we’re 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 144 of 191 
 
asking Government for a short-term and a long-term guarantee, and I think it was 
misstated here, because that was certainly not the case, we were only asking for a 
guarantee on the short-term and not on the long-term, so that was certainly an error on 
our side, in that letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But all in all both letters worded in a similar fashion, both 
to DG Seleke and to DG Mogajani? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you.  Now just to tie up then on the 
conclusions that you say I think this also relates still to the letter by Mr Maritz, where 
you list the governance and legal processes that were not followed at page 36, at 
10 
paragraph 36 I beg our pardon.  
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Paragraph 36? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes you highlight what was not complied with and that 
the ALFA and the ADFA are distinct documents, there was no legal transition that’s what 
we are saying so what sort of transition would have happened to move from the loan 
agreement to the Development Fund Agreement? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair and just based on my reading of the issue of the 
situation at the time is that in my mind there was no legal from the term sheets that 
were signed there was no legal indication that this now moves from an ALFA to an 
ADFA and so that was contained in the signed it was certainly my impression that there 
20 
was no indication that it’s not an ALFA anymore, it’s an ADFA and it may be some legal 
wording that would suggest how that transition happens but it was certainly my reading 
and there was the – there were in my mind two distinct documents, because the term 
sheet suggest that the conditions in the term sheet were being incorporated into the 
ALFA not the ADFA and that was what was signed by Mr Singh at the time. That was 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 145 of 191 
 
just a comment with regards to my observation or my testimony Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May I just take you back to this transaction that was signed by Mr 
Maritz.  He signed the long-term transaction is that right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood the position once the long-term transaction was 
signed did the short-term transaction fall away, or did it become redundant?   They 
made to sign the short-term transaction would it still have been there after the long-term 
transaction had been signed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair an important question is the – so Mr Maritz signed, 
and there was still this process with the Huarong to pursue the short-term facility into 
10 
December, up until they came back and indicated that they are not able to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when Mr Maritz signed the long term transaction the short-term 
discussions with Huarong in regard to the short-term transactions had not been 
concluded or had – they had not been concluded? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, nothing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but my question is whether you are dealing with a situation where 
if the long-term transaction has already been signed there would be  no need to still 
pursue a short-term transaction or whether there would still be a need to pursue a 
short-term transaction, because my understanding was that maybe you needed the 
sort-term transaction urgently to sign it urgently because negotiating the long-term one 
20 
might take long so – and there was a need for liquidity urgently but then that would give 
me the impression that once we have signed the long-term transaction then you might 
not really be needing the sort-term transaction because the long-term transaction has 
suddenly not taken as long as you thought it would take. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the signing of the long-term facility Chair that did not 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 146 of 191 
 
result or will not result, or would not have resulted in immediate liquidity coming in.  
There would have been a long period in terms of identifying the projects and – so it 
would – the long – the signing of the long-term facility did not ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do away with the need for the ...(intervention)  
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  ... cancelled the need for the short-term facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, would it be correct to say that compared to the short-term 
transaction that was being pursued there was actually – I mean pursuing the short-term 
transaction was more urgent than pursuing the long-term transaction would that be 
correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  You raised in paragraph 37 
right to paragraph, up to the end of your statement matters that you regard as important 
matters, some of them you’ve already testified to, for example for example what’s 
contained in paragraph 40 you’ve already dealt with, maybe you could just – you also 
testified to the fact that your fears that the signing of the agreement would trigger 
payment of upfront fees.  Do you want to just comment on what you say in paragraph 
37 about what DG Richard Seleke had said? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this is also in October before the signing of the 
long-term facility.  There was a meeting, we have regular quarterly update meetings 
20 
with the Department as Eskom, those are scheduled and obviously changes subject to 
availability but we had a regular meeting, Mr Caleb Cassiem and I were in the meeting, 
and towards the end of the meeting we were called to the DG’s office, and we were not 
aware of what the purpose of that meeting or discussion was, we joined the meeting 
and we found that Mr Maritz was in the meeting, and there were a number of 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 147 of 191 
 
discussions around funding and one of the comments that was made is – by Mr Seleke 
at the time was that, and he made a comment to the effect of -  to Mr Maritz that your 
problem is your people, they must stop looking to the West for funding, they must go to 
the East.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was saying that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Mr – the DG at the time, Richard Seleke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and this is now at Mineral and Resources Department?  
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This Department of Public Enterprises. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Public Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, Public Enterprises. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  DPE, so he was DG at the time, and the reason for 
raising this here Chair is that my sense was that the Huarong transaction is from the 
East, there is probably something in this comment here that would signal that you 
should move away from the conventional Western investor community, you should 
rather focus on what’s happening in the East, and that is the reason for commenting on 
that Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And you’ve dealt with the invoice in 
paragraph 39, you’ve dealt with your interactions with the DG before the signing, when 
you approached DG to say he must advise, he must stop the signing by Mr Maritz.  In 
paragraph 41 you raise matters where you were being threatened and could you tell the 
20 
Chairperson who threatened to you that he would come to Eskom and sort you out, and 
under what circumstances were you threatened. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair if I’m allowed to Chair, there’s a reporting point 
in 39 that I would like to cover as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes do that.  
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 148 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If I may Chair.  So the signing happened at the end of 
October Chair, end of October we were served with an invoice we did not pay, so the 
loan agreement required certain conditions precedent to be fulfilled and that was not 
met, because we did not sign and we – based on our understanding the Board did not 
approve so we did not engage Huarong on the conditions.  I mean there was no need 
to do that, the Board said no.  The agreement technically lapsed and we were then sent 
with an addendum to the agreement in December Chair.  And then Mr Maritz signed the 
addendum yet again and the fee letter yet again, knowing full well the discussions that 
preceded that in October the discussions that he was not allowed to sign and the Board 
10 
Resolution so he signed it again in December and we were served with an invoice in 
January again Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Chair.  Thank you for that Mr Pillay, 
you  just have to highlight where I miss an important point to raise it.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And then 41 Chair is the issue that I discussed here 
Chair was the there were two particular points that’s important in 41 Chair, is the fact 
that in the discussion, I think it was roundabout August before the signing Chair I raised 
the concern in a telephonic conversation with Mr Rajeev that I as said to him previously 
that I don’t agree with these parallel processes of them engaging with our Executive, it 
20 
compromises what we are doing through this process to complete it, the conversation 
became very heated and he made a comment that I am frustrating the process and he 
would come to Eskom and sort me out.  So that where I come from Chair that means 
something drastic.  It means ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is around what, August? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 149 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was around August/September Chair, that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, 2017? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  2017 Chair, that he would come to Eskom and sort me 
out.  At that stage I abandoned all discussions with him, Mr Rex Madida intervened he 
came to the Eskom offices to try and manage and he indicated that they have taken Mr 
Rajeev away from this transaction and the Eskom engagement and tried to have a 
conversation with me to say I must forgive and move on, or reconcile with.  At that 
stage I realised that we are not just busy with  people wanting to do funding, there’s 
certainly concern from my side Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The other issue in that paragraph that I also raised Chair 
and during the process throughout the year Chair there was also a very concerning 
conversation with the gentleman that manages Sambesi Capital, a Ven Zibanda Chair.  
He also indicated to me that in a conversation with Mr Singh that apparently there was 
an introduction between the Huarong team and the Trillion team, that was also, I raised 
that with Mr Rajeev at that point in time, he indicated that it’s not the case.  I also in this 
conversation with him, the last conversation I had with him and it certainly unsettled him 
or frustrated him, or he became very furious about that point, and that, all of those 
things were very concerning for me, those linkages and connections Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And you deal with something which I believe 
20 
to be important in paragraph 44 as well, you jump to 46, and in paragraph 44 you 
mention some figures there. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair there I just broadly mention what would be the 
fees at the point in time I think it was – and unfortunately I didn’t include it, so the issue 
was that it immediately the signing immediately triggers, without Chair earlier comment 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 150 of 191 
 
that Eskom does not get a paperclip, a R4million fee, and of which R240million was 
payable immediately. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you said R400million fee, but I guess you have now clarified 
that is 400million. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I’ve converted that already Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you mentioned something about Huarong acting in a 
particular manner in paragraph 45. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair here was an instance where there was – and I 
10 
think it was at the outset as well, that they wanted to send correspondence and just 
suggest you can put it on a letterhead of Eskom and sign it and send it back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How, when did that happen? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So there was an instance in I think the date now is in 
2016 and I will confirm that Chair, so there was this intention to say why don’t you just 
put this in a letter and send and sign it back.  Sometimes it was ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words preparing and drafting letters for Eskom officials to 
put on Eskom letterheads and sign? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes the one letter that I remember Chair it was fairly, if I 
can call it that, benign, it was just thanking us for the – and even that I found worrying 
20 
Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you at any point sign letters as they suggested and 
put them on your letterhead and just sign them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The one that alarmed me was the letter that we 
discussed because if you look at the letter it’s almost the same as their letter but I did 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 151 of 191 
 
not sign a letter no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You didn’t sign any letter? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then would you want to move to paragraph – you’ve 
dealt with Mr Ven Zibanda is there anything else in that paragraph you wish to point out 
to the Chairperson? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  46 no Chair, I think I’ve covered that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  47, Chair can I proceed to 47? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So 47 Chair I just mention the fact that during the time 
when there was discussions and just prior to the exit of Mr Arnoj Singh it appeared to 
me that the Chairman would be able to control this process because at this point in time 
Chair it was quite clear that we – the governance of Eskom was a problem, the 
implicated individuals would include him were of concern to the markets and it 
appeared that Mr Zethembe was protective of Mr Arnoj and did not want to take the 
decisions to either suspend him and take corrective measures Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, earlier on you did indicate about the involvement of 
Trillian, I think when this corporate plan drafting, but could you just elaborate and tell 
the Chairperson what you mean in paragraph 48 about what is their involvement within 
20 
Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair in paragraph 48 I just indicate that following the 
arrival of Mr Molefe and Mr Singh at Eskom we did McKinsey was working for Eskom 
and doing work for Eskom at the time, but when they arrived there were increased 
numbers of McKinsey people, they were doing all sorts of things with Eskom and also 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 152 of 191 
 
similarly with regiments that then transitioned into Trillion at the time Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you talk about the R30billion loan facility between 
Eskom and Goldman Sacks, what do you want to highlight there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair here is an example of the – a transaction that we 
pursued, it was also again an RFP process that we followed, we identified this 
particular funding and it was clear that the intention was to incorporate or impose 
Trillion onto this transaction.  This transaction particularly Chair was also for around two 
billion dollars at the time, amounting to R30billion and Goldman Sacks made it clear to 
Mr Singh that they would not proceed with collaborating or partnering with Trillion with 
transactions of this nature, but there was no process followed for that Chair. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you talk about Goldman Sachs and its demands 
about Mr Arnoj Singh in paragraph 50. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair I mentioned the point that I also admit here that 
when they joined Trillion particularly had the capacity or the competency in the treasury 
related activities so I did meet with him a number of occasions and in one of the 
occasions I recall Chair that he made a comment to me that I can do anything in the 
Treasury for you, Arnoj Singh find a way of paying you, and that was certainly – 
unfortunately Chair I was alone in the conversation but it was certainly something that I 
was not – following that Chair I did not have further engagements with him at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and he was talking about Treasury, the Eskom Treasury? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Eskom Treasury but he indicated you can give me 
anything to do, Arnoj will find a way of paying you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it your experience that Mr Anoj Singh could get anything done at 
Treasury, at Eskom Treasury? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair I think it was just generally that… 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 153 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The payment to him was probably well would have 
happened somewhere else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But if we can agree and I would agree that he would do 
some work for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Mr Anoj Singh will find a way of paying me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just as a matter of interest would as head of treasury 
10 
would you – would there be a situation where you do not know of any of the payments 
that are made within – within Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So yes Chair.  So the organisation is structured such 
that there is a customer service area that would deal with the regular payments.  We 
predominantly focus on the payments of our loans and our debt and the foreign debt 
payments.  The other payments are consequences how the rest of the business is 
conducted.  So there would be payments that I am not aware of.  They would come 
through either through our customer service area and be incorporated in the budgets of 
those departments and get paid in that way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  You have dealt already in your evidence 
20 
about the corporate plan and how it was drafted with the inclusion of McKinsey and 
Trillian that is repeated in paragraph 51.  If you agree with me in that score you could 
perhaps just deal with how much was paid then to Trillian by Eskom for its participation 
in the corporate plan? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair I must admit the reference to the 30 million was 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 154 of 191 
 
what I picked up in the public domain.  So I believe that that was paid and the point that 
we wanted to make here Chair was the – we drafted the corporate plan and we 
submitted the corporate plan.  Towards the end and the finalisation of this corporate 
plan Mr Eric Wood was summoned to the office.  We went to see Mr Singh. There was 
a debate on drafting issues Chair and that was it.  The financial plan was conclude – 
the funding plan was concluded but it was drafted by us. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And I learnt later in the public domain that they were 
paid 30 million for work that we have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever have occasion to check whether what you found out in 
10 
the public domain was actually true? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As somebody in treasury? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair the – I did not pursue that it was basically in 
the public domain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  But if you wanted to find out whether there was such an 
amount paid out from Eskom being head of treasury would you not be able to find out? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I would be able to.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair I would be able to go through the organisation 
20 
and draw records and try and find it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do you know how long it might take you to find out? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No I think it would be – should be fairly quick Chair that 
we can… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 155 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We can establish that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will follow up thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja I think it should be followed up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we know as a fact whether it happened or not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then in paragraph 53 which is the last 
paragraph in your main statement you deal with the payment made to Trillian in the 
amount of 4 million, what was that for? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Ms Normanl 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pillay the only thing I am thinking of is whether as head of nat – of 
treasury when you picked up something like that especially when it was said that 
somebody had been paid by Eskom such a lot of money for work that you did and they 
did not do whether it was not – you were not obliged to check whether that was true 
because if it was true should not – would there not be steps that would need to be 
taken to follow up who authorised that payment and on what basis they authorised it 
when those people had not done the work? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair certainly it would have been for me to follow up on 
that.  At the time Mr Anoj Singh was still part of the organisation Chair and I certainly 
20 
did not want to probe at something that – at the hornet’s nest Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course he left? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So he was still there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I mean afterwards he left? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes but afterwards I mean to compile this I certainly 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 156 of 191 
 
should have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Because that is a lot of money that could be money that – 
taxpayer’s money that should not have been paid out and somebody if it was paid out 
should be held responsible. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it was paid out for no value.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that should be followed up to check. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For each yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then let the commission know what the position is.  A 
10 
supplementary statement can be made where you say you have checked and this is 
what you found.  Okay? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then you were talking in 
paragraph 53. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair paragraph 53 just relates an instance where we in 
the treasury were busy negotiating with China Development Bank at the time.  As part 
of the negotiations we technically got stuck on a particular clause it was a negative 
20 
pledge clause and I – in my discussions in giving updates to Mr Singh in terms of the 
progress on it I raised this with him.  He asked me to send him an email to say what are 
the issues,  He then took that and sent it onto Trillian and they responded almost with 
what I in my understanding told him what could be the possible solution and I also 
again Chair I was – I also learnt and that they were paid almost 4 million for that.  And 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 157 of 191 
 
again Chair in line with your earlier comment just also just follow up on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Follow up and check ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Chairman.  Mr 
Singh could you then before we conclude just go to your… 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Mr Singh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To your supplementary statement. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair I am being referred to as Mr Singh Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did I say Mr Singh again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh second time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I – now you must fine me for doing that.  Thank you I 
10 
apologise.  Thank you.  In your supplementary statement you capture matters that in 
fact you actually deal with the atmosphere and the environment that it prevailed within 
Eskom at – during certain times a period between May 2017 to January 2018.  And the 
position of Eskom financial situation at Eskom at that time.  Could you without really 
just going paragraph by paragraph because you know what you – what is contained. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In – during that period could you just summarise exactly 
what was prevailing at Eskom during that period? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the essence of and in preparing for this was I 
wanted to give a perspective Chair that this was not a situation of mere funds that can 
20 
be drawn out of the South African economy or if I can use the word looting Chair.  The 
risk of what we were facing at Eskom we stood the risk of collapsing the South African 
economy.  That in the event that Eskom was allowed based on these activities to 
default on its debt it would have defaulted almost 400 billion of debt.  It would have 
triggered a default into the government debt and it was certainly something that was 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 158 of 191 
 
quite clear as a result of these activities would have amounted to that.  So it was – 
sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no continue I am listening. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I – the point that we wanted to – that I wanted to make 
here Chair is – was this was not just trying to get money out of the system the risk was 
we would have collapsed the South African economy.  We would have had a 
depreciation in our currency.  We would have our capital and equity markets 
deteriorate.  We would have a collapse in the growth of our economy.  It is just 
unimaginable what could have happened in that event.  So I am giving a picture that if 
the consequences of these activities was … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  A default on the part of… 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  A default would have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Disastrous for the economy. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It would have been disastrous for the South African 
economy and it would have been these – these activities or contracts that we signed it 
would have resulted in that default Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand the position with regard to guarantees as explained 
to the commission by various witnesses from or attached to National Treasury at one 
stage or another it is that if an entity such as Eskom or any SOE well maybe it is not 
about a guarantee but if – ja no if there is a guarantee, a government guarantee and 
20 
the entity defaults then it is not a matter of just that particular lender or funder that is 
connected with that transaction that can then demand the whole repayment of the – of 
what they are owed but other lenders too may do the same in regard to I think if I 
understand correctly in regard to other entities and government so … 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the way… 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 159 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding more or less correct? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  More or less yes Chair.  And I can – if I may Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Just clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the way it – things are stand now Chair so if Eskom 
had to default government – the government guarantee framework is such that 
government steps into Eskom shoes and service the debt that is guaranteed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that is only if government has the ability to do so 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the point that I am sharing here Chair is that if you 
look at the context of 400 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And where we are from a national treasury fiscal 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It is unlikely that government would either… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Assume all that debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Or step into Eskom’s shoes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And that could trigger a default into the government as 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 160 of 191 
 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Because – and that is the point I am making Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then it would mean that not only would government not be 
able to borrow but other lenders who might demand payment as well. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it is actually it would be quite disastrous for the economy? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair disastrous oh indeed.  The only example that I can 
think of now would be the Argentinian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Situation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So we could technically worst case scenario if 
government is unable to arrest the situation trigger a default into the sovereign as well 
so our government would be defaulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.  Okay let us go back to the transaction that Mr Maritz 
signed.  You instructed people at treasury at Eskom not to execute on the invoice that 
was put up? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Where did that end?  I do not think I heard that.  What happened?  
20 
Was it never paid or what happened? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair still even after the second signature we were still 
serve – again served with an invoice to almost the most quantum or amount.  We still 
did not pay and it is also Chair if you look at the time, the passage of time this is when 
the new leadership, the new CEO and the board walk in. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 161 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And they then found this situation.  Obviously our 
reporting into the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That this event happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this is when now the new board… 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  New board came in Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Came in.  This is now early 2018. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And then there was formal communication between 
Eskom and Huarong they approached Eskom and I think to the comment of the – our 
chairman last week Chair that Eskom basically said to them this thing was not signed 
… 
CHAIRPERSON: Oh yes now I remember ja.  He said they were not going to pay and 
the chairperson of Huarong asked for … 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Confirmation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A meeting over coffee or something and your chairman said no I am 
not going to have coffee with you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you want to sue us, sue us.  Is that – that is where the whole 
position is? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair and that is the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay and Mr Maritz was dismissed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He was – he – during that disciplinary process I think 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 162 of 191 
 
towards the end of January, February there was this Bowman’s investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And during that process he resigned Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  that is what I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that – okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then you deal in that 
supplementary affidavit with the – the qualified audit of Eskom and the consequences 
that that had on Eskom and its debt to its lenders.  Could you just deal with that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the issue that we had was the under the 
10 
qualification in some of our loan agreements particular two Chair and I ask Chair that 
the sensitivity of the name be kept that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Of those particular lenders Chair that if you do not deal 
with the qualification and the default, event of default under those loan agreements 
Eskom would technically default and we would not be able to release our results at a 
point in time.  We would not be able to secure funding and so those matters that 
resulted in the qualified audit was certainly at that point in time linked to the 
transactions, the contentious transactions that is in the public domain they were linked 
to those that resulted in the qualification of Eskom’s side Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and that qualified opinion is in Annexure AP25 
at page 530.  There the auditors identified the basis for that qualified opinion.  Can you 
recall what that basis is you can go to page 530 and just summarise under Basis for 
Qualified Irregular Expenditure.  Page 530.   
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 163 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair.  In our opinion if I may Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:   
“That the basis of the qualification Chair is basically the irregular 
expenditure and it relates to in this Section 55(2)(B)i of the PFMA 
that requires disclosure in a note to the consolidated and 
separate financial statements particulars of the irregular 
expenditure that has occurred during the financial year” 
And that Chair I think what we dealt or what we dealt with here was the auditors could 
10 
not in the Eskom’s audit at the time that it was conducted find and in particular at a 
point in time the matters relating to McKinsey, Trillian and I think it was Impulse at the 
time.  And for that reason the auditors qualified the audit. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you and then at page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  535 they identify matters under procurement and they 
comment on that – could you just quickly briefly summarise what they say there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair over and above the – those particular contracts 
Chair they were also irregularities in our procurement so it ranges from invoices, foreign 
tax invoices that was not available for foreign suppliers.  There is quite a number of 
20 
them Chair that relates to that.  There was also non-compliance with the construction 
industry certification that we needed as part of our procurement so there was a – but 
those were probably the – what I can recall the issues that we dealt with that resulted in 
the non-compliance from a procurement perspective. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  I am not sure whether you want to – are you 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 164 of 191 
 
satisfied with your answer to the Chairperson when you were dealing and the 
Chairperson was putting to you the scenario about guarantees and with Eskom having 
a qualified audit what that had on Eskom’s debts having to lenders calling up debt and 
with Eskom defaulting.  Do you want to just quickly briefly elaborate on that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the qualified audit would result in an event of 
default.  If you are not able to cure that or waiver the event of default or remedy it it 
would certainly result in a pre-payment of those facilities and that would – there are 
some cross default triggers into our other loan facilities and there was a number of 
them Chair and that would result in almost a default on our total debt if you go through 
the waterfall of our debt portfolio.  So the qualification was quite material if we were not 
10 
able to remedy that or waiver that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have a recollection of what Eskom’s total debt was more or 
less around that time if you had defaulted. What government could have been called 
upon to sort out? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair from memory I think it was the order of magnitude 
of about 395 billion at the time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  I – we seemed to have covered everything I 
am not sure whether you really want to go – I think you have covered the gist of what 
you wanted to convey in your supplementary. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The situation at Eskom at the time and how the audit 
itself had affected Eskom as an entity and how maybe you could just talk to the steps 
that you took in order to make sure that you did not have a situation where all lenders 
were calling up debt. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 165 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the – what we then – the process that was 
followed is obviously to deal with the issues that give rise to the qualification and 
address that with a particular lender.  We engaged the lender and the lender then 
indicated what – what Eskom would have to deal with is obviously the issues around 
the concerns that the investor community and not the lender particularly had was the 
procurement issues at Eskom. What is in the public domain around governance and 
people implicated into some of the – also again what was in the public domain the 
behaviour of certain individuals within Eskom and those were some of the discussions 
that we had with lenders at the time Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then you have an important period as 
10 
well in your supplementary between April 2015 and June 2017.  Could you please just 
talk to that and also to the conversations with Mr Brian Molefe … 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair in… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In paragraph 16 and 16. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the – I think I have largely covered what the issues 
on 15 was in terms when after Mr Molefe and Mr Singh arrived at Eskom from Transnet 
and the presence of McKinsey and Trillian at Eskom and then in 16 Chair there was 
also a request when we were Chair you may recall when we referred to the public 
sector participation programme there was the suggestion or the proposal or 
recommendation from Mr Singh to say that we should go and Transnet look at their 
20 
policy and basically use that as a reference for our PSP programme Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And then also Chair and I mentioned in my statement 
Chair that there was a particular point in time where the then treasurer Caroline Henry 
indicated that and it was a verbal conversation Chair so it was not a formal meeting that  
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 166 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That Mr Molefe suggested that if we are sitting with 
surplus cash can we not reinvest that with Transnet given their liquidity requirements.  I 
think we – oh not I think I know that we responded by saying our policies does not allow 
for that.  But I think it is just worth noting that Chair.  It was not an instruction it was not 
basically insisting just mention that Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then you say that both Ms Henry and Mr Homewood 
their contracts were not renewed? 
 MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Ms Henry she and that is again Chair my 
understanding at the point in time she was at the time where she had to renegotiate her 
10 
contract and it was renewed and the indications was that she does not fit in with the 
new leadership of the organisation.  That was certainly my impression and I have 
explained what happened to Mr Homewood in terms the instruction to me to say I must 
exit him from the…sation.  That was certainly my impression and I have explained what 
happened to Mr Homewood in terms the instruction to me to say I must exit him from 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually at some stage I was going to come back to you on that that 
you were given instructions by Mr Anoj Singh to get rid of him and how you – whether 
you ultimately got rid of him yourself or and if so how you went about that because from 
what you indicated earlier on it seemed you not in agreement with this instruction. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja so Chair the – it worked out in a quite an interesting 
way.  So I went back to Mr Singh and asked why do we need to do this. I suggest to 
him that I am not comfortable to go and say listen you need to leave.  I proposed that I 
know that he wanted to leave when Ms Henry left so I wanted to suggest to him can we 
not say to him that he wanted to leave and this is an opportunity for him to consider.  
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 167 of 191 
 
But by the time that I – after a couple of days delay because I found it quite difficult to 
do that Chair when I called him to have the discussion with him Chair to explain to him 
what was happening he already in the organisation found out that there was this plan of 
[indistinct].  So before I could even engage him he said to me he is comfortable just 
show me what is on the table and what you propose and I will – I am willing to go.  So 
there was no need for a conversation that you need to leave and this is almost – there 
was no need for that conversation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see one of the problems that – one of the problems that 
have been seen in government departments and in parastatals form what one picks up 
simply from the media is that there may well be certain funds, taxpayer’s money that 
10 
gets used to get rid of officials or employees that have done nothing wrong just 
because somebody senior does not want them.  Sometime does not want them for 
personal reasons, sometimes because that person is a stumbling block to things that 
the senior one wants to have done and to then want to put in somebody that is not 
going to be stumbling block.  That cannot be certainly where it is done for oh purposes 
of getting somebody else in who will be pliable to issues of corruption that is not the 
way how taxpayer’s money can be used and certainly what you said earlier on when 
you testified it seems that you did not think that there was a valid reason for Mr Singh to 
want that member of your staff to be – to leave. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No certainly not Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and despite whatever Mr Singh might have told you you 
remained unpersuaded that there was a good reason? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no still not Chair to this day not convinced Chair. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman and then you deal with the 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 168 of 191 
 
issue of delegation of authority in 2015 which you – you refer the commission to AP27 
which appears at page 557.  What is it that you want convey about the delegations of 
authority? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the – what I wanted to share here in terms of what 
were the limits that certain committees were able to sign off on and certainly the 
understanding that or the sign off of the long term facility by Mr Maritz was not part of 
his delegation.  At least the approved delegation by government DOA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay what paragraph – what page is that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is page 558 Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  585? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  558.  558. 
CHAIRPERSON:  558 okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Where would Mr Maritz fall 
within those categories if you could just direct the Chairperson to the relevant one? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair if I may page 565.  So it would be largely linked 
to – so this is specific on – under the but just a guide Chair is that if you look at 
paragraph 232 it gives you a sense of what the – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it now. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So 56 – 532 highlights at least finance director and not 
even the CEO.  That is the limits that they have so it says: 
20 
“The following designations may on behalf of Eskom and up to the following limits 
negotiate, conclude and approve transactions in foreign currency exchange interest 
rates and commodity derivatives.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Let us have a – take an example you would be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry I thought I found it.  Did you say 562? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 169 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  565. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  565. 
CHAIRPERSON:  565.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have got 565 I was here earlier on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 232. 
CHAIRPERSON:  23 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2 paragraph 232 Mr Chairman.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the following designation may on behalf of Eskom and up to the 
following limits negotiate, conclude and approve transactions and foreign exchange 
foreign interest rate and commodity derivative instruments.  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That is the – just for the finance director Chair and if I – 
may – if I can refer you to 558 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 55? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  558. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So there Chair if you look at the resolution resolved that 
20 
under two financial limits and we refer here to the IFC Chair.  General transactional 
limits is increased from 500 million to 750 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the point that we wanted to – that I wanted to 
highlight here Chair that even the IFC. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 170 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That we took that transaction to according to this 
delegation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Did not have the authority to even… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The IFC was compelled. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  To elevate it to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So and being acting group CEO are you saying that Mr Maritz 
10 
would certainly have known the limit of his delegations? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think not necessarily know, but probably followed up on 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And I think also Chair the, the, the reason for raising it 
here is that in that email that he responded to the CFO to say that he is going to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He indicated a number of 5 billion that he is delegated to 
sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Somehow suggests something different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That we need to confirm. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 171 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and, and at page 565 the General Manager 
Treasury just below 2.3.2 that would be yourself. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  56? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  565. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  At, at what point then did you realise that the IFC 
did not have authority to look into the proposal? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It is at, at the time when, when this email came back that 
Sean Maritz indicated that he is going to sign.  That is when I looked at the, the, the 
10 
delegation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But, but is, I think I referred you to a memorandum that 
you had prepared to the IFC? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If then IFC did not have authority why would you 
forward a memorandum to it for it to look into the proposal? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair so the, the request was for it to go to the IFC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and, and only afterwards did I also pick this up but 
the limit of that was only for the IFC.  So it was certainly from my side as well that it had 
20 
to go to all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to that, are you, are you saying to that extent Mr Maritz might 
also have been unaware of that limit? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 172 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  He may have been unaware of that limit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just to wind up then on the Huarong 
transaction action.  Huarong was, as you have already testified in your evidence, 
Huarong was just a vehicle set up purely for the purposes of Tribus interacting with 
Eskom.  Am I right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To facilitate the, the, the. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They, they were. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The funding. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  From the high fund to the, the, the success, the, the, the 
following discussions or the follow up discussions that we had. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That was always conceptually what they wanted. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They wanted to do.  The only difference Chair was that 
they were with Huarong.  They were now able to get bigger funding volume to be able 
to do, so. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So it was always part of their structure that they 
20 
followed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and was Huarong registered on the database of 
Eskom as a supplier? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that how Eskom does business?  You do not have to 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 173 of 191 
 
register as a supplier?  You can do business with Eskom without being on, on its 
database? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair this is part of that process that had to be 
followed.  That if we, we do not register them without having concluded or agreed or 
signed off on agreement that would say they are now a supplier in this format and again 
Chair back to the, the issue that transaction apart from the IFC it still had to go to the 
BTC to, to, to deal with those issues according to my understanding at the time Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether you register a company in your database 
when you have concluded a contract with them or it is a requirement that they should 
be on the database before you can conclude a contract with them. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I am not sure Chair.  I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, thank you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja, I am certainly not sure of that at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so, so it might not be a strict requirement that you must be, you 
must be on the database before a contract can be concluded? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might not be a strict requirement or it might not be a requirement at 
20 
all? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I am certainly not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But, but you have been there for seven years.  Probably if it was a 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 174 of 191 
 
strict requirement you would know? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I would know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Can you just follow up on that Mr Pillay?  I even as 
lawyers you would not be able to do work with Government if you do not appear on the 
Treasury database.  Is that, is that, is that something that, maybe they are just abusing 
lawyers.  It is something that we can, we can do without being on the database and just 
do business with, with, with Government? 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry, Chair the, is the question that if they are not on 
the database? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That you cannot do business with them. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So in, in our case what, if you use the example of the 
lawyers we have a legal panel. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That is established and then you would obviously if you 
are qualified and on the panel you would be on the database on the Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then only then will Eskom contract you to do 
work for it? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That that and so there would be a contracting period 
obviously to bet you onto the panel and for you to be on that is that is certainly my 
understanding of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  That there must be a contract first before you are 
on the panel?  Before you are, you are [intervenes]. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 175 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I am not; that is the part that I am not sure Chair of 
which comes first.  The. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  You have a contract and then you are registered or are 
you registered then you have a contract. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But it is your section not a custodian of that information 
as Treasury Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Of, of the legal panel? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no.  Not necessarily the legal.  Of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of the database for suppliers for Eskom. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the, we have a general database. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So what we do with and in this case there was an RFP.  
We have issued that RFP to the whole market.  We did not say if you are not on the 
Eskom database or you can only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, alright okay and then and then just on that RSP, 
RFP scope you said how many people reacted to that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I, sorry Chair I am not sure, but there was a [intervenes]. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  [Intervenes]. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think indicative I mean I, from memory I remember 
there were the ones that I mentioned earlier was the, the J P Morgan Municipal Debt 
Securitisation.  There was the Absa, RMP Facilities.  Sorry, I do not have off the top of 
my head. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 176 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The whole complete list. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then what, what, how do you make sure, the 
Chairperson did indicate this when he put one of the questions to you that in order to 
make sure that your procurement processes you know constitutionally compliant how 
do you make sure that for instance like in this case of Huarong where you have cast the 
net wide and you said anyone who has got a funding proposal who is going to, not 
going to require Government. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Guarantees. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Guarantees, please offer your services to us.  How do 
10 
you then make sure that that process is fair?  It is competitive and it is, it is costs 
effective? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair based on the criteria the, the, the team or the 
Committee that evaluates that would then say this is the responses that we got, but I do 
not, sorry I think it is in line with the responses that we get as the RFP that we put out 
for the request for the information.  Then we would assess if it is, it is transparent, does 
it comply with all the requirements of the RFP. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then am I correct to say that in your answers to 
the Chairperson you did not have a successful bidder from the RFP process in your 
answers to the Chairperson there was not a successful bidder to that RFP process? 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  To the RFP process? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The ones that we were dealing with so the [intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The Huarong situation. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 177 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes and, and the, the ones the examples that are used, 
the J P Morgan, the, the Absa and the RMP proposals.  They were certainly of one that 
I can recall. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is, is the answer that you concluded that process and there were 
entities or suppliers that service providers that you elect, you appointed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So we, we, we did not conclude with that.  So we were. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You left it hanging? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We identified the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And we were continuing with discussions with them 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was that discussion concluded at any stage or it was abandoned 
after the signing of the agreement? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No Chair.  So we, we concluded the, the particularly the 
J P Morgan one we could not conclude because of the, the state within Eskom 
particularly around the municipal debt.  The other two from memory the J, the Absa 
20 
transaction and we have concluded on an RMP transaction Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and, and those were entities that responded to the RFP that 
you told us about? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  RFI, RFP Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 178 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is Absa and RMP you said those are concluded? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That is from memory that I can recall Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Those were concluded.  Just, just one other thing.  
Let us just talk about this Huarong and the iDiva entity that was going to receive the 
money.  Were you aware when White & Case, you know in some of the matters that you 
had raised that iDiva they had found that iDiva was actually a shoe company that was 
registered in the Virgin Islands.  Were you aware of that information? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And being a person who then is entrusted with you know 
public funds within Eskom Treasury, did you not see that as a risk of saying look I do 
10 
not even want to touch this people in this company and this proposal? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair I think the, obviously the, it raises the red flags 
the Virgin Isles and we raised this issue of, of iDiva Chair, but we wanted to conclude 
our process so that we can go back and say to them we have concluded.  It was not 
midstream that we have, we have seen iDiva and we do not like it.  We wanted to 
complete our process so that we can go back to them comprehensively and indicate to 
them what it is that we, we did not want and why we did not conclude the term.  That 
was certainly my understanding or approach to it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and the, the, what is called the parent company of, 
of, of Huarong and you had seen the structure and in that structure which appears in 
20 
your statement maybe I will just take you back just slightly you would find that even 
within that structure Huarong Energy Africa only has a stake of about 8.2 percent, if you 
look at it. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is it 25.08?  I just, I just want to take you to that please.  
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 179 of 191 
 
If you like, if you could just bear with me Mr Chairperson. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Sorry Chair, the page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  I am going to take you to that page just quickly a 
second.  Sorry, I just want to find the diagram.  Just, just talking about that maybe, 
what, what investigations did you as Treasury do to make sure that if a company says I 
personally I do not have the money, but my parent company will fund this process.  
What measures or systems do you have within Treasury that you must employ or in 
order to make sure that not just one fly by night can come to you and say I can actually 
fund you and in fact it does not have funds.  Thank you, thank you.  I found the page 
Chairperson.  It is page 428, thank you, of the, of U6.  The big bundle.  428, sorry.  As 
10 
you can see the, the, what is called as a parent company, China Huarong Asset 
Managing Company on top. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you can see Huarong Energy Africa is right 
down there. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With a 25 percent stake in Huarong Energy Investment. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  65 percent stake in Huarong Energy Investment and that 
has been 25 percent stake in Huarong Energy Africa Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now 65 percent is for China Huarong. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  China Overseas Investment in, into Huarong Energy 
Investment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but we are talking about the Huarong that you were, 
you were dealing with. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 180 of 191 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes what is the percentage for that one? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The Huarong, we were dealing with Huarong Energy 
Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and how, please can you try and relate that to the 
very first management company that is on top? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So the, the, the management top company on top is 100 
percent owned.  It has 51 percent stake.  So there is obviously the, the funding would, 
would, would be structured and, and from the Huarong Overseas Chinese Asset 
Management that has 100 percent stake in China Huarong Overseas Investment and 
that 65 percent in Huarong Energy Africa with a 25 percent stake in Huarong Energy 
10 
Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So all of this is what you were told by Huarong Energy 
Africa? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And on your own as, as, as Treasury you never checked 
whether in fact even Huarong Management would be prepared to put up funds to assist 
in this transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  This, this was based on the proposal and I, and we did 
do some a due diligence on or just an assessment of the; and, and, and you will recall 
Chair that we, we did in that discussions with them meet the individuals from Huarong 
20 
Energy and they provided a profile of the company to us.  So, and, and, and obviously 
linked to that was the, the involvement of White & Case to do that assessment for us 
Chair.  So we did do that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but then you see we keep on going back to White & 
Case and, and this troubles me because White & Case is very clear there is no grey 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 181 of 191 
 
area in their memorandum. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They are simply saying that everything about these 
people is suspect.  These companies, get more information before you do business 
with them, but then you, you, Eskom continued to just engage them and do business 
with them.  Who really stood to benefit from this transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the, the, the; so the process we had to follow our, 
our legal process and, and we could not just suspend it in between because we do not 
like iDiva or we, we, we had to complete our process so that we can conclude it and 
say to them based on a comprehensive review these are the reasons that we do not 
10 
want to continue with you, because it would certainly in, in just thinking of it Chair result 
in Huarong saying to us as per this term sheet you were frustrated and you, you have, 
you have basically compromised the negotiations to get to the alpha. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But again if you say to them iDiva is a shoe company. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  They were aware.  We told them that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We indicated that to them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but I am, what I would like to know from you 
Mr Pillay there was legal advice against this transaction.  There was financial advice 
from Mr Khan against this transaction. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And nothing was happening in the sense that nobody 
was actually saying here is money into your South African bank to show commitment on 
their part.  How was this transaction going to benefit Eskom? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair the, the, the, there would not be money going 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 182 of 191 
 
into Eskom if you do not have an agreement that is signed and, and certainly the 
discussions around August was clear that there was following our process the legal 
advice is clearly there and not to continue.  The, the evaluation from Mr Khan is clearly 
there.  So there was sufficient reason now to say based on a process that we followed 
that we can go back to them and say to them we have followed our processes.  We 
cannot continue with you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then at what point then just before Mr Maritz had signed 
at what point did you raise these matters with Huarong and say they there are these 
concerns please rectify them or satisfy us that in fact these matters which are crucial 
towards the conclusion of the agreement even if it was not going to be, but if you were 
10 
anticipating concluding one, at what point were these matters raised with them? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It was, it was raised throughout the discussion around 
the, the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That that we had concerns with all of these [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is not the position that you as Treasury raise them with those to 
whom you reported, but those to whom you reported did not share the same view as 
you with regard to what the attitude should be to Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair it may be an easy yes out Chair, but certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  We engaged them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huarong? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  We raised it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Internally Chair, but. 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 183 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  There was the process that we are unfolding and 
developing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The, and, and, and the proposal or engaging or 
negotiating this proposal [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including with Mr Anoj Singh or when he was not there? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, just with them Chair, because the Board’s resolution 
was negotiating and [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And conclude.  He has to be [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no what, what I mean is, from what you have told us at least 
from a certain stage Mr Anoj Singh seemed to be, to have no problems dealing with 
them or even concluding signing some agreements of one kind or another with them, 
but you as Head of Treasury at Eskom from quite early you had serious reservations to 
say the least with regard to proposals from Huarong.  So what I thought might be the 
position is that what you told to Huarong depended on what Mr Anoj Singh’s attitude 
was because he would be I would, I, I thought he would be the leader of any group from 
Eskom discussing with Huarong, but I may be mistaken in that regard, because you say 
you did raise these issues with Huarong. 
20 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would Mr Anoj Singh have been present when you raised them 
or he would have been? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not have been present? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 184 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No he was not, he was not present when we engaged 
with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  In, in that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anyway the answer is that you did raise them. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to the signing? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Prior to the signing and throughout the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  That we were going through with that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and, and raising them, did you raise them 
in, in writing? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So there, there is evidence of just particularly the, the 
fee issue and the structuring of the fees.  We raised those with, with Huarong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but I am talking about matters that are structural that 
are raised by White & Case.  They raised structural mattes and matters relating to the 
terms.  The structural issues about the composition of the various entities did you ever 
raise those in writing? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No, no not in writing Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But it is, it is in the part of the negotiations and the 
discussions we had with them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Lastly Mr Pillay from the 
correspondence I have taken you through the submissions and everything else that you 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 185 of 191 
 
had prepared.  It appears that there was a point when you were in support of this 
transaction.  Am I right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the, the, the only reference to it in terms of the 
support of the transaction was in particular the questions at the various Boards and it 
was specific to the fee, the LIBOR plus 2.7 and I remarked that given my high level 
assessment of it, it should not be unfair.  I am comfortable, but I must also admit Chair 
that that was in the absence of having to go to [indistinct] and having a firm discussion 
and discussion around that Chair.  There was certainly never an, an, an express 
[background noise] to say I support this.  I want to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So in other words from everything that you have written 
that indicates that you were moving the Board, the IFC or the PTC to support whatever 
it is that you were requesting about the transaction.  The Chairperson must not regard 
that as your support of the transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  No.  So it, it is, I mean I took it to the process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What does that mean?  Please [intervenes]. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So I, I presented it to the Board, because I, I, I cannot go 
to the Board in my personal capacity and say trying to convince the Board to support it.  
It was based on a RFP/RFI process that we followed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am just trying to understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us put it this say. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever say anything to the Board that did not; that may have 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 186 of 191 
 
showed that you were supportive of this transaction when in fact you were not 
supportive of it? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair to, just back to the, the only discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes], ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Was, was particularly around that pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Even from the Board minutes there was never an 
instance where I expressly said to the Board we have to do this and it is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja.  There is also unfortunately not recorded that I said 
we have to go through our process.  That is what we were following. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  From the, the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  February meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But then with, with all of that you kept on moving the 
process forward, because your, your answers today were that we wanted to comply and 
20 
we wanted to do things right.  You wanted to prove, to move forward a process that you 
were not support involved as Head of Treasury. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair what I, what I, so part of the negotiations we 
wanted to conclude the negotiations with them and obviously follow our process so that 
when we come to a positon where it says this thing is not doable and it is not my 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 187 of 191 
 
specific view.  It is the process that was followed.  That is certainly what I, I think we 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if it was to happen you wanted to make sure that the right 
processes were followed? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Followed, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  but whether or not it was to happen or to be approved was a decision 
that would be taken at the end of the process? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Process, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is, is that right? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes, yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well are you satisfied? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is that is all from.  I am satisfied Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, fine.  You can, you can still clarify it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could I?  I am just worried about, it is 25 past five and I 
have not even indicated to the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me give you a five minutes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Five minutes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  So half past. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Laughing]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Just as the Head of Treasury

Mr Pillay this is now I am not trying to say I doubt the answer that you have just given 
to, to, to a question that I asked you.  I am just trying to understand the situation where 
you are heading an institution, a department within that institution and certain things 
happen and you move forward with the process in the manner in which you did and 
then you come at the tail end now in 2018 three years down the line and you say to the 
Chairperson I did not support this process.  I was just going through the motions. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think going through the motions Chair is as going 
through the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and I also think what, so we were going through the 
10 
process completing the process so that we can arrive at a point where it says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  It is not doable and for that reason Chair I, I indicated 
that in the August meeting it was agreed we need to follow process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And then in the October meeting we took it to the Board 
to say we are still continuing.  We have to complete our processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it open to you to refuse to let it go through the, the process? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think I, I, I may have had that opportunity to say let us 
stop it, but I think then it would have resulted in them coming back to say the personal 
20 
issue that I have frustrated the process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  What I am asking you in terms of Eskom’s rules and regulations 
and policies and processes did you have power or a right to say this one must not go 
through the process or we must not go through the process here.  I will make a decision 
now or the decision must be made before the process is finalised? 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 189 of 191 
 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair I, I think in, in; yes I probably could have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  But the, the; I wanted certainly wanted the process to 
conclude. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, if, if. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  And, and this to come to a logical conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, if, if you could have what would be the, would what, what kind of 
situation would need to exist for you to be able to do that? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair the, towards the end of the transaction it was 
certainly clear that this was a problematic transaction. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you are saying now towards the end of the transaction.  By 
which I understand you to say towards the end of the process? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The process around October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if you do not go to the end of the process, much earlier as I 
understand you are saying that it was open to you to stop the whole process and I 
imagine reject it. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I, I do not think the process allows me to reject it Chair, 
but I mean. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what I was asking. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Even my. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Earlier on. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there is a proposal whether the position is not that there is a 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 190 of 191 
 
process through which it must go before a final decision is taken whether it is approved 
or not approved that is the question I was asking earlier on and your answer was you 
did have the power to stop it earlier as I understood you. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  I think as I sit here Chair I think I, I, I could have stopped 
it maybe and suggest abandon the process, but then we would have had to deal with 
the consequence of why did we come to that and how do we respond to them after we 
have, we have followed, should have followed the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would, would you have had grounds, acceptable grounds, to stop 
it before the process was finalised? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  If, if I realise that there was certainly we are not going to 
10 
get to a conclusion.  I mean certainly the advances that we made or motivations that we 
made for certain of the issues that were not we were not happy with, so I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Maybe just one last question 
following on from that.  Did you at any stage from 2015 right up to 2018, January see 
any benefit for Eskom in the transaction? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  Chair certainly given the, the quantum of the funding the 
diversification of the funding it was a, a new innovative way of dealing getting funding 
20 
and project execution.  So those were the elements that certainly seemed elements that 
could have looked like a doable transaction or a transaction that we could consider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would have given Eskom some benefit? 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  The benefit would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the question is whether in this transaction throughout the 
01 MARCH 2019 – DAY 59 
 
Page 191 of 191 
 
time that you had, you were dealing with it whether you ever saw any benefit that would 
flow to Eskom if it was conclude. 
MR ANDRE FRANK PILLAY:  So Chair if it was concluded within the, the cost that that 
we were trying to, were willing to negotiate to, if we were able to get a quantum of 
funding it would have certainly been significant and it would have certainly assisted us 
with our capital program if that was successful.  So those were the initial elements that 
we, we found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much Mr Chairman and thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your time is up. 
10 
[Laughing] 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is still, we are finished with the statements thank
