HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair subject to one aspect that 
I would like to raise with you.  Ms Memela is here to give evidence 
today.  She has raised with me however a few moments ago when she 
arrived that she would like an opportunity to consider the bundles of 
documents that have been prepared for her evidence today.  The Legal 
Team of the Commission certainly has no difficulty with that.  As I have 
10 
explained to Ms Memela the bundles comprise initially a statement that 
she submitted, I think it was last week, after many months of 
engagement with the Commission’s investigators and Legal Team and a 
position that she took in January that she did not want to provide an 
affidavit nor did she want the assistance of the Commission in 
preparing one.  So her bundle comprises the statement that she then 
did submit which she makes clear is not an affidavit in the statement as 
well numerous documents that came through with it.  We were not 
certain how to arrange them because they were not identified a 
annexures to the statement but we have put them in as best an order as 
20 
we can and then beyond that in the bundle as is usually the case in 
these proceedings there is an additional document section which 
comprises documents that have been discovered in the course of the 
investigation and which Ms Memela will be referred to in the course of 
her evidence today.  So it would be our submission that we should take 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 3 of 188 
 
an adjournment just to facilitate Ms Memela familiarising herself with 
the bundle.  I did discuss with her earlier a half an hour to an hour’s 
adjournment.  She seemed to indicate that that would be adequate but 
possibly she would like to make some representations in relation to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela good morning. 
MS MEMELA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that you would like to have some 
opportunity to go through the bundle? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair given the fact that there are additional 
10 
documentation that I might not have seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just bring the microphone closer to you I 
cannot hear you very well.   
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you said something I just want you to repeat that. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I have requested like maybe thirty minutes of your 
time to – for me to go through the files that I have just received now.  
And then given the fact that like there are additional documentation 
20 
that maybe I have not seen.  So I just want to go through that and then 
I will be – I think I will ready and then I will have three requests before 
we start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  After – ja I do not know if I can make the requests now 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 4 of 188 
 
or afterwards – after I have sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us deal with the other issue first.  Would 
thirty minutes be adequate for you to look at the bundle? 
MS MEMELA:  I believe so because like I mean most of the information 
here is coming from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  But I mean I just wanted to check the additional 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So that I familiarise myself with it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Maybe you should mention now your 
other requests and then I can see whether we should deal with them 
now or we should deal with them later when you – after the 
adjournment. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh the requests? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay the first request Chair is that since I had 
mentioned on my e-mail to the Commission that my lawyer is not 
available.  She will be in Cape Town until Monday so I am 
unrepresented right now.  So I was going to request the Chairperson to 
20 
protect my rights, guide me and – so that like maybe I do not end up 
like I am self – implicating myself without even realising.  And then the 
second one will be – I will ask for your guidance like in answering 
certain questions that like maybe people have not been given notice 
which is the rule of the Commission.  Where people have not been 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 5 of 188 
 
given the Notice 3.3 that I am going to mention them.  So like I mean 
there I will need your guidance as well if like I am obliged to answer to 
those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Well the – was that one – you said you had 
three requests, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja I think I have ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the other one? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja no I think I have mixed the two.  Like I mean where it 
looks like the question seeks to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Protection and ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Ja like I may end up like incriminating myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And about 3.3 Notices. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the Legal Team would have seen your statement. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if the names that you are talking about are in 
your statement they will have had a look at that and I think during the 
adjournment if need be they can apply their minds further to that. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the question whether anybody should have been 
20 
given a Rule 3.3 Notice or not.  Secondly there might be difficulty – I 
mean I would give you like anybody whatever “protection” that I can 
give.  But I would want you to complain later that you answered 
questions which maybe you should not have answered because you 
would incriminate yourself. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 6 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I did not protect you.  So I am concerned about 
that.  But from what I have seen you are a lawyer, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do know that even lawyers do need lawyers. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For advice. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think it is something that you may wish to reflect 
on during the adjournment as well.   
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Legal Team Ms Hofmeyr would be happy to 
talk to you insofar as you may wish to talk to her to ascertain their 
position. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do the best we can to make sure that everyone 
who appears here is treated fairly.  But where it needs to – we need to 
be firm we will be firm.  But I just do not want you or your lawyer later 
on to complain that the Chair should have said, do not answer that 
because all I know is what is here. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know anything else whereas your lawyer 
would know whatever else you may have told your lawyer.  So Ms 
Hofmeyr do you want to say anything about the requests? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just in relation to – if I can pick up the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 7 of 188 
 
second one first which I think is the one you dealt with first.  The 
question about Rule 3.3 Notices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair Ms Memela was quite clear in her 
statement provided to the Commission right at the end that she was not 
implicating anyone.  That has been Ms Memela’s consistent position in 
her interactions with the Commission.  And it was off the back of that 
that we considered the statement in its totality.  She does refer to 
people of course as she must tell the story but given her clear 
10 
indication that she was not implicating anyone no Rule 3.3 Notices 
have been sent out pursuant to receiving her statement.  It is another 
matter as we always encounter in the course of evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we could – my proposal is that we address 
that if and when it arises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In relation to the second aspect insofar as 
legal representation is concerned until yesterday I think we understood 
that we would receive an application from Ms Memela’s lawyer for her 
20 
not to appear.  She has clearly been engaged with lawyers in the lead 
up today insofar as she indicated to the Commission on Wednesday 
that we would be receiving that.  So it would be our submission that we 
continue with the evidence.  Ms Memela is a lawyer and admitted 
Advocate and if at a point a question is asked and Ms Memela believes 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 8 of 188 
 
that her answer would self-incriminate her in any criminal conduct she 
should alert us to that and we can take it from there.  That would be 
our proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you think of that?  Namely you continue to 
make yourself available.  You give evidence.  You answer questions. 
But if there are questions where you feel that your answer might 
incriminate – you might incriminate yourself then you indicate that you 
have – you believe that giving – answering the question would result in 
that.  And then we can take it from there. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair I confirm that I am ready to start like provided 
10 
that there are no like ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I am comfortable answering certain questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And I just want to touch on the statement part where I 
actually insisted that like it will not be an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  It was because during like I mean the two meetings that 
I had with the team – the Commission Team they did not have specific 
questions for me.  They actually like relied on what I was putting on the 
20 
table and I said – I even said like in one of the e-mails like I will not be 
doing their job.  You understand like I mean my understanding is that 
like if they are maybe see some sort of like I mean possible wrongdoing 
from other people they should like I mean try and prove that and then 
like maybe I might collaborate that.  But like now I was called to 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 9 of 188 
 
discuss like in general like the items that are going to be discussed 
today.  And I did ask for the specific written questions so that I know 
that I am addressing the questions coming from them.  So like that is 
the reason why I actually insisted on the statement.  Because like it 
was something that was coming from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Explaining the items because they just like listed the 
items that they wanted to talk to me about and in the meeting like I 
mean they allowed me to actually start give a background and stuff and 
then jump in a ask certain questions.  So I felt it is fair to me to 
10 
actually not write an affidavit because like I mean it may feel as if I am 
here to implicate somebody and as it is known right now that people are 
keep on singing people’s names like sometimes unintentionally so and 
stuff like – so I did not want to be seen as I am pointing fingers at 
people for something that I do not know what they have done.  Like in 
terms of like the wrongdoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is your position also like Ms Hofmeyr’s position 
that she understands that your position is that in your statement that 
you supplied you are not implicating anybody. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be mentioning some name. 
MS MEMELA:  I mention – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are not – you do not intend to implicate 
anybody. 
MS MEMELA:  No but I – that statement Sir it sounds like I mean I do 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 10 of 188 
 
not intend to tell the truth.  I do intend to state the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Like to a certain extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  That like they do not – like I mean I do not seem as if I 
am process – like I mean I am pointing fingers at people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  I want – like I came here because like I want to take 
accountability for any other decision ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  That was taken by myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And like also to justify where there are certain 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Decisions that like I mean the Commission thinks 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Were not in line with the processes and whatever ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  Well I will not speak 
20 
for the team that consulted you but in the course of investigation 
sometimes you do want somebody who you believe may have 
information that is relevant to say, tell us what you know about this 
without any other specific questions and after you have been told then 
sometimes you might have specific questions.  So sometimes you just 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 11 of 188 
 
want to talk to different people who seem – who might have information 
that is relevant and arising out of that discussion.  Sometimes you then 
have specific questions. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I thought I would just clarify that for them. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay we are at about 10:1 we could resume at 
10:40 if we want to make it more or less thirty minutes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that would be 10:50 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 10 to I am sorry. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  10 to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  10 to – 10;:50.  Shall we do it that way? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will then adjourn Ms Memela and then we 
will resume at 10:50.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela, did the 30 minutes was it enough? 
MS MEMELA:  It was enough Chair. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 12 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let us proceed 
then.  I think administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS MEMELA:  I am Nontsasa Memela. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
10 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
MS MEMELA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr, do you know what 
arrangements the transcribers might be having with the Legal Team to 
ensure that if there are words that – for which they need spelling.  That 
they get to be told afterwards whether they get the statement to see the 
– those words or names or whether.  Is there any existing arrangement, 
because otherwise I think we do not always give the spelling 
...(intervenes)? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know if there is any existing 
arrangement? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I am not aware of an arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 13 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That does mean one does not exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am just not privy to it.  What I do know though 
is that shortly after the evidence is completed as possible the 
statement is uploaded onto the website which is of course available to 
everyone including transcribers, but I can ask at some inquiries be 
made just as to what the nature of that arrangement is, because it 
might then obviate the need for us repeatedly to give spellings 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or it might indicate that we need to give some 
more than we have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, because I would imagine that maybe 
if they were to have access to a witness statement soon after. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They could pick up. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The spelling ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For certain names.  Otherwise we would need to give 
20 
spelling ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Each time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which has not been easy. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 14 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  No and one does forget and I am certainly 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Including myself in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we are focusing on the substance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I guess they are hearing what I am saying 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Reverend Stemela is hearing what I am saying.  
10 
Something needs to be done.  In the meantime maybe we will try and 
do that until we are told that there is an arrangement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will try and give spelling for names that we think 
they might – that are not English.  We think they might have a problem 
spelling, but some like certain surnames might be English, but might be 
difficult to spell. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – okay.  Alright.  Let us try that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the – we will start with spelling her name. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela’s name. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to do that? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 15 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me do that just in the course of requesting 
that we enter into the record ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As Exhibit DD25A and 25B.  Those are the 
bundles containing Ms Nontsasa Memela’s statement and that is 
N-o-n-t-s-a-s-a and the surname is Memela, M-e-m-e-l-a.  The first 
bundle, A, comprises her statement and additional documents she 
supplied to the Commission.  As well as in the remainder of Bundle A 
and into Bundle B certain additional documents that the Commissioned 
has assembled. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela’s statement and annexures in the file 
which contains the statement will be marked – admitted and marked 
DD25A.  That is Exhibit DD25A and the annexures that are in the other 
file that will be Exhibit DD25B. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  In addition to those two files 
we have made reference in the course of the week to the fact that the – 
Ms Memela has put in two applications to cross-examine both 
Ms Sambo 
and 
Mr Human. 
 
We 
have 
prepared 
those 
in 
the 
cross-examination files that are usually handed up.  So if I may beg 
leave ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To hand those up to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela has been given her copy already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 16 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Memela, if we can just again 
with some housekeeping aspects.  If you turn to Exhibit DD25A at page 
1.  What is that document? 
MS MEMELA:  (Indistinct). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just page 1.  If you start at page 1.  Can you 
identify that document for us? 
MS MEMELA:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page – please put on your mic.  When she refers to 
page numbers she will be referring to the red numbers on the top right-
hand corner of each page ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she will not mention zero-zero. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She will say page 1 ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And two and so on.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright.  Okay.  So this is my statement that I made after 
the voluntary meeting that I had with the Investigating Team and the 
Legal Team of the Commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  So I reduced the discussion that we had to writing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go to page 26 in the same file.  
Exhibit DD25A.  Is that your signature on the page?  Apologies.  Did I 
say 26? 
MS MEMELA:  26 will be ...(intervenes). 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 17 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Page 26.  26. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Page 26? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  This is my signature.  Yes.  It is my signature. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and do you confirm as true and 
correct the contents of the statement? 
MS MEMELA:  I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Then 
in 
relation 
to 
your 
statements 
accompanying your applications to cross-examine.  I would like to do a 
similar thing.  If you can first take up the application to cross-examine 
10 
Ms Sambo.  That is indexed as SEQ04/2020.  Do you have that 
available to you? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you turn to page 3 in that file.  Can you 
identify that document for us please? 
MS MEMELA:  That is my statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go over to page 10.  Can you 
identify the signature on that page? 
MS MEMELA:  That is my signature. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you today confirm under oath that the 
20 
contents are true and correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and let us do the same if we may for 
the application to cross-examine Mr Human.  That is indexed as 
05/2020 and again if you will turn to page 3 of that file and identify the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 18 of 188 
 
document. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  It is my statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go to page 8.  Can you identify the 
signature on that page please? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  It is my signature. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And finally do you confirm under oath today 
that the contents of that statement are true and correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see Ms Memela that you have already dealt with the 
10 
reason why your statement is not an affidavit.  We had occasion 
yesterday I think or the day before to discuss that issue of statements 
that are not under oath, but your applications for leave to cross-
examine. 
I see they are also supported by statements that are not 
under oath or that are not affirmed declarations.  Please take steps to 
make sure that those are – at least those are affidavits.  So later on 
you could do that to make sure they comply with the Rules. 
MS MEMELA:  With the Rules.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  So you could do an affidavit and confirm that 
20 
that statement – those statements are true and correct.  Just so that 
your applications comply with the Rules. 
MS MEMELA:  I am prepared to do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 19 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela, you are a 
lawyer.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did you obtain your law degree? 
MS MEMELA:  2006. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have also indicated in your statement, 
I am picking it up now at page 2 of Bundle DD25A. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That you did a post graduate diploma after your 
10 
law degree.  What was that in? 
MS MEMELA:  It is a Post Graduate Diploma in Drafting and 
Interpretation of Contracts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did you complete that? 
MS MEMELA:  2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And for the sake of completeness.  You can just 
confirm that your law degree is an LLB Degree? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and you are also an advocate.  Is 
20 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when were you admitted as an advocate? 
MS MEMELA:  In 2012. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 20 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move to your 
position at SAAT, because I understand from your statement which has 
now been confirmed under oath.  If we go to paragraph 6 on page 2.  
That you were in an acting position as HOD of Procurement.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Can you repeat your question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: I was interested in the positions you have held 
at SAAT. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  SAA Technical ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I had picked up at paragraph 6 that you 
held an acting position in the role of HOD Procurement at a particular 
point.  When did that start? 
MS MEMELA:  If I remember correctly I started in September – between 
September and October 2013 when the Chief Financial Officer of SAAT 
resigned and procurement at that time it was reporting to him.  So then 
it was divided between myself and the person who was acting as CFO 
20 
after Mr Zulu.  So that I was acting from 2013.  I am not sure about the 
month but like between September/October. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And where were you before that? 
MS MEMELA:  Before acting? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 21 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  I joined SAAT as a Senior Legal and Contracts 
Management Specialist. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when was that? 
MS MEMELA:  That was in – on the 15 t h of April 2013. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And before joining SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:  Before joining SAAT I was at the Development Bank of 
Southern Africa, DBSA, as the Contracts Procurement Specialist and 
later became Group Legal Advisor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And for what period were you at the 
Development Bank? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Chair, I did not familiarise myself like I mean on my CV, 
but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I think it was between 2011 to 2013. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure about the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The months.  The months. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  The months, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So before you joined SAAT.  You had completed 
20 
that Post Graduate Diploma in Drafting and Interpretation of Contracts 
and you had been admitted as an advocate.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we can talk about then your 
progression from acting position to a permanent position, because I 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 22 of 188 
 
understand that you then were appointed in a permanent position 
around November 2015.  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  I think it is 2014. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  I think 2014.  The position was then revived back to 
the structure.  There was a position of an HOD Procurement before in 
the SAAT structure, but like I mean when I joined it was not there.  It 
was reporting directly to the CFO.  So the position was advertised and 
then like I went through the recruitment and selection process. 
Then I got the position.  So I was now permanent from 2014 
10 
as HOD Procurement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did you leave SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:  When did I leave SAAT? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  I left SAAT – okay.  Chair, I am not sure how this 
question is related to the evidence.  Maybe I will find out later or 
maybe if ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well it is just to understand ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  To understand where I am? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Oh.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are innocuous ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Questions just to give us a picture about where you 
have been in terms of work.  How long you were with SAAT. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 23 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Because like I mean I signed like some sort of an 
agreement like which has got a provision – confidentiality between 
SAAT and myself, but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Then I will ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  All she wants is when did you stop being an employee 
of SAAT. 
MS MEMELA:  Of SAAT. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is all she wants.  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Let – but there are more information that like that 
how did I leave SAAT and then like I mean I was suspended in 2018, 
May for certain charges like I am including some of them like I mean 
being the items here.  Then I went through the disciplinary hearing like 
which was chaired by Advocate Cassim. 
In his outcome he did propose like I be moved from 
Procurement to Legal Division, but like we did not like really agree, 
because like I mean from my side I did not think he had the terms of 
reference like to actually propose that.  So then like he proposed like 
20 
that okay.  Then dismissal is fair and appropriate. 
Then I went to the CCMA and applied for arbitration and I 
won the case on the 18 t h of October 2019.  I was supposed to start – go 
back to work on the 1 s t of November 2019.  Then when it was just one 
day like for me to go back.  Then I received an e-mail that like I mean 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 24 of 188 
 
they would like to review and stuff like that, but then the discussions 
about like settlement followed after that. 
So we have just settled.  I think we signed at the beginning of 
January this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  A separation and mutual agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So until you were an employee of SAAT until 
sometime in January this year? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we pick it up at page 2 of your 
statement in DD25A.  You will see at paragraph 6 there.  You start to 
talk about some of your responsibilities in your role as Head of 
Department. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell us what those responsibilities 
were? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  In 2015 – okay – when I was confirmed as the 
HOD Procurement I was only heading Strategic Procurement and 
Operational Purchasing.  Strategic procurement consist of the long term 
20 
tenders from three years to five years.  Where I mean we go out on a 
tender process and then operational purchasing are a day to day buying 
of spares. 
So like I was responsible for that from 2014 to 2015 and then 
from 2015 there was a restructuring that took place at SAAT and then 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 25 of 188 
 
like myself and other three HOD’s.  Like I mean had an additional 
responsibility 
and 
then 
my 
position 
was 
changed 
from 
HOD 
Procurement to HOD SEM and that is where then like I am – I was 
stating my portfolios there. 
Like I had senior managers reporting to me which is Legal 
and Contracts Management, BEE and Supplier Development, Materials 
Management, Logistics and Inventory and I do not know if I forgot the 
other one.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you have covered them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  So like those were the like portfolios that I was 
responsible for and like I mean there were senior managers there that 
were responsible for that and reporting to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, I have picked up from this 
statement and your others that you appear to have had quite an 
important role to play in Supplier Development.  Is that a fair comment? 
MS MEMELA:  That is a fair comment.  Yes, because Chair Supplier 
Development and BEE – B-BBEE was part of my job description.  Other 
than that it was also part of the strategy enterprise development and 
also part of the business scorecard of the company.  I will – I do not 
20 
know if maybe you will come back to this, but like I would like to go in 
detail about like I mean the role that like I was expected to play. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Please do. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  So on the Supplier Development Chair why it 
started.  When I took over SAAT as HOD Procurement there was no 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 26 of 188 
 
BEE suppliers in our database.  They were buying directly from the 
multinational companies and if like it was like I mean the local 
company.  It all was like I mean white owned companies. 
So - because of the Supplier Development that was in place 
at that time and the fact that B-BBEE required all – also the State 
Owned Companies to actually have a certain level of BEE status.  When 
I joined procurement.  SAAT was sitting at Level 6 which is the worst 
for a State Owned Company.  It means that like I mean they were not 
involved. 
The national agenda like I mean transformational agenda.  So 
10 
then like I started like I mean proposing and of course from SAA they 
had drafted like Enterprise Supplier Development Strategy in 2014 
which allowed us like I mean as from like Procurement, HR and 
whoever is responsible for like I mean making sure that like the 
company adheres to B-BBEE and then like one of the elements there 
says that the local suppliers should – we should promote the local 
supplies to join franchise with multinational companies. 
So Chair remember like when the – when I took over HOD 
Procurement position as I mentioned.  There was no black owned 
companies and like I mean they knew companies that came forward 
20 
after the – this – the workshop that took place like I mean about 
Supplier Development and stuff. 
They did not have the knowledge in the aviation sector.  So 
like I had to open doors for them and like I mean in doing that like work 
closely with them.  Guiding them and asking also …(indistinct) from 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 27 of 188 
 
SAAT to guide them.  Making sure that like I mean whatever parts for 
instance that they buy on behalf of SAAT and not all those parts and all 
those kind of things and then I listed – I came up with a list of 
suppliers. 
I remember the first one was around like maybe 11 out of 
3 000 like I mean suppliers on the database.  Ms Sambo was actually 
one of those suppliers that like I mean I opened doors for at SAAT.  It 
was not an easy journey.  Like I mean of course I had ruffled feathers, 
because SAAT Procurement had been just doing their thing on their 
own and just dealing with multinational companies and not giving any 
10 
opportunities to the black companies in South Africa. 
So like I mean I was that involved.  Yes.  So as – like I mean 
as we go on you will see how much I was involved like in guiding some 
of them.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would the NIP, the National Industrial 
Development Program, program have applied at the time to those 
multinational companies? 
MS MEMELA:  There was – the NIP obligation was supposed to start 
applying as far back as 1999. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  For instance like I mean for a tyre contract.  Like SAAT 
entered into a tyre contract in 1999.  It is one of those Chair Evergreen 
contract that SAAT had and then there was logistic contract.  There was 
a components contract also which I think started in 2008 with Air 
France and SAAT. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 28 of 188 
 
Before that I think it was Lufthansa, but like I mean remember 
the NIP obligation is managed and controlled by the DTI.  Not by the 
company.  So like I mean I cannot speak on behalf of the DTI, but like I 
am just saying they were supposed to have enforced ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  And make sure that like these multinational companies 
are giving something back to the country instead of just taking these 
huge contracts and not doing anything like in terms of maybe 
transferring skills back to the country.  Like I mean technology and 
know-how. 
10 
So like after I had learnt about the difference between NIP 
obligation requirements versus Supplier Development.  Then we find 
out that actually Supplier Development is part of the NIP obligation.  
You cannot like really apply both of them.  So that is the reason then 
like that I was pushing for Supplier Development to be applied at SAAT, 
because like that way we will have control and we will be able to 
manage the relationship between multinational companies and local 
companies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is supposed to be achieved by 
Supplier Development? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Chair like this.  It is a long list.  It could be training from 
multinational companies.  For instance I will make an example.  If there 
is a five year contract and one of the multinational companies like have 
joint ventures with the local supplier.  In a contract they would agree 
that.  They will be transferring skills. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 29 of 188 
 
They would be training them.  They will be transferring 
technology and know-how and then like I mean the purpose of that is to 
ensure that like when the tender goes out again the local supplier is 
able to actually compete with these guys.  You understand?  Like I 
mean SAAT as an MRO. 
They buy mostly from multinational companies and like local 
suppliers did not have that knowledge and they needed as much 
guidance as possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  All of the objectives that you have listed there 
training skills transfer, exposure to technology suggests to me longer 
10 
term development of the selected supplier.  Is that a fair comment? 
MS MEMELA:  I guess that is your view.  Like I mean it is relevant, but 
like I mean it could ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry.  It is relevant or irrelevant?  I just did 
not hear that. 
MS MEMELA:  I am saying it is relevant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Relevant.  Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:  It is relevant like, but just depending on how you 
interpret your long term. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Long term could be five years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Within five years like multinational companies if they are 
working closer together and there is a watertight contract in place.  
They could like really transfer these skills and then like you know that 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 30 of 188 
 
okay by the end of that contract they are able either to go with these 
ones or they have the freedom to actually approach others or maybe 
bid on their own with partnership like with other – like the new 
multinational companies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So grow the selected supplier so that they can 
ultimately compete on their own terms.  Is that a fair summary? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Repeat that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The idea of Supplier Development is to grow 
the supplier ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that at some point they can compete on 
their own terms. 
MS MEMELA:  That is one of them.  Like I mean it could be a list of 
things that like I would like to get out of Supplier Development. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Anything else that comes to mind now? 
MS MEMELA:  Maybe it could be creation of work in South Africa where 
maybe – I will make an example Chair.  So that like you have a clear 
picture.  For instance with the tyres I will say like the current contract 
now is with Bridgestone and they are based in Brussels.  So 
Bridgestone will have a part – site like where they are supposed to 
20 
actually ship the tyres to South Africa and then like when the tyres get 
to South Africa, I mean the container. 
There could be an agreement maybe between the multi – like 
I mean Bridgestone and the local company that okay.  You will be 
playing this role.  You will – as soon as the ship gets to Durban – if it 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 31 of 188 
 
gets to Durban or wherever.  You will then take over the transportation 
of the tyres from Durban to SAAT.  You see.  Like so that is where 
maybe they would ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Actually agree.  So like I mean it is about that.  I can 
remember out of that phase there would be people who are employed 
and that is creation of jobs. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Memela, I would then like to 
move to page 3 of your statement in Exhibit DD25A.  You have a 
heading there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr, I see we are at 19 minutes past 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we had some adjournment ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Earlier.  Maybe we should take the tea break at 
11:45. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will just need somebody to remind me when 
we get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 32 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will that be fine with you Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  That is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela, we are at Exhibit 
DD25A at page 3 and you have a heading towards the bottom of that 
page.  “Swissport” in bold.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you start at paragraph 9 below that 
heading to say: 
“What I recall during this time was that the Board 
10 
decided who should act as the CPO after the 
departure of Dr Dahwa at SAA.” 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know anything about the circumstances 
surrounding Dr Dahwa’s departure at SAA? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Your question is quite – when you are asking like 
that do I know the circumstances surrounding his departure.  Do you 
mean do I know the charges against him like what happened and stuff? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You do not know? 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr – Dr Dahwa, has given evidence before this 
Commission previously.  Are you aware of that? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 33 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  I am aware, but I was not watching. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  His evidence included the following.  I 
am going to just reference it, because I do want to ask you some 
questions, because you were responsible for procurement in SAAT at a 
similar time that Dr Dahwa was responsible for procurement at SAA.  Is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So Ms – Dr Dahwa’s testimony before 
this Commission was that on the 2 n d of October 2015 he was forced 
during the course of eight hours on a day to sign certain letters of 
10 
award to Swissport and Engen and he was placed under great pressure 
to do so by the then Members of the Board of SAA, Ms Kwinana and Ms 
Myeni that was pursuant to the SAA 30% set aside policy are you aware 
of that policy? 
MS MEMELA:   I’m aware of the policy 30% set aside but I never 
applied it under SAAT contracts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right well nor did Dr Dahwa, his evidence was 
that he regarded that 30% set aside policy as unlawful and so he 
refused to sign agreements that would have applied it.  His evidence 
was also that during that meeting he was threatened that on the 
20 
Monday, the following Monday the EFF would be protesting at SAA and 
they wanted all Zimbabweans out of SAA and Dr Dahwa was 
Zimbabwean and so he feared for his safety at the time.  He was 
shortly, thereafter charged and went through a disciplinary process.  
Did you hold a view, at the time about the lawfulness of the 30% set 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 34 of 188 
 
aside policy? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair with regard to a 30% set aside from a legal point 
of view it was not in line with the relevant legislations that I’m abiding 
the procurement process in the State Owned Companies.  However, 
without defending the Board I believe that the reason maybe they 
wanted to apply such a percentage was to make sure that they are 
giving as much opportunity to black owned companies as possible 
because I remember during that time they started with the workshop 
and going around the country and introducing the tenders and letting 
the local companies to know that they don’t have to be scared to play a 
10 
role in the Aviation Sector it’s not as difficult as it looks.  So to answer 
Counsel’s question, from SAAT’s side I’ve never or my team have never 
applied 30% set aside instead we actually used 10% like from the BEE 
point of view depending on the price like for instance 90/10 or 80/20 we 
actually followed that.  The actual certain things that like we kept on 
maybe just putting …(indistinct) Supply Development as we were 
moving along.  So I remember the Board that was following – the 
previous Board of Ms Myeni had asked myself as the Head of Supply 
Chain for SAAT and SAA to list the contracts that we had ensured that 
they adhered to the 30% set aside and like they actually – they thought 
20 
there was that 30% set aside also at SAAT and like I mean we proved 
to them that we never applied that until it was actually included in the 
legislation PPFA in 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So just to get clarity on your answer to the question, 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 35 of 188 
 
the question was, whether your view at the time was that the 30% set 
aside was unlawful and I think you have said that you believe that it 
was not in line with ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   The legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, so you believed it was unlawful? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you aware that National Treasury took 
a similar view in 2015 – late 2015? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes I heard that they had sent a letter from National 
10 
Treasury to the then Acting CEO, Ms Thule Mshe, I think she had 
shared it with procurement and stuff so I am aware of that letter from 
National Treasury.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, we don’t need to go there for 
present purposes because your recollection is a good one Ms Memela, 
with respect but Chair just for the record it is in Exhibit DD25B at page 
648, we’ve referred to it previously in the evidence of Dr Dahwa and 
that was the letter of the Chief Procurement Officer of National 
Treasury, as you indicated to Ms Mshe indicating that the resolution of 
the Board to set aside the 30% in it’s current form is not supported by 
20 
procurement – by any procurement legal framework and must be 
stopped with immediate effect.  Ms Memela with that background in 
place I’d like to move to the two transactions that the Commission is 
focusing on in its hearings at the moment.  The first is the sale of the 
SAAT GPU’s and the second is the award of the components tender to 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 36 of 188 
 
the joint venture of JM Aviation.  These are the two aspects that you 
have focused on in your statement because they were the two 
transactions that your engagements with the Legal Team and the 
Commission’s investigators made clear to you, were of relevance to our 
proceedings.  So I’d like to give you an opportunity at the outset if we 
can take the sale of the SAAT GPU’s to start with to explain to us what 
your role was in relation to that sale. 
MS MEMELA:   Chair to answer that question, I had no role nor did I 
initiate the sale of the GPU’s I have also proven that at the CCMA.  The 
sale of GPU’s was within the delegation of authority of the Board and 
10 
the submission to sell the GPU’s was done by the previous Acting CEO 
of SAAT.  Based on the contract between Swissport and SAA.  So it 
went to the Board and the Board approved based on the contract that 
was in place, my understanding is that.  I did attach the minutes of the 
Board like on my answer just to show that who was there and how was 
it discussed and like I mean on what basis did the Board reach their 
decision.  So you asked about my role the only time I got involved was 
when like I was asked by the Acting CEO to sit in the negation, I mean 
he actually received the proposal ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that Mr Zwane? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   No, no it was not Mr Zwane, it was Mr Arson Malola-
Phiri who was acting at SAAT at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just for clarification – if I may just come 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 37 of 188 
 
in there because it’s part of this majeure at that stage, our 
investigations have been revealed, and I think there has been evidence 
on this already, Mr Zwane was in a CEO position at SAA and yes, this 
did come out in previous evidence and Mr Phiri was in the Acting CEO 
role at SAAT, thank you. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course there – part of the problem is that when 
we talk about SAAT in the context of these SAA keeps coming in so it’s 
important to understand when you refer to an Acting CEO or CEO 
10 
whether you’re talking about SAAT CEO or SAA CEO so ja, okay alright. 
MS MEMELA:   Alright Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, so the Acting CEO of SAAT wrote a submission 
after – I don’t know like after he received an instruction maybe to sell 
the GPU’s but I do understand that the submission was linked to the 
contract between Swissport and SAA.  Yes, and then he did, the 
submission after he had received an e-mail proposing to buy the GPU’s 
from SAAT and then his response to the e-mail he said – he stated that, 
okay like I mean, he still has to go to the Board and have the approval 
20 
by the Board and then before he can go back to them and negotiate.  
So after – and he did exactly that he went to the Board and then it was 
discussed and then the Board approved and as the CEO, my role, let 
me give clarity on that Chair, my role was reporting to the CEO.  Ja, so 
he gave me an instruction to sit and negotiate the proposal that was 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 38 of 188 
 
already sent to him yes and like it was not just me I had other 
colleagues that were there, although, like I mean some like now, I think 
out of fear they say they did not attend and of course I don’t have much 
proof to say, okay you were there ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if they were there you say they were there. 
MS MEMELA:     Yes they were there okay I had ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   There might not be a register, attendance register 
but if you know they were there, then you say they were there. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes so I had Mr Chele Makaleng who was the owner of 
the GPU’s like his department was the owner of the GPU’s and then we 
10 
had Stan Vosloo who was responsible for Materials Management and 
then I had also invited Leon Roberts who was the Logistics and 
Inventory Manager, he couldn’t make it, he’s the only one that I 
remember that couldn’t make it.  So like we were joined by the two 
Members of the JM, Mr Jules – no it was Mr Jules, I don’t remember 
who the other one was but I think it was two of them.  So like we 
discussed based on the proposal that they had sent to Mr Malola-Phiri 
before he wrote the submission to the Board.  So we started based on 
that, you know and we asked them, what was their basis of the price 
that they had put forward and then, like I mean, you’ll see like there 
20 
was an e-mail written back to me by Ms Sokhulu saying okay this – like 
thank you for the meeting this is the amount like the GPU’s or current 
GPU’s are going for at that time.  So that’s where my involvement 
started like from the negotiation up to the time when the invoice was 
signed by the CEO and myself. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 39 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That meeting that you’re discussing, I just want 
to be clear, you’ve mentioned Mr Jules Aires, Chair reminding myself of 
our undertaking this morning that’s J-u-l-e-s A-i-r-e-s was he present? 
MS MEMELA:     Mr Jules? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:     Yes he was in the meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you’ve mentioned a Ms Sokhulu, was she 
present in the meeting? 
MS MEMELA:   I don’t remember if she was present but I think she was 
...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you mentioned an e-mail that she sent to 
you that said thank you for the meeting, does that help you recall. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, yes I think she was because I know it was two of 
them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and that’s S-o-k-h-u-l-u, and then who 
else was in the meeting you said a Mr Vosloo, is that V-o-s-l-o-o? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And a Mr Makaleng is that M-a-k-a-l-e-n-g? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was that the meeting that occurred on the 
20 
day prior to you receiving the e-mail from Ms Sokhulu referring to the 
meeting? 
MS MEMELA:   Referring to the meeting yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is that the only meeting you had to discuss 
pricing with JM Aviation? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 40 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:   That was the first meeting that we had because it was 
followed by the Board Resolution so we were following the Board 
Resolution and the instruction from the CEO to sit with them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: Are you sure about that chronology? 
MS MEMELA:   Chronology I mean like in terms of ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That the meeting preceded the decision of the 
Board. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes I’m sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wasn’t sure earlier on whether you meant the 
10 
resolution of the Board came first and then the meeting so – but you 
have just confirmed that the meeting happened before. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair the Board Meeting happened before after the 
submission by Mr Malola-Phiri to the Board it was discussed and then 
like we negotiated after the Board Meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry then there was some confusion because 
I thought that you just said that you had that pricing meeting before the 
Board’s decision. 
MS MEMELA:     No it was afterwards because it was ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh then there is confusion okay so let’s get that.  
The meeting that you have just talked about. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say happened after the Board had, had a 
meeting and made a resolution. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 41 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then just to be clear so that we’re not at 
cross-purposes was that the only pricing meeting at which the sale 
price between SAAT and JM Aviation was discussed. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes and according to the meeting, like physical meeting 
that was the only meeting, afterwards it was just, like I mean e-mails 
from – and yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, thank you, I just want to be clear about 
that.  Right then I’d like to meet to the components tender. Ms Memela 
10 
you will know that, and we have spent two days dealing with the various 
versions of this components tender because it starts as early as – the 
first one was in 2013 and there is version one, and two and three and 
four.  For today’s purposes I’d like to hone in on the ones that are 
really of most relevance to the Commission but at any point that you 
feel that you need to give some reference backwards, please do so.  
What I’d like you to explain to the Commission now if you will, was your 
role – let’s say from about 2014 in relation to the components tender. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, and just for a reference for you, you start 
20 
your explanation of that at page 6 of DD25A, the reason why I gave the 
introduction I did a moment ago is because a great deal of your initial 
discussion of this components tender does go through the history and 
all that I am saying to you is we have traversed the history over the 
last two days, so I would like to pick it up if we may in about 2014 to 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 42 of 188 
 
understand your role in relation to it, but you must not feel limited if 
there is some aspect of what happened previously that you need to go 
to please tell us that. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay are you going to ask a question on your one 
question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well what your role was, could you start with 
that, what was your role? 
MS MEMELA:   From 2014? 
CHAIRPERSON:   From 2014. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   From 2014. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you might miss off or you might wish to mention 
some headings relating to 2014 and after that might help her to focus 
on which she might, you might wish her to focus. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, let me do that Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let’s start in October of 2014, because 
October of 2014 is when the second five year tender was advertised, is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes that’s correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So let’s maybe take it from October 2014 and 
then you can track for us forward what your role in SAAT was relative 
to that procurement process.   
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair in terms of the role – I am trying to 
understand like the question like when  ...(intervenes).   
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 43 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me assist you, what Ms Hofmeyr would like 
you to tell me is if you look at that particular tender you would know 
obviously the steps that need to be taken normally for a procurement 
process and you would know what process, if any was followed in 
regard to that one and she then wants you to say out of this process 
this is where I got involved, this is where I got involved, I did this, I 
didn’t do that, that is what she wants you to talk about for that tender 
and throughout the process from the time the RFP would have been 
issued to the time it was withdrawn or cancelled or whatever the 
position. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair, I will try and be as brief as possible.  I 
would like first to highlight the hierarchy or how things work in 
procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   And how until the Board level like when we run the 
process, so  ...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:   And I’m sorry in answering the question feel free to 
say as Head of Procurement this is what your role normally would be. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is what it was in this particular case. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that is where I am going.  So I am trying to explain 
that, the tender and evaluation voting and stuff is done by the CFST, it 
is Cross Functional Section Team, in other companies it is called BEC 
or you know the people that are actually responsible for the evaluation, 
so the evaluation – the CFST is usually managed by a person from 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 44 of 188 
 
procurement who is now called the Project Manager, who is actually 
running with the whole process and then when they are done evaluating 
and coming up with the highest scoring bidder they then make it a 
recommendation to myself and then explain why that one, of course like 
my role is to make sure that I am as independent as possible, I don’t 
intervene or interfere with their decision, because remember they are 
the ones who was sitting there making the decision like after they have 
voted and looked at all the elements that are applicable.   
 
So like from then, from the recommendation by the CFST 
through the project manager then it will come to me and then I will have 
10 
certain questions, maybe to say okay have you checked that, 
especially, I would look especially on the Supply Development, that 
okay are you sure that Supply Development is aligned and everything is 
okay and stuff like that, and BEE as well, so after that like I would take 
their recommendation to Exco, Exco then comprises of GM’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry before you talk about the first call the first 
committee, CFST. 
MS MEMELA:   CFST yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said the project manager would be somebody 
within procurement, is that right? 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the project manager be the same person all 
the time or it would depend on each tender? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair it is  ...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is somebody in charge of the department which 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 45 of 188 
 
needs that particular service or product or is it just one person all the 
time? 
MS MEMELA:   Actually when I took over it was like as you have raised 
it, it has always been one person, like for component it will be a certain 
person, like for logistics it will be a certain person, for tyres it will be a 
certain person, so like I mean those are the things that I changed 
because like I mean we also had a problem of like them knowing so 
much like they are able to give from inside yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, so that I mean  ...(intervenes).   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you changed that? 
MS MEMELA:   I changed that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was during your time it became one person. 
MS MEMELA:   It became like I mean it will be that person who is 
relevant to that commodity at that time, yes chair, who is the – either 
specialist or a manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now the people who make up the CFST would 
they be under you, would they fall under your department, procurement 
or some would others would not? 
MS MEMELA:   Some would Chair and others would not.   For my 
20 
department it will be the person that I am talking about who is project 
manager, maybe with one specialist or maybe one buyer to help with 
the admin and then all others will representing different divisions, like 
from operations, like 2A Finance, Legal and all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, no that’s fine.  I just wanted to 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 46 of 188 
 
understand that.  I interrupted you as you were moving on to talking 
about Exco’s role.   You would take the recommendation to Exco. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you take the recommendation after you have 
satisfied yourself that you are happy with the recommendation? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, after  ...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you just take as is? 
MS MEMELA:   I usually take it as it is, because remember because I 
don’t sit in the Evaluation Team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   I am not there when they are evaluating, so like I mean 
I usually only would attend their thing if like maybe there is some 
information that I need to pass to them, I would make an example, for 
instance if their Board meeting, like maybe depending on the delegation 
of authority at that time like on what contract that we are running, and 
then I know that the Board meeting will be in two weeks time from that 
period so like I mean I will ask like before they start, like that I mean 
okay guys you need to know like I mean we need to move speedily like 
I mean the next Board meeting is on this date, which is two weeks from 
now and if we miss that you must know like we would still have to wait 
20 
for like I mean more months and stuff like that, so that is when I would 
actually go in or maybe when they don’t like really understand the 
Supply Development, because at SAAT Chair the issue of BEE and 
Supply Development was just zero, the way I pushed it there was even 
a time where it was called Nontsasa’s BEE, I had to actually like I mean 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 47 of 188 
 
sit down with my team and made them understand that it was not 
something that I came up with, it was actually the law, ja.   
 
So I attend like only on invite and then ja they will do 
everything independently, so they will recommend to me and then after 
certain questions like and I am satisfied with their answers and stuff 
like I would sign. 
 
In fact like the most like issue that like I would be looking at it 
was to apply my mind and make sure that I mean like the submission is 
flowing for them, because like remember when they do the submissions 
sometimes they don’t, they are not clear of what they are asking for  
10 
...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:   The presentation of the  ...(intervenes).   
MS MEMELA:   Exactly so like I mean it was my responsibility to 
ensure like I mean they to state everything like I mean in detail so that 
I mean when it gets to the Board, the Board doesn’t have to ask 
questions and say okay go back for the work or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’mm, okay. 
MS MEMELA:   So like after I have satisfied myself with the flowing of 
the submission I will sign and then take it to like I mean to the Exco, 
which maybe will give us about three days before it gets to Exco  
20 
...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:   And signing it would that be signification that you are 
happy with the document including the recommendation or it will simply 
be signification that you have seen it? 
MS MEMELA:   It will be signification that I am happy and I am 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 48 of 188 
 
supporting them on their decision, having satisfied myself that they 
have followed all the processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine. 
MS MEMELA:   Then it will go to Exco, which I said Exco comprises of 
the GM’s of SAAT, General Managers, including myself, being the HOD 
at the time.  So I also played the role of being the company secretary 
for Exco meetings, so like I mean the reason why I was part of that is I 
would like sometimes take notes, take minutes for the Exco and stuff, 
so like it would go to Exco and then Exco will discuss it in detail, raise 
their questions before it goes to BAC, so like I mean once Exco is 
10 
happy as well they also sign just like me and say okay like we are 
happy with what has been recommended by the CFST, and then from 
the Exco it goes to BAC. 
 
BAC then Chair is the Bid Adjudication Committee that 
comprises of like I mean managers or HOD’s, now actually HOD’s from 
SAA and all the subsidiaries of SAA, and then people will sit there and 
look at the submission, and when BAC look at those submissions they 
don’t start evaluating again, their duty is to check if the evaluation was 
done fairly, transparently as per the 217 Constitution or the PPFA, and 
everything like I mean the National Treasury knows like I mean have we 
20 
followed the stuff, that is what they look at and if they that also maybe 
the – because sometimes it will happen that the CFST would 
recommend the bidder, that is not the highest scoring bidder and put 
down their reasons why they do that, like maybe risks or something like 
that, so the BAC would also ask why did you like jump the highest 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 49 of 188 
 
scoring bidder, I mean have you checked, have you made be sure that 
like we won’t be taken to court and all that, so those are the things that 
they look at and then I must explain Chair that like when it goes to BAC 
from SAAT it is not for approval, it is for notification and even their 
SCM policy that like I mean covers for SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why are they called adjudication?   It is not for 
them to adjudicate? 
MS MEMELA:   Ja, they – okay the SAAT Procurement part has got its 
own section in the SME policy Chair because of the technical buying of 
the tools and stuff like that, so sometimes I think like the way it was 
10 
drafted it was to ensure that like maybe if the tool is needed as in 
urgently they are able to go out and acquire the tool and then notify 
BAC, so usually then like I mean it will be taken to BAC for notification 
even afterwards, after it has been acquired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So BAC just notes. 
MS MEMELA:   BAC notes yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they query if there is something to query. 
MS MEMELA:   They query if there is certain things that they don’t 
agree with, like based on the relevant legislation that is surrounding, 
yes, and then if they feel they need it to go back for work they send it 
20 
back, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   And from there it goes to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes and then the Board being the accounting authority 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 50 of 188 
 
of the organisation they take the decision, either they agree or they say 
okay it is subject to, or they overrule the decision of the CFS Team and 
the Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair I do have some follow-up questions but 
we have exceeded our teatime schedule, maybe we should take the 
break and I can follow up afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let’s take the tea break, it is ten to now, we will 
resume at 12:05. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela thank you for 
that overview initially in relation to your role.  I would just like to pick 
up on a few clarificatory points.  You described a Project Manager when 
you were describing the role of the CFST.  Do you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:   I recall. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you ever play the role of Project Manager 
in relation to the  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   CFST? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   No. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 51 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, and when a bid documents were referred 
to Project Managers.  Is that the CFST Project Manager? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And then my next question is, just 
clarificatory again, you said from CST – CFST it goes to Exco and then 
are you a Member of Exco? 
MS MEMELA:   I was not a Member of Exco until 2017.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, you then were not signing off on the BAC 
10 
recommendation for the 2016 tender as a Member of Exco, is that 
right? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, you are mixing two different committees. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   Exco and BAC.  They are separate Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us do Exco,  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   So  ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry what I meant to say is CFST, you said 
makes a recommendation to Exco, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes – ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   When the final five-years  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I thought she said they make a recommendation 
to her – to you. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, they make a recommendation to me to check if 
everything is okay like I mean if they have adhered to relevant laws and 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 52 of 188 
 
everything that is surrounding the process. Then like I mean, I would 
sign, I think I understand her question now, I would sign as the HOD 
SCM.  So, like I think she wants to understand if I sign as a Member of 
Exco  ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
MS MEMELA:   Oh yes, I sign as HOD SCM. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But in so doing  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   But just, I am sorry.  Let us just get that right 
because it is important to understand these things.  CFST, do they 
make a decision, or do they only make a recommendation to somebody 
10 
or to a committee? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, CFST Chair, they are responsible for evaluation 
of the BEE stuff, like I mean they go through all the elements, like I am 
talking – critical criteria, functionality, BEE, price.  So, like remember 
the in terms of the PPPFA they have to go for the highest scoring 
bidder.  So like after they have gone through all those elements, and 
then like they will have certain number that they have like if depending 
on the delegation for authority, the amount like it will be 90/10, so like I 
mean they would start counting from there.  Then like they would then 
make a recommendation to award or maybe to appoint based on the 
20 
points that they have came up with, like the highest scoring points. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you confirming that what they do is to 
recommend  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not to make the decisions themselves. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 53 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About who should get the tender. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the recommendation, was it to you or would it 
be a recommendation to Exco  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   Through me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it has to go via you? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay, yes, thanks Chair for putting it that way.  It will 
10 
be a recommendation to the Board, remember like I mean, all the 
transactions depending on the delegation of authority, some like will be 
under me and I think for me I only sign for up to a certain amount  
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to a certain amount? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes exactly.  So, like I mean, based on the delegation 
of authority they will be going to the Board.  So, like looking at the 
price of that certain contract it will tell you then that it is a Board 
matter.  It will go to the Board.  So, like they are recommending  
...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the person who has the power to decide in terms 
of delegation of authority.  It could be the Board sometimes it could be 
somebody else sometimes  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, all right. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 54 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:   And then just to add there Chairperson, when they 
recommend through me then I recommend to at Exco, then the CEO 
then from Exco, like after it came back from BAC the CEO then will 
recommend to the Board on behalf of Management and the Supply 
Chain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so, from the BAC it would not go straight to the 
Board it would go  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   It goes through the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The CEO. 
MS MEMELA:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So when the final five year tender that was 
eventually awarded to the joint venture of JM Aviation and AAR went to 
the Board, were you a Member of Management at that time? 
MS MEMELA:   As Management off-sight? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MS MEMELA:   I was the HOD. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, so just to follow through you were 
20 
explaining a moment ago that it is Management that then places the 
submission before the Board for its decision when the value is within 
their delegation of authority.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   It is through the CEO. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.  But he is speaking for Management.  He 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 55 of 188 
 
is not speaking alone is he? 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right.  And just help us with what goes to the 
Board on the day that it convenes its meeting to make a decision like 
this?  Do they get all of the bid submissions put before them?  What do 
they get? 
MS MEMELA:   You mean like I mean  ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words what does the CEO take to the Board?  
Ja what documents? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay the CEO takes the submission to the Board which 
10 
is the summary of what went on within the CFST and what has been 
approved or maybe recommended yes, then like it is now a submission 
that is made to the Board, they do not get all this admin who was who 
and who was not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us  ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, okay, I am sorry, so the CFST sends a document 
to you.  That document would you call it a submission. 
MS MEMELA:   It is a submission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And does it seek to summarize the information that 
they had before them before they made the recommendation that they 
20 
reached or what? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, they summarize what they have agreed upon and 
what they have voted for, and then they would list the bidders names, 
and then like they would say price, BEE, and stuff like that and then 
that is when we will start knowing that okay from here there is phase 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 56 of 188 
 
one, and then from phase one they will explain that okay from phase 
one, Bidder A or something like that has been disqualified based on 
this.  And then going to phase two, we were left with these two bidders 
and then like from two, phase three, like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you say the CEO takes the submission to 
the Board, is that the same submission he takes to the Board, or would 
it be a revised submission, that has been revised on his journey from 
the CFST up to CEO. 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair.  When it goes to the Board it is a revised 
submission.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   It is no longer the same as the one that was coming 
from CFST.  The one that is coming from CFST, has got like I mean, a 
list of signatures like I mean that is for the person who compiled the 
recommendation which is like usually the Project Manager and then like 
I mean it would come to me and then like the Members of Exco and 
then it will go to BAC.   
 
Then when it comes from BAC for notification then it will come 
back and then the CEO then like will revise and take exactly what is not 
there but like I mean now  ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Puts it in his own way. 
MS MEMELA:   It will just be his signature, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, he would prepare a revised submission but which 
is based on the submission that came from CFST. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 57 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:   Except like I mean maybe the Exco was not in 
agreement. Because like also Exco has – had the power to say okay  
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   We do not agree. 
MS MEMELA:   We do not agree.  It is a pity that Ms Hofmeyr jumped  
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   She might come back. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  So, Chair she jumped from like where Exco had 
the power to actually give feedback and say okay do not give to these 
10 
bidders because of this and that and that  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   And stuff like that and then we had to actually cancel 
and restart. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I think she might ask you at some stage 
about that, but she – Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Thank you so much Chair.  And 
then just in relation to the BAC, your role in the BAC in May of 2016, 
what was that? 
MS MEMELA:   If I remember correctly, Chair I think I was the 
20 
Chairperson of the BAC and I will explain, the – because I think the 
public would like to know what the role is in there.  So, as I said, that 
like the BAC does not do adjudication.   
 
They do not re-evaluate what has already been re-evaluated 
by the CFST.  The only thing that they are looking at are the elements 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 58 of 188 
 
of the PPPFA, the Constitution and all the legislation that are 
surrounding this.  Then like I mean if they are not happy with certain 
things then they will say okay, please do this before we note.  But I will 
tell you this Chair now  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, they check compliance. 
MS MEMELA:   They check compliance.  If like I mean, there is like I 
mean for instance like CFST was not too restrictive in terms of 
technicalities and stuff like that and then they check that okay there 
was fairness, there was transparency, there was competitive kind of 
process.  So, like I mean, as I said before that like I mean the BAC 
10 
notes the submission from SAAT.  Why?   
 
Because SAAT has got its own chapter in terms of the 
procurement process because of the kind of commodities that they have 
to buy.  So, like I mean, they unlike SAA that like would go to BAC 
maybe just like for approval, SAAT will go to BAC for notification.  But 
Chair like I do not know maybe if I will get the evidence later and stuff, 
but like we will see that even though I was the Chairperson, all the 
items that were coming from SAAT I recused myself.  Although like 
there was absolutely nothing that I could change and stuff like I mean, 
then the BAC would not have any powers to change what has been put 
20 
like I mean front by the CFST and Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, did you recuse yourself in relation to the 
components tender that was awarded in May 2016? 
MS MEMELA:   I recused myself from components and then I remember 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 59 of 188 
 
I had recused myself for logistics as well, I think we were also running 
the tyre tender as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And, I am jumping now ahead to 
the final tender, because that is where we are going to focus some of 
the evidence today.  You indicated that you were part of Management 
who had received the recommendation from the CFST in that process. 
Correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, like the recommendation is made by CFST based 
on their evaluation and the results in the CFST. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And before that then went to the Board as you 
10 
described it, did you support the decision taken by CFST in terms of 
the ranking of Air France first, JM Aviation, AAR second and Lufthansa 
third?  
MS MEMELA:   Okay as I had mentioned Chair that the CFST I like I 
mean, I always make sure that like I mean they are, their decision is 
independent from me, they do not feel that I am actually controlling 
them to do anything and stuff like so. Lufthansa, they have first 
proposed for Lufthansa to be awarded, and although Lufthansa did not 
have the Supplier Development and commitment or maybe a mutual 
joint venture with any local company.   
20 
 
They submitted that, and I did raise that to like I mean to the 
Project Manager that okay maybe we might have a problem here 
because remember the Supplier Development was part of the 
requirements of the tender but of course based on the preferred or like 
I mean scoring points Lufthansa was the highest scoring bidder.   
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 60 of 188 
 
 
Remember the PPPFA  say like I mean the award or the tender 
should be awarded to the highest scoring bidder and then like it gives 
you exceptions that like you could give it to the bidder that is like has 
scored the lowest but like you should be able to justify why you have 
done that like and it should stand in a Court of Law.  So, like I mean 
when they propose for Lufthansa, they did say also like I mean 
Lufthansa was low-balling.  Lufthansa was extremely cheap.  Chair, 
Lufthansa as I have mentioned, like I mean, they were the previous 
service provider for components of SAAT and they know very well that 
they will not be able to, like I mean, what do you call this? Afford the 
10 
components like with the amount that they put, like I mean, on their 
proposal.  So, like, they were lowballing, but, like I mean, of course, 
like those things can actually, like, be put on a water tight contract to 
ensure that, like, they are mitigated.   
 
So but – like I mean, when they proposed that – like, okay the 
Board should award, they highlighted the risk that they are picking up 
from this.  As much as they are cheap, there might be a risk later, that, 
like I mean, maybe they will keep on coming back to us and ask for 
increase.  Most multi-national companies, most of these big companies, 
they like to do that – come in and then, like, ask for increase later.  So, 
20 
like, it went to the Board and then the Board noticed that it did not go 
to BAC first, like, I think that they applied the fact that like, okay, it 
could go to BAC afterwards after the fact I was not there when, like, I 
mean, when it was tabled to the Board, but then, I did support the 
recommendation of Lufthansa.   
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 61 of 188 
 
 
The Board asked again like as they have the power to say, go 
back and rework and then like see if it will go to the BAC first before it 
comes to us.  So that’s when, like I mean the CFST realized that, okay, 
I think they think, like I mean, the risk quite too high in terms of the 
price that like was put by Lufthansa.  I am sure you will notice after the 
ruling of the court like when France took us to court, like I mean, 
Lufthansa just asked why they did not get the tender and they 
understood when we responded to them why they could not get the 
tender.  So like, they went back to the bidders and said, okay, please 
sharpen up your pencil and see if, like I mean, because Air France at 
10 
that time was still a bit expensive.  I think A.J. Walters was extremely 
expensive.  They had already been disqualified maybe.  I do not 
remember, but like I mean, it was Air France, Lufthansa and AAR.  So, 
like, they were still a bit up and like they went down.   
 
And I want to state it on record, Chairperson, that, like I mean, 
the purpose of going out on this tender and the purpose of, like I mean, 
testing the market before this final one which was for five years was to 
ensure that we get as much saving as possible because remember the 
company had raised that the money that was charged by Air France was 
extremely high and there was even a seventy million delta that no one 
20 
could explain why SAAT was paying so much, you know?  
 
So, like I mean, charging – like I mean, testing the market and 
going up and making sure that the CFST to go back was to make sure 
that we get value for money and much more cheaper than what we were 
paying Air France before.   
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 62 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela I think we might have been at 
cross purposes because the process that you have described now as I 
understand, it is the process where the bidders kept being approached 
again for their best and final offers.  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What I had actually asked was whether you 
supported the final recommendation that was made to the SAAT Board 
because you will recall, that was in May of 2016, and that was the 
recommendation that it be awarded to Air France and that second in the 
running was JM/AAR and that third in the running was Lufthansa and 
10 
the question was did you support that position? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay.  Let me correct you, Kate, Lufthansa was not the 
third in the running, Lufthansa was the first in the running.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well. 
MS MEMELA:   Followed by – I am just talking in terms of the 
preferential, like I mean, oh, the  ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   The ranking.   
MS MEMELA:   The ranking. Yes, but I understand your question.  You 
are saying, did I support the recommendation to the Board like to award 
Air France. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I signed for Air France. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
MS MEMELA:   Yeah.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would now like to move to the entity JM 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 63 of 188 
 
Aviation and I understand from you when you were first introduced to 
that entity.   
MS MEMELA:   When was I first introduced?  Okay, Chair, I was not 
formally introduced because like I am trying to understand this 
question.  I was not formally introduced to JM.  Let me just like I mean 
put the brief background first like about  JM.  We had JM International, 
that has been our supplier as such since 1992 and there has been then 
all these workshops in terms of bringing in black owned suppliers and 
stuff.   
 
So, like I mean, during the workshops, like that is when I got 
10 
to know, I got to meet some of the black owned suppliers and the 
instruction from the Board at that time was that procurement SAA, 
procurement SAAT, procurement Air Chefs, like people, like I mean, 
were told that you need to go to the Procurement Team and register 
your names down and then ask for maybe the list of tenders that are 
about to go out.  You know? 
 
So, like, they were also told that okay they are welcome to 
approach these multi-national companies and then like I mean they will 
be given support from SAA as a whole and SAAT and Air Chefs.  So, 
like I mean, I got to know – like one – some of the Directors of JM like 
20 
from those workshops.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And I understood from your statement that 
those workshops commenced in around 2015, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:   They commenced around 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who in particular did you meet in 2015 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 64 of 188 
 
from JM Aviation South Africa?  
MS MEMELA:   I think I may have met Mr Ndzeku, Vuyo Ndzeku.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And had you met a Ms Sokhulu at that stage? 
MS MEMELA:   She was not there.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At the Supplier Development workshop? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, she was not the one that like I that attended like I 
mean her father attended it.  Midrand.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And where – was that – I have a recollection 
that that was in the middle of the year.  Am I right in that or do you 
have a better ...(intervenes).  
10 
MS MEMELA:   I think it was around like May, June. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you say Mr Ndzeku attended that, but Ms 
Sokhulu did not? 
MS MEMELA:   I do not remember if she was there, but I just 
remembered Mr Ndzeku was there.  That is when we got to chat during 
this what – the workshops.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.   
MS MEMELA:   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And was he ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:   And, I, okay.  Sorry, Chair.  I chatted with lots of BEE 
20 
suppliers during these workshops and in fact even outside the 
workshops that includes even Ms Sambo. Ms Sambo like when she 
testified here, like I mean, she did mention that, like I mean, I did 
assist her and like I gave her certain documentation and stuff, like I 
mean, I think you will get to that later, but, like I mean, I did not only 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 65 of 188 
 
meet with Mr Ndzeku and like I mean assist JM like I mean, I have had 
that responsibility which was actually recorded on my job description.   
 
I do not know if you have my job description, like I mean, the 
Supply Development BEE is part of my job description, Chair.  And then 
it was also part of the Enterprise Supplier Development strategy that 
was started in 2014 and then there was an MOU between DTI and SAA 
to ensure that, like I mean, the transformational agenda is pushed 
hard.  So, like I mean, just like because, I just want to give clarity 
before Counsel continues with her question that the role that I played 
was to be as close as possible to these BEE suppliers as I said that 
10 
there were no BEE suppliers at SAAT, like I mean, in our database and 
you will notice that like I mean Mr Ndzeku was not part of the list of 
black-owned suppliers that was tabled to the Board to notify them that 
we are progressing in terms of bringing in black-owned suppliers.  
Chair, I might have ruffled a lot of feathers by doing that because for 
the first time SAAT as the State Owned Company had somebody who 
was pushing so hard for black people and then like that, there were 
certain questions, like not just from open water like from Ernest and 
Young and stuff like, because where they would just ask you that like 
okay, do you know Sibongile Sambo?  Is she your cousin or something 
20 
like that and I remember I lost it at that time, Chairperson because my 
understanding and the view in South Africa is that once you interact 
with a black supplier, being a black person, automatically there is fraud 
or corruption involved.   
 
So like, I had to deal with all those things and I even said 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 66 of 188 
 
when I was actually listening to Ms Sambo that like if she had money 
she will actually have a JEV contract with AAR, not dump each other 
like I mean, on the five month contract before the last one, and then 
they warn on the final one.  I will be sitting here again, Chairperson, 
defending myself against another black-owned supplier or maybe any 
other person saying; you were too close.  You interacted too much.  
You favoured them and stuff.  So that is the reality of the matter that 
when you support a black person, when you talk to them privately trying 
to guide them and stuff like, it is assumed that, like I mean, there is 
fraud involved or there is corruption.  And when you look into this, 
10 
Chair, like I mean, I am sorry, Kate.  I have to state this on record.  For 
instance, I did mention that there are lots of ever-green contracts at 
SAAT.  SAAT is a State Owned Company.  It is supposed to, like I mean 
balance what they need from others when they run tender in terms of, 
like I mean, the BEE status and stuff like.  They also should exercise 
saying, you know.  So, and, like, that was not done.  As long as the 
contract is between the white suppliers, I am not playing a race card, 
Chair, but I am just stating the facts that I met at SAAT when I took 
over this position.   
 
But like I mean when I gave instructions to ensure that like – 
20 
for the supplier to get the tender or business, they have to meet these 
requirements.  The Supplier Development requirements.  I went as far 
as touring Europe, US and everywhere, letting them know about the 
laws of this country because nobody has ever done that.  These 
companies like – have been at SAAT like I mean having contracts since 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 67 of 188 
 
1999.  Nobody questioned that.  Nobody questioned the fact that the 
nip obligation was not adhered to.   
 
Of course, it is controlled and managed by DTI, but, like I 
mean, somebody should have, like I mean – maybe the accounting 
authority or the accounting officer being the CEO.  So, like I mean, I 
had that role.  Like I mean, also protecting the CEO, protecting the 
Board, like in saying, “Okay, we push hard.” So, like I mean when I 
listened to Ms Sambo – like I mean saying all those things, I said you 
know, it is a pity that I cannot mention the BEE suppliers – other by 
name that I have given like I mean the same help – like given the same 
10 
help as JM or Ms Sambo, or anybody else, you know – like for  
instance, like, Air France had Kwane Capital as their black-owned 
company and, like I mean, I was pushing also for them because they 
only had the MOU between Kwane Capital being the black owned 
company in South Africa and then Air France.   
 
If you noticed, Kate, if you did not jump there or maybe you 
will go back, you will notice that when Air France bided in 2015, they 
bided with Kwane Capital, but like I mean whatever they had promised 
in terms of Supplier Development, they never delivered.  There are 
certain letters that I wrote, pushing Air France and making sure that 
20 
they adhered to what they had confirmed with the local supplier.  
Nobody, Chairperson, has gone through my e-mails and has gone 
through my laptop and actually picked up all those things that I had 
raised.   
 
The focus is only on JM and like I mean, Chair, sorry.  Like I 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 68 of 188 
 
mean, the open water report, I did say I will explain this.  The open 
water report – like I mean it – the open water came in around 2015 and 
they came for the main purpose.  The first one was the fact that SAAT 
was losing assets left right and centre.  They would buy spares worth 
millions of Rands and then later on the spares have been lost and then 
would have to buy again.  There was some sort of a syndicate 
happening, you know.  That was the first one, and the fact that there 
was the scrap that belonged to SAAT but they still had value and like I 
mean somebody sold the scrap for zero value instead of hundred and 
seventy-five million.   
10 
 
So I was actually mentioning all those things when I talked to 
the team of investigators that: 
“Guys I feel that you are being selective in terms of who 
you focus on, where the focus is on, where is actually 
names and mentions white people that have made sure 
like I mean that SAAT loses a whole lot of money 
through assets, through everything”. 
Nobody is looking back there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Ms Memela, the Commission obviously 
will not finish its job if it is to look at everything.  In the process it has 
20 
to prioritise and in prioritising there may be people who will not agree 
with its decision to prioritise that, or that, but what you and everyone 
else have been invited to do since the Commission started is to give 
the Commission any information you have which you think may relate to 
matters that fall within its terms of reference.   
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 69 of 188 
 
 
So, some people have done so and they might have focused on 
certain contracts, and then maybe you have not given the Commission 
information focusing on the contracts on which you wanted to – you 
would have liked to also look at.  So, even now, free if later on you 
would like to send documentation, statement to the Commission to say, 
here are other things that fall under the Commission’s terms of 
reference that you might not be aware of and the Commission can look 
at that.   
Of course, it is public knowledge that I have said that the 
Commission will probably have to secure another wing of its scope if it 
10 
is to finish its work.  But I have said that there may be matters are 
brought to my attention and I might say that one seems to be important.  
But those that might not looked into by the Commission would have to 
be looked into by some other agency.  So, I am just explaining that 
part.  I suggest that what we should do is, answer the questions that 
Ms Hofmeyr puts to you. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you feel that you need to add some information in 
order to ensure that you give – you do justice to your answer, that is 
fine.   
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I will be quite happy when you are done to give 
you a chance if there is something else ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was not raised by Ms Hofmeyr with you. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 70 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you think you would like to deal with in order 
for there to be fairness in terms of your own role and so on. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
MS MEMELA:  That is alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  So, Ms Memela just to 
clarify, when you first met Mr Ndzeku at that workshop in Midrand in 
May June 2015, was he introduced to you as a JM Aviation South Africa 
10 
representative? 
MS MEMELA:  Oh, he I – he introduced himself as an individual not as 
JM.  I am not sure when JM was registered but I do know that 
...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it was about October 2015. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that accord with your recollection? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  That is ja. so he introduced himself as himself 
...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Not as the Director of – remember the only JM that was 
– that we were aware of was JM International which ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But by October of 2015 when they joined the 
supplier database, were you aware of his link then to JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  They did not join the database in October. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 71 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2015? 
MS MEMELA:  2015.  Can you ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe we can return to it.   
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you want to get the specific date that is the 
...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Recollected date that I have but I just want to 
know at what point in time you made the association between Mr 
Ndzeku and JM Aviation South Africa?  Would that have still been 
10 
within 2015? 
MS MEMELA:  I think it was somewhere in 2016.  I do not remember 
exactly.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Sokhulu, when did you make the 
association between her and JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  Ms Sokhulu came in I think for that negotiations for the 
GPU’s.  When was it?  Was it on 2016, I think? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And did you know that they were father 
20 
and daughter? 
MS MEMELA:  I think it was introduced sometime later when there was 
the negotiations of the contract Chair of JM and AAR. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 72 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you know that Mr Ndzeku was a 
Director of Swissport South Africa when you met him in 2015? 
MS MEMELA:  Of course, when we talked because I think I cannot 
remember everything that we chatted about Chair but I do know he did 
introduce himself saying okay he does have a lot of aviation experience 
through Swissport and all that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to move to the property 
purchase that you made in – for a house in Bedfordview.  Ms Memela 
during your involvement in these two contracts, that is the one 
involving the sale of the GPU’s and the one involving the components 
10 
support services that was awarded to the joint venture of JM Aviation 
and AAR. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There was an amount of 2.5 million Rand paid 
towards a house you were buying in Bedfordview by JM Aviation.  Is 
that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  The deposit was 1.5 so the amount was the amount of 
the land owed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry, I do not understand that.   
MS MEMELA:  I am saying the deposit of the house was 1.5 the amount 
20 
of the land was 2.5 that was bought by Mr Ndzeku. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, no, sorry.  My question is when you bought 
your Bedfordview house in 2016, JM Aviation paid 2.5 million Rand 
towards the purchase of that house.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct but it was not JM Aviation, it was Mr 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 73 of 188 
 
Ndzeku.  It may have come from JM Aviation – I explained that already 
to the Investigating Team and I gave the what the prove for that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us go through that if we can.  I 
understand your account of it is at page 21 of your statement that is in 
DD25A. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you start there to deal with the background 
to this payment of 2.5 million. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicate that it involved a sale by your 
10 
mother of two properties.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What were those two properties that she sold? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, it was the land in Eastern Cape.  Chair it was the 
land in Eastern Cape at Mpindweni and the other one it was a land in 
Mbotyi.  So the one the amount that was paid for the purchase it was 
actually merged to be paid for the purchase in Eastern Cape for Cove 
Ridge and then because it took longer to happen and then it was 
redirected to the amount of the house in Bedfordview when the bank 
approved a certain percentage and then I needed a deposit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Ms Hofmeyr, maybe we must give you a 
chance to explain how it came about that you – that payment was made 
whether by JM or by Mr Ndzeku. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know you have given this explanation here but the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 74 of 188 
 
people who are listening have not read this and there is something that 
has come up publicly.  You might wish to just explain to say this is how 
Mr Ndzeku or JM came to pay for my house.  These are the 
circumstances.  Then Ms Hofmeyr will ask you the questions. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay chair.  In 2015 I was purchasing a property in 
Cove Ridge in Eastern Cape and it took longer to be finalised and then 
I started looking for a property to live in here in Johannesburg as I was 
living in Alberton.  So, at the time when it was finalised before it was 
finalised the bond from Standard Bank, they approved a certain 
percentage.  I remember at that time they were quite strict with 
10 
approval of 100% bond and stuff.   
So, the deposit was needed.  One of some of the deposit was 
coming from my husband’s pension fund and some of the deposit was 
coming from the amount that was coming from the land purchase of my 
mother.  And I did ask also that the fact that it was coming from JM 
what account it was coming from Mr Ndzeku because the deal was 
between Mr Ndzeku and my mother, not JM.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, let us just unpack that a bit if we may.  You 
indicated that there were two properties that your mother sold to Mr 
20 
Ndzeku. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Located in the Eastern Cape.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How is she introduced to Mr Ndzeku? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 75 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay my mom came for the eye operation in 
Johannesburg in 2015 and I told her about the intention to buy the 
property in Eastern Cape and stuff like that.  And she showed interest 
that okay I have this kind of – part of lands and she had also land in 
Vusi and Mount Frere at stuff.  So, she said she would sell some of the 
properties.   
At that time there was quite an interest like when you talk to 
some of the BEE partners, there were some of the BEE supplier who 
were actually interested in buying certain properties in Eastern Cape to 
develop and do other things, do other projects.  So, I remember most of 
10 
them they bought from Mbotyi and the one in Mpindweni is actually next 
to Umzimvubu and it was from my mother’s parents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, did you put her in touch with Mr Ndzeku? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I actually said because Ndzeku from our 
discussions when we chat, he did explain that he was looking for the 
property in Eastern Cape and everybody is buying and he has so many 
projects to run in the coming- ja. So I introduced him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you understand he wanted to do 
with the property? 
MS MEMELA:  At that time, he did not explain what he wanted to do. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what type of property is it 
MS MEMELA:  It is the land ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry, the two properties? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, they are the land.  Where my mother’s parents used 
to have the land in Mpindweni and then they moved to another and then 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 76 of 188 
 
they left that one under her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it – can it be used for business purposes or 
not? 
MS MEMELA:  It can be used for business purposes because it is next 
to the river and it is next to the field Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, is it zoned for business purposes? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, I think his interest was for that.  And Chair, just to 
add, when I was asked by the Investigating Team around this from 
Open Water report, they had said my property was like the deposit was 
coming from the increase from my salary and I had corrected that.  
10 
Also, Ms Sambo said the same thing that it was an increase of my 
salary also Mr Human.  So, I explained to them these are the facts and 
I think this is the part like I said I do not understand the reference or 
maybe the link between purchase of my property versus the tenders 
that were running at that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When Open Waters was probing with you the 
salary increase, did you say to them, no, the money for my Bedfordview 
house did not come from the salary increase.  It came from the deposit 
from Mr Ndzeku. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Chairperson let me give clarity to this.  Open 
20 
Water never gave me an opportunity to state my side of the story.  At 
the time when they started checking this, they actually take – they took 
everything from my laptop and then everything from whoever that they 
listened to instead of coming to me and asking me questions because I 
would have clarified at that point where my deposit came from.   
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 77 of 188 
 
But they have written what they through was happening and it 
is a result of this Chair certain people nearly got fired because from HR 
the recommendation for my salary was made from HR and stuff like.  
So, I want to put it on record that Open Water never asked me about 
like with the purchase of my property.  I only find out when the team – 
the Zondo Team started asking questions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But they did engage you about the salary 
increase. 
MS MEMELA:  They did not engage about the salary increase.  I only 
heard about it when I think, Arson Malola-Phiri, was the Acting 
10 
Chairperson – Acting CEO of SAAT wanted to find out how is my salary 
being discussed like it is relating to the tender and stuff.  And he said 
some of the questions that were coming from the Commission’s Team 
was that maybe it was ratification payment from top Management to me 
for a job well done.  I am not sure what job well done but they were 
linking to that.  Open Water never talked to me about my salary 
increase.  They talked to everybody else except me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we were at the point where you indicated 
you had introduced your mother to Mr Ndzeku. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He wanted to buy two properties for her for 
business purposes.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I am not – not like I am unclear I think he will be 
the right person to actually answer that question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  No, I am interested at the moment 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 78 of 188 
 
about your understanding of his intentions for the property. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  I did not understand at that time so I think he will 
be a correct person to actually answer that one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you know when he concluded the 
purchase with your mother? 
MS MEMELA:  I think it was concluded between 2015 and 2016.  I am 
not sure about the year but I think it was concluded around there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you know what the sale price was? 
MS MEMELA:  For Mpindweni it was 2.5, I think.  These documents 
belong to my mother, not me.  So, I am actually talking on her behalf. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  So, and then Mbotyi it was I think 500 000. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you sure that both transactions went 
through? 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure right now.  That is one of the things that I 
was trying to figure out but those were the questions that were not 
asked during the investigating meeting.  So, I think Mr Ndzeku is the 
right person to actually answer that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you say that ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:  But I know that the Mpindweni one went through 
20 
because he paid for that one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you say those questions were not 
asked during the meetings with the Commission? 
MS MEMELA:  No, I am saying the question you are asking now, if I am 
aware that it – they went through.  Yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 79 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall being asked to provide the 
Commission with all the supporting documents for this transaction? 
MS MEMELA:  I was not asked to submit the supporting documents.  I 
was asked to explain and then Mr Kirtland Chair said, are you sure, do 
you have the title deed? Do you have offer to purchase?  Do you have 
this and that?  So, I responded to that.  So, this is I think where I had 
said I would appreciate if the team sends me specific written questions 
so that I am able to answer properly and then I attach exactly what is 
required.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would you like me to take you to the e-mail 
10 
where it was specifically requested that you provide the supporting 
documents? 
MS MEMELA:  You can take me to that e-mail. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is with reference Ms Sambo to where you 
say in your own ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Memela. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, apologies Ms Memela.  Where you say in 
your e-mail that you have – there are papers to support this.  I first 
want to give you that reference.  So, you will find it at page 21. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of Exhibit DD25A and it is at paragraph 48.  If 
you look at paragraph 48 just before the bottom of the page. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have been talking there about this very 
transaction.  Right?  And when you get to paragraph 48, you are talking 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 80 of 188 
 
about the purchase agreement to sell the two properties and then you 
talk about Cove Ridge.  And then you see in the second last line you 
have a sentence “there are papers to support this”.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that.  I thought you were directing me to the e-mail 
that I received. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, I want to locate – because the e-mail refers 
specifically to this sentence in this paragraph of your statement. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is why I wanted you to have the benefit 
of seeing this sentence. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In this paragraph of your statement.  Chair for 
this purpose I need to take Ms Memela to a correspondence bundle 
which has not been handed in yet.  I do note that we are close to the 
tea break.  I am happy to do it now.  It just involves handing out 
documents.  Otherwise we can do it when we return from the – I beg 
your pardon, lunch break, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What is convenient to you?  Is it something that 
is short and ...(intervenes)?  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is fairly short Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, we can hand it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do it ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us do that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do it. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 81 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may beg leave then to just then hand up to 
yourself Chair a correspondence bundle that has been prepared and to 
Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  This has not been admitted as yet, right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It has not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has not yet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was really a correspondence bundle put 
together in anticipation of Ms Memela possibly making application 
today not to appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was only compiled overnight.  But if we 
can enter it as ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there are two ways of dealing with it.  For now, 
you just want to refer to one e-mail. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you contemplate that you will be referring to this 
correspondence file much later? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, not at all.  Unless something arises in Ms 
Memela’s testimony that is at odds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because what we could is maybe just take out. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make a copy of the e-mail and then we add it to her 
file. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we – for purpose of asking questions we 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 82 of 188 
 
relate to that without admitting this whole file. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am indebted to you for that.  What I will do for 
present purposes is just if I may direct you to the pagination in the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then we will extract it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in so far as the pagination is concerned, I 
must just begin with an apology.  This was originally put together as a 
10 
file of more than 800 pages but it included an enormous amount of 
repetition.  So overnight in preparation for today I had stripped out the 
repetition but in consequence of the is that the pagination does not run 
beautifully from 1 to whatever.  It retains the old pagination but you will 
still – it still moves numerically.  We will just have to find the page I am 
looking for.  It is page 398 of the correspondence bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  398. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  398. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if you page it will not move beautifully in 
20 
numerical order but it does move progressively.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What I was saying is maybe we should take it out 
here, give it a page number for this one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you refer to it ...(intervenes).  
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 83 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You refer to the page number as ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As we have extracted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so I think that might be ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That might be preferable.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be preferable. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair then I am going to ask if you would not 
mind taking out from 398 all the way to 422 because this is an e-mail 
10 
that has an attachment to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we are going to need to look at the 
attachment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should it not be 423?  I see that the second 
...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry, 442 if I said that incorrectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 442. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, it is the last page of a draft affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at this stage you just want to refer to that e-mail 
20 
only. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I will take you to one page in attached 
document.  So, Chair for now my proposal is let us work with the 
pagination in red at the top if we may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 84 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then I will indicate how that pagination 
changes when we put it into the file so that the record will be able to 
reflect that change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we put it at the back of Ms Memela’s bundle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  I suggest at the back of DD25B. 
MS MEMELA:  So where are we now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, at the end of DD25B? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  B, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that is the end of the additional 
10 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Memela we have left you out of this 
discussion.  I think somebody will help you afterwards. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  We will arrange Ms Memela’s file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
KATE 
HOFMEYR: 
 
For 
now, 
she 
can 
leave 
it 
in 
the 
correspondence bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Sorry we did not tell you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so we go to the end of that bundle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see what I wanted us to do is that if for now you 
are only going to refer to that e-mail. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 85 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We may just paginate that e-mail only. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sequentially with this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you can do the rest of the pagination during the 
lunchbreak or whatever. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well why do we not do that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I can refer to what follows but we will do 
pagination without having to go there in the lunchbreak. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that makes eminence sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, the current bundle DD25B ends on page 
670 as I have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, we would paginate this from 671. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela this is an e-mail sent by the 
Commission’s investigator Mr Kirtland to yourself.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, which one now ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry so, at the top right-hand corner. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 86 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The red paginate page is 398.  Do you have 
that? 
MS MEMELA:  398 ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Do you confirm that it is an e-mail from 
Mr Kirtland to yourself? 
MS MEMELA:  It is an e-mail coming from Mr Kirtland to myself on the 
14 t h of January. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair just to give a little bit of 
background to the chronology that precedes this.  It is in the 
10 
correspondence.  We can go there if any aspect of it is disputed by Ms 
Memela.  But in the interest of time I just propose to summarise it so 
that this e-mail can be placed in context.   
There had been engagements with Ms Memela at the end of 
last year in a meeting with the Legal Team and the investigators and 
there was a follow up from January and later in December about an 
affidavit that she was going to provide to the Commission.  What 
happens around this time is Ms Memela had put in an e-mail to the 
Commission her account of the topics. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Kirtland was following up about 
converting that account in the e-mail to an affidavit.  And what Mr 
Kirtland had done by this stage is actually placed it into an affidavit 
format for Ms Memela and he had gone through the affidavit and 
indicated to her specific questions to follow up from the broad account 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 87 of 188 
 
that she had given.  And so, what is detailed in this e-mail is precisely 
that.  He indicates in the second paragraph that Ms Memela had 
requested to provide – that we provide her with a standard template of 
an affidavit to use by the Commission and highlight the questions that 
she – we still wanted her to address. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then she said I will just copy and paste to 
the affidavit.  And what Mr Kirtland was explaining was that was 
precisely what he had done the previous week.  And you will see the 
attachment is first the summons, a copy of the summons that was sent 
10 
as a courtesy to Ms Memela.  And then the affidavit that had been sent 
to Ms Memela from page 424.  And Chair if you just scroll into that 
affidavit to page 437. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see paragraph 52 at that page is 
basically a replica of paragraph 48 in her current statement before the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will see four lines from the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It says, “there are papers to support this”.  This 
is the exact same paragraph we were looking at in her statement. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh okay, I thought you were going to show us the e-mail 
that I said I will send the documentation.  But it is okay Chair, I am 
sure there is another e-mail where I had written to Mr Kirtland saying – 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 88 of 188 
 
because he had indicated that he had sent me a draft affidavit with the 
comments and said ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no, that is fine.  Just hang on.   
MS MEMELA:  Yes ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let her finish. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when you have a chance then you can 
respond. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Ms Memela we are going through this 
exercise because my questions began with a query about your 
knowledge of the sale agreements.  And I had said to you that we had 
previously requested that you provide us with those agreements. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understood your testimony you said, 
no, we had not made that request.  And that is why I am moving to this 
document to show you where we made that request previously.   
MS MEMELA:  Okay from the affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, in the affidavit at what is paragraph 52 of 
the affidavit in page 437 you will see a paragraph beginning, “my 
mother then entered into a purchase agreement”.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 89 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you see further down in that paragraph 
there is the sentence four lines from the bottom starting at it end that 
says, “there are papers to support this”.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you see the comment bubble on the 
right-hand side of that page from Mr Kirtland saying, please attach all 
the papers and correspondence in this regard? 
MS MEMELA:  I am seeing it now Chair.  But as I said but you said I 
will answer later.  But as I said ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now that she has asked you the question you 
10 
can deal with it.  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Yes.  I indicated to Mr Kirtland that I was using 
my phone and that the comments were not appearing and stuff.  So, I 
could not see the comments on the side and then he had to resend the 
word and then not with this – because I said okay, I am using the phone 
so it does not have that option for me to actually check the comments 
that he have made.  So, I have nothing against submitting the 
documentation as promised.  I can still submit that from my side.  So, I 
did not maybe keep them ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not see. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Because I do not want to submit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  I do have them but it could – they could follow 
afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 90 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  It is just Chair what I wanted to know was that I just 
needed to know because Mr Kirtland only said the link between my 
purchase of the property and the reason why it is actually raised here 
is the fact that I purchased it during the time when the component 
tender was taking place and stuff.   
So, I was trying to understand I actually wrote to Mr Kirtland 
as well asking what is the link?  Is it because of the director had 
bought the land or is it because it was both at the same time and or 
maybe there is just an assumption or suspicions that maybe it was the 
money for tender which is I do not understand because did – ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  So, I wanted to find – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you say you are happy to provide the 
documents? 
MS MEMELA:  I will provide the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But I am saying also Chair I will provide the 
documentation as I promised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  But I also want to know what Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  The question is directed to.  I mean what is the link 
between my property and the tender? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine.   
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 91 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She still has quite some questions for you.  Maybe or 
are you done with this part? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair.  I understand there to be a 
concession by Ms Memela so we can move on after the lunchbreak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  I think we will take the lunch 
adjournment and then when – then you can do the pagination of these. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when we resume maybe for purposes of the 
transcript, you can just announce what the new pages are. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will do that precisely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We are going to adjourn now.  And it is 13:05 
we will resume at 14:05.   
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just over the lunch adjournment we 
managed to change the pagination on the pages. Our efficient 
document Management people were actually here with the replacement 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 92 of 188 
 
pages before we had even left the room so that was excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we also used the break Chair to paginate 
just a few more documents that I want to hand up now if I may because 
it picks up on a matter that Ms Memela testified about just before the 
break.  I had not anticipated that there might be a difference in her 
recollection from the facts as I had them.  So we just went to go and 
get the records.  What they are is communication October 2015. Ms 
Memela you will recall I asked you when JM Aviation was added to the 
data base at SAAT.  So I just want to have for your benefit the records 
10 
of that.  So if I may beg leave to hand up the copies? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They have been paginated already to go at the 
end of Exhibit DD25B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Okay.   
\ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will start with those documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they have been paginated to commence at 
page 698 and that is in Exhibit DD25B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Yes.  Ms Memela have you got the pages? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  I have the pages Chair.  I have the pages Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  698 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we start at the bottom of that page in the e-
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 93 of 188 
 
mail that appears that appears in the last half.  Ms Memela can you tell 
us who sent that e-mail and to whom? 
MS MEMELA:  It was Ms Khosi Sokhulu to myself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the subject of the e-mail? 
MS MEMELA:  JM Aviation Company Documents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the date of the e-mail? 
MS MEMELA:  13 October 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And could you read into the record what she 
says to you in that e-mail? 
MS MEMELA:  “Good day Nontsasa it was a great 
10 
pleasure to finally meet you on Friday 2 October please 
find JM Aviation South Africa’s Company Documents 
attached as requested.  We look forward to the 
opportunity to be of service.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you will recall in your evidence earlier I 
asked if you could recall when you first met Ms Sokhulu. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Has this assisted you with that recollection? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja it assists yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was in fact on the 2 n d of October 2015 
20 
that you met her? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then these documents were forwarded to 
you on the 13 t h of October, what did you then do? 
MS MEMELA:  I forwarded them to the list of guys like at Procurement 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 94 of 188 
 
and to one BEE officer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and that you see at the top e-mail on that 
page 698, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you request that the company be added to 
the data base, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know if that occurred? 
MS MEMELA:  If that occurred I do not – I did not follow up.  Like 
remember there is as I said like I mean a person who is responsible for 
10 
BEE and Supply Development. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You facilitated them getting onto the data base 
and amongst the documents that they had to submit if you will turn to 
page 727?   
MS MEMELA:  727.  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  727 what is that document? 
MS MEMELA:  Oh it states like the shareholders of JM. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and can you read into the record who those 
20 
shareholders are and what proportions they hold as shares in the 
company. 
MS MEMELA:  “Dear Sir ...(intervenes).” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that just say who the letter comes from 
and so on.  Synergy, it comes from Synergy Chartered Accountants, is 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 95 of 188 
 
that right?  Ms Memela? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay it is the document of the suppliers so I will let 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  The documents ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I just want you to identify who the document 
came from. 
MS MEMELA:  Oh okay.  At the – on the letterhead is Synergy 
Chartered Accountants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and it is written by T Nyepa 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Nyepa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  N-y-e-p-a. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is addressed, to whom it may concern. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the subject – you can read the subject and 
then you can identify the shareholders. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually you can read the letter because that will give 
a complete picture. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
“Dear Sir or Madam, we hereby confirm that we are 
the duly appointed auditors of the abovementioned 
entity 
and 
we 
hereby 
confirm 
the 
entity’s 
shareholding as follows: Ms M V Sokhulu, 35%, Ms I 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 96 of 188 
 
N Louw, 30%, Mr J Aires, 15%, Mr V A Ndzeku, 20% 
Kindly contact the undersigned hereof should you 
require any further clarification.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Memela you just left out the title 
of the letter, the subject.  What is that? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
“Re JM Aviation South Africa PTY LTD Company 
Registration Number 2015/053564/07 Shareholding 
confirmation.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the date of the letter? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  The date of the letter is 18 t h of January 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell me when you met with Ms Sokhulu 
on the 2 n d of October 2015 what were the circumstances around that 
meeting? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay Chair I will not remember because like I did not 
have the information in front of me but like one thing I would remember 
is that I have met so many BEE companies especially after their 
workshop in 2015 and stuff like.  So I am sure it was definitely about 
them being added into your data base and like I mean what is it that is 
expected from them like I mean they should not front and like all those 
20 
kinds of schooling and training. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know that she was not a Director of JM 
Aviation at that time? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm.  Was your understanding from the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 97 of 188 
 
interaction that she did have a role to play there? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay like I mean there are certain questions that you 
ask like I mean the suppliers.  Remember like I mean we – the Board or 
the Chairpersons of the Board like …(indistinct) the workshops like to 
actually address like the Supply Development and the lack of like 
having BEE companies like into the data base of SAAT and stuff like.  
So there were certain questions that they were asked.  Like I mean 
question like okay would they be able to provide or supply certain 
things and stuff like – and then to question who is the director that time 
or who is not like it was not part of the – ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I think given this refreshing of your memory 
would it be fair to say that at least by the end of 2015 you knew Mr 
Ndzeku, Ms Sokhulu and JM Aviation? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes like I mean based on this information. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would now like to move to Cove Ridge 
because part of the ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry you say based on this information? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes based on the information here that I received the 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not talking about the letter at 727 because 
the letter at 727 is 18 January 2016. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 98 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, no I am talking about like the e-mail that was sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About other documents? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that clarification.  I would like to 
just explore Cove Ridge a little bit more because your evidence 
previously indicated that that was a property in the Eastern Cape that 
you were interested in buying, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And for what purpose was that? 
MS MEMELA:  It was the purpose for the purpose of business renting 
out and – ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Renting out? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja – business purposes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So was – business purposes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  And was it a developed property? 
MS MEMELA:  It was not a developed property it was in the process of 
being developed. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicated that your mother had said to 
you she wanted to assist with the deposit on that property, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 99 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the sale price of that property? 
MS MEMELA:  I think if I remember correctly Chair it was 2.8. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how much was the deposit of that purchase 
price? 
MS MEMELA:  I think like we were going to pay half of that and then 
like I am getting the amount from the bank, the remaining amount from 
the bank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  But it did not continue it was cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you looking Ms Hofmeyr for the deposit that was 
10 
paid or for the deposit that was required? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The deposit that was required.  So I think 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what was the deposit that was required? 
MS MEMELA:  The deposit that was required I think – I do not 
remember like I mean if it is written here but like I mean there was a 
certain amount that was required.  But like I mean the cost of the land 
was 2.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the one that you say you paid which was you 
said about half or would have been more than the deposit that was 
20 
required by the bank? 
MS MEMELA:  It would have been half of what was required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So ...(intervenes). 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 100 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  But it was not finalised. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just so I can clarify.  The purchase price 
was 2.8.  The deposit was about half of that and the remainder would 
be made up by a bank mortgage, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  I think that is correct like but I am just checking quickly 
if it is not recorded.  If you tell Ms Hofmeyr what document you are 
looking for she might be able to help you. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I am looking for the – over the purchase of the 
Cove Ridge. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh yes let us – can I – can I just finish one or 
10 
two more questions and then we will go there because it will follow the 
flow.  And then can I just understand the arrangement with your mother 
was that the deposit that she was going to assist with on Cove Ridge 
would then be redirected to your Bedfordview house when Cove Ridge 
was cancelled, is that correct? If you will just put your ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please switch on your microphone again and then 
give the answer again. 
MS MEMELA:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give that answer again? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes like I mean the deposit that was meant for Cove 
20 
Ridge like then it was going to be later directed to the Bedfordview 
house. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did you find the Bedfordview house, 
do you recall that? 
MS MEMELA:  I think it was around February I do not remember the – 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 101 of 188 
 
ja exact dates. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No of course. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is February 2016, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja I am saying like I do not remember the exact dates so 
I – ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, no I thought you meant the day in February 
but you said February. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja I think somewhere in February. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Like I am saying I am not – I do not remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I am just identifying the year, February? 
MS MEMELA:  I think 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Right.  Because you are in 2015. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When you are engaged in the Cove Ridge 
transaction, is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then you find the property in Bedfordview, is 
that correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at that point you cancel the Cove Ridge so 
that you can pursue the Bedfordview property, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the sale price on the Bedfordview 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 102 of 188 
 
property? 
MS MEMELA:  Chair this is one of the questions that I had said like I 
mean I would ask you if I am obliged to answer and stuff like – because 
I am really trying to figure out like I mean how is my purchase of my 
house like I mean relative to what I am here for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Which is the component. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see the reason why Ms Hofmeyr is asking 
about details about the purchase of your house and the money that was 
paid in regard to that came from either Mr Ndzeku or JM is to see 
10 
whether there may have been anything improper about the payment or – 
of that amount in regard to your house in circumstances where you 
were Head of Procurement at SAAT and Mr Ndzeku was a Director of 
JM and at a certain stage it was making a – putting in bids.  So these 
questions are just to check whether there was nothing improper.  So 
from my point of view there should be no problem in answering it but 
you remember what we said at the beginning.  If you feel that 
answering that question is going to be – you are going to be 
incriminating yourself you must indicate but on the face of it I do not 
see a problem.  But I do not know much as much as you know about 
20 
those transactions. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Chair like I think the reason why I am raising this I 
am not running away from accountability or maybe like I mean 
responding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 103 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  To the facts and stating my own facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  But like I think like I mean remember before the break I 
did ask like what the link is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Between my property and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  The transactions that we are talking about now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:  I think like that will give me an indication of where she 
10 
is heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you need not know where she is heading. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must just answer the question.  You do not need 
to worry about where she may be heading. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as I said you know if you feel strongly that maybe 
if you answer the question you might be incriminating yourself we will 
hear from you – indicate but if you feel comfortable to answer the 
question do not worry about where she may be heading.  Is that alright? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  That is alright Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you remember the question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We want to be fair to everybody.  We want to be fair 
to you.  We need to ask certain questions to establish what had – what 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 104 of 188 
 
happened but we want to make sure that as we do that there is fairness 
but at the same time we must try and get to the bottom of the situation. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The question was, what was the sale price of 
the Bedfordview house? 
MS MEMELA:  It was 3.8. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  R3.8 million.  So I assume based on your 
previous testimony that R3.8 million plus R2.8 million at the same time 
if you had a liability for both would not have been a liability you could 
10 
meet, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  If I had the liability for both? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I would like I mean continue with both of them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understand it once you had found the 
Bedfordview house you then decided to cancel the Cove Ridge, is that 
right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Sambo gave an account in her 
evidence about an interaction she had had with you around this 
property and you in fact responded to what she had said in your cross-
examination application. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 105 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your statement that you confirmed this 
morning under oath.  I would like to take you to two aspects of it. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will find that in the cross-examination 
application in front of you numbered 04 of 2020 and the part of your 
statement that I want to pick up at is at page 8.  At 8 there you 
commence dealing with this aspect at paragraph 8.5. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say there: 
“I 
deny 
and 
refute 
the 
allegation 
as 
10 
misrepresentation of facts by Ms Sambo in that she 
was not a close – not that close to me as a friend for 
me to discuss my intention to buy pro – my property.  
(People who are close to me would testify to this that 
I never share my private information with anyone 
except 
one 
has 
something 
to 
do 
with 
such 
information).” 
Then you go on and say: 
“The bank has never declined my application instead 
in 2015 the banks had been very strict in approving 
20 
100% bond.” 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “But they were mostly approving a 
certain percentage of the bond requiring a deposit.  
A deposit which had nothing to do with Ms Kwinana 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 106 of 188 
 
and Mr Zwane.” 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you go on and explain how that 
deposit was going to be paid.  I just want to pause there.  Do you 
maintain in your evidence today that this payment of this deposit had 
nothing to do with Ms Kwinana or Mr Zwane? 
MS MEMELA:  I maintain that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we can go to page – paragraph 8.6.  
You say there: 
“During 2016 Ms Sambo called me congratulating me 
10 
and informing me that she had heard that I had 
moved to a new home and asked where it was.  I told 
her it was in Bedfordview.  That was only from that 
call she learned about my property in Bedfordview.  I 
remember she asked me to send her a photo which I 
did and her comment was, wow this one cannot be 
less than R10 million.  And that time I had not picked 
up 
her 
bitterness 
towards 
me. 
 
I 
innocently 
responded that it was not even close to R4 million 
and added that my salary would not be sufficient 
20 
enough to even attempt to purchase a property for 
R10 million.” 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you say to Ms Sambo that the property 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 107 of 188 
 
was not even close to R4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Because it was not R4 million.  I guess like because I 
said it is 3.8. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is 3.8 not close to 4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay it is close but ja I am not sure about where that 
question is going.  But like I mean it close to 4 million.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then why did you tell her it was not close to 
4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Look like I mean there are things that like I mean you 
disclose to certain people and stuff like I mean I was not going to 
10 
disclose that to Ms Sambo.  Like I mean it is not like she was 
investigating or maybe I owed her any information about my property. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you volunteered information about its sale 
price as not being close to 4 million, that was false, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay like I mean me saying it Ms Sambo that it was not 
close to 4 million.  So like I mean ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what Ms Hofmeyr is putting to you. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you admit that saying that the property was 
not close to R4 million was not true. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja but like I mean she did not ask about 4 million.  Like 
I mean she talked about 10 million.  So like I mean it was just me like 
responding.  So I was writing what I had said like when I was talking to 
her.  So like I mean this is not about 4 million or anything.  Like I mean 
I am the one who actually came up with 4 million.  She like I mean 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 108 of 188 
 
suspected that it was over 10 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So I am not sure like I mean how maybe saying like not 
close to 4 million to Ms Sambo stands like I mean to prove that maybe I 
was lying to her or I had to – I am not sure.  Like maybe I do not 
understand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no let – okay let us do it this way. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct that your property, the purchase price of 
10 
your property was 3.8 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct that Ms Sambo said to you that house 
after seeing the picture could not be less than R10 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes like I mean it was just an informal conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it correct that in responding to her you said the 
house was not even close R4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I did say that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is R3.8 million close or not close to R4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  It is close to R4 million Chair but like I mean that 
responding to Sibongile was not something that I was under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 109 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let – we will get there.  So you accept that it is close 
to R4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you accept that what you said was not true? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you want to provide an explanation why you 
said it was not close to R4 million? 
MS MEMELA:  There is no-one so far that I have given the exact 
10 
answer of how much my house is. Like it is either I change like I mean 
because I do not – I never like really disclose such information to 
anyone.  In fact like even my first property in Douglasdale Fourways I 
have never told anyone how much it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So like this here like it was just being like me saying to 
a person like who wants to know that okay like I mean it is not close to 
this.  So I am not sure Sir – Chair that like maybe by saying that like I 
mean I was supposed to tell her exactly how much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you might not have needed to tell her exactly 
20 
how much it was. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you could have said it is not even close to 10 
million and left it at that.  And that would have been true, is it not? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay but like I mean an informal conversation between 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 110 of 188 
 
two people versus like me sitting here taking an oath is like different.  
What I say out there because I was like just quoting what we had said 
to each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr do you want to take that ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No we do not need to take that further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not?  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Sambo has been given an opportunity to 
explain why she might have said something false to Ms Sambo but 
10 
unless there is anything else she wants to add we do not need to take 
that further.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to move to that agreement 
that purchase agreement for the Cove Ridge property that you 
requested you be directed to.  It is in Bundle DD25B – apologies A.  
And you will find it at page 370.   
MS MEMELA:  370? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Can you identify the document at 370? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I can. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies I see you are still getting there.  
What is that document? 
MS MEMELA:  It is a Deed of Sale. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Between what parties? 
MS MEMELA:  Slipknot Investment and Nontsasa Memela. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 111 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what page does that document end on? 
MS MEMELA:  It ends 374. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was this the Deed of Sale for you to 
purchase the Cove Ridge property? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us just go through it at page 371.  I think 
you indicated in your evidence earlier that the purchase price was R2.8 
million.  You can see that on page 371.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicated earlier that there was a 
10 
deposit amount and an amount that would be covered by the bond. Can 
you identify for us the clause that sets that out? 
MS MEMELA:  The clause – I did not say that there was a clause that 
will set it out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh but ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was part of the agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  It was part of like I mean the plan that okay like I mean 
the deposit will be paid and then like I mean the remainder I am going 
to get from the bank. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But would that not have to be set out in the 
agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay it was not in the agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was not? 
MS MEMELA:  It was not. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 112 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know the requirements of the Alienation 
of Land Act for the identification of a purchase price for the sale of 
immovable property? 
MS MEMELA:  No I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  And when was the purchase price 
required to be paid under this agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  It was required to be paid if I remember correctly after 
90 days or like – but it was not an agent.  I do not remember like the 
days or maybe the months that like it was required to be paid.  So like I 
do not want to like I mean say things that like I mean when I find out 
10 
maybe when I go back to my files and stuff.  Like I mean it does not 
support this.  So I am safe to say like I do not remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well it is about a three-page document.  We 
have looked at it.  I struggle to find a provision that indicated when the 
purchase price had to be paid.  Can you assist with that at all? 
MS MEMELA:  The part where it indicates? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When the purchase price had to be paid? 
MS MEMELA:  No it is not here.  That is why I am saying like I mean I 
do not remember like how long it was going to be.  And then like I mean 
it was not agent as well. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was not agent.  Just explain to us what that 
means? 
MS MEMELA:  I am saying like I mean it was not like I mean something 
that was required to be paid like within 60 days or 90 days.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry so I am just not sure I understand your 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 113 of 188 
 
testimony.  I thought a moment ago you said you – it did have to be 
paid in 90 days. 
MS MEMELA:  I said I do not remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  It may have been like 90 days or more. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you agree that this agreement does not 
make any provision for when the purchase price has to be paid? 
MS MEMELA:  No it does not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it does not contain a deposit provision nor 
a provision to get a bond? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  No it does not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And do you know who the owners and 
Directors of Slipknot Investments were at the time that you purchased 
this property? 
MS MEMELA:  I am not sure about like the Directors or the owners of 
the – but like I mean we signed like I mean based on the company or 
maybe family trust or something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  But I know that like I mean the person who signed for it 
like that I was buying from was – the person who signed was – the 
20 
person signed was – I think Yakhe Kwinana. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yakhe Kwinana? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Chair of the Board of SAAT? 
MS MEMELA:  The Chair – ja the former Chairperson of the Board of 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 114 of 188 
 
SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time that you concluded this agreement 
with her she was the Chair of the Board of SAAT, is that correct?  You 
can look at page 373. 
MS MEMELA:  373. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the date.  It is April 2015. 
MS MEMELA:  No I do not remember. Like I mean when did she become 
a Chair of SAAT or not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was she known to you at SAAT at this time? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja like I mean she had known me at SAAT. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just for the record she was the Chair of the 
SAAT Board at that stage.  We have had evidence to that effect.  And I 
see it was signed in Centurion on the 21 s t of April.  Do you recall who 
the witnesses were of this agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  No I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The signature of the seller there, who was that?  On 
page 373. 
MS MEMELA:  I think the seller on behalf of the Slipknot was – it was 
signed by Ms Yakhe Kwinana.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would be able to identify her signature 
20 
anyway or did she sign in your presence? 
MS MEMELA:  I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – everybody seemed to have signed on the 21 s t 
of April 2015. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja I think we signed at the same – but like I cannot 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 115 of 188 
 
confirm it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you all at the same place when you signed? 
MS MEMELA:  I think so yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would know that she signed here? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And in any event that signature would 
be a signature that you are familiar with having worked with her for 
quite some time or not really? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja having to – like having seen like on the Board 
Resolutions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other documents. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The witnesses appear to have been the same 
witnesses so I think. 
MS MEMELA:  It was signed at the same place. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Same place indeed.  And you can confirm Ms 
Kwinana signed it for the seller and you signed it as purchaser, is that 
correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the witnesses have been people that came with 
her to the place where the signing took place or would one or – one of 
them have come with you or will both have come with you?  Or was it 
people that were just grabbed as they were passing? 
MS MEMELA:  No Chair.  No.  I think like if I remember correctly, but 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 116 of 188 
 
like I might be wrong, but I think it was signed at the law firm 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  And then like maybe some of the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would have been the staff at the law firm that 
may have signed as witnesses? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes or maybe people that she came with or 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  From, ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which law firm would that be? 
MS MEMELA:  I think it will be Mbanjwa Law Firm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the law firm that was going to take care 
of the transfer of the property? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As indicated at page 371? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can you just assist me with a 
sale agreement for R2.8 million.  That does not indicate when the 
20 
purchase price needs to be paid.  Was that not an issue for Ms Kwinana 
when she entered into this agreement with you? 
MS MEMELA:  Like she did not raise an issue.  Of course like if it like I 
mean drafted by the lawyers.  We like I mean there were witnesses and 
stuff like I mean we knew what we were agreeing on. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 117 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did you think the purchase price had to 
be paid? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – but what is also clear is that there was 
no deposit provision for this agreement.  Was there? 
MS MEMELA:  Like it was – like I think a verbal agreement, but like it 
10 
was not included into the agreement at least. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And are ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  And ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You aware you said previously you were not 
aware of the provisions of the Alienation of Land Act, but are you aware 
that those agreements for the sale of immovable property unlike other 
agreements do have to be reduced to writing in their terms? 
MS MEMELA:  For it to be valid? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So like you are saying now like I mean this might be 
20 
invalid like does not ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Like that differ from one way lawyer to another? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I would not think it differs from one lawyer 
to another, but I do not think we need to have a legal debate. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 118 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What – on some of these legal issues I think 
Ms Hofmeyr is asking so that you can give an answer based on what 
you know and if you do not know.  It is fine.  Part of the reason is that 
you are a lawyer.  So you might know, but you might not know.  Law is 
too wide.  So feel free to give what you understand to be the position. 
MS MEMELA:  I did say Chair to her like I mean earlier on that I do not 
know and that I am ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  No.  That is fine, but I am just clarifying so 
that you do not ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not wonder why some of the questions are 
legal.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair and then if we can move to the 
deposit that your mother was going to pay ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because my ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that Ms Hofmeyr.  So Ms Memela, 
can you tell me how it came about that you went to – how it came about 
that you concluded this agreement with Slipknot Investments (Pty) Ltd 
20 
represented by Ms Kwinana.  How did it come about?  How did this – 
what happened? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Chair, Ms Kwinana – of course like many people 
know her as like I mean the Chairperson of like our former Chairperson 
of SAAT like you do ...(intervenes). 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 119 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And like I mean I would – I can say now confidently so 
that like I mean she was not playing that role alone like as the 
Chairperson like she would play a role of like a sister advise like in 
terms of investment and stuff.  She is in that space of like I mean 
property development and like she would mention that okay this is what 
I am doing and like I mean if you want to invest like you could do that 
and do that. 
So like I mean we started talking about that and then I was 
interested in investing there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you talked about – when you had discussions 
that led to the signing of this agreement were the two of you quite 
close or not really? 
MS MEMELA:  Like we were like professional close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So she came to understand that you were 
looking at buying property and she told you about a property that was 
on the market. 
MS MEMELA:  That she was developing and - ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That she was developing? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  She is in a property development base like for 
quite some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 120 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you agreed on the price and then she said 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come to talk to my lawyers and then they prepare an 
agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  That is right Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know whether this agreement was actually 
prepared by the lawyers?  I am – I know when I say whether you know 
whether they prepared it.  You might say I do not know if they actually 
prepared it, but it came from them. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it come from them as far as you know? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  My understanding or what I had learnt was that they 
had been dealing with her properties and property development like I 
mean all the deeds of sale like were done by them.  So like I mean 
going like from this property to the other there will be just like I mean 
20 
entering like I mean details of like the next purchaser or like what 
investment and stuff.  So like I would say I believed it came from her 
lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Then just in relation to the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 121 of 188 
 
deposit for this property. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have established that that was not reflected 
in the written agreement ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understand your evidence to be there was 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  The intention ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A deposit of about half of the value that was 
going to be paid ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:  The intention.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just so I get your evidence correct.  Once 
your mother had concluded the agreement with Mr Ndzeku to sell her 
properties.  She was going to use the proceeds of that to assist you 
with the deposit. 
MS MEMELA:  To assist ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did Ms – did your mother then receive the 
proceeds from the sale to Mr Ndzeku which I understood was in about 
20 
2015 and then make it available for the deposit on this property? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  Like I mean it was made directly to the lawyers.  So 
that they can transfer to the lawyers that were responsible for the 
Bedfordview house. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 122 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  And then, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So who gave Mr Ndzeku the details about 
where to pay the money if your mother did not pay it? 
MS MEMELA:  If my mother did not pay it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She did not pay the deposit. 
MS MEMELA:  No.  She ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand your evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was that Mr Ndzeku rather than paying her 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  It shall be ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was going to pay you directly? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And he was going to pay to – did you say the 
transferring attorneys? 
MS MEMELA:  It - like I mean it was going to come from Mr Ndzeku to 
the Mbanjwa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Like – and then like from Mbanjwa to the 
transferring attorneys or registering attorneys.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  But like Mbanjwa was not responsible for the transfer of 
the Bedfordview property. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 123 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So once Mr Ndzeku was to pay for the property 
he purchased in the Eastern Cape he would just in a sense redirect that 
money straight to L Mbanjwa Attorneys. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And by the time you had found the Bedfordview 
house Cove Ridge was off the cards. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can I just understand the terms 
of your arrangement with your mother.  Was it a loan?  Were you going 
to be paying it back? 
MS MEMELA:  No.  It was a donation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now the cancellation of Cove 
20 
Ridge took place when you had found the Bedfordview house.  Is that 
right? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are still the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr, because I think you may have 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 124 of 188 
 
– you are almost through on this ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sale agreement.  What is strange with this agreement 
is what Ms Hofmeyr pointed out.  Namely although there is a price – 
purchase price.  There is no indication of when the purchaser would be 
obliged to pay it and whether it would be paid in instalments and it 
seems to me there is no indication that the agreement does not seem to 
say this is subject to getting a bond and so on. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you signed it where you aware of all of those 
10 
things? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  We ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with those things? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Like I went – browsed through ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And like I mean, because like they have been dealing 
with like I mean property development and using the same agreements 
and stuff.  My understanding from the contracts and legal point of view 
20 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  As much as I did say that like the Alienation of Land Act 
I mean I would not be aware of, but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 125 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  There might be like an agreement that like I mean 
provision of the agreement that is written down, but like I mean if the 
parties like in the same mind and the intention like whatever that like I 
mean you are agreeing upon.  Like I mean that is acceptable.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is – so you say you thought that whatever verbal 
agreement you may have had with the seller. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be fine. 
MS MEMELA:  It would have been fine, because like ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  We knew each other.  She knew I would not run away  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you say you did go through the sale 
agreement before signing it? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you see that at the end of it - that is clause 
8 the last sentence – do you see that it says? 
“No agreement to cancel, alter or add to this 
agreement shall be of any force or effect unless 
20 
signed by both the seller ...(intervenes).” 
MS MEMELA:  Both the seller ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  “ ... and the purchaser.” 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You saw that? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 126 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see the sentence of the same paragraph 
which says: 
“This agreement constitutes the entire contract 
between the parties.” 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the next one that says: 
“The purchaser has not in making this offer relied 
on any warranty or representation not contained 
herein.” 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You saw all of those things? 
MS MEMELA:  I may have not like I mean read like in what like 
applying my mind on the whole like I mean provision, but that I do know 
that like I picked up that like I may know cancellation or alteration 
would be done without the signature of the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that first sentence that says: 
“The entire contract ...” 
It means you cannot say there is another part of the 
agreement that is verbal. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I am not saying ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair.  I am not saying there is another part.  I am 
saying like there was an intention to pay a deposit ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 127 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
MS MEMELA:  As soon as like I mean the property ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Is sold and then like the money is like available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is just a very strange agreement of a property 
which is quite an important asset for most of us and at a quite high 
price, R2.8 million.  Where there is no indication as to when this will be 
10 
paid.  How it would be paid.  Okay.  Alright.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, just before the Chair’s latest 
comment you testified that it was understood that the deposit would be 
paid ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With the purchase – when the purchase of your 
mother’s properties went through.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The difficulty with that Ms Memela is that this 
agreement was signed – concluded in April 2015. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your had not met Mr Ndzeku by then yet? 
MS MEMELA:  Like remember like I mean the deposit was not like 
entirely dependent on Mr Ndzeku. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 128 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  I said like I mean my mother showed interest like I mean 
in selling like the property so that she can help me with the deposit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So it was your understanding that she 
was going to sell some property in the Eastern Cape? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was then going to form the basis of the 
deposit here? 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly.  So that I mean ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But that was not included in the agreement? 
MS MEMELA:  Not in the agreement, but like I mean during the 
10 
workshops like of the Supplier Development and stuff like I mentioned 
like to some of the BEE suppliers of like I mean the intention to sell the 
land if anyone is interested in stuff like that.  That is when then I 
mentioned to Mr Ndzeku I think around like May/June ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that would have facilitated you being able 
to get this property yourself.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is – sorry.  Repeat that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you were speaking to people at the Supplier 
Development Workshops ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To see if they were interested in buying your 
mother’s property. 
MS MEMELA:  Not people.  Like I mean certain individuals. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Like I mean BEE people.  Like I mean ...(intervenes). 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 129 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Especially – okay.  I do not know if you will understand, 
but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the whole audience you mean. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just some of the people. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Some of them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly.  So like I just wanted to explain to you that like 
I mean sometimes like when you meet a person coming from the same 
culture or same tribe as you.  Like I mean you get to talk like a lot and 
stuff like that and catch up and get to share certain like I mean 
information. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  I will make an example Chair.  That like maybe when you 
20 
walk into the lift and then you meet somebody and they say 
…(indistinct, African word).  You feel like okay you have met your 
brother or your sister and then you start talking and chatting and 
discussing like.  So it was not the whole audience. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  No and forgive me if that was the way my 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 130 of 188 
 
question came across. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am just trying to get the chronology right.  So 
you conclude an agreement in April 2015 with Ms Kwinana’s company, 
Slipknot Investment ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To buy a property worth 2.8 million.  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At that stage the intention is your mother’s 
going 
to 
try 
and 
sell 
some 
properties 
in 
the 
Eastern 
Cape 
10 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To assist you with a deposit on this property? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
You 
then 
go 
to 
Supplier 
Development 
Workshops in May 2015 ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you speak to some people at those 
workshops about the property that your mother is selling.  Is that right 
– correct? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, Chair.  Let me correct this part.  Like I mean it is 
not like I went to the workshop to talk about the property.  The property 
was just part of the discussion.  Like I mean I went to the workshop like 
for Supplier Development to introduce like BEE companies into the 
database and all that.  They can understand that. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 131 of 188 
 
Like I mean they are welcome to come and be added into a 
database.  So like I mean the discussion would like be added.  Like I 
mean during the discussion or maybe afterwards or so.  So I am not 
saying like I went to the workshop like I am – that is not the picture I 
am trying to paint.  That I went to the workshop like just to discuss the 
property. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  Ms Memela ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you are saying that at some stage or another 
while you were interacting with some individuals ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within the workshop ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  The – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And chatting.  The topic cropped up ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Then ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  One way or another. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Then there would be this topic.  For instance like I will 
make an example with Ms Sambo.  Like I mean we used to chat a lot 
about like I mean her joining ventures like with aviation companies and 
20 
then getting an office at like where at SAAT.  Like so that like she will 
be able to provide her services, but like I mean on the same note like I 
mean even if it is not the same time. 
Like I mean she would say okay you know like what I mean I 
am interested in venturing into oil or fuel like I mean and then like I 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 132 of 188 
 
mean transporting fuel from this to that and then she say like it makes 
a lot of money.  So like I mean you discuss like those kind of 
transactions with people and then like it depends like you – if you are 
interested like you want to embark on it or maybe like if it does not 
interest you. 
Then like you leave it.  So like I am trying to explain that.  
That like I mean the discussions were not like necessarily about 
property or what. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if any of the suppliers to whom you spoke at 
that workshop were interested in buying your mother’s properties in the 
10 
Eastern Cape. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then you would be able to conclude this 
transaction with Slipknot Investment.  Is that right? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I would have been.  Anybody including Ms Sambo I 
would have been. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as it so happened Mr Ndzeku was 
interested? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  One last thing before we leave the agreement.  
You said that there was an understanding working alongside this 
agreement.  Notwithstanding the clause that the Chair has taken you to.  
That there would be a purchase price paid at some time. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 133 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Did 
you 
have 
an 
understanding 
from 
Ms Kwinana what expectation she had in that regard?  When was she 
expecting it to be paid? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember.  Ja.  Like I said earlier. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was actually open ended? 
MS MEMELA:  It was an open – ja.  I do not ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm.  
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So she was going to sell a property of R2.8 
10 
million to you without clarity as to when she would receive the money 
for it? 
MS MEMELA:  Like it was not in the contract Chair.  You know and I 
think like I mean when she gets the chance to actually like I mean to be 
on this chair.  She will be to prove like I mean – show precedence that 
like I mean there are lots of other – of her other properties that like I 
mean she had used the same template and stuff. 
I understand like that maybe because of a certain act.  Like it 
should have been indicated.  You know ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  And I guess like I suspect also like because I do not 
remember very well, but I suspect that like maybe it may have not been 
indicated.  Like I mean the deposit, because we are not sure if like I 
mean my mother’s going to get a buyer during that time.  So like I was 
either going to like I mean rely on the bank or maybe take time or like I 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 134 of 188 
 
mean sell like I mean something else like I mean to cover here and 
there. 
I do remember in – I mentioned this during our meeting.  I do 
not know if it was with you or the Investigating Team that when I bought 
the Douglasdale property.  I did not mention that I will pay the deposit, 
but like I mean when it became available I paid it and then like I mean I 
had the property in Bloemfontein like for investment purposes in 2007. 
So like I mean those are the kind of things that like I mean 
you get interested in and like I mean investing in property.  So like I 
mean for me to go through this like detail by detail especially if you buy 
10 
it like from somebody you know and like I mean who you know that like 
I mean they will not maybe run away or maybe like they will not say – 
they will change their mind later on and say okay.  I am no longer 
selling property to you or something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and she is Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is Ms Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  What did I say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Advocate Hofmeyr. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think today you have been referring to me as 
Kate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You have been referring ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  Okay.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and I thought it was just once ...(intervenes). 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 135 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  I am sorry if – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, let us just talk about the 
cancellation of this agreement.  You indicated that once you had found 
the Bedfordview property you cancelled it.  There actually is not an 
entitlement under this agreement to cancel it.  Did you notice that? 
MS MEMELA:  There is no ...(intervenes)? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Entitlement to cancel. 
MS MEMELA:  To cancel.  Like I mean it does not like really have to be 
in the ...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  To cancel the contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is just that usually sellers ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Want to ensure that the purchasers are bound 
by the agreement.  Do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  I accept that ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  But ja.  Like I mean it does not necessarily mean that 
like because there is no cancellation clause like I mean you cannot 
20 
cancel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMYR:  That is certainly not what I was suggesting. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 136 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I was asking for you to confirm that there is not 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  An entitlement under the agreement for the 
purchaser to cancel it.  Do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  It is not here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you have to secure Ms Kwinana’s 
agreement to the cancellation? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I think we signed some documentation like I may 
ask for it and then like we will send it to you later. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Hofmeyr, clause 7 ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does give the – does seem to give the seller – does 
not the right to cancel if there is a breach. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Sorry, but I was saying from the position 
of the purchaser cancelling.  There was not a clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  From the purchaser? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because in this case it is Ms Memela who later 
cancels ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 137 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because she is buying the Bedfordview 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  I think Chair is correct ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Because I mean under eight as well it says: 
“No agreement to cancel or alter unless signed by 
both parties.” 
10 
So I am saying like there is a document that talks to the 
cancellation and like I will find that and I will send it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  We may have it ourselves.  I will draw 
you ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Is it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your attention to that in a moment when I get 
there. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the facts, if you can just help us with 
those, at some point did you approach Ms Kwinana about cancelling it? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Like I mean the – that is the discussion that should 
happen before you ask about like – ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was she willing to agree? 
MS MEMELA:  She was not difficult about it, because she understood 
that like it took longer.  Like I mean to get like to finalise that - this 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 138 of 188 
 
one.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did she also appreciate your having found the 
Bedfordview property and wanting to purchase that?  Did you discuss 
that with her? 
MS MEMELA:  I discussed that with her and then like I mean she 
actually said okay like I mean if we still continue like you can still use 
L Mbanjwa like I mean to get like I mean the payment and then we will 
use the – I remember the reference was her name or something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Are you aware that the money that 
Mr Ndzeku had committed to pay your mother for the purchase of the 
10 
properties was paid much later than you actually concluded your 
Bedfordview sale? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall when he paid the money? 
MS MEMELA:  I do not remember when the money was paid. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja, but like I mean it took longer.  Like I mean I think it 
took longer to finalise and then like for him to get the amount like to 
send to Mbanjwa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you have discussions with him about that? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Like he had discussions with my mother.  So like I – ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  With your mother? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right, because they concluded their agreement 
in 2015. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 139 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And he paid in May 2016. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right, but it was okay, because you had 
already cancelled the agreement once you had purchased the 
Bedfordview property. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to the cancellation that you agreed 
with Ms Kwinana.  You will find that in DD25A at page 397.  Is that the 
cancellation that you were referring to? 
MS MEMELA:  I think it is the one, but like I think there was some sort 
of an agreement attached – that was supposed to be attached to this 
one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  I will try and find it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we can just go through what this letter 
contains.  Can you tell us to whom it is addressed? 
MS MEMELA:  Attention Kwinana Consult or dear Ms Kwinana. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the title of it. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 140 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Formal Cancellation of Sale Portion 11 of Farm 925 
Cove Ridge East London. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you confirm that you prepared this 
letter? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I wrote the letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is that your signature at the bottom of the 
letter? 
MS MEMELA:  That is the signature. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And let us look at what you said in the first 
paragraph.  Can you read that into the record? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  “I refer to the abovementioned sale and 
confirm my intention to cancel the transaction as 
proclamation is taking longer than anticipated and I 
have since identified a residential property in 
Bedfordview that I am interested in buying.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did you mean when you referred to 
proclamation taking longer than expected? 
MS MEMELA:  Like I mean they were talking about like I mean certain 
things that like had to be approved and stuff.  I would not remember 
like I mean detail by detail. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because I thought your evidence previous was 
that what was taking long was your ability to get the deposit or the 
bond.  Is that not correct? 
MS MEMELA:  No, no, no.  Like I mean I did not say that like that 
there. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 141 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  What was taking longer it was because of the deposit.  I 
said like the transaction took longer than anticipated. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But once you found the Bedfordview property 
you were now going with it. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you go on and say in the second 
paragraph if you would read that into the record. 
MS MEMELA:  “Therefore this is a formal cancellation of the 
above transaction.  The deposit of which will be 
used on the sale of the aforementioned house in 
Bedfordview.  The monies that were paid to 
L Mbanjwa 
Incorporated 
in 
respect 
of 
this 
transaction should now be paid over to the seller’s 
attorneys being …(indistinct) with account number.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is the date of this letter? 
MS MEMELA:  It is 7 May 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You had purchased the property in Bedfordview 
in February 2016.  Had you not? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 142 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  There is a difference between purchasing and making an 
offer to purchase. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Huh-uh. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja.  So I did not purchase.  I made an offer to purchase 
around February. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and when it is accepted then you are 
bound by it.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Like I mean once it is accepted like you are bound it 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  But remember there is also a cooling off period 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  And stuff like that, but ja.  I also like I do not remember 
like the bond, ...(indistinct) when it was approved. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ja.  60 days. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It had to be secured within 60 days of 
February 2016 acceptance. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm.  So you had already committed on the 
Bedfordview property in February 2016. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 143 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you cancel this agreement only on the 
7 t h of May 2016 then? 
MS MEMELA:  Because like I mean there is no way that I was going to 
continue with both of them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then why did you not cancel it in 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  And it was taking like I mean longer also to – you know.  
Like I mean and I saw that like I mean I should focus on the one that is 
the residential property. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela, your testimony earlier was that 
10 
once you had identified Bedfordview property there was no way that 
you could afford 3.8 million plus 2.8 million and so you cancelled the 
Cove Ridge transaction.  Do you recall that evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  That is exactly what I am saying now.  That like I 
mean there is no way that I will continue with both the properties. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So like I mean I did mention Chair that like I mean I may 
not remember the dates and when like was it cancelled and like when – 
but I do know that like I made an offer to purchase in February.  Ja.  So 
I am not sure.  Like I mean if like you are getting my answers correct or 
20 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  I am.  Let me be clear about what I am 
struggling with.  Your previous testimony was once you had secured the 
arrangement for the Bedfordview property sale. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 144 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You could not continue with the Cove Ridge 
property transaction.  Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That occurred in February 2016.  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  The offer to purchase was done in February 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and accepted in February 2016. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is a valid agreement of sale 
10 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the Bedfordview property in February 2016. 
MS MEMELA:  2016.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your testimony earlier was once you had done 
that you cancelled the agreement on the Cove Ridge property.  Do you 
recall that evidence? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  Like I mean here it was cancelled.  Like here is the 
20 
letter.  I said to you like I will find something like that.  That talks to 
that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and we have ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  So like I mean your struggle is like now on the dates. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is precisely. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 145 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  That it was cancelled. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  H’mm. 
MS MEMELA:  So like I mean you – I do not know Chair if like she is 
expecting me to have cancelled like immediate in January or maybe 
that is the impression that I gave her when I responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just answer to the best of your recollection and 
knowledge. 
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is going to – she says that her – what she is 
struggling with are the dates.  Now you might or might not recall the 
10 
dates, but she appreciates that 2015 is quite some time back, but 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just do your best.  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr, do you want to repeat the question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I indicated in the lead, and it was the dates 
Chair, that were troubling me because I understood Ms Kwinana’s 
previous evidence to be once Bedfordview was secured Cove Ridge 
was no longer an option right and what I can’t understand is why 
20 
...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  No Chair ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I could finish my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let her finish Ms – just don’t forget what you wanted 
to say. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 146 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If, once the Bedfordview property had been 
secured and your previous evidence was, then there was no reason to 
continue with Cove Ridge, why did you wait until May of 2016 only to 
cancel the Cove Ridge transaction? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I did not – like maybe I must just like repeat again, 
like maybe my intention is not like she had interpreted my answer to 
be.  My answer I mean, we still cancelled like the Cove Ridge property 
and like I mean after I had identified the Bedfordview in February, you 
know, so I think like you know you are struggling between – with the 
10 
period between February and May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the period close to a year. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No it’s a matter of three month’s it’s the same 
year so it’s February 2016 to May of 2016 and the challenge for me – 
let me make it clear is that between February 2016 you had obligations 
under the Bedfordview property to pay R3.8 million to the sellers and at 
the same time you had an obligation to pay R2.8 million to Slipknot 
Investments and that persisted for three further months until you 
cancelled and I’d understood your previous evidence to be, you could 
not entertain two liabilities like that and that is why, once you’d 
20 
secured Bedfordview you cancelled Cove Ridge. 
MS MEMELA: Ja, Chair, like for me or maybe me and Ms Seaka we did 
not see any difference between cancelling when or – because I did 
notify her that like you see I’ve identified this and I think I’m going to 
be focusing on it.  So like it might happen that like we had agreed 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 147 of 188 
 
verbally and then we cancelled later on after three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The other reason why the date troubles me a 
bit, Ms Memela, is that it’s two days after the deposit was received 
from JM Aviation, are you aware of that? 
MS MEMELA:  I’m not aware of remember ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what is two days after receipt of the deposit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Chair at 397 this Slipknot Investments 
purchase agreement is cancelled on the 7 t h of May 2016, if you go back 
two pages in the file to page 395. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the records of the bank account of L 
Mbangwa Attorneys to whom Mr Ndzeku it is claimed, paid the deposit 
amount of R2.5 million and that you will see reflected in the fifth line on 
that page.  He paid that in on the 5 t h of May 2016, that was my 
reference to two days earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware that he’d paid it in two days 
earlier? 
MS MEMELA:  I was not aware until you – or like Andrew showed this 
20 
to me yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So had you been led to believe by your mother 
that the deposit had been paid earlier? 
MS MEMELA:  No, no she did not discuss that like I mean, the only 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 148 of 188 
 
interest that she showed Chair was that she was going to help me with 
the deposit and the deposit was going to be R1.5 million and then the 
remainder that was going to help with the legal fees together with my 
husband’s deposit and then like the remainder was also going to go to 
her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So do you have any understanding why Mr 
Ndzeku waited so long to pay that deposit for the transaction with your 
mother? 
MS MEMELA:  I think that – like the person will be in a right position to 
answer that, it will be Mr Ndzeku. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I’m just asking whether you have any 
knowledge about why he delayed until the 5 t h of May? 
MS MEMELA:  I have no knowledge, I don’t remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And if you just look at that fifth line on the 
page. 
MS MEMELA:  Which page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  395 you’ll see there the date of 5 May in the 
fifth line and it says under the first column, internet banking payment 
from and then you’ll see a description for the payment, do you see 
that? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Yes that’s what I mentioned earlier on like, Ms Kwinana 
was used as a reference. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, and it says, consulting Kwinana, there. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have any idea why it would say, 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 149 of 188 
 
consulting Kwinana? 
MS MEMELA:  Consulting Kwinana, I think maybe it was her consulting 
company I don’t know I think she will be the right person to answer but 
like my understanding like the reason why she was used as a reference 
is that like I was buying from her like her property and stuff and then 
now for Mbanjwa to pick up the deposit like was to highlight like I mean 
Kwinana is – remember they were her main lawyers all this time.  So 
like, that was the reason why. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I understand, possibly the reference to 
Kwinana, what I’m struggling with is consulting, do you have any idea 
10 
why consulting would be the description. 
MS MEMELA:  No I ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because this had nothing to do with consulting 
did it? 
MS MEMELA:  Of course it had nothing to do with consulting, I don’t 
know, between Kwinana and Mbanjwa, what is their relationship in 
terms of consulting or whatever but like I don’t want to answer on 
behalf of ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course, I was simply interested in whether 
you had any knowledge as to why it would be described as a consulting 
20 
payment. 
MS MEMELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the letter of cancellation that we talked about a 
few minutes ago at page 397 that you wrote to Slipknot Investments, 
said attention Kwinana Consult, what is that, is that a company, a firm 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 150 of 188 
 
belonging to Ms Kwinana or what was it? 
MS MEMELA:  I don’t remember Chair, I don’t remember I think like if I 
may ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would have known it at that time at lease. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I’m saying if I may maybe that’s what she said like I 
must refer it as like so that it’s in line I mean the reference to the 
lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if – so I’m wondering Ms Hofmeyr whether 
consulting Kwinana that appears there at page 395 is meant to say this 
is for consulting services or whether it refer to an entity.  I see that at 
10 
the top of the column it says description ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I take the point let me follow up, if I may, 
with Ms Memela about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let’s assume, for present purposes that there 
is an entity, Kwinana Consulting, this arrangement that your mother had 
with Mr Ndzeku had nothing to do with Kwinana Consulting did it? 
MS MEMELA:  No it didn’t. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when he paid the R2.5 million on the 5 t h of 
May I understand you regarded that as related to the purchase of 
20 
property agreement he’d entered into with your mother, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that too, had nothing to do with Kwinana 
Consulting? 
MS MEMELA:  It didn’t have anything to do with Kwinana Consulting 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 151 of 188 
 
but I mean, because they were the lawyers for her who had been 
helping her like I mean, they – apparently they had lots of  
…(indistinct) transactions that they were doing together.  So like I 
mean, they wanted – like she wanted them like to be able to pick up 
this specific transaction, so I think ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would she want them to associate this deposit 
with her? 
MS MEMELA:  Like – because like I mean ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because, as I understand it, it had nothing to do with 
her. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  It had nothing to do with her but like I mean, remember I 
was buying a property from her and that she had introduced me to L 
Mbanjwa Attorneys.  Yes so like I mean for them to able to pick up out 
of all their transactions and files and stuff they would know which one 
is that one because like I mean I remember ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry at the time that they made – they paid this 
money to L Mbanjwa and Associates, to the law firm the contract 
between yourself and this Slipknot had not been cancelled, is that 
right? 
MS MEMELA:  Like I mean, I’m looking at the letter now that letter, I 
20 
mean Ms Hofmeyr has just like showed me, it had been cancelled like 
two days before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes two days or three days before ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So yes, but is the position – had Mr Ndzeku or JM 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 152 of 188 
 
had they been told that they must pay the money into the lawyer’s 
account ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  Ja instead of Slipknot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they didn’t know about the Bedfordview property 
or did they, that is now Ndzeku? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja like I would assume like he did know or maybe he did 
not because like I’m not sure how much – what is it that they have 
discussed, him and my mother but like I do know, like I mean, he knew 
10 
that the purpose of that sale is to pay for my deposit as well ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair this is just a point that I want to make, 
not directly to Ms Memela but it’s related to the evidence of Mr Ndzeku 
who is coming on Monday to give evidence and the reason I raise it is 
because his lawyers are present today.  We had not, until today, still 
not received a statement or affidavit from Mr Ndzeku but we have had 
discussions in the course of the week and there was an indication that 
we would receive one in advance of his evidence.  We would be most 
grateful for that, time is running out, hopefully over the weekend but I 
20 
wanted to just highlight a particular aspect that we would request that 
they deal with in that affidavit because we haven’t been able to have 
interactions with Mr Ndzeku to this point.  You see the challenge is that 
this payment was not made by Mr Ndzeku, the payment, not from any 
personal account of his, it was made from the account of JM Aviation 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 153 of 188 
 
and so what I’d like to request that Mr Ndzeku do in his affidavit, is 
explain to us why the payment was made from JM Aviation and explain 
to us the tax treatment that was given to this payment in the records for 
SARS insofar as JM Aviation’s Tax Records are concerned.  So if that 
can just be taken note of so that it can be included in the affidavit.  Ms 
Kwinana, the Chair picked up on a point that I was going to make right 
at the end, which is your indication in your statement in response to Ms 
Sambo’s evidence was that this whole payment of the deposit had 
nothing to do with Mr Zwane or Ms Kwinana, we have gone through the 
facts and there is quite a pivotal role that Ms Kwinana has played in all 
10 
of this, do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  But like the payment has nothing to do with her, it’s not 
coming from her, nor Mr Zwane so that’s what I meant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You meant it didn’t come from them? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you accept that, but for Ms Kwinana’s 
involvement in this, the deposit would not have got to pay for your 
Bedfordview house? 
MS MEMELA:  No I don’t accept that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why not? 
20 
MS MEMELA:  Because, like I mean, she was not the one who bought 
the land. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but you had to cancel the agreement with 
her and Slipknot Investments in order for the deposit that was going to 
be paid to be redirected, did you not? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 154 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  I did but, like I mean Chair it’s not coming from her 
personal capacity or maybe business capacity, so that’s what I mean, I 
mean like, they had nothing to do with my deposit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the sense that she was not a payer of the 
deposit. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes it was not coming from her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But she did forsake a binding purchase 
agreement with you in order for the deposit to be re-directed to the 
Bedfordview house correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes we cancelled but it’s not like I mean, she actually 
10 
was going to pay for my – like the property that I was planning to buy 
from the Eastern Cape like coming from here.  So like what I meant 
when I was responding to Ms Sambo is that, like I mean, this had 
nothing to do with Mr Zwane or Ms Kwinana because like I mean, how 
she had put it in her affidavit it was as if they were going to pay for me 
and Chair, like I mean, I just like I mean, wanted to kill that narrative 
because like even now Ms Hofmeyr is still going through like the 
property and I think I have responded enough and I did promise that I 
will send the supporting documentation.  Like shortly like after like 
Monday to prove like my state.  So I’m more interested now in the link 
20 
between my property and the component tender, the final component 
tender because like she was there, she was talking about the final 
component tender like when you came to this one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: Yes, let’s go to what Ms Sambo said because 
you were responding to what she’d said in her affidavit.  You’ll find that 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 155 of 188 
 
in the files on your left-hand side Ms Memela because we need to pick 
up Ms Sambo’s affidavit so it’s in Exhibit DD18 and you’ll find it at page 
35.  Ms Memela if you look at the chair next to you, there are a number 
of files there and amongst them is the bundle containing Ms Sambo’s 
evidence. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You’ll need to pick up Exhibit DD18 and open it 
at page 35. 
MS MEMELA:  Page 35? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, do you have it? 
10 
MS MEMELA:    Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The relevant paragraph is paragraph 121 there 
Ms Sambo states in her affidavit: 
“I cannot recall the exact date but it could have been in 
2016, Advocate Memela verbally told me that she wanted 
to purchase a house and that she’d put an offer in on a 
property in Bedfordview.  The offer was declined as her 
salary was not sufficient.  Advocate Memela then 
informed me that Ms Kwinana and Mr Zwane were going 
to make a plan for her.” 
20 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:  I see that paragraph. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And it is not Ms Sambo’s allegation there that 
Ms Kwinana or Mr Zwane were going to pay for the property, do you 
accept that? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 156 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  It is not – are you saying it is not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is not saying that Ms Kwinana and Mr Zwane 
were going to pay for your property, do you agree? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes, like I mean ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is simply saying that they were going to make 
a plan for you, do you accept that? 
MS MEMELA:  But like I mean that’s a …(indistinct) statement so I 
...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So I don’t know if you say I must accept what do you 
10 
mean? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I’m saying, I want us to be clear about what 
this means and your understanding.  Is your understanding that she 
was alleging here that Ms Kwinana was going to pay something to that 
property? 
MS MEMELA:  Chairperson remember, like I mean, I’m not the author of 
this affidavit ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No she’s asking your understanding of what Ms 
Sambo is saying here. 
MS MEMELA: Ja I said to her, my understanding was like when she 
20 
said Mr Zwane and Ms Kwinana, like, we’re going to make a plan, like I 
mean, maybe she meant that the money was going to paid by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS 
MEMELA: 
 
Exactly 
so 
like 
I 
mean 
also 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You interpreted the plan? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 157 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  I interpreted the plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To mean, to include paying for you? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes so that’s why when she’s asking like is this my 
understanding, I’m saying I cannot interpret for the author, but my 
understanding when I was reading it, that’s exactly how I understood it 
but I mean the – like I mean, she also added that the offer was 
declined.  Here it could also be proven that the offer from …(indistinct) 
was not declined.  So like I mean, I’m just like trying to balance things, 
I mean it does not necessarily mean because like Ms Sambo stated it, 
it’s correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No indeed, what we seem to have clarified is 
that Ms Kwinana certainly did not, herself pay over money for the 
purchase of your property, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What she did do though, Ms Memela is move 
from a situation in which you owed her R2.5 million ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:  I owed her? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes well you owed Slipknot ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  R2.8 million isn’t it or R2.5 million? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  R2.8 million apologies, R2.8 million you 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s in terms of the sale agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: Yes, you owed her R2.8 million in terms of the 
sale agreement and then she agreed to forsake the R2.8 million that 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 158 of 188 
 
you owed her and have the month that might have come to her got to 
you to purchase the Bedfordview house, is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  No it’s not correct Chair and I refuse to legitimise Ms 
Hofmeyr’s perception because like once I said ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me say she’s giving you a chance to refute 
that or put a different perspective or to put your side of your version. 
MS MEMELA:  Exactly Chair that’s where I’m going, that like I mean it 
seems like she’s pushing a certain narrative and I think like at the end 
of the day today you will know exactly where she wants to go with it but 
...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no Ms Memela, Ms Hofmeyr is an Evidence 
Leader in the Commission, she is entitled and actually she’s obliged to 
ask questions that will probe and try and establish the truth.  The rules 
of the Commission make that plain, she’s not necessarily – if you look 
at other witnesses that she has dealt with she does exactly the same.  
So she’s obliged to ask questions with a view to establishing exactly 
what happened, what the position is.  So please don’t read into that, 
any personal motives all she’s doing is just her job but you are free to 
say, that approach to this issue is not justified because of these facts 
that I’m placing before the Commission.  So you put your perspective 
20 
fully ja. Okay alright. 
MS MEMELA:  The concern then Chair that I have like with her 
questioning style, I understand like you’re saying I mean she is 
supposed to be leading evidence and I mean like when you twist the 
question to sound like something else instead of what I’m supposed to 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 159 of 188 
 
understand to say because I owed Ms Kwinana R2.8 million, like when 
you’re talking about owing somebody – maybe our interpretation is not 
the same it will be like maybe she had loaned me some money and stuff 
we are talking about the deed of sale that could be cancelled.  Yes like 
I mean the cancellation clause or maybe the entitlement as she had 
said it was not there but like I mean I’m just concerned about how she 
had – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that’s fine, I think the thrust of her question 
was, there was an agreement that you had with Ms Kwinana’s company. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of that agreement you were supposed to buy 
her property and pay her R2.8 million and I think – she didn’t say this 
but I think it’s implied, she was entitled to insist that this agreement 
stands, you must pay but she was prepared to say, okay let’s cancel 
this agreement because you want to buy property elsewhere.  Okay but 
I don’t want to ask the question for her, I’m just giving you my 
understanding of her question. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay I understood it that way Chair because I mean she 
was reading from Ms Sambo’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, alright. 
20 
MS MEMELA:  So that’s why I said like I will not legitimise what Ms 
Sambo had said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  And like I mean, my understanding of her statement is 
like – of her question is like, she is trying to collaborate what Ms 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 160 of 188 
 
Sambo has said, I may be wrong but like I’m saying that is not what like 
what it was meant, I mean I did not owe Ms Kwinana any money other 
than what was agreed upon for the purchase of the sale which was 
cancelled later.  So like I mean, this statement left by Ms Sambo to say 
like Ms Kwinana and Mr Zwane will make a plan does  not really 
collaborate or justify what she had said here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that unless Ms Kwinana agreed 
to cancel the Slipknot investment purchase you would not have been 
able to buy the Bedfordview house? 
MS MEMELA:  Like, had she refused? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Then what will be her reason for refusing? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That’s not my question I’m asking whether you 
accept that if she hadn’t agreed to cancel the Slipknot agreement she 
had with you, you would not have been able to purchase the 
Bedfordview house? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes I wouldn’t continue with the Bedfordview house. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Memela at the time that Mr 
Ndzeku or JM Aviation paid this R2.5 million into the attorney’s 
account, that was at 5 May 2016, you were a Member of Exco of SAAT 
20 
is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:  2016? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  No I became the Member of Exco I think at the 2017 
when it was announced, like I said like earlier on Chair, like I was the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 161 of 188 
 
minute taker or company secretary for Exco of SAAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did misunderstand that then, I apologise I 
thought you said when the submission was placed before Exco, this is 
the submission in relation to the final components tender you had been 
a member that had agreed with the submission made by CFST, did I 
have that wrong? 
MS MEMELA:  I said I had signed and – like I mean I had signed and 
supported the CFST as the HOD Supply Chain Manager. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as HOD for Supply Chain Management you 
didn’t hold a position on Exco? 
10 
MS MEMELA:  At Exco ja. like I mean at that time like it was just GM’s. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right apologies and you weren’t a GM you were 
a HOD. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I’ve understood that now, so let me correct that 
at the time that he paid R2.5 million that was going to be used for your 
property you were only the HOD of Procurement at SAAT, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at that time the decision on the bids for the 
final components tender had not yet been concluded, is that correct, it 
20 
was still open? 
MS MEMELA:  At what date can you repeat I’m trying to remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, so he pays on the 5 t h of May and just to 
help you, it was on the 9 t h of May that the Board decided, finally to 
award it to JM Aviation and AAR.  So at the time that he paid for the 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 162 of 188 
 
property the decision had not yet been taken on that tender, do you 
accept that? 
MS MEMELA:   I accept that but like I mean if you, like I mean Chair, I 
understand the corporate governance I’m sure like the pack, the Board 
pack had already made its way to the Board like looking on the dates, 
like I mean the pack should make it to the Board like seven days before 
the Board Meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Unfortunately that didn’t occur in this case 
because the BAC meeting only took place on the 6 t h of May, the day 
after he paid the R2.5 million. 
10 
MS MEMELA:  Okay, ja so I’m trying to understand like the BAC and 
the deposit where is the link? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I’m asking a question of fact Ms Memela, at 
the time that he paid the R2.5 million the Board had not yet decided 
who to award the contract to, correct? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja like based on the dates of the Board resolution. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, and also on the date that that property or 
that amount was paid to be used for your property, JM Aviation was 
negotiating the sale price on the GPU’s with SAAT, was it not? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes which was already decided by the Board. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No it wasn’t actually because what had 
happened was, on the 26 t h of April the first e-mail came from Mr Aires 
saying, we’ll offer R225 000 for the GPU’s. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that was on the 26 t h of April and about a 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 163 of 188 
 
week and a bit later on the 5 t h of May that’s when the R2.5 million was 
received and thereafter the Board meets and then the final decision is 
made on the sale price, do you accept those facts? 
MS MEMELA:  I don’t know Chairperson like because I’m trying to 
understand ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you don’t understand – if you don’t remember the 
dates you can say you don’t remember the dates. 
MS MEMELA:  No, no I do Chair I do remember the dates, like what I 
don’t understand is the mentioning like the deposit and the GPU’s and 
the component, she just like rightfully reminded me like the proposal to 
10 
SAAT CEO was made on the 26 t h of April and if you check like that 
proposal and that e-mail is not addressed to me it’s addressed to the 
Acting CEO and the Acting CEO is responding to the – to Jules and I 
think like he’s stating that he’s going to follow this and that and that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do you want to repeat your question?  You just 
answer what you know.  The question.  If you do not know, you do not 
know.   
MS MEMELA:   Chair I might remember like what happened, but like I 
mean I am worried like as I said earlier on before we started, that I do 
not want to say yes or no on something that like later on I will have to 
20 
work so hard to get myself out of.  Because like I mean  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I understand that but that is why I am 
saying to you where if you do not know, where if you do not remember 
you just say you do not remember.  If you think it is a particular answer 
but you are not sure, feel free to say I think that is the answer but I am 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 164 of 188 
 
not sure, so you do not need to commit yourself to something that you 
are not sure about – to an answer that you are not sure about, but you 
just need to answer to the best of your knowledge and ability and to the 
best of your recollection.  Okay? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that alright?  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So, just back to the 5 t h of May is the date on 
which the R2.5 million is paid.  That was about a month and a bit 
before you were charged with negotiating the sale price on the GPU’s 
with JM Aviation.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Like I mean, I was instructed like with other colleagues 
of mine, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, we will come to that in a moment.  Ms 
Memela you have given an explanation in your statement to this 
Commission about this transaction and you have indicated in that 
statement that you regard there is been no conflict of interest in so far 
as you were the recipient of this 2.5 million. Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can you explain to us the basis on which you 
say there is no conflict of interest if you receive 2.5 million from a party 
20 
who SAAT is contracting with? 
MS MEMELA:   No, I did not receive like I mean from the party.  It was 
coming from my mother, so there is a difference, it is not like I mean 
there were paying me from their pockets, like I mean just like I mean, 
yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 165 of 188 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   They did pay from their pocket; the transaction 
was JM Aviation paying in to L Mbangwa  Attorneys  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, they were paying for like I mean for the land that 
they were purchasing.  So like I mean, when I stated that like there was 
I did not see anything untoward Chair, and the fact that like I mean I 
did not see any conflict of interest.  I was still responding to their 
question during our meeting when they said like I mean, did you not 
think there was a conflict of interest.  And I said like from where I was 
sitting, like I mean like in my capacity as the HOD like there was no 
conflict of interest, because I did not sit in the Evaluation Team or the 
10 
people that were making decisions to say I am awarding this tender to 
you.  So that is where I was coming from with the conflict of interest. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, its – as I understand your position, there 
is no conflict of interest if you are not involved in the bodies making 
the decisions.  Is that correct?  
MS MEMELA:   It will be my understanding Chair, I may be wrong, but 
like all I am saying is like if the decision or maybe whatever transaction 
has absolutely nothing to do with SAAT or like I mean it is something 
that is outside like and for me I would not be taking a decision or 
making that decision to award that certain supplier, like for me it did 
20 
not fall under conflict of interest.  Ja you see maybe if there was a 
business that we were going to conduct together, like in the side, 
instead of like I mean them buying the property from my mother like 
that will be something different.  So that was my understanding.  And I 
even made an example because like I even said like I do not want to 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 166 of 188 
 
mention any names, but like I mean there were certain people that like I 
mean negotiated with JM, like for other projects although they were the 
Chairperson of SAAT at that time, but like I mean there were 
negotiating for other projects.  I did say that in my statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Were you aware of the terms of the conflict of 
interest policy that SAAT had at the time in 2016? 
MS MEMELA:    I think like I may have browsed through but like I mean 
I do not remember if I read it like during the time when I was buying my 
property, like I mean Chair, what I did like was to separate the two, like 
I mean the property versus the tenders, and I even said that like I mean 
10 
when we were discussing this, that if I had been like I mean the one 
who had said okay, let us award to JM and AAR, then like it will be 
seen as that conflict of interest.  Then I would be expected to declare 
for conflict of interest.  But like I mean it was not my decision to award 
to AAR.  And then also, it was not my decision to sell the GPU’s to JM 
for Swissport.  So that is where then like I mean my understanding of 
like I did not see any conflict of interest.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.  My question was did you know the terms 
of the conflict of interest policy that operated at SAAT at the time? 
MS MEMELA:   No, I do not remember now. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You do not remember whether you did know it, 
or you did not know it at the time? 
MS MEMELA:   I did not know it at that time, maybe I did not even have 
a copy at that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   How would you then know what interests you 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 167 of 188 
 
had to declare? 
MS MEMELA:   Like it is a common knowledge like I mean Chair, like I 
mean if you enter into a certain agreement with maybe a supplier for 
something that is involving the company that you are working for.  Then 
like I mean for instance if I open a company outside like with somebody 
and then like they come and tender and then like when that decision is 
to be made to award to that person, then I am sitting in the decision 
making, then like I would be able to say okay I actually know these 
people, and like I mean I will recuse myself or yes something like that 
is my understanding. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you think the head of procurement at SAAT 
should familiarise themselves with the conflict of interest policy? 
MS MEMELA:    Yes, like to a certain extent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why only to a certain extent? 
MS MEMELA:   For instance like I mean I do know like from the risk 
and compliance Chair, that like when you register a company and stuff 
like there is a certain form that you fill that like I mean you are opening 
a business outside, especially if, like maybe some of the services or 
maybe goods like could clash with what is like I mean the services of 
SAAT or like the company that you work for.  So, like that is my 
20 
understanding.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela let us go to the conflict of interest 
policy that applied at the time.  You will find it at DD25A and you will 
need to go to the back to page.  Let me give you the first page of it, 
436. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 168 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:   436. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   436 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   First thing I just want to highlight if I may 
about this document Chair.  Is that it is the Group Conflict of Interest 
Policy for South African Airways SOC Management in general 
employees (recommended to be adopted to SAA subsidiaries).  There is 
whole debate in relation to the GPU as to which applicable policy was 
applying.  I understand we were not at that debate here because this 
10 
was the Group Policy that would have applied to SAAT. 
MS MEMELA:   We will have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes 
MS MEMELA:   We will have  ...(intervenes).   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will have a  ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:   I will raise what he has  ...(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh all right I look forward to it Ms Memela.  
Let us go to page 442.  Clause 7 there starts Provisions of Conflict of 
interest.  Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It says at 7.1: 
“Prohibited use of position.  SAA employees shall 
not 
use 
or 
seek 
to 
use 
their 
positions 
or 
employment with SAA to: 
• Gain 
direct 
or 
indirect 
benefits 
for 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 169 of 188 
 
themselves or their family members.“ 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that you would unlikely have 
interacted with Mr Ndzeku or met him but for the Supply Development 
workshops at SAAT.   
MS MEMELA:   Okay can you repeat that.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, was it the fact that SAAT was conducting 
Supplier Development workshops that put you into contact with 
Mr Ndzeku? 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes like I mean like I said Chair earlier on that like I 
mean there I met Mr Ndzeku through these workshops and I would not 
have met him maybe like I mean to discuss these but like what I want to 
add is the fact that it could have been any other like BEE supplier who 
was interested in buying the property.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.  But it is a product of your position in 
SAAT that you had access to Mr Ndzeku, correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what this provision says is that employees 
may not use their positions to gain a direct or indirect benefit for 
20 
themselves or their family members, do you accept that you received a 
direct benefit from Mr Ndzeku in form of the 2.5 million Rand. 
MS MEMELA:   It cannot be direct like I mean he was paying for the 
land.  Yes, so like you could say it is indirect.  But like I have mean 
Chair with regards to these as it says at the beginning of the page, 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 170 of 188 
 
recommended to be adopted by SAA subsidiaries.  This is the first time 
like I mean I see this like for SAAT.  That is why I said like I am going 
to – yes, like I am going to raise that, because like I mean I have not 
seen this one, like I mean what we have at SAAT is – what I know is the 
delegation of authority like I mean you know all these other 
documentation,  but like I mean, I guess like I mean if it was not 
recommended to be adopted by SAA I do not know, like I mean, is there 
a documentation that proves that it was adopted by SAAT? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela we will look for it.  Let us assume  
...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:   You do not have it now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That it did apply.  Right.  Then do you think 
that your acceptance of the 2.5 million Rand was in breach of clause 
7.1. 
MS MEMELA:   Acceptance? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   When you say acceptance like I mean it is as if Chair 
like I mean it was a money paid to me by a supplier, and I am saying 
like I mean, that was the payment for the property that was bought.  So, 
like I mean, and also I find it difficult to respond  ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is the point that you seek to make and have sought 
to make for some time, this – that payment was supposed to be paid to 
your mother.  
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was just a matter of convenience to say since your 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 171 of 188 
 
mother was going to pass it on to you, Ndzeku or JM could well just pay 
it to Mbangwa Attorneys. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But you are saying that as far as you are 
concerned, it was money that they were paying to Mbangwa Attorneys 
on behalf of your mother. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes.  Like but like I mean for me, for my purchase, for 
the purchase of my house ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to avoid a situation where they would pay to 
your mothers account and then she would have to pay it to Mbangwa. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the point you are making or not really? 
MS MEMELA:   That is the point I am trying to make Chair, because like 
I mean, how Ms Hofmeyr is putting the question it is as if like I mean I 
had benefited from JM through like I mean some payment that they 
received from SAAT.  And like I mean to JM and then to me.  So like I 
understand that you trying to highlight the conflict of interest and stuff 
like but you even said that if a direct benefit, and I said like it is an 
indirect benefit because like it was not coming from them direct to me.   
It was to my mother and then like to pay for my property.  So like I – 
20 
and then she said like with the other part that I am concerned with 
Chair is that she had said let us assume that it was adopted by SAAT 
and I am saying like I mean this is the first time I see this document.  
So like I mean responding on the assumption would be quite difficult, 
so like I mean this is the part where I would say I cannot respond 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 172 of 188 
 
where like you are talking assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no the point you made about whether it was 
adopted – this document was adopted by SAAT is a legitimate point and 
they will look into it as I understand Ms Hofmeyr to establish whether it 
was adopted or not, am I right?  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair, I must state it was my 
understanding that it was.  I do not have the document before me.  I 
have asked our investigators to obtain it so that we can clear this up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But I did not want to put it without the 
10 
document so we will look for that.  Then if you go down the page to 
7.3.1. it says: 
“SAA employees shall refuse gift, hospitality or 
other benefits that could influence their judgment or 
performance of obligations under this policy.” 
Do you see that?  
MS MEMELA:    Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you think it is incumbent upon employees 
of State-Owned Enterprises to refuse benefits that might have a effect 
on the influencing their judgment. 
20 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, like I mean benefits that will influence the 
judgement when you are in a decision-making position.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You always tack it on to a decision-making 
position.  Is that your clarification?  
MS MEMELA:   Remember like I mean it will affect your judgement and 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 173 of 188 
 
like I mean your reasoning and how you apply your mind if you were to 
take a decision in that certain point.  So like I mean if the decision has 
already been made and there is absolutely nothing I can do to change it 
like for instance in the case of ground power units, so like I mean it 
will, I would not agree that it affects the judgement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree with the principle. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes with the principal Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But what you are saying is as far as you are 
concerned what is written here would apply if the employee concerned 
would have the power to make a decision  ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MEMELA:   He has a mandate to make a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that is the point you are making? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes Chair, and then I made an example of the ground 
power unit that like the decision was made from the Board and like 
based on a contract between SAA and Swissport, for reasons known to 
SAA.  And also like on the component tender, like on the final one, the 
decisions were made by the Board.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Well let us move then if we may to the ground 
power units and your role in relation to their sale.  Chair I would like to 
20 
start that if we may at DD25A, and I would like to look at the relevant 
provision of the contract that dealt with this and you will find that at 
page 316. 
MS MEMELA:   You said DD – page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   316. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 174 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, got it.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  This is an extract of the 
agreement between SAA and Swissport.  Are you familiar with that 
agreement?  
MS MEMELA:   Like I saw the full agreement when I was fighting my 
case at CCMA.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you see the clause related to the SAAT 
sale before that? 
MS MEMELA:   The clause like relating to the GPU’s? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
10 
MS MEMELA:   No, like I mean the one that was sent Chair by 
procurement at SAA it had no provision that talks about the GPU’s.  
The only time that I got to know about, is when like I mean, Shaiyele 
was raising the fact that he was not happy with selling all twelve, like 
he was prepared to sell seven GPU’s and then like I mean the acting 
CEO Mr Malola Phiri sent him this.  I am not sure where he got it. He 
may have gotten it like from SAA.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So I do want to go back to the agreement you 
just referred to that had a blank space for the supplier, I will come to 
that in a moment, but I just want to confirm my understanding.  At some 
20 
point in the sale of the GPU’s, did you look at clause 8.1 and 8.2 that 
appear on this page? 
MS MEMELA:    At the sale, like I mean or are you saying like from my 
involvement with to negotiate the proposal that was put in place. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 175 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, like I mean I did look into it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So, let us look at what the clause 
says. Well it is two clauses: 8.1 and 8.2.  Could you read both of those 
into the record please? 
MS MEMELA:   Okay 8.1   
“As part of the continuous improvement of its triple 
BEE and promoting the governments development 
agenda, the handling company will sub-contract 
some of its services or enter into agreement with 
51% black-owned companies that may, that have a 
10 
representation of all either of the women, youth, 
disabled persons and military veterans for the 
purchase of equipment required as part of its 
investment on the agreement.” 
And then 8.2  
“The handling company agrees to purchase and or 
arrange purchase of old recently acquired surplus 
SAAT GPU’s at current book value, fair market 
value or other such evaluation as mutually agreed.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And just to be clear, is it your understanding 
20 
that the handling company there is Swissport South Africa? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, that is the understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, so Swissport South Africa, just to read it 
in: 
“Agrees to purchase or arrange purchase of all 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 176 of 188 
 
recently acquired by its surplus SAAT GPU’s at 
current book value, at fair market value or other 
such valuations as mutually agreed.” 
Correct.  And you did consider that at the time that you were 
tasked with the negotiation of the sale after the Board had approved.  
MS MEMELA:   After the Board had approved. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right.  I mentioned that I did want to take you 
to another agreement because you indicated in your statement that you 
10 
had had some interaction with a prior agreement when Mr Peter had 
supplied it to you.  Would you mind going to page 291 of the same 
bundle DD25, 291, and tell me if that is the agreement you were 
referring to? 
MS MEMELA:   Two? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   291. 
MS MEMELA:   I do not remember Chair.  I am not sure like this if this 
is your team like they found this from my e-mail because like what I 
said like on my statement is that like when Advocate Peter sent it to me 
like I did not even look into it, because like he had already taken over 
20 
like the Acting as the Chief Procurement Officer of SAA, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No I fully understand that Ms Memela, then let 
me just ask you some questions not based on whether you saw it at the 
time or not, but what you make of it.  If you go over the page to 292, 
you will see there that there is a recordal there at the top, whereas, do 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 177 of 188 
 
you see that? 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It says Whereas the carrier that is a reference, 
you will go over the page to Swissport South Africa.  It says  
“The carrier was carrier awarded various ground-
handling services, sorry the carrier is SAA.  SAA 
awarded various ground-handling services to the 
handling company, that is a reference to Swissport 
South Africa, on 31 July 2012 for a five year period 
approved by the SAA Board in respect of a 
10 
particular tender with a number. 
(b) Due to various circumstances the terms and 
conditions 
of 
the 
contract 
and 
service 
level 
agreement, commencement date was agreed as 
1 January 
2016 
for 
a 
period 
of 
five 
years 
collectively.” 
 
Do you see that? 
MS MEMELA:    Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Memela we had some evidence yesterday 
that I think some of us had some difficulty wrapping our minds around 
20 
because what had happened in relation to this Ground-Handling 
Agreement at SAA was that there had been a tender in 2012.  Swissport 
South Africa had been awarded it for five years from 2012.  Then no 
agreement was concluded.  2012, 2013, 2014, and then in 2016 they 
are awarded another agreement for five years starting on the 1 s t of 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 178 of 188 
 
January 2016.  Without any tender process having been followed prior 
to that.  Would your view be that that was inconsistent with 
procurement requirements? 
MS MEMELA:    You see now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What do I see Ms Memela?  
MS MEMELA:   You see  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I hear what Ms  ...(intervenes).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That was one of my nicest questions.  I don’t 
understand it all, but so be it.  Yes. 
MS MEMELA: You I may state my view, like and it might agree with Ms 
10 
Hofmeyr, and stuff like and somebody else might come back, but like 
remember like in this I do not have I mean the full background of the 
Swissport, like I mean from 2012 I will still at DBSA.  So, I was not at 
SAA like so when all these things were discussed and stuff like, but  
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    You are free to talk about what you have personal 
knowledge of. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly, without being seen as saying people have 
committed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she is asking because you – 2015, 2016, you 
20 
were Head of Procurement. So that may be the reason and therefore 
you will be familiar with the requirements for procurement.  
MS MEMELA:   Okay, so your question Ms Hofmeyr is if I was in the 
shoes at SAA what would I regard this arrangement.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, or this was an arrangement at SAAT. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 179 of 188 
 
The Chair is absolutely correct with respect. You were the Head of 
Procurement at SAAT.  So what I am interested in is your view as to 
whether an agreement entered into on the 1 s t  of January 2016 for five 
years, that is awarded to a ground-handling company that is not 
preceded by any tender process, would be compliant with procurement 
law as you know it? 
MS MEMELA:   Chair, can I not respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is your difficulty? 
MS MEMELA:   You know why, remember earlier on I did mention that 
at SAAT I did not apply 30% set aside. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MEMELA:   And here, there is 30% set aside.  So to talk on 
something that I was not like I mean part of the negotiation, maybe I 
think like my challenge is coming from there, but like of course I do not 
have any dispute in terms of saying like I mean of course when you 
running a tender you have to like I mean follow all these elements; 
competitive, transparency, fairness, like I mean giving like I mean the 
bidders a chance.  But like I mean remember like there are certain 
deviations that are allowed, by the PFMA but also like I mean the SCM 
policy, so like I mean something may have happened that I am not 
20 
aware of, that is why I am saying, like I mean, I do not want to commit 
to Ms Hofmeyr  ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So, you saying that you do not have all the 
facts? 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly, you understand?  So like I mean, I do not want 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 180 of 188 
 
to assume what happened because like I mean I do not have the full 
facts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes, I understand that. Chair we are at 15:59. 
I have embarked upon the GPU aspect.  There is still the components 
aspect.  I certainly will need some time to do that and Mr Ndzeku’s 
legal representatives have already been informed that we may have to 
have gone over today’s evidence to Monday with Ms Memela, so it 
would be my suggestion that we do adjourn and we return at 10:00 
might also enable Ms Memela to bring those further documents that she 
indicated she had in relation to the sales, and then we can continue 
10 
with the evidence then  ...(intervenes). 
MS MEMELA:    But Chair, don’t I  ...(intervenes).   
CHAIRPERSON:    Ms Memela h’mm. 
MS MEMELA:    Don’t I have a right like I mean to be asked if I am 
available Monday what if I am in Western Cape? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is what I am about to ask you. 
MS MEMELA:   Exactly because I thought  ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:    She is not the one to ask you, I am the one to ask 
you. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes, I was going to ask that Chair because my 
20 
understanding like I did say in my response like which I response, like 
which I think was read loud that some of these decisions were like 
taken by the Board and I do not see why I should go in full detail in 
terms of like I mean, understanding why the Board had taken certain 
decisions and stuff like for instance, I made a reference to MOU, that 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 181 of 188 
 
was a Board matter, I made a reference like I mean to GPU’s, that was 
a Board matter like and then, AAR/JM final contract that was a Board 
decision, so like I mean, if it is 16:00, can we not wrap up, and  
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well  ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:   I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No, no. It is legitimate for you to say if there is a 
chance you would prefer it if we could wrap up. That is legitimate for 
you to say that. 
MS MEMELA:   I would appreciate that Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We just need to assess how much time is necessary 
for Ms Hofmeyr to complete and then of course we must have regard to 
our availability and your availability obviously you suggest that you are 
available for us to continue beyond 16:00 for purposes of wrapping up, 
but of course if in any event we might not finish, there might not be 
much benefit in continuing today if you are going to come back anyway, 
so that might be another issue to look at.  With regard to what you may 
be asked and what you may not be asked, one can only take that on a 
case by case basis, as questions get asked.  You might be able in 
regard to some questions to say because you were not involved in the 
20 
taking of that decision, you are not able to throw light on that. 
MS MEMELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that would be perfect, but it may be that you 
might not be asked on the basis that you were part of decision making 
but because you occupied a certain position you would know whether 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 182 of 188 
 
taking that decision in certain circumstances was in accordance with 
policies of the company that kind of thing, so you could be asked that.  
So, you said Ms Hofmeyr you would still need quite some time because 
the other part that you have not touched  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed, the bad news Chair, is that I am on 
page 17 of 31 pages of notes.  So, there is almost no prospect we 
would complete today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That might need what about three hours? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am optimistic, two hours or thereabout. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two hours. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Maybe a bit more depending on the 
questioning and of course your questioning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, it seems suitable for us to reconvene on 
Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And for Monday otherwise the plan was to have 
Mr Ndzeku. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed, but we anticipated a potential runover 
here so Mr Ndzeku is scheduled both for Monday and Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, I am not worried too much to taking into 
that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Memela, we have done it quite frequently in 
the past in this Commission that we sit beyond normal hours where to 
do so would help to finish the witness’s evidence so that the witness 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 183 of 188 
 
does not have to come back.   
MS MEMELA:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But sometimes when one looks at the amount of time 
that must – of time that is necessary one is able to say we will not be 
able to finish and therefore another day must be arranged.  So, from 
what Ms Hofmeyr is saying it is – she says at least 2 hours.  Now that 
seems to suggest to me that we will not have enough time.  Do you 
have any difficulty in terms of availability on Monday so that we could 
wrap up on Monday? 
MS MEMELA:  Yes.  I have a project that I have to work on in the 
10 
Eastern Cape on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So, I- and I also do not want to be seen as if I am not 
cooperating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  I actually did mention to Mr Kirtland that I am up and 
down.  I am in Eastern Cape and I am mostly in Eastern Cape and then 
this side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  So, there was that arrangement that I had. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MEMELA:  Which would mean if I cannot sell, I might lose some 
income. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If you are not available on Monday, would you 
be available on Tuesday or Wednesday? 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 184 of 188 
 
MS MEMELA:  If the Commission allows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your side you would be available to be here on 
Tuesday? 
MS MEMELA:  Okay ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Wednesday? 
MS MEMELA:  Wednesday I can ja ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Wednesday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I should just remind you that you may not 
be available on Wednesday.  If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no ...(intervenes).  
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Except I guess the morning might be feasible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you are right but I would be available at least 
until lunch time – more or less lunch time on Wednesday. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay or maybe Chair I do not know I could check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MEMELA:  And notify you before I leave if I will be available on 
Monday.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MEMELA:  I will see if I cannot move the commitment 
...(intervenes).  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other arrangement. 
MS MEMELA:  That side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay what we can do is that we can adjourn and you 
can communicate with the Legal Team maybe some time later this 
evening or whatever arrangement and if the position is that you are 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 185 of 188 
 
able to rearrange your plans for Monday and you are able to come here 
then we will continue on Monday.  That would be preferable if your 
situation permits.  But if your situation does not permit then we can –
we can arrange that you come back on Wednesday morning. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay.  I also want to get a commitment from Ms 
Hofmeyr, she said she might need 2 hours.  Are you sure about 2 
hours?  Do you think maybe by 10, 11 we will be done because I could 
maybe leave immediately afterwards? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Monday? 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think when you talk about if it is Monday, if you 
make yourself available on Monday. 
MS MEMELA:  If I may myself on Monday maybe I can be able to drive 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Put it this way.  She estimates 2 hours and she say 
subject to my questions. 
MS MEMELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there can be many, there can be many 
sometimes.  So, we could end up going to 3 hours we are not sure.  I 
am not sure and she is not sure.  But I do not think that we would go – 
20 
that we would take 4 hours for example.  So, I think we both would 
think it should not go beyond 3 hours.  But we – ja. that is what we 
think. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just make another possible 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 186 of 188 
 
suggestion of an earlier start on Monday if that would assist.  We could 
maybe start at 9:30 or 9:00 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we – as things stand, I may have a commitment 
but if the position is that Ms Memela can rearrange her life for Monday 
and be here. 
MS MEMELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We could look at the possibility of starting at 9:30 but 
I do not know whether that 30 minutes would make much difference in 
your life. 
MS MEMELA:  No, it will not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will not.  So, shall we leave it on the basis that you 
will be in touch with the Legal Team either late at some stage this 
evening. 
MS MEMELA:  Actually, I will just make a call and before I leave here, I 
will give them feedback ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we are looking at you continuing on Monday or 
continuing on Wednesday depending on ...(intervenes).  
MS MEMELA:  The feedback. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The call ja. 
MS MEMELA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we may as well just stick to 10:00 for 
Monday ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
07 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 209 
 
Page 187 of 188 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, if we continue with you on Monday, we will start 
at 10:00. 
MS MEMELA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, that is alright.  Thank you for your 
cooperation Ms Memela. 
MS MEMELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are therefore going to adjourn until Monday.  We 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
