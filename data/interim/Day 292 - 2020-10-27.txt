CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated Ms 
Malahlela.   
MS MALAHLELA:  Thank you – thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Good morning Ms 
Malahlela. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Good morning. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you for coming to give 
10 
evidence before the Chair.  You based overseas currently 
is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I am. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Where are you currently working or 
living? 
MS MALAHLELA:  In Europe. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In Europe. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just ask it will be easier for the 
Chair to hear and the recording to pick up your voice.  If 
20 
rather than looking at me even though I am giving you the 
questions. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I look… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Please look at – in the direction of 
the Chair with the microphone in front. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 5 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  All witnesses do not want to look at me.  
Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Malahlela is it correct that you 
have cooperated with the commission’s officials and have 
produced an affidavit at our request? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just want to place on record for the 
transcript Mr Kennedy.  Do you want to place on record for 
the record – for the transcript that we are still using Denel 
Bundle 01 today. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Yes I do Chair and it is Exhibit 
W10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That starts from page 127 of this 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On mine it starts at page 131.  I think it 
is the index that starts maybe earlier.  The actual affidavit 
seems to start – start at 131. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  131 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes I have that thank you.  I was 
looking at the title.  May I just have a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Malahlela if I can take you please 
to page 164.  It seems that this was simply a statement 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 6 of 260 
 
signed by you not before a Commissioner of Oaths, is that 
correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:  164. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  164 please look at the top left of each 
page when you look at the page numbers.  Do you see 
Denel -01-164? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I see that.  I did sign in front of the 
Commissioner of Oath so I am just surprised why that does 
not appear at the bottom. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes that version may not have found 
10 
its way in the file but can we remedy that by asking you 
please to confirm – you have already been – you have 
already taken the oath before the – this commission.  Can 
you confirm that this is your statement? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And have you been through it 
carefully? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I believe so. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And are you familiar with everything 
that it says? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And do you agree with everything that 
it says? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And do you confirm that it sets out the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 7 of 260 
 
true facts fully and accurately? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Now Ms Malahlela I 
would like to start by getting a bit about your background 
for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you ask me to admit it as an Exhibit 
Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I beg your pardon for omitting that 
formality.  We ask that this be admitted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The statement by Ms Celia Paulina 
10 
Mamohlala Malahlela is admitted as Exhibit W10. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Malahlela if I can take you to page 
132 you set out your professional background.  I am going 
to pick up just a few points there.  You have an LLB 
Degree? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And 2.1  and then 2.4 deals with your 
work employment background prior to joining Denel, is that 
20 
right? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it does. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You were at Eskom Holdings as a 
Governance and Legal Officer February 2006 until July 
2007? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 8 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You were at De Beers Consolidated 
Mines as a Senior Supply Chain Officer August 2007 until 
2010 and then you joined Katanga Mining as a Contracts 
Advisor and then you had the role added of Company 
Secretary from November 2010 until you left them in May 
2012? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then if we go back to paragraph 2.2 
you then moved to Denel and joined Denel Land Systems in 
10 
May 2012 as a Contracts Manager in the Supply Chain 
Department, correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And 2.6 on page 133 refers to your 
reporting to the Chief Operations Officer Mr Thebus whom 
you 
mention 
a 
number 
of 
times 
elsewhere 
in 
your 
statement.  So he was the official to whom you reported? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And to whom did Mr Thebus report? 
MS MALAHLELA:  To the CEO Mr Stephan Burger. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Stephan Burger and you refer also in 
your statement later a number of times to Mr Burger? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will come back to that.  Now 2.7 you 
set out your various responsibilities as Executive Manager 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 9 of 260 
 
Supply Chain as including what is set out in 2.7.1 to 2.7.5.  
Was it part of your responsibility to ensure that there was 
compliance with proper procurement process? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And was it part of your responsibility 
if anything was being done that did not comply with those 
processes to raise the issue? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And who would you raise that issue 
with at least in a first instance? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA: To my superior. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Thebus. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Then you refer to a delegation 
of authority in paragraph 2.9 and you have attached for us 
as an annexure to your affidavit the delegation.  Is it 
correct that that – if you can just turn for a moment to page 
30 – I beg your pardon page 167 is the marker page and 
then from 168 is that the Company Policy? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Which has as part of its annexures a 
list of delegations? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it is. So this is the one that applied 
from November 2012.  It was amended from time to time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  And that table 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 10 of 260 
 
setting out the delegation runs from page 177, is that 
correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I just need to confirm.  That is correct 
Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. So this sets out the levels of 
authority.  May I take you please to – to page 182.   
MS MALAHLELA:  I have found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Paragraph or item 5 is headed 
Procurement.  And 5.1 refers to levels of procurement, 
standard procurement of products and services other than 
10 
items specified in 5.2 and 5.3 less than R50 million.  
Whose approval was required there? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Less than R50 million approval was the 
CEO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  By the CEO.  Is that in the column C 
under GCE? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and in between R50 million and 
R200 million. 
MS MALAHLELA:  It was the Group CE. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and then anything above 
R200million. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Denel board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Denel board.  You mention this 
delegation specifically in a later section of your affidavit.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 11 of 260 
 
Is this the one that applies to the relevant transactions? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it is the one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I just want to understand what 
you have at page 182.  What is SH on that first column that 
is vertical?  What does it stand for? 
MS MALAHLELA:  It is shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shareholder? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes.  I think there is also a list of 
acronyms if I can just go to it on page 177 the first 
10 
acronym is SH which is shareholder DPE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just quickly run through these ones here.  
DBD. 
MS MALAHLELA:  DBD is Denel Board of Directors.  GC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  GC is Group CEO. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And GEX? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Is Denel EXCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Denel – GEX is Denel EXCO. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it like Group Executive. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Committee? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and then CO will be CO of the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 12 of 260 
 
particular subsidiary or division? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you Mr Kennedy. 
MS MALAHLELA:  And if I may add Chair so that means 
the CEO of the Group is the GCEO – GCE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  GCE is Group CEO. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CEO is CEO of a division or subsidiary of 
Denel. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then if we still 
look at that key of – of acronyms or abbreviations on page 
177 you have taken us through the one on the left hand 
side.  On the right A means what? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Approval. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  PR? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Primary Responsibility. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  CR? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Co-responsibility. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  C? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Consultation Input Supplied. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Initiate. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And FI? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 13 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  For Information received report. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So if we go back to what I took you 
took you earlier at page 182.  If we look at 5.1that is 
standard 
procurement 
of 
products 
other 
than 
those 
specifically mentioned elsewhere less than R50 million the 
A under CEO means approval by the CEO, is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And C we have just seen means 
Consultation or input supplied.  
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So what does it mean in the context 
of less than R50 million?  Does it mean the CEO was 
vested with the – entrusted with the power to approve such 
a procurement? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes that is my understanding. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that would be as the Chair ’s 
pointed that is the CEO of the division. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Not the Group CEO? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then the C’s mean that 
the GCE and the GEX that is the Group Chief Executive 
and the functional Groups Executive may be involved in 
consultation. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 14 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Or would require consultation. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Which one?  Would they have to be 
consulted? 
MS MALAHLELA:  They will have to be consulted. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  And then when we get to the – 
between R50 million and R200 million we have seen that 
the notation is A for GCE again does not mean that the 
Group Chief Executive as oppose to the divisional CEO 
would have to approve it? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And the Group CE – the GCE’s limit to 
approve a transaction the upper limit was R200 million? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And anything above that would 
require board approval if we look at the final bullet point 
on this page above R200 million A is – appears under DBD 
that is the Denel Board? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Thank you.  May we now… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That third bullet point is it intended to 
say R200 million and above? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Of course I guess – I guess it 
means above R200 million because the – the one above 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 15 of 260 
 
that says anything between R50 million and R200 million 
the GDC the Group CEO has to approve? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they cannot be two who approve R200 
million? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cannot be both the board and the – so – 
so for the board it must anything above R200 million? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  May we then go back to 
your statement page 135 you set out an organogram 
showing 
the 
reporting 
structures 
or 
the 
procurement 
processes rather. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then you refer in paragraph 2.12 
to the delegation of authority meaning that depending on 
the value of the procurement you would be as among your 
20 
duties preparing a – a submission for approval by EXCO of 
DLS depending on the level of authority. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I struggled Ms Malahlela to follow 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 16 of 260 
 
the diagram above paragraph 2.12. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see where the first step takes place, 
who initiates it and then the next step and so on.  I ended 
up seeing at the bottom submit to Group Executive Director 
and then the top obtain approval.  So I was not sure where 
you start and where you end.  I am sure there is something 
I misunderstood would you like to explain it to me? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Not a problem.  This diagram that you 
see here it was included in the procedure that was in place 
10 
at the time when the transaction took place.  So if you look 
at the values there they are not necessarily in line with the 
values in the delegation of authority.  I know they are too 
small so the first one that you have is between 0 and 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  These – does this 
diagram relate specifically to what happened in this case 
or this is just a general diagram to say this what would 
happen generally? 
MS MALAHLELA:  This is a general diagram which was 
included in the policy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:  They Supply Chain – the procurement 
policy.  Ja but the delegation of authority we followed what 
was applicable from time to time as it was issued and sub-
delegated further. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 17 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so where does one start when 
something needs to happen that is relevant to this? 
MS MALAHLELA:  So if our … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can see rejected – rejected – rejected 
and I see approved – approved – approved. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not see the start and the 
journey. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Okay.  So we are starting here at the 
approval stage so that means you would not necessarily 
10 
see the quotation stage or the tender stage at this level.  It 
happens before which is not included in my statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So I can take you through the approval 
process because that is what I wanted you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so this is about approval? 
MS MALAHLELA:  This is just about approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not about the journey before that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  No it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So just talk to it further. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  So this was to give indication that if 
something needs to be approved.  So let us say something 
needs to go to Group EXCO or Group CE for approvals.  So 
what would happen is that the procurement manager would 
give approval and will recommend.  It will go to the small 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 18 of 260 
 
what we used to call the small procurement committee 
which is now on their referred to LPC which is the old 
acronyms that were used a long time ago but we called it 
the 
small 
procurement 
committee. 
 
Then 
it 
was 
recommended to the Group – oh sorry the Divisional EXCO 
and then from the Divisional EXCO then it will go to the 
Group C – Executive Director which is the CEO.  Should I 
use the delegations that we have in here to explain?  So 
let us say something is between R50 million and R200 
million as we have seen in paragraph 5 Chair. So the 
10 
manager the procurement manager responsible for that 
particular section of procurement be it commercial or 
technical would then give an approval to sign that they are 
okay with it.  Then it is recommended to the small 
procurement committee which would normally approve up 
until R5 million which is a sub-delegation that is why you 
do not see it in the Group Delegation of Authority.  Then 
that procurement committee would then recommend to the 
Divisional EXCO Supply Chain Committee which is chaired 
by the CEO of the division.  And then if it is acceptable 
20 
there then it will be recommended further to the Group 
Executive for approval.  And if it is going to the board then 
it will go further than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this diagram deals with amounts 
starting from what R20? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 19 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  From 0 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From 0? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I can see 0 to 20,000 there. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I can see 20,000 to 500,000? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I can see is it 500,000 below 
that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes that is true. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then another… 
MS MALAHLELA:  You have got 500 to 10 million.  If I may 
Chair so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja to 10 million. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this diagram covers situations that do 
not exceed 10 million? 
MS MALAHLELA:  So this diagram was the delegation of 
authority I believe because I was not in the organisation at 
the time.  The delegations of authority that were applicable 
20 
when the procedure was put in place but they since went 
obsolete because we or Denel revised the delegation of 
authority as and when Corporate revised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 20 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this one is no longer applicable. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So the value… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of the transactions. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Then I do not need to bother 
myself with this.  I thought … 
MS MALAHLELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought it was here because it would be 
applicable. 
MS MALAHLELA:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:  It is just to show the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Just to confirm Ms 
Malahlela this does not appear to deal with the situation of 
something that is to the value of more than R200 million? 
MS MALAHLELA:  No it does not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay thank you.  And for that we have 
to look at the table we looked at earlier which required that 
anything above R200 million would require not only the 
20 
GCE’s approval but also the board’s approval. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct?  Right thank you.  
Now you deal from page 136 with evaluation criteria that 
was – that were used in the assessment of bids.  Was this 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 21 of 260 
 
the standard process and requirement for when you 
assessed bids in your capacity in procurement? 
MS MALAHLELA:  At the time it was not applied in the 
division because it was – there was still – or rather we 
were still applying the policies and the procedures that 
were in place in the division.  However Mr Mlambo had 
already told us to start applying the evaluation criteria as I 
have alluded to in my statement. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I take you to paragraph 3.4 page 
137. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  3.4 ja.  I have found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You refer to a presentation by Mr 
Mlambo.  What position did he hold at that stage? 
MS MALAHLELA:  He was the Group Supply Chain 
Executive or manager. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So you were dealing with Supply 
Chain Management in the DLS Division. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct?  But he was at the 
Corporate Head Office level of Denel? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Okay. 
 And 
he 
conducted 
a 
presentation.  Is that – is that the meeting that you were 
referring to a moment ago where he said you must now 
apply a particular criteria? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 22 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  So we used to have – I will refer to two 
meetings.  We used to have regular Group Supply Chain 
meetings where we would discuss Supply Chain issues in 
the group.  So he referred to in the – in one of those 
sessions but he also referred to it in this session where the 
supply – it was essentially not a meeting it was a supplier 
day if I may call it that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then he gave – he indicated that 
certain evaluation criteria had to be used in the Denel 
group. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did that mean that you in DLS were 
required to apply these criteria? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct.  As a division of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now these three items in 351, 
352 and 353 are they the criteria that he then said you 
must now use? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct as I have taken that from 
the presentation which he had made which is an annexure 
to this statement. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that what you refer to again at the 
end of paragraph 3.4? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Let me just double check 3.4. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is the presentation? 
MS MALAHLELA:  CM5 yes that is the one. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 23 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And if I can take you please to 
page 209 and 23 – 210.  So it is 209 and 210 is that the 
agenda that you referred to in your affidavit? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes for the Supplier Day. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Go back to page 137.  So 
the three criteria were price, functionality and BBBEE.  
Price was 25% functionality 45% and BBBEE 30%.  You 
mention in 3.6 that these criteria and particularly that the 
allocation of – of points based on BBBEE related to the 
Group Strategic Objective of Increase Black Supplier Pull.  
10 
So I notice for example the BBBEE proportion was 30% a 
bit higher than price which was 25%.  Is – does this reflect 
the point required by Mr Mlambo in terms of Group Policy 
to be improving black representitivity in the Supplier Pool? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct.  This is what he also 
said in an email which I think I have attached to this as 
part of him sensitising that we need to apply the criteria 
going forward. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And if you – you refer to an 
email in 3.7 is that the email that you have just mentioned? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Let me just double check. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just look at 3.7.  Is that what you 
referring to? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I just need to check the page where the 
email is so that… 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 24 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes well just – yes well let me take 
you to that.  It is at page 212.  212.   
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes this appears to be the one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And so that refers to a process 
at Group level among the executives at group level and the 
formulation of a policy to improve Denel’s spend on black 
owned and black women owned companies? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And recent audit from – conducted by 
Deloittes which reflected that which found that there was a 
10 
variation in implementation across the group and there was 
now a need to standardise this and to impose a clear level 
of criteria. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct?  Right.  Thank you.  
Then to go back to page 137 paragraph 3.8 you set out 
applicable internal procurement policies and you have 
referred to this specific documents in that regard.  Now did 
you take into account what we have just dealt with; the 
criteria, the policies and procedures 
when you then 
20 
proceed to – proceeded to deal with the evaluation of the 
various bids or offers that we are going to deal with in 
relation to the specific contracts that are the subject of the 
rest of your affidavit. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 25 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  May we turn to the first of 
those contracts, page 138, paragraph 4? 
MS MALAHLELA:   138.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have it? 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have paragraph 4? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I have paragraph 4. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  I am going to take you through 
it.  That deals specifically with the first contract of interest 
here.  And that is the appointment by DLS for whom you 
10 
worked of VR Laser Services specifically for the production 
of 217 armour hulls for the Hoefyster platform component.  
And that took place in 2014.  Correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now, you refer first to a 
submission that was made to DLS Exco in April 2014 
recommending the appointment of VR Laser Services for 
these 217 armour hulls.  And you say in 4.1.1. that there was 
a submission to the Exco of DLS.  So that is the division.  
That is not at group level at this stage. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you signed off a submission 
relating to quotations that have been received from three 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 26 of 260 
 
entities.   
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And those were LMT, DCD Dorbyl and 
VR Laser.  And then you refer to yourself being a member of 
the team together with Mr Badenhorst.  Well, you have 
received an instruction, rather, from Mr Badenhorst.  Who 
was he? 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You refer to him in 4.1.2.  Project 
Manager, Transfer of Technology Platform.  To attend a 
10 
meeting to discuss progress.  Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Badenhorst, you mention at the 
foot of the page.  Had previously been employed in the 
Supply Chain Management Department as a procurement 
officer.  Was that DLS’s Supply Chain Department? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you say he had been involved in 
the 
procurement 
process 
prior 
to 
having 
his 
position 
changed.  Then you referred to a report, 4.1.4.  Submitted by 
20 
a Finland company, Patria Land Services.  What was Patria 
involved in?  What was its relevance to this? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So Patria was the only or the... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is it what you referred to in 4.1.5, the 
original equipment manufacturers? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 27 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, that is the one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the abbreviation OEM? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Original Equipment Manufacturer of the 
vehicle. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 
Which 
is 
the 
badger(?) 
or 
the 
interchange leader(?) who faced(?) the vehicle.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And... but this was a new 
10 
contract for the supply of 217 armour hulls.  Had Patria itself 
supplied a number of similar items to Denel prior to this 
contract being awarded to VR Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot say but there were other 
vehicles that they were busy with but let me not speak to 
that because I do not have the exact facts. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  Then you referred 
to the meeting that Mr Badenhorst had asked you to attend 
together with the people mentioned in 4.1.6.  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Bezuidenhout, Chebis(?) van den 
Heever, Drevon(?) and Van te Nell(?). 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you say, you were first – this 
is at the foot of the page – you were first made aware of the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 28 of 260 
 
three suppliers responses to the RFO.  So had there been a 
request for office that had been put out before this? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I believe so before I joined the 
organisation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  You say that that was dated, the 
RFO was dated February 2012.  That was before you joined.  
I think you joined in May 2012  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  So you came into the process 
mid-stream. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would that be fair to say? 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And there had been responses 
to that RFO.   
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   From LMT, DCD and VR Laser.  So that 
meeting took place and a submission was then to deal in 
Exco.  We see at the top of page 40, paragraph 418.   
 
And that contained a recommendation as to which 
20 
supplier should be appointed for this particular contract.  
And you refer in 4.1.9.  So that having been prepared in 
April 2014 by Mr Badenhorst and that was submitted to you. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For your consideration and onward 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 29 of 260 
 
transmission to the Exco. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you referred to annexures 
which has set out the relevant correspondence.  If I can just 
ask you to turn for a moment to pages 255 and 256? 
MS MALAHLELA:   H’m, 255...  Yes, I have found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Is that the correspondence via 
email that you were referring to in your affidavit? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Sorry, I just...  The correspondence 
relating to?  If you can just help me with that? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The emails from Mr Badenhorst 
relating to the recommendation. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I was on 155.  My apologies.  So it is 
255? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   255.  Especially 256.   
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  Now back to page 
140.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That is an email from whom to 
whom? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is an email from Riaan to myself, 
cc’ing the programme rights. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is Riaan Badenhorst.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Mr Badenhorst. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr Badenhorst. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 30 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, it may assist if you have regard 
to page 255 which bears the email details of when it was 
sent by whom and to whom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  I was expecting to that 
at 256.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So this email, it seems, was pressing 
for a speedy decision to be made on the award of the 
business? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was one of the emails that was 
pressing for a decision to be made because there was also 
pressure from Patria’s side. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Pressure from Patria’s side? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Patria’s side. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Because now we were running into 
20 
leap(?) times. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now in your statement at page 
140 at para 4.1.11.  You say that a final submission was 
concluded on 25 April 2014 for consideration at its meeting 
on the 29t h of that month.  And that recommended that VR 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 31 of 260 
 
Laser be appointed as the preferred supplier in the platform 
hulls manufacturing contract.  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then if I can take you now to 
CM10.  You will find that at page 258 and following.  There is 
an email from Linda Meyer to Exco, Exco secretaries and 
yourself, Celia Malahlela.  Correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was the document that then 
appears from page 259 attached to that? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what is the document at 259 and 
following? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It is a submission to the Group Chief 
Executive asking for his recommendation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And were you involved in its 
compilation? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I was.  I...  Yes, I was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so it is addressed, if you see just 
under the logo of Denel, the top left-hand part of this page 
20 
259.  You will see the next block, to Exco.  Is that DLS’s 
Excos? 
MS MALAHLELA:   At which page?  Excuse. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 259. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 32 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You see at the top left there is a Denel 
logo. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Oh, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then there is a heading, Group Chief 
Executive Officer Supply Chain Approval.  And then the next 
line, it is addressed to Exco. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that DLS Exco? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It is DLS Exco. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not Group Exco of Denel? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not Group Exco. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it comes from Supply Chain of 
which you were part? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  As you have referred to.  The 
document was drafted by Riaan and sent to me for... that I 
look at it and then recommended through Exco. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So you approved this draft that 
you have from Mr Badenhorst and then you sent it with you 
20 
recommendation to Exco? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   For consideration. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then if we look at page 261, 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 33 of 260 
 
paragraph 8, the recommendation. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Page 261? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 261, yes.  Paragraph 8.  After 
reflecting the evaluation and the comments and so forth, the 
recommendation is that: 
“Denel Land Systems Exco give approval to use VR 
Lasers as the Hoefyster Platform hull supplier.  Due 
to the value of this transaction deal, it must seek 
final approval from Group CEO and the Board of 
Denel.   
10 
We 
trust 
that 
this 
document 
gives 
enough 
information to enable DOS Exco to give its blessings 
and make the recommendation as stipulated above.” 
 
So you were saying to Exco DLS: 
“Please approve this recommendation and then also 
go to the Group CEO for his approval.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  The value of the transaction, 
are you able to tell us what the value is? 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you look on page 260, paragraph 3. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Thank you.  260, paragraph 3.  So the 
total potential contract value was R 364 774 839,00.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  So this would clearly be way 
above R 200 million which was the limit of the Group CEO’s 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 34 of 260 
 
authority? 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  So that is why in my 
recommendation I recommended that it goes to the board.  
And if you also refer to page 7, you will see that the last 
page is that we take for recommendation at the Divisional 
Exco and then after that it goes to the Group Exco and then 
ultimately to the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   That was the intention.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Okay back to page 
140, please. 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   4.1.13 refers to an agenda.  And just 
look for a moment at page 265.  Is that the agenda you are 
referring to? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Page 265.  Let me just get there.  It 
seems to be the one but I note that there seems to be an 
error with regard to the dates because if you look at the date 
20 
that appears on the agenda, it says the 27t h of April and on 
4.1.13, we are referring to the 29 t h.  If we can just confirm 
that for correctness. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  And in fact, there 
seems to be a difference in the paragraph to that which you 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 35 of 260 
 
mentioned in your statement which I have just picked up 
now.  But I do not think anything turns on that Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You then in your statement, page 140-
41-14.  You say: 
“It can be noted under paragraph 7 of the DLS Exco 
submission of 25 April 2014...” 
 
That is the document we looked at a moment ago at 
page 261.  Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, that is the one. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then to continue in your statement. 
“The Patria report had been integrated into the 
recommendation of the cross-functional team for the 
appointment of VR Laser as the preferred supplier 
for this contract.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say: 
“Although the Patria report had been used in support 
of the decision to recommend VR Laser, it is 
submitted 
that 
VR 
Laser 
would 
have 
been 
20 
recommended.” 
 
Now who is submitting here?  Whose view is this?  Is 
this your view? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No.  We... I do not want to call this a 
cross-functional team because it was not sitting as a formal 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 36 of 260 
 
cross-functional team.  So we sat as a team that looked at 
the quotations.  If you refer to 1.1.6.1.  That is the view of 
the team.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, what number were you giving? 
MS MALAHLELA:   4.1.6.  Where I am mentioning that we 
sat to look at the quotations that had been sent to us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  So the view was that VR Laser 
had offered the most competitive price out of the three 
10 
suppliers. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  And on the face of that, if you go to 
page 2, you will realise that the cheapest price with regard 
to that particular RFO was VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry.  Can you just hold on a second?  
The page 2, are you referring to page 260? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Sorry.  Yes, that is the one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is page 2 of the document but if you 
20 
can just try and bear in mind that we must use the page 
numbers on the top left. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I will.  I will. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so you refer to the three prices 
here.  Is that in the middle of the page where the column is 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 37 of 260 
 
headed supply and amount prices per unit.  And we see 
there at LMT worth offering as a price per unit R 1.7 odd 
million.  VR Laser R 865 010.00.  And DCD slightly higher, 
R 896 000,00. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So LMT was roughly double what VR 
Laser was offering in terms of this response to the RFO. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so to go back to your paragraph 
4.1.15, page 140.  So you are saying: 
10 
“Although Patria, the original manufacturer, had 
recommended VR Laser for the various reasons, it 
had...” 
 
The reason why you in your section were recommending 
approval of VR Laser’s appointment was that it was offering 
the best price? 
MS MALAHLELA:   True. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you have set out 
helpfully at the top of page 141 in your statement the same 
table reflecting the prices. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you say at 4.1.16: 
“Shortly 
before 
signing 
off 
the 
submission 
of 
25 April 2014, 
which 
recommended 
VR 
Laser’s 
appointment and emailing it to Exco...” 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 38 of 260 
 
 
You received an email from Mr Thebus requesting that 
you check the shareholders agreement in place between LMT 
and Denel Land Systems.  Now LMT was one of the bidders 
in this three bid process. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And we have already seen that is price 
was double that of VR Laser whom you were recommending. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now why was it... you do not seem to 
have attached the email but again, you do explain it in your 
10 
statement.  You say he was asking you to check the 
shareholders’ agreement between LMT and Denel Land 
Systems, DLS.  What was that shareholders agreement?   
 
The Commission has heard evidence in relations to LMT, 
originally being an independent entity and later there was an 
agreement between Denel and the shareholders of LMT 
which was already supplying Denel regularly with items.   
 
In terms of that agreement, Denel acquired a majority 
shareholding in LMT.  Is this the shareholding agreement 
that was referred to? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   I believe that is the one that he was 
referring to.  I was not that involved with... in relation to 
shareholders agreement. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   But I believe that is the one that he was 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 39 of 260 
 
referring to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And Mr Thebus is a witness 
who has been consulting with us and submitted an affidavit 
and will be giving evidence at a later stage before the Chair 
of this Commission. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I am sure he will be able to speak to 
that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He will deal with that.  But you say in 
4.1.17 that the indication you got from Mr Thebus was that 
his request that you look into the shareholders agreement 
10 
was informed by communication he had received from LMT’s 
Managing Director at the time, Dr Stephan Nel.   
 
Now if I can just indicate for your knowledge and the 
Chair that Dr Nel’s evidence will also be produced before 
this Commission at a later stage.   
 
Now the point that Dr Nel raised with Thebus, according 
to what Thebus told you, was that Dr Nel was complaining.  
He 
accused 
DOS 
of 
contravening 
the 
shareholders 
agreement by contracting, by indicating that it was going to 
contract for this item with other parties, presumable VR 
20 
Laser.   
 
So effectively, he was saying on behalf of LMT that:  We 
have an entitlement to this business.  Do not give it to 
someone else.  Is that your understanding of what Mr Thebus 
said? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 40 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   That was my understanding, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then you refer in 4.1.18 to a 
further email that you received.  This time from Mr Knoetze, 
the Chief Financial Officer, the CFO of DOS at the time.   
 
And he said he recalled a letter signed by DLS 
confirming that DOS would put business of the manufacturing 
house to LMT as a condition to the equity deal involving the 
purchase of LMT.   
 
So Mr Knoetze has indicated that yes this may relate to 
a letter indicating that LMT would be given business. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   A That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And will be giving business once the 
majority shareholding in LMT was sold to Denel.   
MS MALAHLELA:   My ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that your understanding? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot speak to that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Because we...  The other thing is that, 
this letter, we did not find it and I see...  If you refer to the 
emails further down by Ms Govender, you will realise that 
20 
she is referring to the email not being found. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MALAHLELA:   The...  Sorry, the letter not being found. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  In fact, in your 4.1.21, you refer 
to the chain of email correspondence attached to CM12.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 41 of 260 
 
May I take you please to page 267 and following? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Page 267...  Yes, I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is email correspondence 
which includes a number of attachments which appear to be 
documents ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...that relate to LMT. 
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now did you investigate this then at 
the request of Mr Thebus? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   The group...  The legal executive 
investigated it for us and wrote a report.  As you can see, my 
statement later on refers to the emails and what she said. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Let us go back to that statement 
of yours, page 141. 
MS MALAHLELA:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Paragraph 4.1.19.  Now Ms Denise 
Govender, you referred to as the Executive Legal for Denel 
Land System, DLS.  And she sent a response which is part of 
the email correspondence which is attached there. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And she attached a number of 
documents, 4.19.1 a draft shareholders agreement between 
DLS and LMT.  Submission to the board of Denel Group.  
Notifying of a revised transaction.  Requesting approval.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 42 of 260 
 
 
Reduction of Denel’s shareholding from 70% to 51%, et 
cetera.  A call option, et cetera.  And then 4.1.21 you refer to 
Ms Govender referring to page 6 of the Denel Board 
submission.  And the reasons why Denel was acquiring a 
majority shareholding in LMT.  Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is what Mr Govender referred to 
...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   To. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...to your... to you. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then...  So what was the 
upshot of this investigation undertaken by Ms Govender?  
You were made aware that LMT’s CEO, at the time Dr Nel, 
was saying that they should be given preference rather than 
anybody else.  They should be given the work because now 
they were majority owned by Denel.   
 
Part of the deal was that work would go to LMT.  
Instead, you now looking at a more competitive process 
which we know ultimately resulted in the award of the 
20 
contract to VR Laser rather than LMT.  What was the upshot 
of Ms Govender’s investigation? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I would ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That it could go ahead or not. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I will take you to paragraph 1.1.2.4.  It 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 43 of 260 
 
has a summary of different documents that she looked at and 
her advice with regard to each and every document, 
applicable document. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you.  So that is 4.1.24 on 
page 143.   
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And her conclusion and presumable 
you are not... your function was not to comment on whether 
her legal conclusion was correct or not? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Although you have an LLB, she was 
employed as Group Executive of Legal. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is true. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So her conclusion was in relation 
to 4.1.24.1 that the MOU between DLS and LMT did not 
impose a legally binding obligation on Denel to contract LMT 
for this particular contract? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is what she wrote. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And the MOU was no longer 
enforced.  In 4.1.24.2, there was no legal obligation arising 
20 
from a contract for hulls.  And then an option to purchase 
agreement, 
also 
did 
not 
place 
a 
legally 
enforceable 
obligation.   
 
And she also dealt with a letter by DLS’s CO to 
Khomotso.  The Commission has heard evidence and we will 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 44 of 260 
 
hear evidence relating to Khomotso.  That was a minority 
shareholding in LMT after Denel required the majority 
shareholding.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you aware of that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  So then you referred to 
Ms Govender’s email.  I am not going to go into the content 
of that because you have already summarised it in your 
statement.  That is attached...  Let me just find the page.  It 
10 
is from page 284.  Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I just need to confirm.  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  Now I would like 
to turn in your statement to page 144 and that is the 
adjudication of the updated request for proposals for this HY, 
Hoefyster contract in June 2014.  
 
 So you were now able, as I understand your evidence. 
Once Ms Govender said there is no legal obligation for Denel 
to give the business to LMT automatically, you can then... 
you were then able to proceed to evaluate these...  Oh, 
20 
sorry.  To have these bids adjudicated and an award made. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now, what reference is then 
made in 4.2.2 to a process in which the bidders were asked 
to amend or update their proposals to contain a breakdown 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 45 of 260 
 
of the prices and the items that we see in 4.2.2.1 to 4.2.2.3 
are the items.  So you required a breakdown.  Why was 
there... why was it necessary to have a breakdown of the 
overall prices that they had submitted? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Because it was not clear what each 
bidders quoted for.  We could not compare apples with 
apples. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And then you refer in 4.2.5 to 
the responses received from the three suppliers, LMT, VR 
Laser and DCD.  And you then summarise in 4.2.6 the 
10 
pricing that was actually received. 
MS MALAHLELA:   H’m... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   In 4.2.6? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   4.2.6.  And then you give the... how it 
is broken down where applicable.  LMT, however, in 
4.2.6.1...  Are you with me? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I am with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   LMT gave a response in which it 
quoted an amount of R 736 534,00 excluding VAT.  That for 
20 
each of the 217 hulls, it indicated that: 
“It is not possible to quote for mine protection 
separately as it is an integral part of the whole 
structures.” 
 
Now you had asked for a breakdown specifically to see 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 46 of 260 
 
what is your price for the mine protection system separately 
from the rest. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So if I may just go back a little bit?  So 
we 
submitted 
the 
documentation 
to 
Exco. 
 
The 
documentation coming from the first RFO that was issued 
out.  And Exco recommended that we go and get revised 
quotations because we could not see what the suppliers 
actually quoted for and all of that is in the minute. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So that was a decision by Exco, 
not by yourself? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But did you implement that 
decision ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   To reissue? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...by why of asking these three bidders 
to give a broken down price? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, we did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Are you able to tell us, when we 
look at LMT’s revised submission in 4.2.6.1, the quoting of 
an amount of R 736 000,00 excluding VAT.  Was that the 
20 
same as what they previously tendered or different? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was different.  It was more than half 
the price.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   More than half? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  So if we can just go there.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 47 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we saw earlier that it was over a 
million rand, was it not? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I think it was around R 1.7 million. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Double the eight hundred 
something thousand submitted by ...[indistinct]  
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So here you have a dramatic reduction 
in LMT. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  With the purpose of getting a 
10 
breakdown to allow suppliers to change their prices 
overall. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Since a lot of time had elapsed I take it 
that – or should I say – how do I put that?  It was expected 
that the price could be different but we did not expect that 
the price would go down. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in the end what was the explanation 
for that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I talk to it later on in my affidavit, I 
20 
think he is going to get to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember what the explanation 
was? 
MS MALAHLELA:   They…I… 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not remember you can deal 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 48 of 260 
 
with 
it 
later, 
I 
thought 
you 
might 
just 
remember 
…[intervenes] 
MS MALAHLELA:   The top of my …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sounds an awkward thing. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja.  Top of my head, let me not… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Let us just get to it then I know I am 
referring to the actual stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I take you perhaps as the Chair 
10 
has raised this issue, to page 149?  Let us just jump ahead 
for a moment to page 149, paragraph 42.21.  Do you have 
it? 
MS MALAHLELA:   42.21? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  You say: 
“The pricing contained in the revised proposals of 
27 June 2014 can be summarised as follows: 
42.21.1   LMT sought to explain its pricing with 
20 
respect 
to 
the 
2017 
hulls(?) 
in 
their 
previously 
submitted 
proposal 
by 
distinguishing 
between 
the 
interior 
and 
exterior features of each hull as follows: 
(a) The unit price of the 217 hulls were 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 49 of 260 
 
R736 534 
each 
where 
sandblasting 
and 
priming was included, and 
(b)  The unit price of the 217 hulls were 
R763 191.02 each where sandblasting and 
painting of each hull with matt oak earth 
exterior and beige green as per the RSA 
spec was included.” 
That does not seem to actually give an explanation for why 
there was such a substantial decrease. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, there was another section where 
10 
they alluded to having improved the processes but it is 
somewhere in the documentation, I can just get it and refer 
to it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, let us deal with that in due 
course then.  Alright, let us go back to your page 145.  So 
you deal not only with LMT’s revised proposal but also that 
of VR Laser and then there is a reference to the breakdown 
for them.  In relation to DCD you deal with that in 42.64 on 
the foot of page 146 and a table at the top half of – sorry, 
146, from 145, is that correct? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, now in 4.2.8 you refer to a 
team meeting on 1 April 2015 to consider the responses 
and you then in 429 say that you called for a cross-
functional team to evaluate the updated proposals, is that 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 50 of 260 
 
correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you set out the names of the 
individuals who were invited to sit on the cross-functional 
team.  In 4.2.10, Mr Badenhorst, Bezuidenhout, Brevan, 
etcetera and your name appears at 4.2.7. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And you also involved the 
assistance of a Mr Rhakaduwe of the supply chain 
management department. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now let us move ahead to 42.14.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On page 148.  That is where your 
cross-functional 
team 
evaluated 
the 
three 
suppliers’ 
responses on the 25 June and a list of questions was noted 
requiring clarification.  Correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct, we looked at the 
quotations received on the 25 t h and we called for a meeting 
the following day. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what flowed from that was on the 
following day, there were feedback sessions or a feedback 
session attended by the threes suppliers separately, VR 
Laser, DCD and LMT, different times that you specify.  Was 
that for the questions to be posed for their clarification? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 51 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now we do not need to go 
into the detail of what was done then and then in 4.2.20 
the cross-functional team then gave the three suppliers an 
opportunity to submit revised proposals based on the 
issues raised. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And they then submitted their revised 
proposals.  In fact, Chair, I see I was confused, the 
reference I gave earlier to 42.21 relates to these revised 
10 
proposals.  Let me just check with you, Ms Malahlela.  So 
was this another opportunity for them to revise their 
proposals again? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, if they I misunderstood anything 
and our initial documentation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MALAHLELA:   After the clarification. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So they had originally 
submitted prices, then they were asked to break their 
prices down and some of them did, some of them did not 
20 
and then – and then there is yet a further opportunity for 
revised proposals. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ja, was this normal procedure to 
allow them to revise their proposal? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 52 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was not – I cannot say that we have 
done it before on a specific order but it makes sense to be 
able to evaluate apples with – to understand that everyone 
quoted on the same parameters because if you look at the 
quotations you realise that some of them are included 
painting, some of them did not include painting.  So we 
wanted to have a proper clarification, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then they submitted the 
revised proposals.  We see in 42.21.2, DCD did not change 
its pricing. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   VR Laser gave an updated proposal 
but there was no revision in the actual pricing. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it just gave other information 
and – yes, there is no mention – I beg your pardon, I must 
start LMT, we dealt with that earlier, 42.21.1.  Alright and 
then 42.24 refers to the same criteria, price functionality 
and BBBEE with the percentages as mentioned to earlier, 
correct? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and then there was a template.  
And do I understand from that that the template was then 
used to tabulate the evaluation of the three bids. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 53 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And you then say in 42.26 
that VR Laser received the highest score of 65.54%.  And 
then 
for 
price 
it 
got 
10.3.9% 
of 
a 
potential 
25%, 
functionality, 50.15% and 5% for BBBEE. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct and you can also see it 
on the face of the evaluation template. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MALAHLELA:   It is a copy and paste essentially of 
what happened. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then you compare that with 
10 
LMT in 42.27.  It came second.  Iscor was 64.78%, correct? 
MS 
MALAHLELA:   Yes, same here 
based on the 
consolidated sheet that is also part of the …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On the scoring. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so; the difference between LMT 
and VR Laser was a very small difference, not so, less 
than %, it was .76%. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Based on these percentages. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But you refer at the foot of the 
20 
page to LMT total financial offer being 165 million making 
it the cheapest out of the three suppliers. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So although we have seen its original 
proposal with double what the other suppliers were offering 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 54 of 260 
 
through the revision of the proposals it came out actually 
ultimately the cheapest. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Chair, may I ask, do you wish 
to take a tea adjournment around now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us do that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It see it is 11.15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea adjournment and 
resume at half past eleven. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Malahlela, can 
I take you back to your statement page 151?  Are you 
there?  Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Switch on your mic, Ms Malahlela. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Sorry.  It is on now. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, now may I take you to 
20 
paragraph 
4.29. 
 
You 
deal 
in 
the 
next 
number 
of 
paragraphs with your interaction with Mr Burger and you 
had already told us that Mr Teubes is the person you would 
report to directly and Teubes would report to Burger.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 55 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you had a number of interactions 
with Mr Burger.  Could you tell the Chair please what was 
the general nature of the interactions with Mr Burger about 
this specific procurement process and whether it was 
ordinary or out of the ordinary for him to be speaking 
directly to you about this issues. 
MS MALAHLELA:   At the time it was not ordinary for the 
CEO to come to my office and ask me to give him feedback 
on procurement matters as I was reporting to the COO, not 
the CEO. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Mr Teubes around on that day or 
was this a situation where maybe Mr Teubes was not 
around? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot recall exactly if he was around 
on the day.  But I – sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If Mr Teubes was not at work would you 
have found it strange if Mr Burger came to you for a 
feedback? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Usually he would call me to his office 
instead of coming to my office if there is an issue that we 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so there are two things.  One, it is 
whether it is his request for a feedback from you that was 
not normal or whether it his coming to your office that was 
not normal or both? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 56 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both were not normal. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Unless he was coming from somewhere 
in the offices but it was just not normal, he did not come to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had it happened before? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not that I can recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What would be normal is that he 
10 
would get his feedback from Mr Teubes? 
MS MALAHLELA:   If there is need to give him feedback.  
We usually would not give feedback during the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS MALAHLELA:   We usually did not give feedback 
during the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, even that was not normal? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but if he needed anything from you 
the channel would be for him to go through Mr Teubes? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Or call me to his office or give me a 
call to tell me what he needed or give me a call to tell me 
what he needed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he could deal directly with you 
sometimes. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 57 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Seldom, sometimes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  But you say here what was 
not normal was one, that he asked for a feedback from you 
in the middle of a process.  Two, that he came to your 
office. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In 4.2.29 you 
refer 
to 
yourself 
giving 
him 
regular 
updates 
on 
an 
instruction.  What instruction did he give you? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   He asked me to give him feedback on 
the process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On a regular basis or just on one 
occasion? 
MS MALAHLELA:   On a regular basis. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that mean that even when Mr Teubes 
was around? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes because if you refer to the emails, 
I cc’d Mr Teubes on our conversations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You copied Mr Teubes? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did Mr Teubes find it strange as 
well? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, he knew about it. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 58 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what I am asking is whether he also 
found it strange that Mr Burger wanted the reports from 
you. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I am not sure, I did not speak to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You then refer to informing Mr Burger 
about the prices and that a recommendation could not be 
made on the information and he then requested a copy of 
the bid evaluation committee’s evaluation sheets or matrix.  
You refer to that in 42.31. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did he explain why he was asking 
you for that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you have any feeling as to 
whether it was normal practice for him to do that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I thought it was just oversight ensuring 
that we follow the right process on this particular one 
because it was high value, it is just to ensure that 
everything goes well.  That was my impression at the time. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you refer in 42.32 to him 
looking at the evaluation committee’s sheets, evaluation 
sheets, etcetera, and he informed you that he was 
prepared to defend VR Laser.  How did that discussion 
arise? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 59 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   I sent him – it all in writing, so I sent 
him an email and then he responded by saying that he is 
prepared to defend VR Laser as they also number 1 in the 
scoring.  It is all in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but just give the context what had 
happened before that made him – that prompted him to 
make this remark that he was prepared to defend VR Laser.  
It is like somebody had said something and then he 
thought it was necessary to make it clear to you or to all 
concerned that he was prepared to defend them.  What was 
10 
the context? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I would not know so the information 
that I have is that I had been sending him information after 
his request and he looked at this information and after the 
last email that I had sent before this then he responded by 
saying that he is willing – or let me quote.  He is prepared 
to defend VR Laser.  I do not know against what. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand this remark yourself 
or 
did 
you 
not 
understand 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   My understanding at the time was that 
he was willing to go to – that he would normally take the 
recommendation to corporate office and the board.  So 
once it is approved I will give it to him to take to corporate 
office after he had signed it.  So my understanding at the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 60 of 260 
 
time was that when he gets there he would be willing to 
work with the submissions that he has based on the 
information that he had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Then in 42.38 you 
refer – sorry, 42.33, top of page 152, you refer to Mr 
Burger asking whether the Patria Report was included.  Do 
you know why he – in the committee’s recommendation, do 
you know he raised that?  Did he explain? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, he did not explain.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you find it out of the ordinary? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Now thinking back what – the whole 
conversation and him being part of the process was out of 
the ordinary itself. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then in 42.34 you say that 
Mr Burger said that he would be negotiating with VR Laser, 
negotiating what? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I do not know what he was negotiating 
with VR Laser because - as you let me just look at that, 
then I can – so if you look at the exact email that – that is 
20 
42.34 was taken from, you will see that we had already 
drafted the submission and the submission was in the 
approval process and was now going to be changed 
because the committee had already made the decision with 
regard to the way forward.  So I do not know what he was 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 61 of 260 
 
talking about with regard to him discussing with VR legal, I 
believe that he is coming, maybe you must ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, you cannot have all of these 
things that you say you did not know because he is writing 
to you and he is communicating something.  I see here he 
seems to say – your paragraph 4.2.34 says: 
“He also undertook to negotiate with VR Laser to 
reduce 
the 
price 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
MS MALAHLELA:   Outside the normal process. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Outside the normal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So this sounds strange to me. 
MS MALAHLELA:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I am thinking if you receive 
communication or he sent this to you, there would be some 
reaction from you, Mr Burger, what are you talking about?  
Why would you negotiate with VR Laser to produce the 
price? 
MS MALAHLELA:   For me the process was concluded – as 
20 
you see later on I received a quotation without soliciting it 
and I was requested to include it and I refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Which I believe now in hindsight that 
came, I do not have the facts, came as a result of him 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 62 of 260 
 
having negotiated.  I do not have the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but it sounds like he – this 
negotiating that he wanted to undertake with VR Laser to 
reduce the price does not sound right. 
MS MALAHLELA:   It does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would Mr Teubes have become 
aware at some stage during the process of what Mr Burger 
said? 
MS MALAHLELA:   He was cc’d in the emails, in all the 
emails. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he share with you what his reaction 
was to this? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not. 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never got to know what he thought 
about? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No.  In hindsight, when I received the 
20 
quotation, I assumed that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m… 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is why I [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say from a certain 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 63 of 260 
 
point Mr Burger seems to have shown a particular interest 
in the process in what was happening? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct, from my point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From your point of view. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would that be not the kind of level 
of interest that he normally showed in other matters? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and now he was saying he would 
negotiate with VR Laser to reduce their price and he would 
10 
do so outside the normal channels. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.   Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Malahlela, can 
I take you to the emails at page 529? 
MS MALAHLELA:   529.  I have found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There is an email at the foot of the 
page which appears to come from you to Mr Burger.  In fact 
is says Stephan, Reenen.  Reenen is a reference to 
Teubes, is that right? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you say: 
“Please find the attached as requested.  The 
committee will meet tomorrow to do the final 
recommendation if they agree with the results after 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 64 of 260 
 
population of info.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that the cross-functional 
committee you referred to earlier? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now Mr Teubes – sorry, I beg 
your pardon, Stephan Burger then responds to you in the 
email halfway down the page, in the middle of the page, on 
the 27 June.  Just read out to the Chair please what he 
says? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   The one that starts with: 
“Thank you, Cecilia…” 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   “Thank you, Celia, given all that I am  
prepared to defend VR, the one thing that I have 
not seen is the factor that Patria has strongly 
recommended VR as the preferred supplier but 
maybe this is integrated in the scoring.  Given VR’s 
price but also that they are number one, I think we 
should get DCO approval but in parallel I will 
20 
discuss with them to reduce their price.  I would not 
have done that if they were not number one but, as 
they are, it could do no harm to get the prices 
reduced.  This, however, I will do outside the 
normal channels.  That is the email that I was 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 65 of 260 
 
referring to.” 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now what did you understand him to 
mean when he said they are number one? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So if you refer to the consolidated 
sheet, there were numbers with regard to number 1, 
number 2, number 3, which is on the consolidated score 
sheet.  That is what he was [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, in terms of preference. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of scoring. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of points. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So VR Laser was number 1. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that is what he is referring to. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is what I understood he was 
referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that the scoring that yielded 
results that we saw earlier where VR Laser was number 
one but LMT was less than 1%? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Less in scoring than VR Laser. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 66 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was .76, I think it was, percent. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I get the impression – and you must 
tell me if my impression has got any basis in terms of what 
had happened, that when he says I am prepared to defend 
VR and then talks about negotiating the reduction of price, 
I get the impression that that is a reaction of somebody 
who might have felt or understood that VR, as number one, 
10 
was under threat and that they might not actually get 
appointed hence wanting to defend them so that they either 
remain number one or they get appointed.  That is what I 
can think of. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there anything that was happening 
in the process that Mr Burger had become aware of that he 
might have interpreted as threatening VR Laser’s prospects 
of being appointed? 
MS MALAHLELA:   The only thing that I can think of is the 
20 
issues with LMT that we have already spoken about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is the only thing that I can think of 
but again, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And the issue of reducing 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 67 of 260 
 
the price, seems to me might only also have been – might 
have been intended to address maybe – to make sure that 
in terms of advantage to the company there was some 
benefit maybe in order to counteract any negativity or any 
negative factors because if you say this is my price and it 
is an acceptable to the company, you will not have to 
reduce it. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct, perhaps that was part of the 
ammunition that he was building to defend, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   But it makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But you would agree that from 
what he is saying and from his actions it looks like he was 
very supportive of VR laser getting the appointment.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how it looks like. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is how it looks like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If I can take you 
back for a moment to page 150.  We dealt with this in your 
20 
evidence before the adjournment.  42.26 refers to the 
scoring given to VR Laser. 
MS MALAHLELA:   One five, sorry? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   150 is the page number.  Maybe it is 
the numbers on the top left. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 68 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   150, do you have it? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   42.26 you refer to how the scoring 
was made up for VR Laser, 65.54%, broken down price, 
functionality and BBBEE.  Now what interests me is the 
price of financial offer.  So VR Laser was offering a price 
of R262.4 million for this project. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct, that is what appears, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And then you set out in 
10 
42.27.2 the financial offer, the price from LMT being the 
cheapest.  That is R165.6 million. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we are comparing LMT, 165 
million with VR Laser at 262 million, almost 100 million 
more expensive. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Despite that, VR Laser was 
given an overall scoring almost 1% more better than LMT 
because of the other considerations. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The BBBEE and the functionality. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which were weighted in the way that 
we have already seen where pricing was weighted less 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 69 of 260 
 
than the other items.  Okay.  Alright, can we go back to the 
emails, please? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay, which page are they on? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 528 now.  529 is the one that 
you have just dealt with from Mr Burger saying he is 
prepared to defend VR and that he – that he intended to 
see if he could negotiate a lower price from VR. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did he indicate in this email or 
anywhere else whether he was going to give the same 
10 
opportunity  to LMT or DCD to revise their prices? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, he did not.  That is also the other 
reason why I refused to include the quotation after I 
received it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Why was that?  Why did you refuse? 
MS MALAHLELA:   The other suppliers were not given an 
opportunity and supply chain did not solicit it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So I knew nothing about us requesting 
it. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then if we can look at what appears 
to be your reply at page 528.  Can you confirm if that is 
your reply? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now in your reply, if I may just take 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 70 of 260 
 
the witness through paragraphs that appear not to be in 
dispute and then just get to the real points, Chair.  The 
Patria Report was integrated in a technical scoring, that is 
something he had asked Mr Burger, have you incorporated 
reference to the Patria recommendation. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You mentioned that earlier. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But then in the second 
paragraph, 
they 
are 
not 
numbered 
but 
the 
second 
10 
paragraph of your email, you say: 
“VR Laser price is totally over our budget.” 
Now we have seen that their price that I took you to a 
moment ago was R262-odd million. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you say that: 
“That is totally over our budget, the maximum we 
can do is R1 million per unit all costs included 
based date 2014.” 
What were you referring to there? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   I was – we normally had values that 
were attached to line items that we were buying as part of 
the programme, so between finance and programmes they 
will tell us how much we are allowed on that particular line, 
then we know what we can negotiate for the company to be 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 71 of 260 
 
able to make profit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If this email at page 528 preceded that 
remark by Mr – that email by… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Burger? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Like it did on the next page, then it must 
be that this remark by Mr Burger that he would negotiate 
with VR Laser to reduce the price must have been 
prompted by your statement that their price was totally 
over the budget, is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Perhaps but that was not my intention. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it did precede. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Let us just check the date for 
correctness, so that email …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are the same date.  Ja, yours is in 
the morning at twenty eight minutes past eight, his is 
eighteen minutes past one. 
MS MALAHLELA:   One. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A.m. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is yours first – is his first or…? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Let us check the pages, 203 – where 
was this email …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe because of the trail of emails 
at some stage or another you may have… 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 72 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He might have known that there is 
concern with regard to the price, VR Laser’s price being 
above budget. 
MS MALAHLELA:   He might have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Perhaps just to 
assist, Chair, apart from the date and the time which 
reflects that Stephan Burger’s email was sent at 1.18 a.m. 
and your email was sent the same morning but at 8.28, the 
first paragraph, if you go back to Mr Burger’s email, starts: 
“Thank you, Celia, given all of that, I am prepared 
10 
to defend VR.  The one thing that I have not seen is 
the fact that Patria has strongly recommended VR 
as 
the 
preferred 
supplier 
but 
maybe 
this 
is 
integrated in your scoring.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then your email at page 528 
starts and deals with that. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Patria report was integrated in the 
20 
technical scoring. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So am I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So yours was a response to his. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 73 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the fact that VR Laser’s price was 
over the budget, did it not mean that they could not be 
appointed or given the job then as long as their price was 
over the budget? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So normally what we would do is that 
10 
we would take it to the committee, get mandate to 
negotiate with them to bring them within the budget price 
and if they did not agree to come within the budget price 
then we will get permission from management to proceed 
with this price. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Then still on page 
528 you add a further paragraph apart from dealing with 
the price being totally over budget, the third paragraph you 
say: 
20 
“Please note that the other big disadvantage for 
LMT and DCD was that we could not give them 
points 
for 
any 
BBBEE 
element. 
 
They 
have 
submitted letters stating that they are in a process 
of verification.” 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 74 of 260 
 
Elsewhere in your statement you have referred to expired 
certificates. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was the actual problem that led 
to them being given zero points?  Did they deserve zero 
points or was there a problem with their proof? 
MS MALAHLELA:   For us to be able to award points we 
needed a valid certificate which has not expired. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so then your letter – your 
email to Mr Burger continued: 
10 
“They have submitted letters saying that they are in 
the process of verification.  Should they submit the 
new certificates within the next fourteen days we 
have to include their points.  If they do it will 
change the picture with regard to the final total 
score.  Please refer to the BBBEE notes on the 
consolidated 
score 
sheet. 
 
I 
will 
schedule 
a 
meeting.” 
Etcetera. 
“…to do final recommendations …[intervenes] 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   So we included this to be apparent in 
the score sheet as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So you have raised two 
difficulties in your email.  The one is that the VR Laser 
price is …[intervenes] 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 75 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   High. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is going to take you way over budget 
and the second is that the scoring in which they scored 
just under 1% better than LMT could change if LMT and 
DCD submitted fresh BEE certificates which might affect – 
might entitle them to some points. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  We had given them an 
opportunity to submit within 14 days. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that have been proper of them to 
10 
– or for you to accept their BEE certificates after you have 
scored them?  Should they not make sure that they meet 
all the requirements by a certain date and if they have 
failed to meet those requirements they have got to be 
scored on that basis. 
MS MALAHLELA:   If the scoring …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Can they come back later and say here 
are the certificates in circumstances where as at a 
particular critical date they did not have those certificates? 
MS MALAHLELA:   If the certificate arrived after we 
20 
concluded the process then that would have been unfair 
but we, as the committee, took a decision to allow them to 
submit in the meeting, the clarifications meeting with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, does not like right to me but 
let us not – we do not have to stay on it, let us move on. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 76 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now is it correct that your email was 
also copied to Mr Teubes? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you.  Now I would like 
you to turn to page – sorry, Chair, page 535. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This appears to be an email from Mr 
Hendrik van den Heever.  Who was he? 
MS MALAHLELA:   He was the procurement officer 
responsible for the components that were being bought.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it is an email addressed to you 
and Cynthia. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, Cynthia was, I believe, speaking 
under correction, she was his manager at the time. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
 
And 
then 
there 
– 
was 
it 
accompanied by the documents that we then find from 537, 
supply chain manager – sorry, supply chain submission. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That looks correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Dated the 30 June and there is an 
analysis of the bids that we have already discussed and 
20 
then at page 541 a recommendation. 
“The following is recommended that a contract can 
be negotiated and an order placed on VR Laser 
Services for phase 2 of the Hoefyster contract with 
a total value of R262.5 million.” 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 77 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the very same figure that we 
have referred to as being above budget, is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I just have to – but we can take it as 
correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and then 712 this is a ceiling 
amount as further negotiations with VR Laser will take 
place to obtain a price below DLS budget.  Who prepared 
this memorandum, do you know? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was Henk I believe. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Henk? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Mr Van Den Heever. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Van Den Heever himself? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then we see on the next page, 
542 provision for signature, presumably by a number of 
people, your name being and title of Executive Manager 
Supply Chain, being at the top. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then also for approval by was it 
20 
Mr or Ms Africa? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Mr.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then Mr Thebus.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then on the right hand side De 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 78 of 260 
 
Klerk and Knoetze the CFO already mentioned and then the 
actual approval would be by Mr Burger as CEO of DLS.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Did you sign this did you 
approve this as a recommendation?  
MS MALAHLELA:   No I did not.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now we will get to your 
reasons in a moment.  Now can I take you please to page 
548.   
MS MALAHLELA:   548, yes.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you look at it…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry that is five? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Five four eight, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five four eight, okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is again a trail of two emails if 
you look at the second one dated the 30 t h of June 2014.  
Can that be right from VR Laser to yourself? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that is correct and it is headed 
up dated quotation for the fabrication of the Hoefyster 
20 
platform component it came from – I believe it is a Mr 
Arora CEO of VR Laser.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you confirm you received this 
email?  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 79 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   I do.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what he says is this: 
“Hi Celia please find attached the updated quotation 
for the Hoefyster platform components we are 
submitting after doing cost saving measures at our 
end.  We are thankful for the opportunity and 
assure the quality - presumably of work - and best 
service to deliver in time.” 
And was that then accompanied by the document we see 
from 549?   
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which appears to be there revised 
proposal.  
MS MALAHLELA:   That looks correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is headed updated quotation and 
can you tell the Chair what the price was now being quoted 
in terms of the updating, the revision of the prices? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I must just find the – are you talking 
about the final price? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was point one is talking about a 
quotation 
for 
the 
fabrication 
of 
Hoefyster 
platform 
components only so that means it is not necessarily the 
hub itself of 500 and has the further breakdown where you 
have got industrialisation unit learning curve serious 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 80 of 260 
 
production, that is why I am asking.  So I will just list all of 
them the three of them under point two.  So point one, 
under 
point 
two 
you 
have 
got 
unit 
price 
of 
the 
industrialisation of house.  PPM one to five which was now 
sitting at R1.3million and we have got point number two 
learning curve production which is units four to 20, which 
was sitting at R1.2million and series production units 
sitting in just over a million.       
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now how did these prices 
compare with the previously tendered prices from VR 
10 
Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   If I can just – they were less if I can 
just summarise it, they were less than the initial quotation 
that we had received.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I take you perhaps to page 153.    
MS MALAHLELA:   One five three, got it.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is a table that you put in your 
statement just explain to the Chair please what that table 
conveys? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I am at five five three so it is one five 
20 
three.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   One five three.  
MS MALAHLELA:   It will take a sec to find just opening 
the pages, yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Have you got it? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 81 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is part of your statement where 
you have set out a table, explain the table just in broad 
outline to the Chair please, what are you trying to convey 
there?   
MS MALAHLELA:   Let me just check what was here.  Can 
I read what I said outline?  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
MS MALAHLELA:   So on the same day…[intervene] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you in 4.2.38 are you? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
MS MALAHLELA:   I am just trying…[intervene] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, read it out please. 
MS MALAHLELA:   “On the same day I provided a draft 
submission to EXCO of Denel Land Systems to Mr 
Keevers for his consideration coincidently also on 
the 30 t h June 2014 I received an email from VR 
Laser ’s Chief Executive Officer at the time Mr JP 
Arora attaching a revised proposal which contained 
20 
a reduced price for the production of the armour 
hulls.”  
Then I included the table.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, so what does the table refer – 
well let me take you halfway down you will see an item that 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 82 of 260 
 
says series production units based on the DLS schedule 
initial price R120 400 986,00 revised price R100 084 
487,00, right.  Is this what you referring to as a reduction 
in prices? 
MS MALAHLELA:   If you look at the series production that 
is where the reduction stands out.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
The 
other 
prices 
appear 
to 
be…[intervene] 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Relatively the same.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   To remain the same.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is under the heading of 
quotation for armour hulls including Mine Protection and 
then the second half of the table is headed quotation for 
armour hulls excluding Mind Protection and there the unit 
price for units one to five and four to 20 remain the same 
as quoted previously, correct?   
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But then the next items series 
production units based on the DLS schedule there is a 
reduction from R100 108 446,00 to R100 100 601,00.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Now how did it come 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 83 of 260 
 
about that we are VR Laser in fact sent you the email we 
have just looked at which reflected yet again revised prices 
which were now in some respects substantially lower than 
what they have previously tendered?   
MS MALAHLELA:   I never received information as to who 
requested them but I know I did not request them as 
Supply Chain Team as far as I know did not request them 
to resubmit.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now please go in your 
statement to page 153.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry we know that – we know what 
Mr Burger had said to you about talking, negotiating with 
them to reduce their price outside the normal channels.  
Now from what you have said it looks like your policies and 
procedures permitted a stage where you could go back to a 
supplier and negotiate a reduction of price under certain 
circumstances.  Is that right?   
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that would be an official permitted 
process? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Through Supply Chain.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, through Supply Chain.  So do you 
have any idea why Mr Burger would have wanted the 
reduction of any price on the part of VR Laser to happen 
outside of that official process? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 84 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no idea? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I have no idea.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I take you then in your 
statement page 153 your paragraph 42.39.   
MS MALAHLELA:   One five three? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and you refer to the email that 
you have received from VR Laser, is that the email setting 
out the reduced prices?   
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you sent that to Mr Thebus and 
he reacted how? 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 
Interesting 
something 
to 
that…[intervene] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He said it was interesting? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yep.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  
MS MALAHLELA:   In – okay maybe you are still going 
there but initially he said interesting after we have done 
20 
the submission he asked me to include it which I refused.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Thebus? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it is all in writing in the emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you point out at the foot of page 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 85 of 260 
 
153 that the revised proposals that was received on the 
30 t h of June was still dated 24 t h of June.  Why is that 
significant and if so why? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was not really significant at my head 
it was that you could not really distinguish between that 
and the previous quotation that we received.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well of course it created the impression 
that as at 24 June 2014…[intervene]   
MS MALAHLELA:   We had received that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There price was this latest one.  
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yep.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was factually not true.   
MS MALAHLELA:   True.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you receive any revised 
further reduced prices from LMT or DCD?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Not that I can recall.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And were they invited by you or 
anybody else to your knowledge? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not that I know of.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now you have mentioned in 
answer to the question from the Chair a moment ago that 
you understood your processes to allow negotiation of 
better prices.  If that was allowed was it permissible to do 
that only for one of the tenderers or was it required that 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 86 of 260 
 
everybody had to be given a chance? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So if the recommended supplier was 
the winning bid then that was allowed.  Then we would 
recommend it and get mandate to go and negotiate the 
price further because they have already won but we will 
get approval first before engaging the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So could you have a situation where you 
have already where a particular supplier had won and you 
can still negotiate the price down?   
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, in certain cases. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that something that could happen? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, in certain cases we did that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Gathered within our baseline that we 
had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I guess that you would be 
negotiating from a weak position would you not where they 
have already known that they have won as opposed to 
negotiating before the final decision?   
MS MALAHLELA:   True, we would not necessarily let them 
20 
know that they had won. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not tell them?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright so if your negotiations 
did not yield a satisfactory reduction…[intervene] 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 87 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Then we would go back.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you could go back, ja okay alright.  
MS MALAHLELA:   If we did not get permission to proceed 
with that price.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, yes Mr Kennedy.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair if I can just have a 
moment.  Right now you referred to a response that you 
received from Mr Thebus in your paragraph 4.2.40.1 and in 
42.40.2 you say that he recommended that the reduced 
price contained in the revised proposal received from VR 
10 
Laser Mr Arora earlier that day that evening be included in 
the draft submission to EXCO and it be sent to Mr Burger.  
Is that correct?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now what did you feel about that 
request or instruction from Mr Thebus? 
MS MALAHLELA:   How I felt? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, what did you feel.  
MS MALAHLELA:   That it was not proper that is why I 
responded by saying that we could not do that.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I take you to the email that your 
statement refers to page 562.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Page five six two.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At the foot of the page five six two.  
MS MALAHLELA:   I am almost there, got it.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 88 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right at the foot of the page Reenen 
that is Mr Thebus there is an email right at the bottom 
says: 
“Thanks Celia I suggest that you update it with the 
latest quote info” 
Update what, Ms Malahlela?  
MS MALAHLELA:   The submission that I had sent to him.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay: 
“That you update it with the latest quote info from 
VR and then email it to Stephan.”  
10 
Which Stephan is that?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Stephan Burger.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Burger: 
“For his call and further processing.” 
Then just above that seems to be an email from you in 
response: 
“Dear Reenen are you happy with the content as is.  
I cannot pick up the changes you have made to the 
doc could be because I am doing it from IPad.” 
And then you say: 
20 
“RE - updated proposal for governance reasons.  
We cannot include it in the evaluation as the 
evaluation is already concluded and signed.  We 
can only take into consideration the prices as 
submitted by the closing date.  Should the Board 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 89 of 260 
 
give us the mandate to negotiate we can use this 
proposal as a starting point for negotiation.”    
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just explain that to the Chair please 
bearing in mind your answer to his earlier question about 
when and to what extent there can be negotiation? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay so on this I was highlighting that 
it would be improper of us to include that quotation as part 
of the quotations that we had received during the process.  
But if the proposal that we get permission to negotiate is 
10 
granted as part of our proposal that we were submitting to 
the Board then we could use that as a starting position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that reasoning I am fine with it 
but in the same email you say: 
“We can only take into consideration the prices as 
submitted by the closing date.” 
Again I have no problem that sounds logical to me but why 
is that answer not good enough in regard to the BBBEE 
certificates, why should they not be told if you did not have 
– if you did not comply with the BBBEE requirements by 
20 
the closing date you cannot come after you see that see 
where I was coming from. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why is that reason that you advance 
for saying that VR Laser cannot bring their price after the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 90 of 260 
 
closing date.  Why is that answer not good enough to say 
to the other companies you cannot bring your certificates 
or BBBEE certificates after the closing date?  
MS MALAHLELA:   So on that on the BBBEE we did not 
only give one company an opportunity to submit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the closing date?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was in your policies?  
MS MALAHLELA:   It was not in the policy but we did not 
give one company an opportunity to submit we gave all 
10 
companies an opportunity to resubmit a valid BBBEE 
certificate within 14 days.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but if the policy does not allow you 
to do it after why is it not wrong to do it after for all three, 
why is it right to do it for all three if the policy does not 
permit you to do it for anybody after the closing date? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay, the policy did not – how do I put 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They permitted, it did not say you could 
do it, did it?  
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, it did not but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why would it be right to do it you 
would be going outside policy would you not?  Just like you 
would be going outside policy to accept this price from VR 
Laser.  Would you not agree?   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 91 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   So if it is during the process and we 
had decided that we are going to ask for clarification or 
additional 
documentation 
that 
was 
allowed 
before 
everything else is closed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I – maybe I can understand that 
there is a time within which you may seek clarification 
exactly when that time might be another point but that I 
can understand but I cannot understand why if you have 
got a closing date to say everybody must put in all their 
requirements by this date and the policy does not have a 
10 
provision to say under the following circumstances you can 
allow somebody who did not meet the deadline in terms of 
certain requirements to come back and meet them.  I do 
not understand why you can do it you see because the 
whole idea is that the parties – everybody must meet the 
requirements they are told what the requirements are, they 
are told what the closing date is.  They know that they 
must satisfy all these requirements by that date, do you 
understand?            
MS MALAHLELA:   I do understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MALAHLELA:   But the reason why we allow then in 
this case for the BBBEE certificate which it was part of the 
clarification that we asked for this during the clarification.  
Not somebody else outside Supply Chain going to request 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 92 of 260 
 
on our – without us asking them to request.  It was Supply 
Chain and the cross-functional team that during the 
process they decided that we will allow the suppliers to 
submit the BBBEE certificates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will continue but I think VR Laser 
would be entitled to say no, no they did not meet the 
requirements by that time you cannot give them another 
chance your policies do not do that and if you say I cannot 
reduce my price after the closing dates they also cannot so 
but that is fine I understand what your committee is 
10 
thinking was.          
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now your 
statement then refers to the response from Mr Thebus did 
he accept your concerns or properly address your concerns 
that you had raised about the price not being capable of 
being adjusted at least at that stage?  
MS MALAHLELA:   He accepted that but he stated that 
they as EXCO will then take this into consideration. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
He 
said 
they 
will 
take 
it 
into 
consideration?  
MS MALAHLELA:   At EXCO.  
CHAIRPERSON:   At EXCO? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 93 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay which suggested he did not 
agree with you with your point.  
MS MALAHLELA:   He agreed that we do not include it as 
part of the evaluation but he said that he will then go and 
include it – they will take a decision to include it at EXCO.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand what he was saying 
because it looks like it is two contradictory positions 
because the purpose of including it in the submission is so 
that it can be taken into account.  So you are saying it 
should not be included, he agrees with you.  
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says they will take into account 
anyway.  
MS MALAHLELA:   When my submission gets to EXCO 
they will take it into account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even though it will not be in the 
submission.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If we can look again at page 562 and 
20 
look at his response to your email, the top email do you 
see that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “Hello Celia no changes made from a 
governance perspective I see the sequence as 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 94 of 260 
 
follows.  The team evaluated the three proposals 
made a formal recommendation to EXCO.  We have 
received 
the 
team’s 
recommendation. 
EXCO 
thereafter includes this unsolicited proposal as part 
of their proposal to DCO.” 
What is DCO?    
MS MALAHLELA:   Denel Corporate Office.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “Corporate Office for approvals since 
they believe it does not make a difference in the 
order of preference as recommended by the team 
10 
but only strengthens the view.  The Board paper is 
therefore the EXCO paper for approval and I am 
comfortable to include it in the Board paper that you 
are writing on EXCO’s behalf. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yep, which he also signed.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which he? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Which he also signed.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and so this would be a paper 
recommending to Denel Corporate Board, is that correct?  
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and that you were to write on 
EXCO’s behalf.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So at that stage the process was still 
thaw 
whatever 
EXCO 
decided 
was 
merely 
a 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 95 of 260 
 
recommendation it would still have to go to the Board for 
approval.    
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was required on the basis of 
your evidence earlier in terms of the delegation.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so let us go back to your 
statement 
page 
154 
you 
referred 
to 
42.40.46 
to 
that…[intervene]  
MS MALAHLELA:   One five four? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   One five four yes please. The foot of 
page 154 you say: 
“The submission to the Board was prepared as 
recommended by Mr Thebus and I provided him with 
a draft of the same.” 
Did you in fact prepare that recommendation?     
MS MALAHLELA:   I prepared the document.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The document to go to the Board?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On behalf of EXCO? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, as instructed by Mr Thebus.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you included this reduced price of VR 
because he instructed you to include it?   
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, but it was not included in the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 96 of 260 
 
score sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS MALAHLELA:   It was included in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if you can just keep your finger 
then at page 155 and just look quickly please at page 573.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Page five? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Five seven three.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Got it.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the top email is from you to 
10 
Stephan Burger: 
“Please 
find 
the 
attached 
document 
for 
your 
perusal.”  
And did you attach the document we see from page 575?  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I did.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is headed company 
confidential Denel (SOC) Ltd., Denel Board meeting to be 
held on and then its left blank.  So was this the draft of a 
report that was aimed at, was meant to be submitted to the 
Board at a particular meeting for approval?  
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And just to confirm what you just told 
the Chair that this was prepared on the basis of Mr Thebus 
recommendation 
that 
this 
document 
would 
reflect 
a 
reduced price of VR Laser even though the scoring would 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 97 of 260 
 
not be changed to reflect that.    
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now you then say in your 
statement that you were requested by Mr Burger to change 
that submission and address it to Mr Salugee.  Tell us how 
that came about? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So on the – I think about now roughly 
around three or four months lapsed after I had sent the 
Board the submissions then that is when the conflict of 
interest I believe we will get to it a declaration came into 
10 
play in between and all of that and out of the blue Mr 
Burger – a meeting was called I am not really sure; I 
cannot remember properly who called the meeting but I 
have got the invitation.  We had a meeting with Mr Burger 
and Mr Thebus about the submission and I was requested 
now to change the submission from a Board submission 
which I had drafted now to the Group CE submission.   
CHAIRPERSON:   At that time the Group CEO was Mr 
Salugee.     
MS MALAHLELA:   True.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So this was still under the Board, 
Denel Board that was Chaired by Mr Mantsha or you cannot 
remember.   
MS MALAHLELA:   I am not really sure who was the Chair 
at the time I can check.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 98 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well it must be because by the time – 
ja know I think it must be okay, alright.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright so you were then requested 
by Mr Burger to change the submissions so that it was no 
longer a submission to the Board for approval but a 
submission to the GCE for approval?    
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did he explain why there should 
be this change? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot remember…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually I think I may be wrong I think it 
might be the Board before Mr Mantsha’s Board.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, I think so but we can check.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am sorry Mr Kennedy I interrupted 
you.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair no problem.  Did Mr 
Burger explain why it was no longer to be a document 
submitted to the Board for its approval but submitted to the 
GCE for approval?  
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot remember the exact reasons 
20 
that he gave let me just look at CM37 the documents that 
we talking about.  If you can help me to find it, which page 
is it on?   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, you will find it at page 584.  
MS MALAHLELA:  584 is right at the back.  Ja – I cannot 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 99 of 260 
 
remember correctly what the reasons he that he gave were 
at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you understand Mr Burger to be 
saying that he now expected that Mr Saloojee would give the 
final approval not the board?  Or did you understand the 
instruction to be send it to Mr Saloojee so that he can 
consider it and he can then make a recommendation to the 
board? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That was my understanding and as you 
can see on page 593 of that same document that we spoke 
10 
about I put recommendation to Mr Saloojee not approval. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes that was the – that was the 
previous formulation? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But what he was now asking you to do 
as I understand it was to – was to send it… 
MS MALAHLELA:  Send it for approval. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Malahlela Mr Kennedy took – put 
two propositions to you and when he finished the second one 
20 
you said that was your understanding. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not clear which one of the two? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was you understanding that Mr Burger 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 100 of 260 
 
wanted Mr Saloojee to make a recommendation to the Denel 
board after reading the submission? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was that your understanding? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes.  That is why if I lost that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:  You will see that I said recommended and 
I put Riaz Saloojee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So this would still comply with the 
10 
requirement that the board would still have to give its 
approval? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Then if you can go please to page 
604.  That is a submission addressed to EXCO and we see at 
the end of the document page 611 where it is signed.  There 
is a signature by you. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  At the foot of 611 on the 16 October 
2014, do you recall signing that? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Let me just double check that is on page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  611. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
And 
then 
on 
612 
it 
is 
also 
recommended by the other officials Africa, Thebus, Burger 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 101 of 260 
 
himself, Wessels and Mhlontlo.  And then at the top of page 
613 there is a provision for Mr Saloojee to approve or reject 
– it does not seem that the relevant word was deleted it still 
appears approved/reject but it is signed by Mr Saloojee. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Also on the 16 October 2014.  Now do 
you know whether the – whether the recommendation was 
ever approved not only by Mr Saloojee but by the board? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Let me just – I just want to check 
something for you.  So in between the session that I had with 
10 
Mr Burger and Mr Teubes I must just recall I will check my 
emails who I spoke to.  It was – if you look at paragraph 2 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is page 606.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  You will now see that we no longer buying 
the quantity that we were buying.  The quantity has now 
reduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does one see that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  You will see that we are talking about 
20 
including 37 new variants, new requirements which are not 
ordered yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to read the relevant parts?  Is 
it on page … 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I can read the whole paragraph.  So 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 102 of 260 
 
in 203:  
“The board of Denel authorised the signing of 
production contract for the 238 including…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  Are you reading 
back in your statement? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I am reading in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page are you reading? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Am I confusing myself now?  Let me 
just… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Are you not at page 606? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  I am at page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had said we must go to 606. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes page 606 but now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said paragraph 2. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Paragraph 2.  I must just follow my line of 
thought here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“In 2013 the board of Denel authorised the signing.” 
MS MALAHLELA:  No I apologies I am confusing myself.  I 
am confusing myself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Apologies.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:  I am confusing myself. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright it has been long okay. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 103 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is a question you – Mr Kennedy 
had put to you I guess which led to the confusion. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy you want to repeat your 
question then? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I think let me – let me get to really the 
bottom line of this – the recommendation here.  Can I take 
you at 611. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is a recommendation and it reads: 
10 
“In line with the discussions articulated herein we 
hereby recommend the approval of 
a. The Group CEO of Denel that he should 
approve the DLS recommended selection of 
the Hull supplier.  That recommendation was 
VR Laser.” 
Correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
“A 
mandate 
to 
enter 
into 
contract 
20 
negotiations 
for 
the 
manufacturing 
and 
supply of the Hoefyster platform hulls for the 
183 armoured vehicles to ensure that the 
total contracts price fits within the deal S 
budget” 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 104 of 260 
 
So here it is 183 is that what you were referring to earlier? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja.  That is where my brain was going. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So now the quantities had now reduced. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And would that then allow VR Laser to 
keep its original tendered price but still keep within the 
overall budget because less – a lesser number of vehicles 
was now being purchased. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes.  But the reasons given by the 
program guys I must just remember but Reardon signed this 
10 
as their – Mr Teubes signed this as the responsible person 
for – as the COO.  The quantities – the data packs were not 
ready to order the delta between 183 and 270. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just make this point about the 
different numbers so that I understand it.  Originally what 
was contemplated and in what numbers and now what was 
being contemplated and in what numbers? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Okay.  So when we went out on the 
quotations – when the DLS went out on quotations RFO’s 
they wanted to buying 270 I must just check correct – 
20 
confirm it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  270. 
MS MALAHLELA:  270. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 105 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    217 or 270? 
MS MALAHLELA:   217. 
CHAIRPERSON:  217  
MS MALAHLELA:  We can just confirm it in the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think 217. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes 217 hulls. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then now? 
MS MALAHLELA:  So subsequently now after a few months 
10 
had lapsed then we were told that I must just – it is in the 
documents somewhere.  That the data packs are not ready to 
procure the delta between 270 and 183. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes so that means we cannot actually 
place an order without the requirement – without the data 
packs essentially because it was a different variant.  It is all 
in the documents you can just find it and refer to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the number now would be what? 
MS MALAHLELA:  The number would then be with this 183 
that you see under recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So that means my client does not require 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 106 of 260 
 
what – it is not ready to receive what they initially said they 
wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I can take you at page 606 paragraph 
2. 
MS MALAHLELA:  60? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  6 paragraph 2.   
MS MALAHLELA:  Paragraph 2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You say in 20 – the document says: 
“In 2013 the board of Denel authorised the 
10 
signing of the production contract for the 238 
including 34 new variants new requirements 
by SANDF badger vehicles systems with 
Armscor.  In order to execute the Armscor 
contract DLS now wishes to sign the contract 
and accordingly place an order for the 
manufacturing and supply of the armoured 
hulls for these vehicles.  16 of these vehicles 
are manufactured in Finland and 217 will be 
manufactured in South Africa.” 
20 
So this is – is this the 217 that you were wanting to procure? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Locally. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 107 of 260 
 
“At this stage DLS has not finalised the base 
line for the 34 new variants.  We therefore 
cannot place an order on the full 217 
intention at this stage is to place an order for 
only 183 platform hulls”. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is what I was looking for. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is this – is this reason for why it went 
down for – from 217 to 183? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  And it was also verified by Mr Teubes by 
his signature because he knows the requirements of his 
people. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in this submission it is contemplated 
that it was the Group CEO who was going to approve or 
reject.  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and you – you prepared the 
20 
submission? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I prepared the submission with the new 
requirements in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I prepared the submission with – for the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 108 of 260 
 
new requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  But the initial requirements was 217 I 
prepared the board submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So now the quantities have gone down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now – but the – that the approval should 
come from the Group CEO was still not in order in terms of 
the policies of the company, is it not? 
MS MALAHLELA:  We can just check how much it was for? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we still talking – it seems to me 
way beyond the delegated authority that you talked – told me 
about in the morning. 
MS MALAHLELA:  We just need to add it up if the price is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was your understanding at that time 
that it was within his mandate? 
MS MALAHLELA:  True. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your understanding? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay we can check later on. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright then just to go back to 611.  We 
have dealt with a and b and then c is that there should be 
approved that the necessary commission for Mr Stephan 
Burger to sign the contract for the manufacture and supply of 
the Hoefyster platform hulls for the 183 vehicles.  Place the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 109 of 260 
 
associated purchase order when the condition is in [a] is 
met.  That is the Group CEO’s approval.  Contracting LMT as 
a single source supplier for the vehicle rear internal fit.  So 
that is LMT would get some business. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then after the completion of the 
joint task force design that the additional 34 vehicle hulls 
rear internal fit and back doors be contracted on the same 
principles. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  You have a view as to whether 
what was – what was – had been recommended here 
together with your recommendation was in fact compliant 
with the processes and procedures that regulated Supply 
Chain in Denel. 
MS MALAHLELA:  What was being recommended by EXCO? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In – by you and your colleagues in the 
document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words was your view at that time 
that there was nothing wrong with processing this in this way 
20 
in terms of the company’s Supply Chain Management Policy?  
Were you aware whether it was within or outside of the 
policies to do it this way? 
MS MALAHLELA:  In terms of the Delegation Of Authority 
and the amounts? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 110 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:  The price was in my view the price was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was within. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Was within. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  And they did not require – 
CHAIRPERSON:  The board. 
MS MALAHLELA:  They did not – when I say they I mean my 
client – the end user – they did not require – was not ready 
to order the additional quantities because the base lines 
10 
were not ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. But your recollection is that you did 
not pick up – you were not aware of anything that may have 
been in breach of the policies with the submission? 
MS MALAHLELA:  If I talk – if we look at e and d which is 
now bringing LMT which was not part of the original 
submission this was part of the EXCO recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  The cross-functional team had done its 
own evaluation which was not changed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can I take you to the 
same memorandum page 610. 
MS MALAHLELA:  610. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  At the foot of the page there is a table.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 111 of 260 
 
You see that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that sets out the current VR Laser 
price of R1.209 million giving you a total price for 183 units 
of 221.2 million, correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:  True. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Does that reflect the – the prices that 
they had previously tendered? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I must just double check.  It looks like it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well perhaps let me approach it a 
10 
different way.  Just go back to that table please. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And in the very last item is the 
requested mandate/ maximum price of R1 050 000.00 per 
unit which would give you a total price for the 183 of 
R192.15 million. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now the reduction in the numbers of 
vehicles you have already explained that that was not too – 
to adjust the overall price to bring it down under the R200 
20 
million if I understood you correctly? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  It was … 
MS MALAHLELA:  That was my understanding. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes that was your…. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 112 of 260 
 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
Unless 
somebody 
had 
a 
different 
intention when they said the vehicles have decreased. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But what you suggesting in this 
memorandum is firstly that VR Laser should be appointed but 
you have a problem with the – with the budget and their 
price which would give a total cost for the project of R221 
million should be reduced by negotiation. 
MS MALAHLELA:  I must just read this properly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry say again? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I must just go through this section 
10 
properly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So if it was brought down to R192 
million you would not need the board approval. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  But was that the objective of 
what was being done here?  Was it to avoid the board having 
to consider it and give its approval? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Now in hindsight if I look at it and the fact 
20 
that the – I was requested to change it from a board 
submission which I initially put forward to now a Group CEO 
submission it appears there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now was the idea that the balance of the 
hulls now having reduced the number to 183 would be 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 113 of 260 
 
ordered at some other stage in the future or was the idea 
that the whole project now would be on the basis of 183 and 
not 217 as originally intended? 
MS MALAHLELA:  So the idea if you go back to page 606 
under background the first paragraph the procurement of the 
new variants which is the delta that we were talking about – 
variance platform hulls will only be made once the base lines 
have been firmed up with frozen data packs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair it is getting close to one o’clock 
10 
but I am almost finished this part of the witness’ statement.  
May I complete that section at least? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us finish that part yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes thank you.  Now can I take you 
back to your statement page 155. 
MS MALAHLELA:  155. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 4.2.48.  155. 
MS MALAHLELA:  I have got it.  Paragraph? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  4.2.48 you refer to the fact that as we 
have seen on the document Mr Saloojee signed for his 
20 
approval.  Do you know whether it was ever submitted to the 
board? 
MS MALAHLELA:  No I got the document from Stephan 
saying it is approved we can place the order. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now 4.2.49 refers to Patria 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 114 of 260 
 
which we have dealt with already.  You refer to the fact that 
the memorandum says that LMT offered a price that was 
unreasonably too low for the number of manufacturing hours 
and material costs associated with the fabrication of each 
hull.  Was that your view or did you get that information or 
opinion from someone else? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I – now trying to recall. I am just trying to 
recall whether it was discussed in the committee’s part of the 
Adjudication that we were doing but what we did following 
that was that we got the prices to – from Patria in terms of 
10 
the input costs.  I think it was – we must just confirm it.  It 
was 
mentioned 
as 
part 
of 
the 
cross-functional 
team 
adjudication but let us confirm it.  I do not want to lie. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright.  Then 4.2.50 deals with the 
price being over budget and the approval for negotiating to a 
maximum of R1 050 000.00.  And then you refer in 4.2.51 to 
negotiations that took place with VR Laser which included 
the reduction of the price.  That began in November 2014.  
There was a meeting on that date where Denel negotiated 
for a production price of R1 million per unit for each hull and 
20 
payment with a deposit.  And you refer to the people invited 
to that meeting – were you part of that meeting? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes I was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes you refer to it – yourself as having 
been invited but that meeting took place and did it involve 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 115 of 260 
 
the people at the top of page 156? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Jiyane from VR Laser, Van Der Merwe 
also from VR Laser,  Mr Teubes and yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  From – from DLS. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now what was the upshot of that?  You 
were trying to get a – a price that did not exceed R1.05 
million you proposed R1 million as the – as the unit price.  
10 
Was that accepted? 
MS MALAHLELA:  No it was not accepted.  We have got a 
few emails to that effect reflecting that they did not accept 
the price and then eventually they sent an email with – little 
bit of price reduction which I [00:22:40] that I must accept – 
accept including the base data. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry just speak up a bit I did not hear 
that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Oh sorry.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Teubes said what instructed? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  There is an email where Mr Teubes 
instructed that I accept the price including the base data 
proposal that was made on an email.  But it is all in writing. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I can take you to page 616.   
CHAIRPERSON:  616 or 615 are you starting from the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 116 of 260 
 
beginning? 
MS MALAHLELA:  616 have you got that page? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right are these the emails that are 
referred to in your statement? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In relation to whether or not the R1 
million was acceptable and the deposit of 15. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Hm correct.  And as you can see it says 
that the proposed price of R1 million unit with a deposit of 
10 
15% so they were haggling on condi – it was on – accepted 
on condition that we agree on the November base date.  So 
it was not accepted as we were negotiating it.  Am I 
confusing myself.  Let me just look at this.  So the first 
discussion was on the 14 November 2014 where we have got 
an email from Pieter Van Der Merwe from VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that at the foot of page 616? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes, yes.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Sorry I am – I actually made an error a 
bit earlier Chair sorry it is all in the email.  My memory is 
failing me.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes so what is the correct position? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 117 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  So the correct position on here is that in 
light of the circumstances we would request you to confirm 
whether we can agree on the production price of R1 million 
plus 15% deposit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But then he says:  Should you 
agree we suggest a date and time be arranged.  Was it in 
fact ultimately agreed to? 
MS MALAHLELA:  It was ultimately agreed to because on 
the 18 November you will see where Mr Teubes says to me 
we have tried our luck so that means we did not get to where 
10 
we wanted to get to.  My call is that we accept the base date 
of June 2014 and do not argue it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  It is page 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:  615? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It appears from these emails that what 
was agreed to was the base date but was it ever actually 
recorded that there was an agreement as to the price being 
20 
R1 million per unit or for that matter R1 050 000.00 per unit. 
MS MALAHLELA:  I – I need to look at the documentation 
[00:26:22] might have been recorded as part of the order 
being placed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 118 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  But we can confirm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright.  Thank you.  Perhaps this would 
be a convenient time to suggest the adjournment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment 
we will resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Malahlela, you refer in your 
10 
affidavit to a Mail & Guardian article.  Can I take you please 
to your statement to page 156? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   156. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I am on it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And just sum up what actually 
happened.  You referred to your having been sent a copy of 
a Mail & Guardian article.  Who sent it to you? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was, amongst other people, Mr Henk 
van den Heever. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And if you turn please to page 
622. 
MS MALAHLELA:   622...   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On the... about halfway down, there is 
an email, apparently, from you to Mr Burger.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 119 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   If I can just... 622...  I found it, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Halfway down. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you refer him to that article. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you... just read out what you say.  
“He is the president...”  Just read that out, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Reading from 622? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   622. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Halfway down Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
“Dear Stephan.  Please see the attached article 
below.  Is it the president and his family his/friends 
allowed to benefit from SOE procurement contract?  
If it is indeed true that the president has association 
with VR Laser, I believe that VR Laser should have 
declared their interest in this regard.   
I recommend that we request VR Laser to disclosure 
20 
the real shareholders behind their black equity 
shareholding.   
Can we please have a meeting tomorrow when you 
are back in the office to discuss the way forward.   
I cannot have any further dealing with VR Laser until 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 120 of 260 
 
this allegation has been cleared.” 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now it is correct that the article is 
attached on page 263 on a cover of an email to you from 
Mr Van den Heever that you mentioned earlier? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now we do not need to go into the 
detail 
contents 
of 
the 
article. 
 
Just 
summarise 
what 
concerned you about the article.  What was it saying that ran 
alarm bells for you? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was essentially stating that VR Laser 
10 
had connection to the president and they were benefiting van 
state owned procurement contracts, in a nutshell. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Your affidavit refers to allegations of 
connections with the Gupta Family and also Mr Duduzane 
Zuma.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Exactly.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if we keep at that page, page 622.  
We see what appears to be a response from Mr Burger at the 
top of the page and he says: 
“A hundred percent Celia.  Our dealings need to 
20 
squeaky clean.” 
 
And then he refers to arrangements being made for a 
meeting to discuss as you had requested.  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now what happened thereafter? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 121 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Thereafter...  I cannot remember exactly 
what the exact details of the meeting but we agreed that I 
will sent a declaration of interest form accompanied by the 
letter, asking them to declare their interest if any.  Because 
we did not know if the allegations in the newspaper article 
was true or not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can take you to page 632.   
MS MALAHLELA:   I found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the letter with your name and 
signature.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am battling to see who it is 
addressed to.  There is an address that is inserted but there 
is no name of the company or person to whom the letter is 
...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   It is addressed to the...  the address that 
you see there, 10 Haggie Road in Johannesburg.  It is the 
VR Laser address. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And it says:  Attention CEO.  And it was 
20 
emailed to VR Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So was it sent to VR Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did they respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you not include the VR Laser’s 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 122 of 260 
 
name? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was just an oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:   But if you look at the reference, it 
actually starts with VR.  It was just a simple oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:   But if you look at the content of the letter 
itself, it does refer to VR Laser. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then if you can turn please to page 
634 and tell the Chair please, did you receive a response to 
this request for a declaration of interest? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   From VR Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is that what we find at pages 634 
and 635? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if you look at the letter, 635 says 
in the second paragraph: 
“We confirm that the shareholders in VR Laser 
Services are Elgasolve (Pty) Ltd, 74.9% and Craig 
Shaw(?) 
Investment 
(Pty) 
Ltd, 
25.1% 
of 
the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 123 of 260 
 
shareholders and neither have any involvement of 
conflict with doing business with Denel in any way 
whatsoever.   
All 
shareholders 
and 
directors 
are 
private 
individuals who do not work for government.” 
 
Were you satisfied with that response? 
MS MALAHLELA:   If you look at the full declaration without 
the necessarily referring to the last part, I was satisfied.  But 
furthermore, I... there was a clause in the contract stating 
that should they found...  
10 
 
Should they later be found to have been unethical or a 
lie, we can determinate the contract at any time.  So I was 
satisfied that with this document that I have, if they lied then 
we can determinate the contract to protect the company. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if you turn next to page 637. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is an exchange of emails between 
you and mister ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Mlambo? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mlambo.  The one at the bottom is 
20 
from Bennie Dejani to yourself.  He is the Chief Operating 
Officer of VR Laser.   
“Please find attached letter and the completed 
declaration.” 
 
Are those the documents we just looked at? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 124 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then in the middle of the page, the 
email from you to Denis Mlambo.  You have already 
confirmed he is the Group Head of Procurement. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He will be our next witness Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You then say: 
“Denis, please find attached the ownership details 
as requested.” 
10 
 
Had you any dealing with Mr Mlambo at group level in 
relation to this issue of ownership and possible conflict of 
interest? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, we used to have a lot of informal 
discussions 
with 
regard 
to 
VR 
Laser 
and 
my 
dissatisfaction(?) with it, off the record.  And in some cases, 
I would sent him emails and delete them but on his side, I do 
not think he deleted them.  He would have them, I think. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you appear to responded...  
Sorry.  He appears to respond to you, at the top of the page 
20 
on the 2n d of September. 
“Thanks for the info.  Who are the individual 
shareholders of Elgasolve and Craig Shaw. “ 
 
So what you have been given was a ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Company. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 125 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...information that Elgasolve and Craig 
Shaw were shareholders in VR Laser, an insurance in broad 
terms in the letter that nobody worked for government and 
there was no conflict.   But Mr Mlambo was then saying:  But 
let us find who the owners are. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Let us probe a bit further. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Was anything done by you 
following up from that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, Mr Mlambo took it over and he cc’d 
me on the emails to VR Laser probing further.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Mlambo will deal with it in his 
evidence but you say in your affidavit: 
“Mr JP Aurora confirmed that Elgasolve which had a 
74.9% stake in VR Laser was owned by Salim Essa.” 
 
So that is what came out of Mr Mlambo’s exercise to 
...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Probing. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...to find details. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Now can we turn in 
20 
your affidavit, page 158 to another agreement.  This is a new 
topic we need to cover with you. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is a single source supplier 
contracted DOS awarded to VR Laser in 2015.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 126 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I am just going to, if I may Chair, 
just to skip through a couple of paragraphs that appear to be 
more background that you would be able to read that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Relating to technical input and so 
forth.  And may I skip then to page 159, paragraph 5.3?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you have mentioned in the earlier 
paragraphs that you had been asked to deal with the 
10 
procurement side for a proposed contract for a sole supplier, 
Single source. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   and you deal in paragraph 5.3 with a 
requested draft submission.  So were you asked for a 
submission, to prepare a submission? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I was asked to prepare a 
submission and it is all in writing in the emails that you see 
20 
here. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Right. 
 
And 
you 
made 
a 
recommendation.  Can I take you page 651? 
MS MALAHLELA:   651, okay.  651. Got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now that is a brief email from you to 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 127 of 260 
 
Mr Thebus.  And it got the subject:  Group CEO Submission.   
“Please find attached the attached document as 
requested.” 
 
And it is just the email.  It seems that the attachment 
has not been included in the copy that has been raised.  
Unless it is the document.  Perhaps you can help me 
Ms Malahlela.  Is it at page 654? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I need to double-check.  Yes, it is 
the one because in the recommendation I had included a 
note. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Sorry about the confusion.  
MS MALAHLELA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you made a recommendation to 
go out and tender for this contract. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And why did you recommend that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   We could not appoint or contract a 
supplier without following a process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  At this stage ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Now that is a tender in 
20 
relation to... that is in relation to which tender?  I just want 
to ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   The MOU. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...move away from the one that you have 
been dealing with the whole morning, is it not? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 128 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we have moved away from that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What are we on now? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if you will look at the heading 
Chair to paragraph 5 on page 158.  It deals with the 
memorandum of agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is the one that we are dealing 
with now. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   2015.  It is the Single source. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sole supplier contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In favour of the same company? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In favour of the same company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But it is a different transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And this one is to do what? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is a...  Well, can you just confirm 
Ms Malahlela? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Malahlela. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you look at 5.1.  It is for the 
appointment of what? 
MS MALAHLELA:   5.1, which page, sorry? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, page 158. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 129 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   158. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is of the supply of tariffed(?) FCM’s 
hulls and related armour deals components.  Is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it was complex fabrications.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you start that wording with the 
words Single source. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Is there any significance to this 
being a contract for a single source? 
10 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 
So 
I 
received 
a 
request 
from 
engineering. 
 
I 
will 
call 
it 
Engineering 
Technical.  
Substantiating why there is a need for a single... for having a 
single supplier to assist them with fabrication going forward.  
So those were submitted to me and Riaan(?) then asked me 
to...   
 
Mr Thebus asked me to do a motivation but in the 
motivation, instead of having the name of the supplier, I 
wrote that a proper process should be followed if the 
strategic that the company wants to take and it should not be 
20 
longer than three years.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  The earlier transaction was also for 
the supply of hulls? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That one was just for hulls.  So 
essentially, this one, my understanding was that it was going 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 130 of 260 
 
to cover a whole lot of different fabrication on different 
programmes going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but basically, it is also hulls just like 
previously?  Different brands. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Different brand. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Steel plates and different stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  And then the... and there is still 
10 
components and so on? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja.  That is why I am saying, it went 
beyond just hulls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was a lot of steel component, complex 
fabrications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were there various manufacturers in 
the marketplace which could compete for this type of 
product? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Once one of them was awarded the 
contract, it would then be the only supply to Denel of those 
components? 
MS MALAHLELA:   For the duration of the contract. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 131 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For the duration of the contract, yes.  
Which you recommended should be no more than three 
years. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Exactly.  After having followed a proper 
process in this selection. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it mean that you award the 
contract to appoint a particular manufacturer and say to 
them for this particular period, you are going to be our only 
supplier of these materials? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is the understanding but we had not 
discussed that up to that detail up to that particular time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I am talking in general to say, 
when you say somebody is going to be a single supplier.  Is 
that what it means? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it is a single source.  You only 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for a certain period, they have 
exclusive right to supply you with whatever? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I mentioned earlier that the 
attachment had not been attached to the email, at least in 
the copy that we have before the Commission.  Can I take 
you in your affidavit.  I do not need to take you to the actual 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 132 of 260 
 
paragraph but you referred to Mr Thebus responding and he 
changed the submission document.   
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I may have confused things earlier 
when taking you to that document.  If I can take you back to 
page 653? 
MS MALAHLELA:   653...  On it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is an email from Mr Thebus to 
yourself, 20 March 2015. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he says: 
“I have changed the angle but we asked for approval 
from Riaan(?).  Please see attached submission.” 
 
Is this the... is this the document that came back from 
Mr Thebus reflecting a change? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, you are actually right.  I see now 
VR Laser is already included.  My recommendation did not 
have the name of the supplier.  I would like to put that on 
record that my...  The initial document that I sent to 
Mr Thebus did not have the name of the supplier which is VR 
20 
Laser which he then inserted as part of the respond to me, 
saying that it should go to in arrears(?). 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   the initial document that you prepared 
did not have VR Laser because you were saying it needs to 
go out to open competitive price. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 133 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would that be a proper public tender? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes.  If you also look at the time of this 
particular submission, we were then using the new policy 
that we must check.  It was based on the group policy that 
called for open tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we go to the document you sent to 
Mr Thebus that did not have the name of the supplier.  It is 
just, I think I have missed that if you have already dealt with 
that. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, I am afraid.  There appears to 
be a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In that, what appears at page 651 
should have an attachment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Attached to the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The affidavit, in fact, says that it was 
attached. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but it is not attached. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For a reason, I am afraid, I do not 
have information Chair to convey to you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 134 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that would have been the document I 
am looking for. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It would have been the... what should 
be here, is the original version that the witness prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I confused her by assuming that it 
was the document at page 654. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But that is now clarified that that in 
fact is the revised version as revised by Mr Thebus.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Chair, may we just request leave? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Must we track down that annexure that 
for some reason has not been included in the pack? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We may present that to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us do that.  And then for the 
record, you can just announce that it has been found and it 
is been included and it will be page whatever. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sure my learned juniors will 
...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I may just as a follow up to my last 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 135 of 260 
 
response.  Under the... we can get the policy.  Under the 
new policies and procedures there were circumstances 
where we would be allowed a closed tender an... and 
circumstances where we would follow an open tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And that is all stipulated in that policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now...  Oh, sorry Chair.  May I 
continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now you say that 
Mr Thebus, it came back... he came back with the revised 
version which now recommended not that it should go out on 
open tender but that it should be awarded to VR Laser. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  The name of VR Laser 
was already in the submission when it returned. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can take you to page 656? 
MS MALAHLELA:   656...  I got it. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In paragraph 4, what appears is 
recommendation, DOS.   
“Based on the supply chain process followed for the 
Hoefyster vehicle and the AV8 turrets hulls to date 
and that both these processes are or will be 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 136 of 260 
 
industrialised at VR Laser.  It is recommended that 
VR Laser is appointed a single source supplier for 
fabricated structures for a period of three years.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So Mr Thebus agreed with your 
recommendation that this contract should be for three years 
but he did not accept your view that it should go out to 
tender.  Instead, it should be awarded immediately to VR 
Laser. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That appears. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to you receiving this submission or 
recommendation from him, had he had a discussion with you 
with regard to his different view on that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No.  The only discussion that I had with 
him was when he came to my office alerting me that there is 
this request that is going to come.  Then I received the email 
also from Martin Draven to that effect.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now I...  I guess from the 
document, there is nothing that indicates why it should not 
be an open tender. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So when you read it, you must have 
wondered why he took a different view but did not discuss 
that with you? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 137 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you did not ask him? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did? 
MS MALAHLELA:   There is an email response to him. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Mr 
Kennedy 
will 
read 
it 
when 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Perhaps we can do 
that right away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 659.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Should I read it? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your... is that the email that you 
sent in response to Mr Thebus? 
MS MALAHLELA:   True. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 659? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can just read out the relevant 
part.  I have gone through the document.   
“I 
realise 
that 
you 
have 
taken 
out 
my 
recommendation and now the document has the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 138 of 260 
 
name of the supplier specified.   
I do not mean to belabour the point but I am still of 
the opinion that should management approve this 
request, DOS must go out on tender or RFQ...” 
 
What does that stand for? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Request for Quotations. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
“...as you had done in relation to the 217 hulls 
contract.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   This was under now the new policy 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   ...that was in place.  Not under the 
previous ...[indistinct]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then to continue. 
“...for the appointment of a single source for this 
scope of work.  Once we have identified the supplier 
that 
meets 
the 
DLS 
requirements 
through 
a 
competitive process, then we can appoint such a 
supplier for a maximum of three years as a single 
20 
source.  The specification and evaluation criteria 
must be send, et cetera.” 
 
And then you raised another point. 
“Furthermore, I think that it will only be fair to allow 
LMT to compete for this work.  Firstly, we had a 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 139 of 260 
 
contract with them for Tranium(?) FCM Machine 
which is part of the proposed scope of work in this 
request which was later cancelled due to reasons 
unknown to me because it was before my time as 
that Executive Manager of Supply Chain. 
Secondly, when we suspended the order for the AV8 
FCM, we wrote a letter to LMT, where we stated that 
the intend of the time was to continue or finish off 
the execution of that particular order as part of the 
Hoefyster FCM order.   
10 
I am not saying that the work must be given LMT.  
All I am saying is that LMT and other capable 
suppliers 
must 
be 
given 
a 
chance 
to 
prove 
themselves through a transparent, competitive and 
fair RFQ or tender process. 
I do not think we should piggyback on a process that 
was followed for the platform.  We should go out on 
a separate RFQ tender process where we invite all 
suppliers that we think are capable and then do 
such an appointment.  I will ask Michelle to 
20 
schedule a meeting.” 
 
So you reinforced your point raised earlier that it should 
be a tender process.  You were not suggesting as I 
understand 
it, 
that 
LMT 
should 
automatically 
get 
the 
business. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 140 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you were envisaging still a tender 
process in which LMT could tender, other competitors could 
tender and so could VR Laser. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   A single source is not necessarily in 
conflict with an open tender process? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No. 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can go through an open tender 
process and end up with a single source supplier? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So would the opposite arise in this 
situation?  If there is a single supplier in the world for 
something that you require, you would have to go to that 
person and you would not have to follow a tender process? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.  And we had a process 
that was stipulated in the policy and procedure where there 
20 
is just one only supplier in the world and we can prove there 
is only one supplier in the world, which is usually the case in 
case of OEM, Originally Equipment Manufacturer.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the terminology used in terms of 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 141 of 260 
 
National Treasury Regulations the same as sole supplier or 
something? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, I think it is something to that effect 
but I have not worked on procurement forum for many years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think that is why I am asking whether 
...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...your concept of sole supplier here is in 
conflict with an open tender.  Because I think in terms of 
National Treasury Regulations, as well as Supply Chain 
10 
Management Policies of many state owned entities, there will 
be a provision which says if that is the only entity that can 
provide ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   The sole supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And I think it is referred to, if I am not 
mistaken, a sole supplier. 
MS MALAHLELA:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But then, it means you do not go open 
tender. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You just go to that supplier and your 
justification is that they are the only ones. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct.  And you need evidence to 
support that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but your sole supplier is not along 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 142 of 260 
 
those lines.  Your sole supplier is one that you achieved 
after an open tender process. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is why I prefer to call it a single 
source.  After you have now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now maybe it is the single supplier and 
sole supplier that [laughing] 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, I do understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if it is a single supplier, it must 
10 
be a sole supplier ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ... as well.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Okay so ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but your single supplier concept does 
not exclude using open tender whereas the sole supplier 
concept under the National Treasury Regulations excludes 
open tender process. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   It would not make sense to follow an 
open tender process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Because it will just be one company that 
can provide you with that. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 143 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, alright.  It is just necessary to 
understand these things. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, totally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because we do not deal with them every 
day.  So one could end up getting confused. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Denel has the same definition that we 
are working on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is complicated Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughing] 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I believe the PFMA and the Treasury 
Regulations and the SCM Policy and so forth, as you rightly 
say with respect, refers to sole supplier but there is defined 
in a particular way that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...there is only one supplier effectively 
available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But Chair, can I just get you to 
confirm?  Here there were various manufacturers in the 
20 
marketplace who could compete for this business.  And if you 
awarded one of them the contract, they would then be... 
perhaps I can use the terms single source as far as Denel is 
concerned for the period of the contract. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Now that is my believe.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 144 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  But now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually...  I think Mr Kennedy it is good 
you raised that point because what I said earlier may cause 
more confusion, I think.   
 
When you talk about a single supplier it is not as if that 
supplier is the only supplier who can provide you whatever 
services or products that you want.   
 
It is just that for a particular period, you are committing 
yourself to obtaining those services or those products from 
that supplier. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   In this context, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would it not be the same thing?  
Would it...  Is it not the position that you would not need to 
actually say, to commit yourself like that because if you say 
we want somebody who is going to supply us with X for the 
next three years, necessarily,  where you are going to get it.  
You cannot go elsewhere. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you leave the technology of single 
suppliers. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say we want somebody who is going 
to provide us with x product for the next three years.  They 
compete and one wins, automatically that one who has 
won…[intervenes] 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 145 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Becomes a single source. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is the only one who is going to give 
you. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Technically it is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So even if you do not use the single 
supplier ’s terminology. 
MS MALAHLELA:   It is the terminology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now Ms Malahlela 
you – so your approach was, to sum up, we must go out to 
10 
open tender.  At that stage that you sent that memorandum 
for approval to Mr Teubes before he changed it to reflect 
VR Laser had you been told by anybody that you must 
actually do it on the basis that VR Laser will be awarded 
the contract without a procurement process? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot recall specifically. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  So he raises then in the 
email, the attachment which he had changed, he raised an 
approach which was no tender, no public procurement, it 
must go to VR Laser.  You respond at page 659 – we have 
20 
just been through that – did he come back to you in answer 
to these questions that you raised or these opinions that 
you expressed that this was not appropriate? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I believe that we have got an email to 
that effect, I must just look for it, where – I am not sure it 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 146 of 260 
 
was before this email or after this email, I just look and 
confirm now with my statement.  There was one email 
where he is saying that his view is that it is fine, we will 
proceed and take this to Exco but it will be to get strategic 
direction not to approve VR Laser.  So my understanding 
was that VR Laser now is out of the equation and Exco will 
be approving the strategic decision to do the single source 
work for us to issue it out, that they are okay with it as a 
strategy direction not to approve it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you understood his response to be 
10 
that he was abandoning the idea that this should go to VR 
Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that this would go to Exco and what 
would Exco – what direction must it …[intervenes] 
MS MALAHLELA:   They will approve.  I think there is an 
email to that effect.  I will find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   They will approve the principle of 
having this work being issued out as – having a contract, a 
20 
single source contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is the strategic decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Do you know whether an agreement 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 147 of 260 
 
was eventually signed with VR Laser for this particular 
single source supplier? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, I believe it was in May.  We have 
got the attachment here, we can refer to it, where I went to 
go and motivate procurement I believe from LMT for work 
that has to do with a scope that is included in here and in 
that particular meeting I was told – I was asked first why 
am I bringing motivation for LMT to get the work while we 
have a contract with VR Laser, which I was not aware of .  
All that is minuted in there, we have got the annexure.  The 
10 
minutes as the annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it look like VR Laser got appointed 
without your knowledge? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Yes, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  If I can take you back to 
page 159? 
MS MALAHLELA:   159, got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So just before Mr Kennedy asks you 
further, so did Mr Teubes ever advance any argument to 
20 
you as to why the open tender should not be used? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not that I can remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you had made that point very 
emphatically to him. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja.  No, he did not. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 148 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Page 159, paragraph 5.8 
in your statement you say: 
“No further response was received regarding my 
email of the 23 March 2015.  I was no longer 
updated as to the progress of the approval of the 
draft submission under discussion.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you go on to deal with what 
you have just told the Chair that you later found in a 
10 
meeting where you tried to motivate for an award of some 
work to LMT that in fact there was already a Memorandum 
of Agreement that had been concluded with VR Laser that 
gave them the single source supplier status for that type of 
work. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now your affidavit goes on in 
some detail to say that the appointment of VR Laser as 
DLS 
as 
single 
source 
supplier 
raised 
a 
number 
of 
challenges from a supply chain management point of view 
20 
because it was in conflict with the procurement policy. Now 
if I can take you please to in the annexures to the 
document that you have attached to your statement at page 
662. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Which is the policy.  Okay, got it. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 149 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry you said, as an aside, which is 
the policy? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Which is the policy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that is really the question I 
wanted to raise.  So this is the one that you referred to in 
your affidavit, effective from the 19 November 2014.  Was 
that the new policy that you referred to earlier? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it is the one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what is the bottom line of this 
policy as far as it was relevant for this contract that was 
10 
awarded to VR Laser without a procurement process that 
you had recommended? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Sorry, what is the question again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the relevance, what is the 
bottom line of what you were saying here in relation to VR 
Laser having been given this contract without open tender? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay.  So essentially the document 
corroborates what I said in the email to say that we were 
actually supposed to follow a process to appoint VR Laser 
instead of just putting it in a document and motivating it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – and I am taking you back a little 
bit, this contract that you found out had been given to VR 
Laser without your knowledge was still the same contract 
that you had been involved in except that it was now, I see 
here in your paragraph 5.9, it was now for ten years 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 150 of 260 
 
instead of three years that you had recommended? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not only that, Chair, I was actually very 
angry at some point because – and the submission that 
was taken to corporate office, there was reference to 
supply chain that we supported the document which is not 
true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who would have done that, do you 
know?  Who would have made that misrepresentation about 
your department? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I have no idea whether the document 
10 
was updated at DLS or at DCO, so – and the meeting 
where I found out, I was told that the document, the new 
signed document and the motivations will be sent to me 
after the meeting and I believe that we have an email to 
that effect where the divisional legal executive sent me the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The documents. 
MS MALAHLELA:   The documents with a new submission. 
So I am not sure who did it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that a submission that 
20 
you had prepared which did not reflect support for this was 
amended to make it look like you supported this new thing? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Malahlela, 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 151 of 260 
 
there is another point relating to the policy that you 
highlight in your affidavit.  If I can take you to page 669. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Clause 6.10, intergroup and group 
procurement contract 6.10.1 says: 
“Under no circumstances shall products or services 
that can be procured from a group entity or division 
be procured from an external supplier or non-Denel 
company unless there is approval by the group 
supply chain executive based on sound business 
10 
reasons.” 
Now you have mentioned previously that you had raised 
concern about LMT partly because it had had a contract 
cancelled and you felt it was fair to at least allow it to 
participate in a tender but you have also mentioned that 
LMT was part-owned – majority owned by Denel itself. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would LMT fall under the scope of 
what is referred to her as a group entity? 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 
There 
were 
actually 
conflicting 
20 
interpretation with regard to LMT since it was not – I would 
use DV as the previous BAE, as an example.  So with the 
BAE or DV as it was clear that it was group entity or what 
we were referring to but with LMT sometimes it was treated 
as an outsider where it had to follow a process. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 152 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you have referred in your 
affidavit to an Exco meeting of DLS, DLS Exco, where 
there was a discussion about the agreement that was in 
place with VR Laser, this particular agreement and you 
have referred in your affidavit to the committee taking a 
decision 
that 
the 
agreement 
with 
VR 
Laser 
takes 
precedence.  Can you tell the Chair please what happened, 
what was in fact discussed.  Were you present at that 
meeting? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I was.  If I may digress a little bit.  So 
10 
following having received the documents that were signed, 
I felt a bit aggrieved and I did not know which avenue to 
explore now because it looked like my management was 
part 
of, 
how 
do 
I 
put 
this, 
my 
management 
was 
instrumental in that documents getting signed so I spoke to 
the Group CFO …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your management being Mr Teubes? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And Mr Teubes and Stephan Burger. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So it would have been a futile exercise 
to try to speak to them about a document that is already 
signed.  So I spoke to Mr Fikile Mhlontlo – sorry, I might be 
pronouncing surname incorrectly. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 153 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the CFO at the time. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, the Group CFO at the time.  That 
was 
around 
quarter 
three 
of 
the 
same 
year 
and 
I 
highlighted what had happened and also that I was 
unhappy with what had happened and I was hoping that he 
would be able to assist me to resolve this.  Lo and behold, 
I think about few weeks or a month after that, he was gone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is when he was suspended? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is when he was suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But does this mean that time you were 
10 
able to put in front of you the submission that you sent and 
the submission that was amended by people you do not 
know? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you could tell where the differences 
were. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct and I can still do that 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And you have got those in 
the file …[intervenes] 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  I can just look through the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Because I go this file this morning, so I 
can just look through the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you do not have to look for it now, 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 154 of 260 
 
as long as we have got it.  That is fine. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And now going back to the question 
that was asked.  So after having explored that avenue and 
it did not bear any fruit I then decided to raise it in the 
committee where there is a lot of Exco members.  Perhaps 
they would take a different decision and raise a concern, 
everything is in writing, perhaps people will fell a bit afraid 
to go on with whatever was going on and the decision was 
taken, we have got an attachment of the minutes which was 
taken more than once because I kept on repeating the 
10 
same thing over and over again and I also asked my team 
to start to ensure that we keep the recording.  So not only 
did we type the minutes but we also kept the recording of 
the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A mechanical recording? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, was a mechanical recording of the 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So where it was – I raised the concern 
that I have a problem with this MOU, MOA, I think there is 
20 
a lot of confusion with regard to what it is, that contra 
against the policies and we have to continuing applying it 
over and over again, is that really also sustainable to keep 
on piling all this work on the same supplier for such 
amount of time? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 155 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but the committee with 
whom you raised this did not go along with your views? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, they took a decision to say that the 
MOU supersedes the company policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh …[intervenes] 
MS MALAHLELA:   Which is also documented in the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I have seen that, ja.  Mr 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I take the witness to what I think 
10 
she is referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 672. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is quite an interesting strange thing 
because agreements are supposed to be in line with 
policies. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say the agreement supersedes the 
policies.  The agreement supersedes the law.  Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, Ms Malahlela, will you not just 
20 
please have a quick look at that?  You will see in the 
middle of the page under the heading General 1.1: 
“A concern was noted with regard to placement 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I missed the page, where we 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 156 of 260 
 
must go? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   672, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   672.  Okay, alright, continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This records in the minutes that a 
concern was noted with regard to placement of orders.  It 
relates to a deviation with the Group SCM policy.  Was that 
the concern that you had raised? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then under the heading 
Resolution does this reflect what was resolved by Exco? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “The committee took a decision that  
the 
MOU 
takes 
precedence 
over 
the 
GSCE’s 
condition and the group supply chain policy and the 
DLS supply chain procedure.  The committee also 
stated that given the…”  
recent presumably, not resend. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But: 
“..recent 
history 
with 
regards 
to 
price 
and 
20 
turnaround time, VR was the preferred supplier with 
all opportunities.  It was further stated that in terms 
of the MOU VR Laser prices must be market-related 
and in line with the provisions of the MOA before an 
order can be placed on them.  Due to this reason 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 157 of 260 
 
and 
previous 
experience 
with 
VR 
Laser 
the 
committee felt confident that the VR Laser prices 
will 
be 
market-related 
and 
reasonable. 
 
Celia 
Malahlela was asked to draft a letter to the GSCE 
and explain the decision taken in this regard.” 
Now before we get to whether you sent a letter, as 
instructed, did you agree with this, did you – were you 
persuaded by the reasons given for the resolution that was 
adopted? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, I was not. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you a sole lonely voice along this 
liner in this meeting? 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 
I 
cannot 
remember 
anybody 
disagreeing but I might have forgotten but the decision was 
taken.  The recordings should be at DLS so we should be 
able to find out what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And what is GSCE? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Group Supply Chain Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Who would have been? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   Mr Mlambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mlambo, okay.  Had anything like this 
happened before in your experience? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. Not where …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where an agreement or memorandum of 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 158 of 260 
 
understanding is said to be above the policies of the 
company? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not to my recollection that I saw.  I 
would have opposed it in any case, but anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Now may you turn please to page 
677?  675, in fact. 
MS MALAHLELA:   675, okay.  Got it. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is an email from you to Exco 
subject Conflict between Policy and the Signed MOU and 
then you say: 
“Find the attached for your final input.” 
Now is the document from 677 what you attached for their 
final input? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And why did you – and just identify 
the document at 677 please?  Who prepared this and what 
is it? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   I prepared it on instruction from Exco 
as stated in the minutes on 670.  So we were actually 
discussing an order with regard to T5 which is product of 
DLS which included fabrications.  So that is why that 
subject has reference to T5. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 159 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now did you actually sign this letter, 
677.  At 678 I see your name but there is no signature 
there.  Did you ever sign it? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I cannot recall, I might have signed it.  
I was asked to send this to Mr Mlambo but at the same 
time I spoke to Mr Mlambo about it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Did Mr Mlambo in fact sign it? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, he did not sign it.  I think it is this 
one …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about first, if we may, it is 
10 
just the important features of what you say here. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just – I deal with that to say this is 
what – these are the main points you say in the letter. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Okay.  Can I read it quickly? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if you can.  Not the whole thing, just 
…[intervenes] 
MS MALAHLELA:   So essentially I was saying that the 
MOU conflicts with the provisions of the policy that was in 
place in the company and I was also stating that the 
20 
committee had taken a decision to say that the MOU 
supersedes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   The company policies.  And I was 
informing Mr Mlambo, as instructed by the committee. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 160 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, as you pointed out earlier, Ms 
Malahlela, there is a bit of confusion.  Sometimes people 
are referring to the agreement as an MOU and sometimes it 
is an MOA but let us leave aside that terminology.  What 
was being referred to here was that there had been an 
agreement concluded with VR Laser, it had been picked up 
that there was a breach of the Group’s policy and the 
division’s policy.  And then if you can look at the last 
paragraph please on page 677, you say: 
10 
“Due to these contradicting positions, supply chain 
approached DLS Exco.” 
Supply chain being yourself, is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so you approached Exco to make 
a decision as to whether to honour the MOA and place the 
order on VR Laser or to follow the supply chain policy and 
procure from intergroup, namely DVS or LMT for this 
project.  DVS is Denel Vehicle Systems. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that another Denel division like 
DLS was a division, DVS also? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So you were saying: 
“…either DVS or LMT, both of which were either 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 161 of 260 
 
wholly-owned or partly owned by Denel could have 
been given the project if there had been compliance 
with this provision of the supply chain policy.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do I understand it correctly? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Right.  And then you say: 
“Given the timeframe, urgency and history, Exco 
has recommended that the work be done by VR 
Laser.” 
10 
And then you say: 
“I 
request 
permission 
to 
implement 
the 
Exco 
decision in this regard.” 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In a way did you want written instruction 
to say you can go ahead? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  To cover yourself. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Something like that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   It got to that point unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  But you say Mr Mlambo 
did not sign it. 
MS MALAHLELA:   he did not sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 162 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   I think there is a response from Mr 
Mlambo somewhere in the documentation that we can refer 
to.  I am getting a bit fuzzy with these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, Mr Kennedy will get us to it if 
it is important. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Sorry, I was just 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no, she just confirmed that Mr 
Mlambo did not sign this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And but she says somewhere in the 
bundle there is a response, is that correct?  Or a letter? 
MS MALAHLELA:   There is a response.  I think he 
scribbled at the back instead of signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that is fine but Mr Kennedy will 
get to it when it is convenient. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, Chair.  May I just draw attention 
to an issue that is just apparent to me now and that is the 
– that the affidavit refers to a note rejecting approval by Mr 
Mlambo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it is annexure CM52.  You will 
see – unfortunately, and I do not have immediately an 
explanation for this, when you get to page 680 this 
annexure was not available at the time of bundling the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 163 of 260 
 
exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So I am afraid I cannot put it to the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the next witness will be Mr 
Mlambo himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he will give evidence that he in 
fact refused to approve this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if the document is available in 
his bundle then we will draw your attention to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  That must be the 
document because the witness also says he scribbled at 
the back. 
MS MALAHLELA:   He scribbled at the back. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But I do not believe that there is any 
20 
dispute between any of the people whose names have been 
raised in relation to these proceedings or in the documents 
that Mr Mlambo was asked to approve the deviation 
retrospectively. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 164 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Ms Malahlela, may we now 
turn to the next contract.  We have already dealt this 
morning with the first contract awarded to VR Laser for 217 
hulls.  The second contract that we have just dealt with 
this afternoon was the single source supplier for various 
components. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the same project.  And that was 
10 
awarded to VR Laser where you had said it should be for 
three years and subject to a tender process and instead 
what was decided was it was for ten years and it was given 
to VR Laser. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja, I recommended that we follow due 
process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, you recommended? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That we follow due process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Can you just comment on the 
10 years, was that – did that happen frequently within 
20 
Denel, to your knowledge, that as single source supply 
contract would be awarded ever to a party for 10 years? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Unless it was linked to a specific 
project so that it was running for ten years with clear 
deliverables, I cannot remember any contract of such 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 165 of 260 
 
nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whereas you had been the – you were 
the one who came up with three years, you never got to 
know who came up with ten years. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now we come to a third contract that 
you deal with in your affidavit.  You deal with it at page 
161, paragraph 6 and that is an award of a contract to VR 
Laser in 2016, correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   A year after the contract that we 
have just dealt with, the second contract and you refer to 
an order having previously been placed the previous year 
in 2015 on LMT for specific items and LMT, there was a 
problem with meeting the deliverables, delivery schedule 
for that.  Can you just tell the Chair please very briefly, 
why was that relevant to the appointment of VR Laser in 
this third contract? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So the order had already been placed 
on LMT.  DLS changed the spec and LMT could not meet – 
20 
I believe the timelines because I am – this is based on the 
information that I got, the timelines and the pricing as well.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now just to be specific, to make it 
clear, the distinction between this contract and the other 
two, as your heading indicates, this was a contract in 2016 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 166 of 260 
 
to 
supply 
cradles, 
FCM 
outer 
shields 
and 
armour 
components. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you say that an order had been 
placed on LMT which it had not fulfilled properly within 
time and then what happened in relation to VR Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No, that is not what I am saying.  So 
Denel Land System has placed – had placed an order on 
LMT for the production of FCMs for AV8 project. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   AV8 project? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes? 
MS MALAHLELA:   The order was suspended due to 
inability of LMT to meet the delivery schedule for the new 
configuration, not the one that …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it was not the original one it was 
the later configuration. 
MS MALAHLELA:   The change in spec during – after the 
20 
order had been placed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then you make reference to 
a proposal by VR Laser.  To do what? 
MS MALAHLELA:   To do the same work. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The same work that had already been 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 167 of 260 
 
placed as an order on LMT? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   How did it come about that they 
submitted a proposal? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I just – so how it worked, my team had 
managers, so on the day-to-day running, doing the day-to-
day business they would go out on quotations unless I 
need to get involved in it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Had there been any process – had 
there been any decision to replace LMT under the previous 
10 
order? 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 
So 
the 
discussions 
that 
were 
happening between LMT and management, it was my 
understanding at the time that following this issue where 
LMT couldn’t meet our requirements there was some 
discussion with management of LMT and Mr Teubes came 
to me to ask me to draft a letter which I am sure you have 
seen, and there were emails, there are also emails, where I 
am sending this email to say that the order will then be 
placed under – instead of totally cancelling the order, on 
20 
LMT we’re just going to move it to a different programme 
and that, Mr Teubes asked me to do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, what’s then happened Ms 
Malahlela? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So, the jigs and fixtures were removed 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 168 of 260 
 
from LMT and were then delivered to VR Laser to proceed 
with the work. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What concerns did you raise with 
your colleagues as to whether or not that was correct? 
MS MALAHLELA:   With regard to moving the order? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And placing it on VR Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   At the time we had this MOU which we 
were now being told that we need to follow.  So, under the 
MOU if we are following the provisions of the MOU, we can 
place that order and then at the same time we could give 
10 
that other one to LMT later. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay,  did EXCO deal with the 
matter? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Not that I can recall, later on we’re 
talking about different issue, if you go to 6.5 then we are 
now moving into – DLS have been communicated to LMT 
that it has the intention of placing the Hoefeyster order for 
the FCM on LMT – sorry I actually did – it slipped my mind. 
I raised the concern at EXCO on the 7 t h of March 2016 and 
there are minutes to that effect, apologies for that. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that what you refer to in 6.4? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, you raised the concern with 
EXCO at this meeting that DLS was now placing the very 
same order on VR Laser without going back to LMT? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 169 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, then there’s reference to 
EXCO taking legal advice, do you know whether that was 
taken? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, it was done, if you look at 6.6 
there is communication with the Executive Legal as her 
capacity in that position. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and you refer to her saying that 
LMT should be afforded a right of first refusal. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   To submit a proposal. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On the Trunnion Machining contract, 
yes.  Then you refer to your raising concerns, again at 
another EXCO meeting, 22 n d of March but what was the 
outcome of all of this, was an agreement in fact concluded 
with VR Laser for this third lot of items? 
MS MALAHLELA:   We just need to refer to the minutes, 
so, Mr Burger in his capacity, so this is part of the minutes, 
in his capacity as the CEO of DLS, advised that the 
20 
memorandum of argument – in this case we’re calling it the 
memorandum of argument but I think everybody knows 
what we’re referring to, was signed by the Group’s Chief 
Executive of Denel and should therefore supersede the 
Supply Chain Policy of Denel SOC in instances where two 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 170 of 260 
 
documents are in conflict. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Then if I can take you to page 686. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s the page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   686 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   686 appears to be a letter from Ms 
Govender to yourself. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On page 688, the second last 
10 
paragraph…[intervenes]. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Which one? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   688. 
MS MALAHLELA:   688. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Second last paragraph,  
“In my view, LMT needs to be given an opportunity 
to, at least, quote on the FCM’s as DLS was 
furnished with its costings etcetera”, 
 
Is that a reference to what you mentioned earlier as 
a right of first refusal? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and then the document at 689, 
that appears to be a letter from you…[intervenes]. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So if you refer to the minutes, you will 
see that I was asked to draft cryptic notes, if you can just 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 171 of 260 
 
go to the exact minutes there now, you will see it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are those the minutes at page 693? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I just need to confirm because it refers 
to cryptic notes that I was to make and send to the Group 
CEO, I must just get to the exact reference but essentially 
– we can find the minutes and search for it properly but 
there were minutes.  So, essentially, I was requested to 
write cryptic notes to Stephan hence that email going to 
Stephan. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay let’s move on from why there 
10 
were cryptic notes and so forth, the agreement was, 
ultimately…[intervenes]. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Oh sorry, I found it, it is on page 693 if 
you look at the last comment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The last bullet? 
MS MALAHLELA:   The last bullet yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   As CEE to provide CEO with cryptic 
notes on the summary of developments around the issue, 
which is what I did in the email but if you page through you 
20 
will see that I’ve actually also bolded it as part of the 
minutes, I asked the guys to bold it so that everybody 
knows what they’re doing.  You will see the last – not the 
last, the second last bullet on the third column on page 2 
on top it says, 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 172 of 260 
 
 
“CM voiced concern and sought clarity from the 
Committee on where the Supply Chain should comply with 
the policy or the single source agreement”,  
 
So, he’s saying chair, reiterating the same points 
that I’ve been reiterating over and over again. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you, there’s one last 
issue which I would like to deal with before we close with 
your evidence Ms Malahlela, can I ask you please to turn 
to page 699. 
MS MALAHLELA:   I’m here. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now this appears to be a letter, or an 
email sent by you on the 20 t h of April 2016 addressed to 
Stephan, is this again, Mr Stephan Burger? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now I’d like just to remind you of the 
relevant parts of the letter, you say this, 
 
“Having signed the preferred supplier agreement 
with VR Laser, Denel, having been in the media with regard 
to its strategic alliance with VR Laser, having read several 
media reports about allegations of state capture by the 
20 
Gupta family, more concerns are raised about the viability 
of the partnership and the risks that Denel will be exposed 
to, should Denel decide to continue its relationship with VR 
Laser. 
 
I’m 
struggling 
to 
turn 
a 
blind 
eye 
to 
this 
phenomenon”, 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 173 of 260 
 
 
Just tell the Chair, how you felt it appropriate to 
raise this with Mr Burger rather than Mr Teubes, your 
immediate superior and why you felt it appropriate to 
express that you couldn’t turn a blind eye to these issues? 
MS MALAHLELA:   In 2016 the structure had been 
changed a few times and 2016, I must just confirm, I 
believe that that was the time I was reporting to Mr Burger 
himself. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you feel this way? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   So, I think somewhere in the email I am 
actually – I’m not sure if it’s this email but we can just 
check, I’m referring to – yes if you look at paragraph three, 
I’m referring to the meeting that I had with the CEO of VR 
Laser. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Where he acknowledged the ties in 
passing. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
The 
ties 
with 
the 
Gupta’s…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was the CEO of VR Laser? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It was Pieter van der Merwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Pieter van der Merwe? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So, before that it was hearsay in media 
articles and all of that but for the first time, I had heard it 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 174 of 260 
 
from somebody that it was just in front of me. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Your 
letter 
says 
that 
he 
acknowledged ties with the Gupta family and the then, 
President’s son, Duduzane Zuma. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, in passing. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Through – in direct shareholding? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As alleged by the media? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now you jumped to the third 
10 
paragraph, if I can just remind you what you said in the 
second paragraph, in addition to the media reports and 
acknowledgment by Mr van der Merwe that there were ties 
between VR Laser and the Gupta family and the, then, 
President’s 
son 
you 
also 
mentioned 
in 
the 
second 
paragraph, that it was your humble opinion as you put it, 
that, 
“DLS had failed to follow the correct process when 
appointing VR Laser as a preferred supplier for the 
supply 
of 
steel 
components 
and 
fabrications, 
20 
amongst other irregularities there was no RFQ or 
tender issued for the award of the contract.  In this 
regard I believe DLS should have approached the 
market to ensure good governance”. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 175 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now going back to the paragraph where 
you refer to the CEO of VR Laser you were telling Mr 
Burger here – you were telling Mr Burger something that Mr 
Pieter van der Merwe had said in your presence on the 19 t h 
of April 2016 as reflected here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it’s something that he had said 
in your presence? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then if you would refer to the last 
paragraph on this page, what, essentially, were you asking 
Mr Burger to do? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I was asking him to reconsider the 
arguments that we had with VR Laser and terminate them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You gave credit to him for showing 
great leadership and having achieved a turnaround in the 
division 
from 
R300million 
turnover 
to 
over 
R2billion 
turnover over less than five years.  So you complimented 
20 
him for that and you expressed the feeling that you had as 
a Denel employee, a proud Denel employee but what you 
say at the end of this page, the second last line, 
“With the rate that this controversy is unfolding, I’m 
not certain that this company will even survive long 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 176 of 260 
 
enough for my children to see it.  We ought to be 
proud of what we have accomplished, equally so, 
we should do whatever it takes to protect this great 
legacy”, 
 
Those are very firm and strong words.  Why did you 
express 
your 
opinion 
in 
terms 
such 
as 
these, 
Ms 
Malahlela? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe, Mr Kennedy, if you don’t 
mind, we need to take a few minutes if we – if it’s 
necessary – sorry Ms Malahlela but I would like you, in 
10 
your own words to read that whole paragraph into the 
record, I think it’s a very important paragraph. 
MS MALAHLELA:   The last paragraph? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last paragraph, but maybe you need 
a few minutes to drink water? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay right, then let’s take a few 
minutes – five minutes adjournment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May we ask, through your associate 
or may we indicate when the witness has composed 
20 
herself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that’s fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 177 of 260 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve changed my mind Ms Malahlela, 
rather than read the last paragraph I want you to read the 
whole. 
MS MALAHLELA:  The whole email? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   “Hi Stephan, having signed the  
preferred supplier agreement with VR Laser, Denel 
having been in the media with regards to its 
strategic 
alliance 
with 
VR 
Laser, 
having 
read 
10 
several media reports about allegations of state 
capture by the Gupta family, more concerns are 
raised about the viability of the partnership and the 
risks that Denel will be exposed to should Denel 
decide to continue its relationship with VR Laser.  I 
am 
struggling 
to 
turn 
a 
blind 
eye 
to 
this 
phenomenon.  I would like to reiterate that, it is my 
humble opinion that DLS failed to follow the correct 
process when appointing VR Laser as the preferred 
supplier for the supply of steel components and 
20 
fabrications.  Amongst other irregularities there was 
no RFQ or tender issued for the award of this 
contact.  In this regard I believe that DLS should 
have 
approached 
the 
market 
to 
ensure 
good 
governance.  I would also like to bring it to your 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 178 of 260 
 
attention that the current CEO of VR Laser has 
acknowledged that there are ties with the Gupta 
family and the President’s son (through indirect 
shareholding) as alleged by the media in the 
meeting we had yesterday, the 19 t h of April 2016 at 
3 o’clock in the afternoon.  In light of all these facts 
I 
would 
like 
to 
request 
that 
DLS, 
carefully 
reconsiders the relationship with VR Laser as a 
preferred/strategic supplier.  Denel is a strategic 
asset of this country and I’m proud to be associated 
10 
with it.  It gives me great pleasure to wake up each 
morning to serve this country.  I have had the 
privilege of seeing you turn this division from a 
R300million turnover to over R2billion turnover in 
less than five years.  We are, no doubt a great 
company, furthermore I have great confidence that, 
under your great leadership we will achieve even 
more greater success. However, with the rate that 
this controversy is unfolding I am not certain that 
this company will even survive long enough for my 
20 
children to see it.  We ought to be proud of what we 
have 
accomplished, 
equally 
so, 
we 
should 
do 
whatever it takes to protect this great legacy.  Kind 
regards”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 179 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   How do you feel now, some years 
after you sent this letter about what actually happened? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I think that, actually what brought me 
to tears, because it’s actually what is happening right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was your plea in this email not heeded 
by Mr Burger…[intervenes]. 
MS MALAHLELA:   He responded harshly, there’s an email 
to that effect where it was also part of a report that was 
issued – I’m not sure if it formed part of the newspaper 
article that was…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I take the witness to the foot of page 
697 and onto page 698. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, found it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the email that you’re referring 
to? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That’s the email, that’s the response. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That’s an email from Stephan Burger 
himself and he will be given the opportunity to give his 
evidence before this Commission in due course, we have 
20 
him lined up to.  May I just read some relevant parts, Ms 
Malahlela so that you can respond.  Can you just confirm, 
this is the response to the letter that you’ve just read out 
in full, at the Chair ’s request? 
MS MALAHLELA:   20 t h April – yes, it is. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 180 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It says, 
“Dear Celia, I must say I’m very surprised and 
disappointed in having to receive an email of this 
gravity whilst I’m abroad and also given the fact 
that the appointment of VR was done a very long 
time ago and in a time you were intimately involved 
in the process of the selection of VR Laser as our 
strategic 
supplier 
of 
complex 
fabricated 
components”. 
 
Was this the first time that you had raised this – 
10 
these concerns? 
MS MALAHLELA:   If you look at the minutes, there’s 
evidence that I had been raising it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, isn’t the position that, earlier 
on, we went through even emails where you pointed this 
out time and again that proper procedures were not 
followed? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, so directly I raised it with Mr 
Teubes when he was sending me the submission but from 
late – I think it’s 2015, yes 2015, late 2015 I was raising it 
20 
in the committee with regards to conflict and Mr Mlambo 
was also responding to a lot of issues relating to this MOU 
– MOA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, is the position that, he might be 
right in saying he only heard, recently of your concern 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 181 of 260 
 
because you had raised it in communication with other 
people, not him or is the position that he had raised it with 
him, he was aware of your issues in this regard? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I had not raised it directly with him, I 
had raised it with Reenen when he was asking me to do the 
motivation and I raised it in the EXCO meeting which we 
have minutes of in the package and we’ve read already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would he have been part of EXCO? 
MS MALAHLELA:   He’s part of EXCO, he’s actually the 
Chair of EXCO…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, he certainly knew you had raised 
those. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least at the EXCO meeting? 
MS MALAHLELA:   The minutes are there, it was 
discussed in the meetings…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but your recollection is that he was 
there at EXCO meetings where you raised it? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   As far as I can recall, and the minutes 
are there which are circulated to him as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Can you comment on his 
remark, that you had been intimately involved in the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 182 of 260 
 
process of the selection of VR Laser, it appears to suggest 
this, that you were part of that process, you went along 
with it and are now raising it for the first time a long time 
later, while he’s travelling, he, Mr Burger, he’s travelling 
overseas.  In other words, you seem to be happy with it 
now, you haven’t raised it before you’re raising it now, any 
comment on that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   As you have already – sorry what was 
the – I’m losing my train of thought, what was the question 
again? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He seems to be suggesting that this 
is an afterthought by you because you were involved, 
previously in the process of VR Laser, so why are you 
complaining about it now if you were part of that process? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I collected my thoughts.  So, as you 
know I was not, at this stage, you’ve seen the document, I 
was not involved in the process of appointing VR Laser as 
the preferred supplier of fabricated components. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is the position – as I understand the 
position is that you had a role to play in a process that 
20 
ended up with VR Laser being appointed but you were not 
involved in the appointment, actual decision to appoint and 
you did not support that, you appointment was earlier, 
that’s why you took the point that there should be an open 
tender? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 183 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct I said out, right at the 
beginning that, due process should be followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so is – so the position is, not that 
you had no involvement in the process. Where you had no 
involvement is, in the decision to appoint but in the 
process that preceded that there was some involvement 
and you took the position that there should be an open 
tender, you made it known, it was not supported and 
without your knowledge, VR Laser was appointed? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So, it also depends – I don’t want to 
waste time, it also depends on how you interpret it.  I was 
not involved in the appointment of VR Laser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no I think we are agreeing that 
on that, you were not involved in the appointment but there 
is a stage…[intervenes]. 
MS MALAHLELA:  When the process started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In which you were involved, and that 
stage allowed you the opportunity to say, what process, in 
20 
your view, should be followed. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You articulated that – your views to 
those to whom you’re supposed to articulate it, they did not 
follow your opinion and without your knowledge, VR Laser 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 184 of 260 
 
was appointed. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Then he says at the foot 
of the page, 697, Mr Burger says, 
“I also question the fact that you want to reiterate 
that the correct processes were not followed.  The 
first time I heard you say that was very recently in 
the 
passing 
and 
was 
after 
the 
media 
was 
questioning the Gupta’s involvement and painting a 
10 
negative picture of Denel”, 
 
So, again, he seems to be making the point, you’re 
raising this for the first time very late.   You raised it in 
passing after there was media coverage but that was very 
recent – a very recent comment by you and you didn’t raise 
it at the time of the actual procurement process.  Do you 
have anything to add to what you’ve said already? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I think I’m going to be repeating 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so if it is true that he was present 
20 
at the EXCO meetings, I don’t know if it was meetings or 
meeting where you raised your issues with this, then he 
cannot be genuine in saying he’s hearing for the – he only 
heard recently. 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is my point exactly Chair. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 185 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s your point. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, obviously if he was not present, that 
might change the picture, but your recollection is that he 
was present and he was Chairing the EXCO. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And the minute was circulated to him 
as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  The top of page 698, 
 
“However, I do agree that it is not pleasant to hear 
10 
the Denel name in a negative connotation and I’m equally 
proud of the successes of DLS”, 
 
That seems to be a reference to your statement in  
your letter that he was replying to, that you were proud to 
be an employee of DLS and Denel, but he then proceeds to 
say this, 
“But I want to categorically state that I do not agree 
with your statement, that proper processes were not 
followed.  Surely, we did not send out an RFP for 
the appointment of a strategic supplier”, 
 
20 
 
So, he agrees that the company didn’t go out as you 
had recommended to go out in a competitive process. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But then he says, 
“But we did identify the most complex of complex 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 186 of 260 
 
fabricated systems and went out on open tender 
and we did this twice, 
 
Do you know what open tenders he’s referring to 
there? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he says, 
“And this VR – and this, VR won by following the 
correct processes, only thereafter, VR was selected 
and motivated as a strategic supplier.  The approval 
thereof 
at 
DCO 
was 
done 
by 
following 
due 
10 
processes”, 
 
Now perhaps Mr Burger, you’re not sure what he’s 
meaning but let’s just assume for the moment that I’m right 
when I raise this as a possible suggestion that Mr Burger 
may have been trying to raise.  He may have been referring 
to the original contract before the single supplier contract.  
Single supplier contract, you said, has to go out on open 
tender and he’s confirmed in his letter, they didn’t – you 
didn’t go out – your company didn’t go out on open tender 
then.  Perhaps he’s referring to the previous process in 
20 
which there was a RFO where LMT submitted proposals, so 
did VR Laser, so did the other company. If that suggestion 
that I’m putting to you is right, do you have a comment on 
what he’s seems to be saying? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So as part of my email that I had 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 187 of 260 
 
written to Reenen, I had clearly said that we cannot 
piggyback on previous processes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So that is not due process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer would be ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:  If that is what you are referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your answer would be at a factual level 
with regard to this particular appointment that we are 
talking about no open tender had been followed, and your 
view is and was at the time there was no justification for 
10 
not following an open tender in regard to this particular 
appointment. 
MS MALAHLELA:   There was no justification and not 
following due process.  Remember the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the due process would mean the 
open tender process. 
MS MALAHLELA:   In some cases it would be a closed 
tender under the conditions that are stipulated in the 
20 
policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in this case do you know 
whether, which one would have applied? 
MS MALAHLELA:   It would have most probably been 
closed tender. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 188 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Closed tender. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Because of the nature of the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which would be what, asking for 
quotations? 
MS MALAHLELA:   The IP that is involved this – we didn’t 
get to that point so now I am just – so there is a whole lot 
of things that you need to take into consideration, then you 
motivate to Mr Mlambo.  The policy called for motivation to 
Mr Mlambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on your understanding of the policies 
10 
of the company at the time, it would be wrong to say what 
should have been followed would have been an open 
tender process. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you say should have been 
followed is a closed tender process, is that right?    
MS MALAHLELA:   Most ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it was not ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes, most likely because of the nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Most likely yes.   But not what was 
20 
done? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And if I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On what was done you say there was no 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 189 of 260 
 
due process? 
MS MALAHLELA:   There was no due process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:   And if I may, if Mr Burger is referring to 
– if he is saying that an open tender process was followed 
we all know that open tender process was not followed for 
the 
previous 
processes 
hence 
I 
am 
shrugging 
my 
shoulders, if he is talking about open tender, unless he is 
talking about a process which is an RFQ or an RFO, that is 
a different case altogether, but I had also clearly stated 
10 
that you cannot piggy-back on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just clarify if you would please what 
you mean by the piggy-back, don’t piggy-back on that. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So essentially what they are – it is also 
said here to say that we have gone out on a process to 
appoint the supplier for this and this and this and this, 
because of that process that we followed we now appoint 
the same supplier for additional work, which was not part 
of the original scope. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you cannot rely on the previous 
...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can’t rely – you can’t have a 
situation where if you have had an open tender process in 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 190 of 260 
 
regard for – in regard to the provision of ABC products to 
the company ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   And you add ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that process has been completed 
you cannot later on when you want a service provider 
which will give you or provide you with DEF products say I 
will take the one who succeeded in the other or in the 
previous tender process because it won in that process, 
you can’t say that. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have to embark upon a new process. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you say. 
MS 
MALAHLELA: 
 
 Yes 
and 
furthermore 
there 
are 
provisions with regard to extensions of contracts under 
what circumstances you can extend contracts and the 
percentages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:   So in this case we are talking about a 
totally different scope and yes it was the armour plate and 
20 
all but it was for different vehicles and different – it was for 
vehicles, it was for a whole lot of different stuff that we 
have seen in the documentation, but on top of that as it 
was obvious that it was also going to exceed the threshold 
that you are allowed to extend the contract for. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 191 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, if I can continue then in 
this paragraph of Mr Burger at page 698, it is the second 
paragraph there, the third line, it is to overlap with what we 
raised earlier, but we did identify the most complex of 
complex fabricated systems and went out on open tender 
and we did this twice and this VR1 by following the correct 
processes only thereafter VR was selected and motivated 
as a strategic supplier, strategic supplier in the context of 
this letter appears to be a single source supplier, if you 
10 
look at other parts of the letter. 
 
He then says the approval thereof a DCO, that’s 
corporate level, is that right? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Was 
done 
by 
following 
due 
processes, do you agree with that assertion by him? 
MS MALAHLELA:   No I said in my previous statement I 
will use the piggy-back again, you cannot latch onto 
another process that was done. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and then he says to now say 
20 
that processes were not followed just because we don’t 
like 
the 
owners 
or 
what 
is 
written 
in 
the 
papers, 
presumably the newspapers, or that the CEO of VR is 
acknowledging certain connections with the Gupta Family  
is also a concern to me.   Now may I just stop for a 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 192 of 260 
 
moment and ask your comment, you raised in your letter, I 
took you to that earlier, there were two main issues that 
you raised, the one was that you felt proper processes for 
procurement had not been followed. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And secondly you raised concerns 
about ties with the Gupta Family and the consequent 
problem, potential problem for Denel and its reputation. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, what he seems to be 
10 
suggesting here is that you were using the Gupta Family 
connections as a reason for only now, as he puts it, 
complaining that processes were not followed, he says to 
now say that processes were not followed just because we 
don’t like the owners, or what is written in the papers or 
what the CEO has acknowledge is of concern to you.  What 
do you say about that concern? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So what I see here he is alleging that I 
didn’t like the owners of VR Laser and it was – for me it 
was not necessarily the people behind, it was – how do I 
20 
put this – it was more how business was being done and 
the connections that were being alleged.  Everybody knows 
about it, it was in the media, and it was not because it was 
in the media that I had a problem – how do I – I am trying 
to find ...[intervenes]  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 193 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has to be that if you have the interest 
of the company at heart you would be concerned if you find 
that ...[intervenes]  
MS MALAHLELA:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the company is doing business with 
entities who damage the reputation of the company. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Absolutely, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from processes if you find out that 
the type of entity that you have contractual relationship 
with is not the type of entity that you would like to be 
10 
associated with, obviously that must be a concern if you 
have the interest of the company at heart.  
MS MALAHLELA:   Absolutely, what I wanted to highlight I 
believe that did not like or I would just use hate, it is a 
strong word, I did not hate VR Laser and I did not dislike 
VR Laser, it was what was happening that I had a problem 
with. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Malahlela his next paragraph 
starts, and I am not going to read the whole thing he says: 
“I am convinced that the successes DLS recently 
20 
had was amongst others also due to VR Laser 
sterling performance as strategic supplier...” 
And here I am just going to paraphrase if I may Chair, he 
refers to the Tarratel contract in Malaysia involving VR 
going extremely well, he doesn’t believe any other current 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 194 of 260 
 
supplier could have achieved this, he refers to the UN for a 
contract for the supply of Caspers that they required that 
when the matter, when the contract was awarded to DLS it 
was on condition VRU was used to fabricate because of 
their vast experience and also he refers to Patria in 
Finland finding that VR was the most competent.   
 
So in other words he is saying we did the right thing 
by appointing VR Laser because they are excellent at their 
job  Any reaction to that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   So as I just said previously I did not 
10 
hate or dislike VR Laser, it was the way of doing business 
that I had a problem with. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then he concludes his letter by 
saying this: 
“Therefore Celia what I am trying to say is that VR 
Laser is widely acknowledged as one of our very 
best suppliers.  They are black-owned and I believe 
that 
proper 
processes 
were 
followed 
in 
their 
selection.  We cannot now cancel their contracts 
just because the papers paint a negative picture of 
20 
their involvement with the Guptas and a possible 
risk on our reputation in dealing with the VR is not 
something we are supposed to take a view on.” 
What he seems to be suggesting, if I might just stop there, 
is that it is not appropriate for you as the head of 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 195 of 260 
 
procurement within the DLS Division to be troubling 
yourself or troubling others in relation to reputational 
damage to Denel because of publicity attached to links 
with the Guptas which could imply something improper.  
What do you say about that? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That is my understanding as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes was that criticism of you valid? 
MS MALAHLELA:   That I should not be concerning 
myself? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:     Yes. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:   As a manager in the company that I am 
proud of and is a State owned company I ought to be 
concerned about such matters. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because – there may be many reasons 
for that but simply at a pure level you were saying in your 
email to him how proud you were to be associated with 
Denel – then systems and Denel, obviously if because of 
the company doing business with people who have very 
bad reputation that may impact on the reputation of the 
20 
company you work for as well, you might not be so proud in 
the future to be associated with Denel if whenever Denel’s 
name is mentioned it is mentioned in the same sentence as 
an entity that has a bad reputation. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Absolutely and it might actually go 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 196 of 260 
 
beyond that to the extent that our customers or business 
people that we do business with all over, people meaning 
companies and different people that we dealt with around 
the world would have a problem doing business with us 
because of the reputation, they would not want to be 
associated with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they might not want to deal with 
you, actually I heard evidence last year banks might – they 
look at their clients reputation and if you are associated 
with negative things and negativity they don’t want you as 
10 
a client, so it is maybe Mr Burger when he comes here will 
explain this and maybe when he does we will understand 
his point of view but for now I would have thought that 
everybody would want their company not to be impacted 
negatively in terms of their reputation because of who they 
do business with. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Now how did you feel, 
we will get to your response in a moment, in fact can I just, 
perhaps I must just finish off reading the letter from Mr 
20 
Burger, he says after saying it is not something we are 
supposed to take a view on – 
“This is something for DCO to consider and I would 
take it up with them.” 
You indicated earlier that is the corporate office, that is at 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 197 of 260 
 
head office level of Denel, above the Division. 
MS MALAHLELA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so he said it is not for you to 
trouble yourself with this, he will raise it with DCO and 
then he says: 
“So Celia may I please request that we discuss this 
matter when I am back in the office on Monday.” 
How did you feel though when you got this response from 
him? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I was intimidated to say the least and I 
10 
was wondering what he was going to say to me when he 
gets to the office. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you have a meeting with him? 
MS MALAHLELA:   We did and the meeting he just kept on 
going round and round, we did not get to the solution 
where we get to – as you know today the contracts were 
never terminated. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did he give you any feedback to the 
effect that he had or had not raised it with DCO, with Head 
Office? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you at any stage consider 
yourself raising your concerns at a level higher than Mr 
Burger? 
MS MALAHLELA:   I did. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 198 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you take any steps in that 
regard? 
MS MALAHLELA:   Yes I spoke to the Group CFO as I 
mentioned a bit earlier and unfortunately he left the 
company after that and I felt that I was running out of 
avenues and I started saving money so that I would be 
able to leave the company and be self-sustainable and be 
able to pay my bills, even if I resign without a job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how strongly you felt about what 
you – these issues? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  But I needed to be – should I say – I am 
looking for the word it is right on top of my – I needed to 
ensure that I am not taking a risky decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just say that again? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I needed to ensure that I am not taking a 
– too much risk when it comes to my personal finances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in terms of leaving before you made 
proper… 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Before I have a job then I end up in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Financial difficulties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you stay in Supply Chain at DLS for 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 199 of 260 
 
the rest of your time at Denel? 
MS MALAHLELA:  No I left Denel in 2016. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry when did you leave Denel? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I left – sorry I left DLS in 2016. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  DLS in 2016.  Where did you go to? 
MS MALAHLELA:  I resigned without a contract at the time 
and on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you left at the end of 2016? 
MS MALAHLELA:  At the end of the same year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  [Inaudible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja same year ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:  During the time when I was serving notice 
I was then asked what happened.  I did not want to go into a 
lot of details but essentially I was asked to come and work at 
DCO and I worked with Mr Mlambo and the COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me understand that.  At a certain 
stage towards the end of the year or 2016 you decided you 
were going to leave Denel. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you could leave you were asked 
to work at Denel Corporate Office. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That request had nothing to do with your 
impending departure at the time. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 200 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they just… 
MS MALAHLELA:  The request did not exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they did not know any – about your 
plans. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MALAHLELA:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then what happened?  How long did 
you work DCO – DCO? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  I may just add on that maybe something – 
maybe this point it is also important.  So on the day of my 
farewell at DLS as I was driving back to the office Stephan 
gave me – Mr Burger gave me a call that I should come to 
his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now on the last day at DLS? 
MS MALAHLELA:  On the last day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but as you were arriving in the 
morning? 
MS MALAHLELA:  We went to go and have a farewell 
20 
breakfast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and then when you came back. 
MS MALAHLELA:  When I was now driving back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So he asked me to have a meeting with 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 201 of 260 
 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you made a decision you were going to 
leave Denel. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
you 
made 
that 
decision 
in 
circumstances 
where 
you 
had 
not 
obtained 
another 
employment? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct I did not have a new contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not have any contracts? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had reached a point where you 
said you could not continue. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Denel. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So the intention at the time was that I 
would do volunteer work and I will talk to different people 
and see who is willing to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So he asked you to come 
and see him? 
MS MALAHLELA:  He asked me to come and see him and 
when I got to his office he actually made me an offer to stay.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 202 of 260 
 
And I believe – this is what I heard later on that he had gone 
and asked HR – so I – I do not have evidence I heard from 
different people – from somebody else that he had gone and 
asked HR the salaries of the other EXCO members that were 
highly paid.  And he used this as the benchmark as to how 
much he can offer me to stay.  But now he was bidding 
against corporate people now which was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DPO. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wanted you at a certain salary as well. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Exactly.  No, no D – I left without an 
increase in my salary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh DCO was going to take you without an 
increase on your salary. 
MS MALAHLELA:  I did not get an increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was offering you. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  More. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And what did you do? 
MS MALAHLELA:  And I told him I will think about it and 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 203 of 260 
 
there was nothing to think about.  I just wanted to appease 
him.  I went back and I told him I cannot take it and I left.  
And following that the environment or rather the relationship 
has not been – the greetings were less – we would meet at 
DCO sometimes it will be like – ja anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what extent did the tone and content of 
his response to you in terms of this email at – starting at 
697?  Contribute to your decision to leave. 
MS MALAHLELA:  I felt powerless and I believe that if you 
can no longer make a contribution in a company then you 
10 
should not be there just for the sake of just sitting there 
doing what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Your role in a company is to make a 
meaningful contribution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  And if the company does not serve you or 
provide you with that kind of environment anymore then you 
should not be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And how long did you work at DCO? 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  I worked there roughly for about seven 
months without being in any particular role and around 
August I was asked to act in a position and when I left I was 
acting in this position.  I had no real position that I was 
appointed in. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 204 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the notice that you had served or you 
were serving at the time you went to have break – a farewell 
breakfast or whatever that was a notice of resignation from 
DLS. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Which was revoked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was revoked. 
MS MALAHLELA:  When I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you went to DCO? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes it was handled as a transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and then you had to do a fresh 
10 
resignation later on from DCO? 
MS MALAHLELA:  In 2017 – 2017 I then left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Was it in 2017 I have got the – the facts 
in here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So earlier on you said you left 
them. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Sorry not in 2017 I started at DCO in 
2017 I left Denel in 2019 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you left DLS towards the end of 2015. 
20 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And went to DCO. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you left DCO and Denel in its 
entirety in 2019? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 205 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay alright.  Ms Kennedy I 
continued because I thought you were still – so you can – 
you can continue or finish off. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whichever. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you very much.  I just have one 
further question of the witness and it relates to a problem 
that arose earlier in her evidence.  Because and we 
apologise for this the annexure was omitted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Malahlela I am going to – just going 
to read out the paragraph if I may of your affidavit where this 
arose just for the Chairperson’s assistance.  It is at page 
161 paragraph 5.17 and 5.18.  What you said is this: 
“As is apparent from the draft letter the 
Group 
Supply 
Chain 
Executive 
and 
you 
mentioned 
that 
was 
Mr 
Mlambo 
was 
requested a grantees’ approval in the imple – 
for the implementation of the DLS EXCO 
20 
decision of 29 October 2015” 
That was the memorandum of agreement with VR Laser and 
that that took precedence over the procurement policy.  And 
then you said: 
“Mr Mlambo did not co-sign the letter.” 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 206 of 260 
 
And you attach a copy of the letter and you may recall Chair 
that that is the unfortunately in a copy in process that was 
not apparently available and that you will find Chair at page 
5 – sorry 680.  680 of the same bundle.  And we indicated 
that we would deal with that in evidence of Mr Mlambo but 
when the document became available we would refer to it to 
your attention.  My learned colleagues have efficiently found 
the document in the very same bundle as an annexure to Mr 
Mlambo’s affidavit.  I am not going to take the witness to the 
affidavit but if I may refer her to the relevant page and just 
10 
ask her to confirm is this the letter that she had in mind that 
Mr Mlambo was not prepared to approve.  Can I take you 
please Ma’am to page number 840.  Do you have that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Page 840? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  840. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Oh that is now beyond my section. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is correct. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Ja.  Yes that is the one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  This is the letter that we looked at 
earlier in draft form I believe which here is signed by you 
20 
and am I correct in understanding it was then sent for 
approval by Mr Mlambo.  Are you able to say there appeared 
to be two signatures further down the page – there is a note 
– a handwritten note that starts NB and that is followed by a 
signature and then further on it appears to be a different 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 207 of 260 
 
handwriting and another signature from Mr Nsepe.[?]  The 
first signature do you recognise that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Whose signature is that? 
MS MALAHLELA:  It is looks like Mr Mlambo’s signature just 
after the comment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So did he sign where you typed 
approval – was he meant to sign there if he did approve it? 
MS MALAHLELA:  That was my understanding. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Did he sign it? 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  No as… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what is – what his note says is a 
DVS and LMT must submit proof that they cannot meet the 
requirements prior to the contract being awarded to VR 
Laser. 
MS MALAHLELA:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  I am trying to 
follow what he is saying here.  What you had said in the 
letter that he is not signing is that you had expressed your 
20 
view that this should follow due process but EXCO had 
decided that it was not going to happen and that they had 
asked you to draft a letter to him. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you had done. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 208 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you expected him sign approval he 
does not. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes I thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is the context of saying DVS and 
LMT 
must 
submit 
proof 
that 
they 
cannot 
meet 
the 
requirements.  What is he talking about? 
MS MALAHLELA:  As you may recall earlier we spoke about 
inter group procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  So LMT and DVS are in – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are they group entities? 
MS MALAHLELA:  So he was saying that they must then say 
that they cannot do the work before we can approach 
somebody else to do the same work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But they are both group entities.  I 
know that you said LMT is sometimes… 
MS MALAHLELA:  LMT – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Regarded as group entity sometimes not. 
MS MALAHLELA:  With that understanding then. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MALAHLELA:  You can say they are group entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  And I say with regard to LMT [00:12:23]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was addressing a concern you had 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 209 of 260 
 
not raised here. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just his own issue. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So conflicts between policy and signed 
MOU’s.  So policy said inter group you must go to inter 
group companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  So it was related to what I had raised in 
here – what I sought guidance on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  Because we are referring now on 
paragraph 2. 
“Under no circumstances shall products or 
services that can be procured from group 
entity 
or 
division 
be 
procured 
from 
an 
external supplier on non-Denel companies 
unless there is an approval by the Group 
Supply Chain Executive based on sound 
reasons.” 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes. 
 
So 
this 
would 
address 
the 
20 
requirement that group entities must be given an opportunity 
to do the job. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And only if they cannot do it do you go 
outside? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 210 of 260 
 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have addressed that issue what he 
is talking about. 
MS MALAHLELA:  If they have sound reason.  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would not have addressed your due 
process concerns. 
MS MALAHLELA:  Concerns.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would not have addressed that. 
MS MALAHLELA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
MS MALAHLELA:  I believe but I am sure Mr Mlambo will 
speak to it.  There was a point where he addressed the MOU 
itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He? 
MS MALAHLELA:  He addressed the MOU itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MALAHLELA:  But I am sure he will speak to that in his 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  And just to provide clarity 
20 
to a question that the Chair raised earlier.  You have 
confirmed LTN was a group entity.  DVS stands for what? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Denel Vehicle Systems. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that is – was also a group entity? 
MS MALAHLELA:  Yes which is the previous BAE. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 211 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair there are no 
further questions from us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that Mr Kennedy we have taken 
much longer with this witness than we thought. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I think that it was necessary and 
issues have been dealt with.  We have done justice to the 
issues there – there were important issues that her evidence 
covered.  Thank you very much Ms Malahlela for availing 
yourself and it – from what I am told it looks like you may 
10 
have had to shift your travelling arrangements in order to be 
able to give the commission adequate time.  Thank you very 
much.  We appreciate that.  Thank you for coming to give 
evidence.  You are now excused.  Thank you.  Mr Kennedy I 
am available for us to use whatever time we can with the 
next witness if that is – that is fine with you? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes may we proceed with the next 
witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  He has been waiting for some hours. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it would be useful if we could to at 
least start his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at least we can use the hour and then 
we can talk about whether he is available tomorrow morning 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 212 of 260 
 
to continue before we go to the next witness or whatever 
arrangements … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  May I then call to the 
witness stand Mr Mandla Denis Mlambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  The files for the witness?  
I think – I think nobody told Ms Malahlela that they should 
remain here – the bundles. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry I did not hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying nobody seems to have told Ms 
Malahlela that the bundles should remain here. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Oh I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but she is still around. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Oh dear I am sorry about that Chair.  
The attorneys are also… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MLAMBO:  Mandla Nkosi Denis Mlambo. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR MLAMBO:  No I do not. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Do you consider the oath to be binding 
on your conscience? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 213 of 260 
 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR MLAMBO:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you; you may seated. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Perhaps for you 
Chair may I just ask the witness perhaps to remove his mask 
so that it will be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  More comfortable for him and more 
audible for us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.   You may be seated. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good afternoon Mr Mlambo. 
MR MLAMBO:  Good afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think just lower your microphone a 
little bit.  Yes, yes.  Are you comfortable? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I suggest some guidance so that 
the Chair will be able to hear your voice clearly and the 
microphone will as well.  I know normally when people ask 
20 
you questions you will look at the person who is asking the 
question.  I am going to ask you to act contrary to that for 
this afternoon.  When you hear my questions will you please 
direct your face towards the Chair and the microphone so 
that he and the microphone pick up your evidence clearly? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 214 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If you could please try and remember 
that.  Thank you Mr Mlambo.  I know it is not all that 
comfortable but it will help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see that he is settling himself to 
look this side. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us see he will manage.  I – it is 
important that I hear what you say Mr Mlambo, you 
understand? 
10 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it might be the chair.  It looks like you 
are not very comfortable in that chair.  You will manage? 
MR MLAMBO:  Ja I will – I will manage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
MR MLAMBO:  There is not much I can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So when you give answers try and 
look this side. 
MR MLAMBO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR MLAMBO:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mlambo is it correct that 
you have consulted with us as the legal team for the 
commission dealing with Denel? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes I have indeed. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 215 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And also with the investigators and you 
have produced an affidavit, is that correct? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I ask you in the file in front of you.  
Do you have – do you have the document that bears your 
name?  If I can ask you please to look at page numbers that 
are made on the top left of each page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just for the record Mr Kennedy you confirm 
that for this witness too we are using the same bundle that 
we were using for the previous? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is correct so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Witness which is Denel Bundle 01. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  01 that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it appears Chair as Exhibit W11. I 
will ask to have that admitted once I have had him confirm 
that it is his signature etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Mlambo do you have page 704?  Mr 
Mlambo will you please just look at the page number on the 
20 
top and see if you have got page 704? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The black numbers. 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and is that the first page of what 
is referred to as a statement bearing your name, Mandla 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 216 of 260 
 
Denis Mlambo? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is this the affidavit that you signed as 
requested by the commission’s investigators? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Can I ask you please now 
to turn to the end of that affidavit at page 733.  Do you have 
that? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that your signature that appears 
10 
there above the signature of the Commissioner of Oaths? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes it is indeed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Do you – do you confirm Mr Mlambo 
that this is your affidavit and that its contents are true and 
correct? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Chair may we then formally 
ask for the admission of this exhibit that is Exhibit W11 in 
Denel Bundle 01 as an exhibit of this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you the statement or affidavit by Mr 
20 
Mandla Denis Mlambo starting at page 704 is admitted as 
Exhibit W11.  Is that right? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  W11 that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mlambo I am 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 217 of 260 
 
going to take you through some parts of your affidavit and 
the annexures that require particular focus.  Now you were 
previously employed by Denel, is that correct? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  When did you start there? 
MR MLAMBO:  In 2004. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I can take you to page 706 you have 
referred to your various qualifications which include a 
Bachelor of Commerce Degree from Unisa. 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And various diplomas and other 
qualifications, Correct? 
MR MLAMBO:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And now are you still working for 
Denel? 
MR MLAMBO:  No I am not I am actually in the consulting 
business now. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right when did you leave Denel? 
MR MLAMBO:  I left Denel in June 2019. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  2019? 
20 
MR MLAMBO:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And what position did you hold at that 
stage that when you left? 
MR MLAMBO:  When I left I was still Group Supply Chain 
Executive. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 218 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And when did you take up that 
position? 
MR MLAMBO:  It was in 2012. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now if I can take you to your paragraph 
2.5 on page 706 you make reference to your role previously 
as Executive manager for Supply Chain and then you make 
reference to developing and implementing various systems.  
Did those systems relate to procurement in particular? 
MR MLAMBO:  No they actually relate to business systems 
and processes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As Group Supply Chain – Group Executive 
Supply Chain Management were the people who would report 
to you be people who were in different divisions or 
subsidiaries of Denel but those who were Supply Chain 
Management positions in Supply Chain Management – like 
managers. 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes it was essentially the Supply Chain Head 
at the various divisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MLAMBO:  In Denel. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – so in the context of the evidence of 
Ms Malahlela would that have been Mr Teubes who would 
have reported to you? 
MR MLAMBO:  So there was actually a dotted line.  It – the 
Supply Chain divisional heads actually reported either to the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 219 of 260 
 
CEO or the COO or the CFO at the division and there was a 
dotted line to.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh to you?  Okay. 
MR MLAMBO:  That is to my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So your position was that of Group 
Supply Chain Executive for the group as a whole. 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then the group comprised various 
entities head office and a whole lot of divisions. 
MR MLAMBO:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And was DLS one of those divisions? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And DVS another? 
MR MLAMBO:  And yes DVS as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And did each of those have their own 
procurement section as well? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes each of the divisions had a supply chain 
20 
function from the people prepared to call that a procurement 
function. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And would you liaise with those 
people? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes we had regular meetings and they were 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 220 of 260 
 
also at liberty to consult with me if they had challenges. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now – so was – did you have 
contact with Ms Malahlela who gave evidence before you 
today? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes I did probably more so than with other 
divisions.  I suppose that would have been because of the 
Hoefyster contract. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now let us get immediately to 
that Hoefyster contract and you deal first with the Hoefyster 
contract it was specifically for the production of 217 
10 
armoured hulls.  Is that right? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you deal with that in your affidavit 
from – in paragraph 3 from the top of page 708.  Now you 
refer first to the procurement policy; were you involved in a 
formulation of that procurement policy once you were 
appointed as Group Executive? 
MR MLAMBO:  No the 2008 version I was not involved in the 
drafting thereof and giving inputs to that.  I actually inherited 
it. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Inherited that? 
MR MLAMBO:  That the 2008 version. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Was that then revised? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes it was revised. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  When was that? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 221 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:  In 2014.  Well if the process actually started 
in 2013 but it was ultimately approved in 2014 in November. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR MLAMBO:  Because it had to be ultimately approved by 
the Denel board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Can I take you please in this 
bundle to page 742.  Do you have that? 
MR MLAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just tell the Chair please what this 
document is? 
10 
MR MLAMBO:  This is a Delegation of Authority that was 
issues in November 2012 but that was for the whole group of 
Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So would that have to be followed and 
applied in a division such as DLS and DVS? 
MR MLAMBO:   Oh, yes across the group with the provision 
that divisions were actually given the right to customise, so 
long as they did not deviate from ensuring that there was 
alignment with the group delegation of authority. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now I may I ask you please to 
20 
refer to page 757.  I apologise, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now may I draw your attention to 
paragraph 5.1?  Just explain to the Chair very briefly what 
this provides, 5.1? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 222 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   5.1 essentially stipulates ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  5.1 at what page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 757, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   757.  Yes, okay. 
MR MLAMBO:   This deals with the normal procurement of 
product and services.  And of course, it also stipulates 
approval levels associated with this delegation of authority 
depending on the value of the transaction.   
 
Then 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
executive 
or 
individual 
authorised to approve.  If you look at the first one.  Anything 
10 
below 50 million and equal to 50 million would have had to 
be approved.   
 
The transaction would have had to be approved by the 
divisional 
CEO. 
 
And 
then 
between 
50 million 
and 
200 million, the Group CEO and anything above 200 million 
had to be approved by the board.   
 
But in all instances, I had to be consulted to satisfy 
myself that the processes were followed were consistent with 
the policy and the relevant legislation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And where do we find that in reference 
20 
to that in this table? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Kennedy. 
MR MLAMBO:   It is in the remarks, the last columns. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second.  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  I 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 223 of 260 
 
just want us to connect this with what we were dealing with 
earlier.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember when we were dealing with 
Ms Malahlela that reduced price of the ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That reduced price of VR Laser.  You 
know, they reduced the price and we were wondering 
whether the reduction of the price meant that the deal could 
be approved by the GCO, GCE or by the board.   
10 
 
It appears now that we have gone back to these 
delegations that if it was 200 or more than 200, it should 
have gone to the board.   
 
I am under the impression that the reduced price was 
still over 200.  I may be mistaken but I thought it was 200 
and something million, the one that VR Laser used after 
reducing it.  It was ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [microphone not switched on] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, okay.  No, that is fine.  It is 
just that I remembered that we were not sure when 
20 
Ms Malahlela was given evidence and I was interest in 
seeing whether it was an amount should have gone to the 
board or the Group CEO.  Okay alright.  Continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mlambo, so you have dealt with 
who has to approve it in a case of a contract with over 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 224 of 260 
 
200 million.  Only the board could approve that, correct? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you were just taking... 
starting to take the Chair to the final column of this table and 
you said that in all three categories, your approval – you are 
the Group Supply Chain Manager referred to in that last 
column.  Is that right? 
MR MLAMBO:   That is right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Is Group Supply Chain 
10 
Manager the same as Group Supply Chain Executive or 
something? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought the manager would be lower.  
Executive would be higher.  [laughing]   
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, unfortunately, I did not proofread this 
delegation of authority before it was issued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 You 
did 
not 
demote 
yourself 
Mr Mlambo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
MR MLAMBO:   No, I was not party to the drafting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Oh.  But it seems that from the item 
that starts with less or equal to 50 million, in the last 
column, 
we 
see 
Group 
Supply 
Chain 
Manager 
prior 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 225 of 260 
 
consultation on procurement above 20 million.   
 
So am I right in understanding that if it is less than 
20 million, the Provisional Procurement people do not need 
to consult you prior to giving... to recommending for approval 
by their CEO but if it is between 20 million and 50 million, 
they do? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, anything from 20 million had to go 
through my office. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then the same point is in 
the next item in that last column.   
10 
“And then for contract above 200 million, a report 
outlining the process followed to invite a shortlisted 
of 
suppliers 
and 
evaluation 
of 
scores 
of 
the 
shortlisted supplies and recommendations of the 
Tender Committee must also be tabled to the board 
for approval.” 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that is correct. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
And 
so 
for 
those 
contracts 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry again Mr Kennedy.  I just want 
20 
to make sure that I understand what I talked earlier about 
the title.  Is the position that where it says Group Supply 
Chain Manager, it is correct?  Or is the position that there is 
something wrong, it should have said executive? 
MR 
MLAMBO: 
 
 
It 
should 
have 
said 
executive 
but 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 226 of 260 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So the correct position is that the person 
who was supposed to be referred to here is Group Supply 
Chain Executive.  It was a mistake that it was said manager? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, because I was the only one in the group 
in that position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  So if I make a note to 
say executive, it is actually correct? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you, Mr Kennedy. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just to complete 
that with you, Mr Mlambo.  Which Divisional Procurement 
and other officials such as Ms Malahlela have understand 
this delegation, when they read it, if still Group Supply Chain 
Manager, would you expect them to understand that to mean 
you as Group Supply Chain Executor? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, because this was actually at group level 
and there could not be any other Group Supply Chain 
Executive or Manager except me at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the titles, at group level, would 
20 
you have anybody that could be referred to as manager? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You could have? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, you could still find that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But certainly, within Group Supply 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 227 of 260 
 
Chain at group level, there was no person who was manager.  
There was just the executive which was you. 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, there was a Group Supply Chain 
Support Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Manager. 
MR MLAMBO:   That was reporting to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this Group Supply Chain Manager 
could actually cause confusion? 
10 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the other one would not know 
whether they left out supply, to say Group Supply Chain 
Manager 
or 
whether 
they 
meant 
Group 
Supply 
Chain 
Executive? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, it could definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MLAMBO:   I think the people were just not meticulous 
enough in drafting and putting a document like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Okay Mr Kennedy. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now your affidavit 
then refers to a submission that you received from the DLX 
Exco.  I just want to get the page for you.  May I just have a 
moment, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 228 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the same bundle, if you can turn 
please to page 772? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, 772? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, I have found that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now what is that document?  It is 
headed:  Group Chief Executive Offices Supply Chain 
Submissions.  And it is dated the 1 s t of July 2014.  And it is a 
note addressed to Exco.  Would that be Group Exco or DLS 
Exco? 
10 
MR MLAMBO:   This was actually from DLS and it was a 
submission for approval of VR Laser for the supply 217 
platform house.  Although, here it refers to 183 platform 
house.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we have...  The Commission has 
already heard evidence of a previous witness.  If I can just 
take you to page 774.  There is an explanation for how the 
217 was reduced to 183.   
MR MLAMBO:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was it sent to you simply to give 
20 
your views or to approve it or reject it? 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, this one, if I look at the signature, it is 
on the last page.  It actually bypassed my office and what 
should have happened before it went to the Group CEO, it 
should have gone through my office so I could actually verify 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 229 of 260 
 
whether the process that was followed was clean and 
compliant with our policy and relevant pieces of legislation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where... on what page are 
you looking at, what you are saying, you say it had bypassed 
your office?  I assume that is because you see somebody’s 
signature or what? 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, this one is not signed.  I think there is 
one that has got my name but that is the one we will 
probably talk about later that I rejected later. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what makes you say it has bypassed 
your office?  What is that you see that makes you say that? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, the Group CEO could not possibly have 
known that the process was compliant and for a big 
transaction like this one, it was a huge risk for him to simply 
append his signature because that entire transaction could 
be deemed irregular.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I would understand if you say that 
when we see where he has already signed before without 
you signing.  So I am looking and I wondering whether there 
20 
is a page like that where you say:  I can see it bypassed me 
because on this page there is Group CEO’s signature but 
there is my signature.   
MR 
MLAMBO: 
 
 
Ja, 
okay 
this 
one 
is 
not 
signed 
...[intervenes]  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 230 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say there is another one that is 
signed. 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is basically the same thing? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, that is the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so you... so that is why you say, 
bypassed your office? 
MR MLAMBO:   H’m. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Now Mr Mlambo, your 
affidavit indicates that you had difficulties with this proposed 
transaction and you raise some of the reasons in your 
affidavit and you refer to a number of emails that we will 
come to in a moment.  May I take you...  Yes, let me take 
you immediately to page 787.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   787. 
CHAIRPERSON:   787.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact...  No, it starts at 788.  It is an 
email from Reenen.  Is that Mr Reenen Thebus?   
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At the top.  In fact, let us start in the 
middle.  That seems to be your first email.  It comes from 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 231 of 260 
 
you on the 2n d of September to Celia and Reenen.  Is that 
Celia Malahlela and Reenen Thebus?   
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer to LMT having a 
valid BBBEE certificate.   
“I am baffled as to why it was not submitted as per 
your claim at this evening’s meeting.  I will request 
details from Stephan Nel about the pricing and proof 
of shareholding of VR Laser as issued.” 
 
So there are two issues that you raise here in this brief 
10 
email and that is LMT whether it has a valid BBBEE 
certificate.   
 
And then, the second issue is the shareholding of VR 
Laser.  And you... that seems to have been raised in a 
meeting that you held with your colleagues from DLS.  Was 
there such a meeting? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, there was a meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what was the purpose? 
MR MLAMBO:   The purpose was actually to convince me to 
approve this transaction to award the contract for 183 
20 
platform house to VR Laser.  And after having looked at the 
entire submission, the scoring.   
 
The way the entire process was handled, I was actually 
not just angry but I felt that this is a process that is being 
manipulated in order to favour VR Laser.  There were two 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 232 of 260 
 
critical things that I was actually angry over.   
 
The first one was that this should not have actually even 
gone out to external parties or companies to quote because 
we had acquired LMT in particular to actually design and 
manufacture the same products so that we could meet our 
contractual obligations on the Hoefyster contract.  So it 
baffled me.   
 
And the other issue is that Mr Burger – because I was 
actually sitting on the board of DLS at the time.  He was 
actually at pains to convince the DLS Board about the 
10 
importance, the strategic importance of LMT.   
 
And he pointed out that if we did not save LMT because 
it was going through some financial difficulties.   
 
And there were also some governance lapses as well 
which we could address as a group.  He pointed out that we 
would not be in a position to execute the Hoefyster contract 
without LMT.  So this really shocked me.   
 
But the same person now was actually punting the 
importance of VR Laser to actually be a strategic supplier, 
replacing a company that is 51% owned by Denel.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words, the job that VR Laser 
was being asked to do was going to be asked to do it, all of 
these was approved, was a job that could be done by a 
company that is 51% owned by Denel? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, that is correct. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 233 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was one of your points? 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mlambo, can I take you there.  
There are a whole number of paragraphs.  Oh, sorry.  
Emails.  And I am not going to take you through them all but 
I just like to take you now to the one at page 787. 
MR MLAMBO:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact, on top of page 788, Mr Reenen 
Thebus was responds to you, to your earlier email that we 
10 
have just looked at.  And then you reply to him, it seems, on 
the 3r d of September on page 787.   
 
And you say the following: 
“Hi, Reenen.  Thanks for the prompt response.  As I 
did not have an opportunity to do a thorough study 
of all the tender submissions, I cannot categorically 
claim that the process was sufficiently objective and 
the confidence level is high enough to place it 
beyond reproach. 
Nonetheless, the following are key-issues that merit 
20 
a serious review of the adjudication process and 
outcome. 
1. The capability assessment of the three tenderers.  
Although LMT is the only one of the three 
tenderers that has manufactured the same hulls 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 234 of 260 
 
under contract from Patria, it obtained the lowest 
score.  DCD has never manufactured the same 
hulls and yet it obtained a higher score.  The 
Score Adjudication Team came up with these, 
based on the manufacturer of a different project.  
VR Laser will be manufacturing this type of hull 
for the first time and yet it has the highest score.” 
 
Was that concern you raised, was it raised as part of 
your duties as Group Supply Chain Executive? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, Chair.  It is true. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you raise in paragraph 2 the 
price difference between the VR Laser and LMT office being 
almost 100 million. 
“In my investigation, I was informed by Stephan that 
the LMT quote was based on factual figures since 
LMT has manufactured the hull before. 
If Stephan is right, it would not make business 
sense to pay so much more since LMT is a sister 
company. 
I believe someone at DLS should have demanded 
20 
supporting evidence before assuming that LMT 
under-quoted. 
I believe this anomaly warrants further investigation 
and validation.” 
 
Now, who had referred to LMT as having under-quoted? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 235 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, this is captured in some of the emails 
that are here and it was also raised during the meeting that 
we have had that evening.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   When you ...[intervenes]  
MR MLAMBO:   Or the evening before. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the meeting? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you deal with BBBEE 
credentials which were also referred to in the emails you 
mentioned.  Paragraph 3. 
10 
“LMT was given a zero score on transformation due 
to its expired certificate.  The two elements of 
transformation, 
namely 
ownership 
and 
EE 
(Employment Equity) could have been assessed 
without a valid BBBEE certificate. 
Such date should be readily available from the HR 
department.” 
 
Would HR department be the HR department of Denel 
Group head office? 
MR MLAMBO:   LMT HR Department. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   LMT HR Department? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And LMT, as you described it, was a 
sister company. 
MR MLAMBO:   That is right. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 236 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact, the Commission has heard 
evidence that it was 51% owned by Denel. 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you refer to that being readily 
available from the HR.  And then you continue. 
“BBBEE certificate.  Unless a company by a detailed 
report do not give enough detail to be able to score 
the two elements accurately, if the transformation 
aspects of LMT were considered in the evaluation, it 
could have been rated number 1.” 
10 
 
So it could have gone up if it had been given some 
BBBEE points?  Is that your point here? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that is why... that is correct, Chair.  That 
is why I suspected that there was something amiss here.  It 
was just a deliberate action on the part of DLS to simply 
disregard the BBBEE certificate of LMT.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, now how would LMT’s people BE 
profile or points have been assessed in the absence of a 
valid BE certificate?  How does that happen?  How does that 
20 
work? 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, in our evaluation, the focus was on 
ownership.  And ownership had actually improved by virtue 
of the fact that it was a majority owned by a state owned 
company that is an added benefit that it increases it score.  
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 237 of 260 
 
Prior to us acquiring LMT, it was a BBBEE Level 4 company.  
So it was definitely going to be better than a BBBEE 4, Level 
4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MLAMBO:   And then we would also look at the employee 
profile, which is the Employment Equity, a breakdown of the 
organisation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if a valid BEE or BBBEE certificate 
is a requirement, what is the effect if a company does not 
have a valid BBBEE certificate in terms of scoring. 
10 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, if the company is not in the process of 
being verified, then you would score that company a zero.  
But if a company has already communicated that they are in 
the process of being verified for BBBEE, as a potential 
client, you are actually expected to give that company an 
opportunity to complete that verification process provided 
that it is not going to be a prolonged process.  Normally, it is 
something that is done within a week.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But is the position not when you do these 
things in terms of processes that the closing date that is 
20 
given where you now going to talk generally, that closing 
date means each bidders, where you were talking about 
bidders, is supposed to ensure that its bid, that its bid is in 
and it satisfies all the requirements that it is supposed to 
satisfy?   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 238 of 260 
 
 
Therefore, if one of the requirements is a valid BE 
certificate and you do not file it, and by the closing date, that 
means you do not meet those requirements unless you move 
as a company.  You extent the closing date for everybody, I 
would imagine. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that is correct Chair.  That is what 
typically happens.  And the standard practise is that you do 
not start with the evaluation until such time that – if you 
have given a company five days to submit that BBBEE 
certificate or a tax clearance certificate for that matter, then 
10 
you only start after the company has failed to submit that on 
time.  If your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLAMBO:   ...be given a zero score for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But my point is this.  Is it not the effect of 
a closing date that you want to see those who complied with 
the requirements by the closing date and those who do not 
comply and they are all going to be judged according to 
whether as at the closing time they complied or time?   
 
In other words, if I put in my bid by four o’clock today 
20 
and today is the closing date, four o’clock.  And I have put in 
my tax certificate and you have put in your bid but you left 
out the tax certificate, you do not comply with the tax 
certificate 
requirement 
and 
therefore, 
you 
should 
be 
disqualified. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 239 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not how it works?  Because you are 
all given the same amount of time to comply.   
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the time the invitation is issued to or 
the request for proposals or whatever, from that date to the 
closing date, you all have the same amount of time to 
comply.   
 
Now I complied.  I make sure that I do my job, my 
homework timeously.  I am able by four o’clock to put in my 
10 
bid that complies with everything.   
 
You do not take this whole process seriously.  You do 
other things when you are supposed to do your homework 
and put your bid together.  And then at the last minute, you 
run around.   
 
By four o’clock, there is still something that you have not 
put in.  Therefore, you put in a bid that does not meet all the 
requirements.  You should be disqualified and I should go in.  
Is it not? 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, National Treasury has actually 
20 
incorporated this into an instruction note that if a company 
claims that it is in the process of being verified for its 
BBBEE status, it has to be given an opportunity.  It if it is in 
the process of rectifying its tax issues with SARS, it should 
be given an opportunity.   
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 240 of 260 
 
 
By the time you actually do your evaluation, if you have 
given them ample time which is reasonable and they have 
not complied, then you have got the right to disqualify them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying National Treasury has 
issued an instruction that says if by closing date they are – 
a company says they are in the process of obtaining 
verification for BEE or they are in the process of obtaining 
a tax clearance certificate you should give them an 
opportunity after the closing date? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, but the proviso is that you shall not, for 
10 
instance, contract a company that is not tax compliant but 
now 
will 
be 
the 
time 
when 
you 
in 
the 
process 
of 
contracting.  So if the company does not have or has not 
sorted out its tax issues with SARS then you cannot 
actually contract that company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand that part. 
MR MLAMBO:   But with BBBEE, if you have given them an 
opportunity and they have not actually presented their 
BBBEE certificate as per given time then you can give 
them a zero.  There is …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but are you saying National Treasury 
has issued an instruction that says if the company has 
failed by the closing date to include its BEE certificate or 
tax clearance certificate and says to you they are in the 
process of getting that, you should allow them time after 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 241 of 260 
 
the closing date to bring that in?  Is that what you are 
saying. 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes but that does not apply to other 
aspects like …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes only …[intervenes] 
MR MLAMBO:   …the technical requirements, those are 
nonnegotiable.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but these two there is room, a 
period of grace can be given to them. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is because of a special 
instruction from National Treasury, is that right? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja because an opportunity could actually 
arise at the time when you are in the middle of a BBBEE 
verification process and you should not be penalised 
because you are going through that process.  It does not 
take long to actually get your BBBEE. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Mlambo, if it is official, it is 
part of policy or it is part of the regulations that that can 
be done, that is fine, you know?  But if you ask me, there 
20 
is nothing wrong if you say well, you have a month or three 
months, all of you, to bring – to meet the requirements.  If 
you meet the requirements you will be in, if you do not 
meet the requirements you will be out but next time we 
issue another one, you might be ready and then you will be 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 242 of 260 
 
in but for now -  you are in if you meet the requirements, 
you are out if you do not meet the requirements but if there 
is a special statutory or regulatory provision or policy that 
says in regard to these specific requirements there will be 
some period of grace but not others.  I can understand that 
because maybe the idea is that, you know, they do not 
want to be too harsh in regard to those particular ones. 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is fine. 
MR MLAMBO:   Thanks Chair, may I have some water 
10 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If we can return to 
the emails that we were looking at.  We have looked at the 
one at 787.  Then, as I understand it, the email on page 
786 is the response to you from Stephan Burger. 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes.  Ja, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you – and I am not going to 
go through it, he raises various points and arguments as to 
why you should not be concerned about certain things and 
20 
you reply to him – I would like to take you to page 785.  
That is your email of the 4 September and that is 
addressed to Stephan where you were also copying in 
Celia Malahlela, Fikile Mhlontlo.  Just remind us please 
who Mr Mhlontlo was? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 243 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   He was the Group CFO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR MLAMBO:   Jan Wessels was the Group COO and 
Reenen Teubes was DLS’ COO and Riaz Saloojee was the 
Group CEO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now if you compare that list 
that you have just read out with the list of people who were 
copied in earlier email correspondence from you between 
you and initially Mr Teubes and then it seems to escalate 
to Stephen Burger.  This seems to be the first time that you 
10 
were coping in Riaz Saloojee, the Group Chief Executive.  
Why did you copy Mr Saloojee in on this? 
MR MLAMBO:   I realised that the issue was actually far 
from being resolved and it was serious enough to warrant 
his attention as the Group CEO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now if I may refer you to the 
body of your email addressed primarily to Mr Burger, you 
say: 
“We are clearly not aligned in terms of the analysis 
of the data and information that I saw for the first 
20 
time on Tuesday at the meeting I had with Reenen 
and Celia.” 
Was that the same meeting you mentioned earlier? 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “I certainly think we should not 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 244 of 260 
 
 exchange anymore emails on the issue in question 
as the resolution may be easier to find around a 
table.  However, the following issues have definitely 
not been addressed by your response.” 
And here you raise a number of issues in paragraph 1, you 
refer again to the huge price differential in the offers made 
by both LMT and VR Laser.  Now you have referred earlier 
to LMT being a 100 million – approximately a R100 million 
cheaper than VR Laser and then you refer to information 
you had from Stephan Nel from LMT talking about the fact 
10 
that they had produced the hull earlier and that is why their 
lower prices were reliable and VR Laser ’s quote, on the 
other hand, was not based on past performance.   
 
So did you feel that the price differential that you 
had referred earlier in an earlier email was not properly 
resolved? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes and it just did not make sense why 
people would be so anxious to pay R100 million more 
which would actually erode the bottom line of DLS.  It just 
was preposterous to me. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you deal in the second 
paragraph, number two, with the conflict of interest.  Just 
explain to the Chair please what was your concern about 
the conflict of interest issue? 
MR MLAMBO:   I was actually here referring to the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 245 of 260 
 
submission in terms of the ownership and the adjudication 
team that had actually accepted the fact that VR Laser was 
hundred percent black-owned company and yet they did not 
interrogate 
the 
fact 
that 
their 
individuals 
were 
not 
specified, but it was just companies and the document that 
was also submitted that was supposedly a list of the 
directors, it was not a valid CIPC document.  In my view it 
was a fake document and the people that had actually 
submitted the conflict of interest declarations were not 
really the entire team of directors of VR Laser, it was the 
10 
COO of VR Laser that had submitted and I think Mr Aurora 
as well but the other people that were actually critical, 
people like Salim Essa, had not submitted any declaration 
of interest.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At this stage that you sent this email 
were you aware that Mr Salim Essa in fact had an interest? 
MR MLAMBO:   I think it was probably shortly after getting 
a response from Mr Aurora because I followed that up to 
verify exactly who are the individual shareholders of VR 
Laser because in terms of the documentation that I had 
20 
seen that was evaluated by the evaluation team at DLS 
there was not a single name, it was just Elgasolve and 
Craig Shaw(?) Investments and I had to prod or push Mr 
Aurora to disclose that 74.9% shareholding of VR Laser 
was actually owned by Salim Essa but the 25.1%, I could 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 246 of 260 
 
not actually get any feedback on who owned that and yet 
there was this constant reference that VR Laser was 25.1% 
black women owned.  On what basis?  Because the 
evidence was not there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then if we can look at paragraph 3, 
that refers to the capability and how LMT was assessed to 
be the lowest on capability despite the fact that the two 
other companies, that is DMD and VR Laser, is they were 
successful, would be making this type of hull for the first 
time.  Is there anything you want to add to that?  It seems 
10 
to be to be clear. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, it actually defied logic as far as I was 
concerned but companies that had never manufactured 
platform hull were actually given a higher score on the 
technical evaluation and the company that was contracted 
by Patria, the OEM to make a prototype was actually given 
the lower score and it later turned out that they had 
actually also relied on unrelated aspects to rate these two 
companies.   DCD, for instance, was actually evaluated on 
a product that was totally different from what we have gone 
20 
out on tender for, closed tender for.   
 
And VR Laser had never manufactured this hull and 
it was actually given a score that was higher than the 
maximum.  The maximum technical score that was actually 
supposed to be given to bidders was 45 points and I 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 247 of 260 
 
remember seeing 50 point something points that was given 
to VR Laser and I said to myself this is a real farce. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just remind me.  You were now at this 
stage of this email at 785 you were dealing with this after 
the fact in the sense that this issue had not been brought 
to you on time but you got involved after it had bypassed 
your office. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that is correct, Chair.  In fact if they 
had come to me prior to taking the decision to go out to the 
market I would have said no, you are not going to do that, 
10 
we invested money in LMT for the very reason that we 
wanted to do well financially and technically in the 
execution of the Hoefyster contract.  So it just did not 
make sense.   
 
And what has really even got me hot behind the 
collar was the fact that the leadership at DLS was prepared 
to pay almost R100 million more than what LMT was 
actually quoting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe Mr Kennedy was going to 
deal with this later but it might be convenient.  Were you 
20 
ever told what  - were you ever given an explanation how 
this bypassed your office, how your – or how it was not 
brought in your office or why it was not brought to your 
office before being sent to the Group CEO and it being 
approved? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 248 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   I think the reason – this is my speculation, 
the reason is that they knew that I would go through this 
because of the value of the contract with a fine toothcomb 
and there was a very slim chance or no chance at all that I 
would actually approve the transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you not ask the relevant people 
how come you signed without seeing my signature on this 
thing or a question along those lines?  Why was it not 
brought to me? 
MR MLAMBO:   At this stage in fact they had not signed 
10 
the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, they had not signed at that stage? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, this was September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MLAMBO:   The contract was actually signed the 
following month. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  
MR MLAMBO:   But I had no clue that the contract was 
going to be signed or had already been signed at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
20 
MR MLAMBO:   Because of the exchanges that I did with 
the responsible – in fact the person that was supposed to 
ultimately sign this, if it was below 200 million was the 
group CEO Mr Riaz Saloojee.  That is why I made sure that 
he was aware of my concerns about the issues. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 249 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now if it was not brought to you, you 
were being bypassed, how did you become aware and you 
started sending emails?  How did that happen? 
MR MLAMBO:   It was after the meeting that we had had  
the night before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You heard at some meeting about it? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that was the meeting that we had 
because the idea was actually to sell the approval of this 
transaction to me in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
MR MLAMBO:   That was the purpose of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Alright, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, may I ask for the Chair ’s 
direction please?  I see it has already gone five o’clock 
and you have indicated to me you have other pressing 
matters to attend to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think let us go up to quarter past. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is fine, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That will also enable us to finish this 
20 
little section. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mlambo, just 
to pick up the last question raised by the Chair about not 
going through you.  You raise a problem in that regard, 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 250 of 260 
 
right at the end of your email, just before you end off with 
regards, do you see there is an unnumbered paragraph that 
starts: My contention?  Do you see that? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am going to go back to that 
sentence in a moment but the second line you say: 
“It is also worth mentioning that you flouted the 
delegation of authority by not presenting the file for 
review to me before engaging Fikile and Jan.” 
Presumably that Mr Mhlontlo and Mr Wessels. 
10 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “Any transaction above 20 million  
must go through my office first.  I am beginning to 
have doubts that this was an oversight.” 
What did you mean that you are having doubts it was 
oversight. 
MR MLAMBO:   I actually thought that was deliberate 
because they knew that the submission was not going to be 
approved by myself or go beyond my office and they felt 
that it would be better rather lobby the Group CEO to 
20 
approve it without me being involved. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MR MLAMBO:   There seemed to be an element of 
desperation of wanting to get this finalised as quickly as 
possible so that VR Laser would get the business. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 251 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if we can go back just to 
complete the remaining portions that we have not yet 
touched on.  Paragraph 4 refers to BBBEE certificates 
again.  You say: 
“I received evidence that that the two week grace 
period for the submission of the BBBEE certificate 
by LMT was met and yet you claim that they could 
not be considered as it was after the deadline. It is 
standard practice that a supplier that is being 
verified for BBBEE level cannot be penalised for 
10 
that especially if the critical data used in the 
assessment is readily available.   What makes this 
even more unacceptable is the fact that we have 
unhindered access to data and information at LMT.” 
The last sentence, is that again the point that because LMT 
is majority owned by Denel you would have access? 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I just want you to clarify the 
next sentence below paragraph 4.  You say: 
“My contention is that despite being convinced of a 
20 
fair 
and 
objective 
that 
was 
followed 
by 
the 
adjudication team, let us appoint an independent  
assessor to corroborate your claim.” 
Who are you referring to as the person being convinced 
that it was a fair and objective process, are you talking 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 252 of 260 
 
about yourself or others? 
MR MLAMBO:   Well, Mr Teubes and Mr Burger were 
actually of the view that – expressed that a number of time 
that the process was robust and fair and I just could not 
understand that because there was no evidence than 
looking at the submission that this was a fair process.  
 
There are other things that I did not include here 
that I should have mentioned.  The engagement of one of 
the bidders, whilst the process is still on is an absolute no-
no in supply chain.  If you engage any of the bidders you 
10 
engage them simultaneously and if there are questions that 
are raised you give those answers to all of them, even 
those that had not raised those issues and before the 
actual final approval of the transaction, they were already 
engaging with VR Laser on the pricing. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I take you now to the next email 
which appears at page 791?  Now this time it is not an 
email to Mr Burger who was copying in other …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page, 700 and…? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   791, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   791, okay.  Continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This is an email dated the 9 
September 2014 so it was a few days after the last email 
we saw a moment ago, correct? 
MR MLAMBO:   H’m. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 253 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just say yes if you agree. 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, Chair, I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And this time the email is addressed 
not to Mr Burger or Mr Teubes to Riaz Saloojee, Mr 
Mhlontlo and Johan Wessels, whose titles you have given 
us already and am I right in saying that this – you are now 
escalating to the top executive of Denel, the Group CEO, 
CFO and the COO? 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you say: 
10 
“I 
have 
managed 
to 
review 
DLS’ 
submissions 
pertaining 
to 
the 
abovementioned 
subject, 
the 
subject above is awarding of hull manufacturing 
contract to VR Laser.  Following issues paint an 
unacceptable picture from a process fairness and 
objective point of view: 
The tender documents were not sent to all the 
bidders 
simultaneously 
as 
per 
normal 
tender 
process.” 
Then secondly: 
20 
“Prior to the adjudication process there was still 
engagements 
or 
clarification 
sessions 
with 
individual bidders.  The process requires that such 
engagements be held with all bidders at the same 
time.  Information  that is requested by one of the 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 254 of 260 
 
bidders must be sent to others even if they did not 
ask for it.” 
Is this related a point you mentioned a moment ago that 
they were being dealt with separately? 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Paragraph 3: 
“Despite the fact that LMT’s BBBEE status was 
disregarded on grounds that it was still being 
verified and the deadline was the 25 June 2015, the 
VR Laser certificate was accepted and rated on the 
10 
27 June two days after the closing date.” 
In your submissions you say: 
“It is claimed that LMT’s quote is too low and 
unrealistic.  The difference between LMT’s quote 
and VR Laser quote is almost R1 million.  After 
questioning Stephan Nell on the accuracy of his 
quote…” 
That is LMT’s quote, is that right? 
MR MLAMBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “…he offered to come and present  
20 
the facts, demonstrated it was based on realistic 
quotes.   He claimed LMT had made the hull before 
under Patrias quote.” 
And then in paragraph 5 you refer to your meeting with 
Stephan Burger yesterday.  So was there a meeting with 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 255 of 260 
 
him on the 8 September which followed the earlier emails? 
MR MLAMBO:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say: 
“He indicated VR Laser had offered to reduce the 
quote from around 262 million to 195 million!  Does 
that not tell a disturbing story about the initial 
offer?  On the basis of these findings and other 
facts 
it 
is 
my 
considered 
opinion 
that 
the 
submission from DLS be rejected.  Since LMT has 
the capability to make the hull, this issue should 
10 
have been discussed before going out on tender.  
Good night.” 
Now just comment if you would, please, specifically on 
paragraph 5 how you found it disturbing that firstly there 
was about 100 million difference between the initial quotes 
or offers, paragraph 4.   
And then you were disturbed by the fact that Burger 
then tells you he has found that VR Laser is offering to 
reduce the quote from 262 million to 195 million.  What was 
the points of concern that you had in relation to that? 
20 
MR MLAMBO:   In the normal business world I cannot 
imagine a company that is well-run and it does proper 
costing just simply lopping off 67 million from a 262 million 
quote in one fell swoop.  It just did not make sense it 
means the quote was inflated in the first place and that 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 256 of 260 
 
suggested 
that 
something 
anomalous 
was 
actually 
happening with this transaction.  I can understand if the 
quote is reduced by 0.5% or 1% but this is far too 
significant to reduce a price on. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In your view based on procurement 
law and policies, was it permissible to allow tenderers such 
VR Laser changing their bids in this manner? 
MR MLAMBO:   No.  The only time you accept a bid that 
has been reduced is when that bidder has already been 
approved and awarded and once it has been awarded then 
10 
you can start the negotiations but in this particular 
instance the announcement had not even been made and 
they were already negotiating.  
 
And secondly, people outside supply chain are not 
supposed to get involved or dabble with procurement 
processes.  This is the terrain of the supply chain people 
because they understand the process better.  You cannot 
have everyone negotiating with suppliers.  I mean, that is 
simply messes up the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if Mr Burger was to have gone to VR 
20 
Laser to negotiate with them to reduce the price, one, 
because he was outside of supply chain he should not do 
that.  Two, he would have been acting in breach of policy 
because the policy allowed the negotiation of prices only 
under certain circumstances and by certain people. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 257 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, precisely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja.  This process had not been finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MLAMBO:   And they were already negotiating which 
begs the question, was the outcome not something that 
was actually planned?  The actual evaluation was simply to 
pull wool over our eyes, to give the impression that it was 
a fair objective and transparent process when it was not. 
 
You will actually see later in some of the emails that 
10 
were exchanged, Mr Burger himself saying that he was 
going to negotiate outside the normal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we saw that. 
MR MLAMBO:   And that he was going to fight to make 
sure that VR Laser got the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he said he would defend VR Laser.  
Ja, okay. 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, precisely.  So the process lost 
credibility right at the outset. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, may I ask one final question 
20 
before the take the adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you – can you recall ever 
receiving any response from Mr Saloojee, Mr Mhlontlo or 
Mr Wessels to this email where you raised these concerns? 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 258 of 260 
 
MR MLAMBO:   I never received any response from Mr 
Saloojee on the issue.  But what happened, the is a 
position paper that is in my file. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MLAMBO:   That we actually had a meeting, that was 
Mr Wessels, Mr Mhlontlo and myself …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, Mr Mlambo, sorry to interrupt, 
may I suggest subject to the guidance of the Chair that we 
leave that until you resume your evidence hopefully 
tomorrow morning, if you are available, to deal with that 
10 
because that is going to take a bit of time and we need 
some detail from you on the position paper. 
MR MLAMBO:   I am okay with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are available to continue tomorrow? 
MR MLAMBO:   I will have to cancel my appointments.  I 
do not want to be screamed at, but behaving like a good 
citizen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we are sorry that we have messed 
up your plans but we appreciate it if you can rearrange and 
be able to continue tomorrow. 
20 
MR MLAMBO:   Ja, I will certainly make myself available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Now, Mr Kennedy, 
you and I spoke I think yesterday and maybe last week 
about the possibility that some of the days we could start 
at nine. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 259 of 260 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think you indicated that you would 
appreciate it if we could start at nine tomorrow. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was even before this situation 
arose which is a reason we have taken – we took much 
longer with Ms Malahlela. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Malahlela, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I suspect that I might not be able to 
start earlier than ten tomorrow. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if my situation changes I will let you 
know and then maybe somebody can then advise Mr 
Mlambo and then if I am able then we can start at nine but 
as things presently stand I think we might not be able to 
start earlier than ten. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That may or may not affect Thursday as 
well but let us play it by ear. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we will see how we manage the 
situation in terms of the ripple effect on other witnesses. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
27 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 292 
 
Page 260 of 260 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  We are going to adjourn 
then until tomorrow ten o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 28 OCTOBER 2020
