PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 14 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair Mr Arthur Fraser has brought 
an application before the commission in which the Minister 
of State Security, the Director General State Security and 
the State Security Agency are the three respondents.  In 
essence he requests you Chair to direct in terms of the 
10 
commission’s powers under the Act and Regulations to 
order the respondents to provide documentation.   
 
The first respondent abides; the second respondent 
and third respondent are opposing.  There have been 
discussions between the parties but I am sure they will 
explain to you how these discussions have progressed but 
not yet reached finality and if I may Chair I will address 
you on the matter after the submissions have been made 
by the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.   Who appears for who?  
20 
You will have to put on your microphone or go to the 
podium if they sanitise it but if you can – if your 
microphone is working and you are happy to speak from 
there it is okay. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  I – it is working Chairperson and I 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 4 of 316 
 
rather speak from here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  For the record I am on – in respect 
of Mr Fraser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think – I think they are indicating 
that you – they – you are not audible enough or there is – 
so it is better that you go to the podium. 
ADV NDABELE:  Chair I am for the second and third. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Second and? 
ADV NDABELE:  And the third respondent  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Well just for 
the record just put – place the names – your names on 
record again. 
ADV NDABELE:   Advocate Bheki Ndabele for the second 
and the third respondents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes can they – they cannot hear I think 
maybe take off your mask for now – yes and then just 
speak up a bit.  They need – if they hear then we know that 
it will be in the transcript – if they do not hear it will not be 
in the transcripts. 
20 
ADV NDABELE:   Thank you Chair.  The name is Bheki 
Ndabele for the second and the third respondents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you that is the Director General of 
State Security Agency and as well as the State Security 
Agency.  Okay alright.  Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 5 of 316 
 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   For the record again Chairperson 
I am [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  On behalf of Mr Fraser ja in this 
matter and if I may address you on the events.  It is 
common cause Chairperson that from as early as August 
last 
year 
the 
applicant 
sought 
the 
disclosure, 
the 
declassification and disclosure of certain documents from 
the respondents.  The 00:03:40 Chairperson is that there 
has been no compliance to that request forcing him to 
10 
bring this application to yourself. 
 
And for the first time in the respondent’s answering 
affidavit do we get told that the respondents are willing to 
assist us with the documents that you require and subject 
to us providing them with the particularities for the 
documents 
that 
are 
required 
and 
owing 
perhaps 
to 
limitations of technology we could not file electronically 
our reply together with its annexures. 
 
I beg leave of the commission to hand to the 
Chairperson a copy of the reply.  I provided my learned 
20 
friend with a copy this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the replying affidavit? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   It is the replying affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you Chair.  I suppose you 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 6 of 316 
 
can never be too sure about these health issues you know.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And perhaps the one thing that I 
forgot to do is to apologise on behalf of my – my senior 
counsel Musi Sikhakhane had an emergency and cannot 
appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   We tried to – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I assume I will struggle ahead.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   But the reality Chairperson is that 
in our reply we then go to each and every document save 
for two but for some reason I – you know I skipped and 
explain why we require those documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you go further I think what 
I thought you would address first is what discussions – 
what has come out of the discussions because it may be 
that we should proceed; it may be that we should not 
proceed 
depending 
on 
what 
I 
am 
told 
about 
those 
20 
discussions. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   No that is fine.  I was just giving 
you a background of the discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   But the bottom line Chairperson is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 7 of 316 
 
that 
we 
have 
– 
following 
the 
undertaking 
by 
the 
respondents 
that 
they 
would 
provide 
us 
with 
those 
documents provided we give them the particularities.   
We provided them in the answering affidavit which 
we emailed to them last night and also the – the annexures 
which we only provided them today.   
The annexures is a statement of our client or the 
draft statement because those annexures would then 
inform that statement.  But then we – our view then which 
we indicated to our opponents is that to the extent that 
10 
they undertook to provide us with the documents provided 
that we give them the particularities.  We have done that.  
As far as you are concerned there is no matter to be 
argued anymore today.   
They need to apply their minds to the documents 
that we provided them and – and if they are uncertain of 
what it is that we really need then we can – there can be 
further engagements.  That Chairperson is my instruction 
and that is where the discussions went. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As it stands ja.  Well it seems to me that 
20 
because they have given that undertaking you are right in 
taking the attitude that you should give them time to apply 
their minds to the particulars that you have given so that 
they can give you the information you have asked for.  
Or if they have reason not to give some of the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 8 of 316 
 
information that is they can tell you why.  But it seems that 
there is no point in pursuing the application as of today.  It 
may well be that the application should be postponed 
either to a specific date or sine die so that stays the one 
point.  But the other point which I must say so that you and 
your client appreciate the situation is that as to what the 
commission can do at the time that your client will have 
received the documents that it is looking for in terms of the 
commission allocating any time for any evidence – I cannot 
give you any guarantee because of precisely where we are.  
10 
The oral evidence should have been finalised by end of 
March.   
We are in extra time and there is serious difficulty. 
You know April and May and June were supposed to be for 
the writing of the report.  So I am just mentioning that for 
what it worth that as an when you reach a point where you 
have got your – the information you are asking for we are 
not guaranteeing anything.  If at that stage you make a 
request to give evidence or whatever that will have to be 
looked at at that time against the constraints that will exist 
20 
at that time.  You appreciate that? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   We appreciate that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Mr Pretorius have you 
got anything to say?  Oh maybe I should hear what counsel 
for the second and third respondent has to say.  Are you 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 9 of 316 
 
able to speak from where you are?  Or if the microphone is 
going to give us problems they can sanitise the podium and 
then you can come to the podium.  Why does it look like it 
is unusually dark in this room today?  Is there some light 
that is not as bright as it should be?  Okay.  Yes.   
ADV NDABELE:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV NDABELE:  Chair maybe I must just cut to the chase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes do so. 
ADV NDABELE:  Based on… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NDABELE:  What my colleague has presented to the 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
NDABELE: 
 
Chair 
the 
second 
and 
the 
third 
respondents’ attitude is that the applicant is all of a 
sudden at the last moment reverting to what he was 
supposed to do initially.  As has been stated in the 
answering affidavit of the second and third respondent this 
matter was brought before the issue of the disclosure of 
20 
information.   
The Agency was approached by the applicant as 
early as August 2020.  The then acting Director General 
responded to the applicant inviting him to follow the 
correct 
procedures 
and 
also 
invited 
him 
to 
have 
a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 10 of 316 
 
consultation with him so that they can see how best the 
Agency can help him to expedite the issue of the disclose 
of information.  And that was the letter to the applicant was 
sent on the 21 s t of September 2021.  And the applicant… 
CHAIRPERSON:  2020. 
ADV NDABELE:  2020 sorry thank you Chairperson – 2020 
and six months – and the applicant did not respond to the 
invitation that was extended to him by the then Director 
General.  And now six months down the line they decided 
to approach the commission alleging that there is not – 
10 
would have not been afforded opportunity to get the 
documents that they are looking for which is not true.   
So what the second and third respondent is saying 
is that what the applicant is all of a sudden proposing is 
something that they should have done six months down the 
line.   
That being the case we feel that the application was 
the waste of the commission’s time or the abuse  of the 
commission’s processes and as such it is my instruction 
that the matter should have been argued on merits in 
20 
particular a stand point of the second and third respondent 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
applicant 
in 
his 
application 
is 
requesting information that pertains to a lot of intelligence 
information that has – mainly has to do with the methods of 
collection, associates and identities of the operatives 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 11 of 316 
 
knowing very well that a Director General is by law 
forbidden to do that or disclose that information.   
And then with that understanding and knowledge 
the applicant should have not asked for the relief that they 
– that they sought to ask the commission to give a blanket 
approval for the release of information into the applicant’s 
hands whereas that information mostly or if not all pertains 
to information that by law has to be protected.   
Having done that then the respondent’s feel that 
that was the abuse of the commission towards them.  The 
10 
matter should just be dismissed and their parties must be 
allowed to deal with the matter the way it was supposed to 
be dealt with six months ago.  That is in short I do not want 
to go to the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, that is fine. 
ADV NDABELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I will tell you what – my attitude is 
that because the parties seem to have found each other 
even if late in terms of the process what needs to be done 
I should allow that process.  It may well be that as a result 
20 
of that process your clients will say to him we can give you 
ABC but we cannot give you DE and F and there might still 
be a need for the applicant to pursue the application in 
regard to those matters that your clients might say we – we 
are not giving you this.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 12 of 316 
 
So rather than deal with the merits now it is better 
that – let us see what comes out of that process.  It may 
well be that as a result of that process the parties will 
reach agreement that what he will have been given is 
reasonable, is sufficient, what the – your client’s refuse to 
give there are good grounds in law for not giving that so 
therefore the application will not be pursued.  So that is 
possible as well.  Having said that I am – I must not be 
understood 
as 
if 
I 
am 
saying 
that 
the 
applicant’s 
application does not have hurdles or challenges.   
10 
There may be certain challenges but maybe if and 
when it is argued I may be persuaded but where parties 
have reached agreement on trying to sort the matter out I 
think let us give them that opportunity.  So my attitude is to 
postpone it sine die but you have heard what I said to him 
that the fact that I am sitting here being prepared to listed 
to it or that I am maybe postponing it does not necessarily 
mean once he has got the documents he should say well 
why did you postpone it if you were going to tell me you 
have no dates anymore?  You know.   
20 
So we will see what the position is at the time that 
he has received the documents and has indicated once – 
what he wants to do with the documents.  So that would – 
that – that is my attitude you – you are - you understand 
that? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 13 of 316 
 
ADV NDABELE:  I follow Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Unless you have 
something else I would like to hear Mr Pretorius.  So my 
attitude would be to postpone it and maybe I will postpone 
it sine die and – but everybody understands there are time 
constraints so the parties would need to do whatever they 
need to do as expeditiously as possible. 
ADV NDABELE:  As it pleases the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV NDABELE:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius.  Oh let them sanitise first.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair I will be brief.  It is 
perhaps important to contextualise this application within 
the work of the commission.  There are really two 
approaches that can be adopted.  Mr Fraser says in 
paragraph 34 of his founding affidavit  
“I am more than eager to expose the 
machinations of these people who I believe 
are guilty of abusing their positions in 
government to favour and unlawfully enrich 
20 
themselves, their friends and or associates 
to favour or disadvantage certain political 
parties and or factions of political parties, 
steal from the public purse and then there 
is an allegation that I am not going to deal 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 14 of 316 
 
with.” 
 
Chair there are two ways then that will deal with 
this 
issue. 
 
The 
commission’s 
powers 
to 
order 
the 
production of documents are there for the commission to 
conduct its own investigations in terms of its own Terms of 
Reference.  
 
Mr Fraser appears on his own statement to have 
evidence significant to the work of the commission and 
from the legal team’s point of view of course and I am sure 
that will be endorsed by the investigators we invite Mr 
10 
Fraser to come and cooperate with the commission’s 
investigators so that the commission can with Mr Fraser 
conduct an investigation. 
 
What is happening here is that an investigation is 
being conducted outside the ambit of the commission’s 
work. 
 
So if Mr Fraser has evidence relevant to the 
commission of this nature and of a serious criminal nature 
it should have been brought before the commission long 
ago but although it is late at the – we invite Mr Fraser to 
20 
work with the commission in a commission investigation. 
 
The other way is for the parties to sort it out 
themselves.  I might just say in that regard the commission 
has been very cautious in presenting security – state 
security evidence to protect the identity of operatives, to 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 15 of 316 
 
protect method and to deal only at least for the purposes 
of public evidence with declassified information and it 
seems that if the applicant and the second and third 
respondents are to come to any accommodation it must be 
in accordance with the legal prescript and it is not possible 
for you Chair to grant an order at this stage on that basis 
which would in effect override all those legal prescripts.  
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Pretorius.  This application 
is postponed sine die.  Ja okay.  Thank you.  We are going 
10 
to adjourn and resume at ten o’clock for the hearing of the 
evidence of the witness scheduled for today.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning, Mr Freund.  Good 
morning everybody.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Good morning, Chair. 
MR MANTASHE:   Good morning, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning, Mr Mantashe. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Good morning... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Yes, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, this is the 
resumption of the stream of evidence on the question of 
the adequacy or otherwise parliamentary oversight vis-a-
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 16 of 316 
 
vis the allegations of state capture or corruption.  You will 
recall that we have heard a number of witnesses who 
deposed to a series of affidavits which were furnished by 
the African National Congress and those affidavits as 
originally filed concluded with an affidavit of the Secretary 
General of the African National Congress, Mr Magashule.   
 
So what originally been anticipated is that 
Mr Magashule would be testifying today.  However, some 
time ago, a decision was taken that Mr Magashule will not 
testify and Mr Mantashe was asked, as I understand it, by 
10 
the African National Congress to, as it were, appear in his 
place and essentially to talk to his affidavit.   
 
So that was the primary and original purpose of 
today’s hearing but Mr Magashule has gone further and has 
deposed to a fairly substantial affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mantashe, you mean? 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 
Mr Mantashe. 
 
Did 
I 
say 
Mr Magashule? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you said Mr Magashule. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I apologise and if I do it again, please 
20 
correct me again.  It is an error I keep making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Mantashe...  Ja, the word is written 
in front of me.  Mr Mantashe has gone further and deposed 
to a substantial affidavit and that will be the second 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 17 of 316 
 
primary purpose of the evidence today.  But in the last 
week or so, as a consequence of correspondence between 
myself and Mr Mantashe’s representative, what has come 
to my attention and which we will also need to deal with is 
certain material produced and furnished by Mr Mantashe 
back in 2018, really roundabout the time of the initial 
evidence of the Minister, former Minister Barbara Hogan.   
 
There was an initial statement, there was a 
follow-up statement on deployment, which overlaps but it is 
not identical to the present affidavit.  So we will canvas all 
10 
of that as well.  And then in addition, Chair.  I have put 
together a bundle of newspaper articles in some sort of 
chronological order and those were furnished some time 
ago to Mr Mantashe so that he is not taken by surprise and 
I will be exploring some but by no means all of those 
articles in the course of the day. 
 
Now the consequence of what I have just 
described is that the administrative staff have had to make 
certain adjustments to the pagination.  So the ANC 
affidavit, set of affidavits – the set of ANC affidavits was 
20 
and still is Exhibit ZZ-1 in File 1.  And that set of affidavits, 
we have, really, already dealt with ZZ-1.2 and following or 
most of those and what we were going to be dealing with is 
ZZ-1.1, Mr Magashule. 
 
But now we have had to add to that what is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 18 of 316 
 
going to be Mr Mantashe’s affidavit which will be ZZ-11 and 
the consequence of the bulk of that is the need to split the 
original Bundle 1 into a Bundle 1A and Bundle 1B.  So 
where we inserted, there is no longer space for what used 
to be in the rest of that Bundle 1A but that notwithstanding, 
the other material that was in Bundle 1 and now is in 
Bundle 1B will not be canvassed today.  So we will really 
be dealing with Bundle 1A as it is. 
 
So against that background, I would suggest that 
perhaps it is opportune to swear Mr Mantashe in and I 
10 
understand he wishes to make an opening statement but 
perhaps it might be convenient if I just indicate to you, 
Chair, where one finds that opening statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that.  The relabeling of 
the bundles to – what – did you say 1A? 
ADV FREUND SC:   1A and 1 B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 1B.  One understands the reasons 
why you had to split them.  I am concerned about the fact 
that in the transcript after today, there will be a reference 
to a certain label and not the amended label.  And so I 
20 
wonder whether we could not keep the label that we used 
for – I do not know whether for the first half of the bundle 
and then make the next one 1A, rather, and 1B so that we 
always have one. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 19 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when somebody goes to one, then 
maybe there could be a note to say at a certain stage they 
were split.  Anything you do not find here, go and look at 
1A or something like that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There is no difficulty with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   We will deal – we will rearrange it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Make it 1 and 1A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And we will be dealing today with the 
continuation of Bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no that is fine.  You wanted to 
tell me where to find the statement. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, the opening statement of 
Mr Mantashe, as I understand it, is using, as it were, the 
top left-hand numbering, the POO-1 numbering.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The black page numbers? 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Black numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That 100.419.  So that is page 419 of 
this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  I see it, yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 20 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Of course, there will in due course 
also be reference to the original affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I presume one would want to start with 
the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no that is fine.  Before the 
oath or affirmation is administered to Mr Mantashe, I just 
want to take this opportunity to make an announcement 
that it is connected with the ANC, namely, that we 
previously announced that the President of the ANC was 
10 
scheduled to give evidence in his capacity as President of 
the ANC on the 22 n d and 23 r d of April and in his capacity as 
the President of the Republic on the 28 t h and 29 t h of April.   
 
That has changed in part because the President 
made a request in connection with the dates of 22 and 
23 April because of some commitments that had arisen.  I 
ceded to the request to change those dates.  So the 
present position is that the President of the ANC is not 
going to appear before the Commission on the 22 n d and 
23 r d of April but he will still appear on the 28 t h and 
20 
29 t h of April. 
 
Originally, on the 28 t h and the 29 t h of April, he 
was to appear in his capacity as President of the country 
but that has changed.  On those two days, he will appear 
as the President of the ANC.  As President of the country, 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 21 of 316 
 
he will now appear before the Commission on the 18 t h and 
14 t h of May.  So I thought I must just make that 
announcement because it is important that the public 
knows. 
 
And then secondly.  I want to say I appreciate 
that the ruling party is taking part in the proceedings of the 
Commission and I am happy that they have sent a senior 
leader to take part in the proceedings of the Commission 
and give evidence.   
 
I was quite concerned early last year after the 
10 
Commission has sent invitations to all the political parties, 
representatives in Parliament including the majority party, 
inviting them to make submissions to the Commission on 
various issues, particularly of oversight, and there was no 
response for a number of months from a number of political 
parties including the majority party. 
 
But ultimately, there was communication and we 
– I understand that somehow that implication might not 
have come to their attention of the right people in the 
ruling party.  I was concerned because, particularly with 
20 
regard to issues of oversight, it is quite important that the 
majority party takes part and gives its own input on the 
challenges that might be there in Parliament but also on 
other matters that the Commission is investigating.  It is 
quite important. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374

Many of the political parties represented in 
Parliament did not respond to those invitations that we 
sent out but today I think the DA did respond and some of 
its leaders have given evidence.  You will remind me but I 
am not sure I remember any other political party that has 
taken part but the invitations were given to everybody, all 
political parties, except maybe those who only featured in 
Parliament after the 2019 elections but all those who were 
represented in the previous elections who might have had 
something, some role to play in terms of oversight were 
10 
invited.   
 
It 
is 
just 
unfortunate 
that 
they 
have 
not 
responded positively.  So but I just wanted to say.  I 
appreciate that the ruling party is taking part and will make 
its input and I am happy that they have sent one of its – of 
its 
senior 
leaders 
to 
give 
evidence 
and 
assist 
the 
Commission.  Thank you, Mr Mantashe.

an opportunity to make your opening statement or read 
your opening statement. 
MR MANTASHE:   Thank you very much, Chairperson.  I 
20 
am the National Chairperson of the ANC.  In part, my 
election as National Chairperson, I served at the ANC 
between December 2007 and December 2017.  That is ten 
years.  I have deposed to an affidavit in which I deal with 
the following issues.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 26 of 316 
 
- New(?) 
party(?) 
system 
for 
proper(?) 
representation. 
- The 
goal 
of 
goal 
of 
transformative 
constitutionalism, 
how ANC 
policies 
are 
formulated. 
- The combination of the party candidate list. 
- How the ANC chooses the president and 
cabinet members. 
- ANC development and deployment policy. 
- How 
the 
ANC 
Deployment 
Committee 
10 
functions. 
- The complexities of more than government, 
the lessons(?) from the UK 
- Constitutional exploitation of the function of 
parliamentary oversight and accountability. 
- The 
need 
for 
political 
wave(?) 
in 
parliamentary accountability. 
- The relationship between Luthuli House and 
the ANC representatives in Parliament. 
- Parliament

Oversight 
and

Accountability Model. 
- Recommendations 
made 
by 
the ANC 
to

Page 27 of 316 
 
and Parliament 
-  A lateral reform. 
- And 
monitoring(?) 
ANC 
performance 
in 
Portfolio Committee. 
 
In this opening statement, I highlight some of the 
key-issues dealt with in my affidavit.  However, before 
doing so I wish to refer to a speech(?) delivered in 
June 1991 at Stafford University of the United States by 
the then General Secretariat of the National Mine Workers, 
Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa in which he outlined the 
10 
element of the new constitutional framework which was 
previously 
articulated 
by 
erstwhile 
President 
Oliver 
Reginald Tambo in 1987. 
 
This includes: 
- Reunification of the country including so-
called homelands that the government has 
broken off from South Africa. 
- One common citizenship for all people of the 
provinces. 
- The 
democracy 
based 
on 
proportional 
20 
representation at the national and local 
level. 
- The Bill of Rights that protects human rights, 
specified 
in 
various 
related 
nations 
documents for reasons to guarantee that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 28 of 316 
 
their rights will be enforced and cannot be 
overruled by any newly elected body and 
interpreted(?) judiciary. 
- The mechanisms for aiding regardless social 
and 
economic 
transformation 
in 
a 
democracy 
including 
provisions 
for 
affirmative action and not discrimination.   
 
Not 
long 
after 
the 
Constitution 
Act 
was 
promulgated and Section 1 of the Constitution Act states 
that the Republic of South Africa is a democratic state 
10 
found on the following values. 
- Human Dignity 
- Non-racial and non-sexism 
- Supremacy of the Constitution and the rule 
of law and universal adult suffrage. 
 
I make a point to demonstrate that the value of 
the ANC Constitution and the Constitution of the country 
are aligned and the multi-party talks at the Convention for 
Democratic South Africa, CODESA, will resolve that the 
electoral system shall be a closed party in this system of 
20 
proportional representation, meaning that voters vote for a 
political party and the number of seats allocated to that 
party in Parliament is in proportion to the number of votes 
it is assigned(?) in a general election. 
 
This averment was subsequently incorporated 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 29 of 316 
 
into 
the 
legislation. 
 
On 
the 
issue 
of 
performative  
constitutionalism, I cite legal scholars in my affidavit to 
demonstrate that – to demonstrate what the ANC believes 
to be ...[indistinct] of our constitutional democracy and to 
locate the role of Parliament in the context because the 
ANC subscribes to the views that primarily – primary 
purpose for the adoption of the conclusion was not only to 
establish 
a 
society 
based 
on 
democratic 
values 
but 
fundamental human rights but also one based on social 
justice.  For that policy formation in the ANC starts with 
10 
the development of concept paper which is sent to 
branches 
for 
discussion 
and 
inputs. 
 
The 
paper 
is 
discussed further at regional and provisional conferences.   
 
Once 
every 
five 
years 
the 
policies 
of 
the 
organisation are consolidated at Policy Conference.  At 
this conference, the view of the ANC and his partners, that 
is the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the South 
African Communist Party, the South African National Civil 
organisation are taking into consideration after which the 
policies are adopted and a resolution taken and that is to 
20 
be implemented. 
 
The policies adopted become the manifesto of 
the ANC when it contest election because we do contest 
elections and therefore...  Wait, wait, wait.  Yes.  And all 
comrades who are appraised on the National Provincial 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 30 of 316 
 
Party can at least – are required to commit to the election 
manifesto of the ANC.   
 
Now in complying its list of candidates, the ANC 
takes into consideration demographics, gender equality(?) 
so that at least 50% of the candidates are women and that 
is in the Constitution of the ANC through service. 
 
Representation from the youth sector, particular 
skills of candidates that could enhance the work of 
Parliament and returns(?) of experienced parliamentarians.  
In line with the Constitution of the country, every elected 
10 
member in Parliament shall be eligible to be a candidate 
for 
the 
Presidency 
of 
South 
Africa. 
 
Although 
the 
Constitution 
affords 
the 
President 
the 
prerogative 
to 
choose the Cabinet, the practise in the ANC is that the 
President chooses the Cabinet after consultation with the 
ANC and its alliance.   
 
I want to emphasise consultation because it is 
not the ANC and the alliance that tells the President who 
should be in the Cabinet.  It is the President who consults 
the ANC and the alliance so that the unit is maintained.   
20 
 
In November 2018, I made a submission to the 
Commission to clarify the confusion that had arisen when 
the banking institution presented the evidence about their 
meetings with the ANC and to explain why there is 
...[indistinct] banks and what internal processes were 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 31 of 316 
 
followed thereafter.  [Speaker is not clear.] 
 
At the time, I raised the following issues with the 
Commission.  All South Africans, both black and white, 
should embrace the Commission with open arms.  We made 
the statement then, we repeat it today. 
 
The ANC exhorts that all South Africans to 
persevere well to endure the pain and the emotional 
trauma for building a nation with a single identity out of the 
ashes of the racially divided and inhuman past and we 
have to build a strong capable state for an exclusionary 
10 
and illegitimate past.   
 
Just as a matter of mentioning.  In 1994, every 
director general of any state department was a white male 
and every judge was a white male.  So that is what we are 
referring to.  And the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
fulfilled and important role in the post-apartheid nation 
building process as a young democracy.   
 
We have achieved a relatively – in relatively 
short period a degree of consensus on the past cultural 
traditions, 
customs, 
symbols, 
rituals 
and 
historic 
20 
experiences of black and white people. 
 
This proofed to be a strong indicator of the 
willingness of the different racial groups in our country to 
come together for the common good to largely guard our 
victories and not allow anyone to drag us back to the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 32 of 316 
 
racially 
divided 
society 
where 
the 
rule 
of 
law 
was 
selectively used and with the majority of people, African, 
Coloureds and Indians existed as soulless dehumanised 
individuals.  We should not go back there. 
 
I 
have 
informed 
the 
Commission 
– 
I 
also 
informed the Commission that I would be submitting a 
statement about the ANC deployment.  The details(?) of the 
ANC deployment policy was subsequently filed(?) with the 
Commission on 9 t h, 20 t h and 26 t h November 2018.  So they 
were submitted to the Commission as appear from the 
10 
annexures in the bundle of documents as submitted.   
 
I want to emphasise the fact that in the ANC we 
do not have a policy called Cadres Develop Deployment 
with a deployment policy.  That is a huge difference 
because it is not a Cadres Deployment.  It is a deployment 
policy of the ANC.  I addressed the issue of Cadres 
Deployment in my affidavit for two further reasons.   
 
To give – you know, we are able because of 
Cadres Deployment.  These are the reasons.  To give the 
Commission an appreciation of the genesis of the ANC 
20 
policy, development and deployment so that it can evaluate 
and pronounce on the validity of the request made by the 
leader of the opposition, Mr John Steenhuisen that on 
10 February 2021 that the State Capture Commission 
should 
tackle 
and 
end 
the 
ANC 
policy 
of 
Cadres 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 33 of 316 
 
Deployment.  That is what the DA refers to our policy, 
Cadres Deployment for their own reason. 
 
And to give the Commission an appreciation of 
the calibre of comrades and procedure followed for that 
deployment, 
between 
1997 
and 
2017, 
the 
Cadres 
Deployment policy has been discussed, refined at National 
Committee meetings, Council(?) Executive(?) Committee 
meetings at National Conference.   
 
An element of degree of the development policy 
can be traced back to ANC Conference in Zambia in 1985 
10 
where the ANC President Oliver Tambo called for the 
establishment of a political school. 
 
Ironically, this was precisely at the same time when 
apartheid government placed our country under a state of 
emergency.  There were formal and informal training taking 
place 
since 
the 
late 
1990’s 
to 
take 
over 
from 
the 
predominant white male civil services.  Many as black 
males and females were deployed to undergo training.  
They will send them to various institutions.  They were sent 
to Egypt where they received diplomatic training, the 
20 
Northern countries, United Kingdom has specific value in 
civil service and the Kennedy School of Governance, 
Wharton Business School, [indistinct] 00.11 School of 
Governance and at which university where they took 
courses 
in 
public 
sector 
policy 
and 
development 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 34 of 316 
 
management.   
We are making this point so that it must not be seen 
as just taking people from the street, put them into public 
service, there was a conscious process of training people 
to prepare them for a role in the state.   
The purpose of the ANC political school in South 
Africa which was received in April 2013 was to connect 
from political education and training, political education 
and training for all elected leadership structures to develop 
the capabilities of cadres to undertake the task to which 
10 
they were deployed and to develop the calibre of cadres to 
monitor and [indistinct] 01.06 policy efficiency of ANC 
campaigns and policy development. 
 
Now in 2018 President Matemela Cyril Ramaphosa 
launched the OR Policy Leadership Institute and Dr David 
Masondo was appointed its president.  That is [indistinct] 
01.26.   
The ANC used the first demo(?) government in 
1994/’99 
to 
perfect 
deployment 
system 
notable 
with 
deployment 
framework, 
guidelines 
of 
the 
relationship 
20 
between ANC structure and the government structure and 
this talks to party and state relationship. 
Guidelines on the role and criteria for its premiers, 
guidelines 
on 
accountability 
and 
monitoring 
of 
a 
supportive(?) representative, guidelines on the deployment 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 35 of 316 
 
of [indistinct] 02.07 mayors for local government election.   
In 
practice 
the 
secretariat 
of 
the 
deployment 
committee monitors the media and government bulletins for 
advertisement for vacancies.   
The committee takes a mere interest only in those 
vacancies which it considers strategic and which could 
advance the development agenda with the state, such for 
the post of Director General, board of directors and state 
owned enterprise.   
 
The 
deployment 
committee 
does 
not 
deploy 
10 
directors, deputy directors and all, the deployment does 
not enter there, it is limited to in the state to directors 
general and deputy directors general.  That is it.  Below 
that, it is normal.   
Now the deployment committee maintains a pool of 
suitably qualified candidates for deployment.  Sometimes 
the ANC would encourage comrades to apply for a position 
provided that they have already undergone psychometric 
testing and a comprehensive government-based selection 
process.  This is not an ANC process.  The deployment 
20 
committee does not appoint, it recommends.  Government 
undertakes processes to select candidates for positions.   
In the case of board position for state owned 
enterprises where public interviews are conducted, the 
ANC would encourage suitable comrades to apply. In cases 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 36 of 316 
 
where the Minister has the final say in appointments, the 
role of the deployment committee is to comment on short 
list, usually three candidates presented by that minister.   
The focus in not only on academic and professional 
expertise but the deployment committee also takes into 
account 
skills 
and 
expertise 
in 
connection 
with 
constituency work, working with the masses on the ground 
and our comrades deployed in whatever centre should take 
with them qualities and attributes that we hold dear as a 
movement.   
10 
This includes putting service to the people first, an 
ethic of work and service levels, respect of the senior 
structures and cadres of the movement, responsiveness to 
the needs of the people and collective approach to the 
matters.  And it is important, Chair, to emphasise the fact 
that this is what we aspire for.   
A few days ago the Minister of Public Services and 
Administration said at the top level, up to now, 65% meet 
the requirements, there is a 35% that is questionable, 
meaning that it is quantifying progress that has been made 
20 
thus far. 
In our deployment we consciously strive to dispel 
the notion that we will become a movement and leadership 
which has discharged from the people whom we have 
served in long struggle for liberation.  We endeavour to be 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 37 of 316 
 
true to our tradition of putting the interests of our people 
and our country first.  
The national deployment committee consists of 15 
members, primarily from the National Executive Committee.  
It is chaired by the deputy president of the ANC, currently 
Comrade Mabuza.   
Moving to parliamentary accountability, the National 
Assembly is required in terms of Section 52(2) of the 
Constitution to do two things, hold the organs of state 
accountable and exercise general oversight over national 
10 
executive authority and organs of state. 
Equally(?) important is the provision of Section 
42(3) of the Constitution which requires members of 
parliament not only to oversee executive authority but to 
scrutinise the action of executives without fear, favour or 
prejudice and to take their oath of office very seriously, 
namely that they would be faithful to the Republic of South 
Africa and will obey, respect and uphold the constitution of 
the Republic and perform their function to the best of their 
ability.   
20 
In 
essence, 
our 
[indistinct] 
07.07 
democracy 
adheres to norms and principles of separation of power, 
rule of law, democratic self-government, self-government, 
protection of human rights and existence of an independent 
judiciary and it is a non-negotiable condition that these 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 38 of 316 
 
values are upheld in the oversight and accountability 
obligation of members of parliament.  It follows the ANC 
will not tolerate any unlawful and unquestionable conduct 
by its members of parliament.   
Echoing 
the 
sentiment 
of 
Secretary 
General 
Comrade 
Ace 
Magashule, 
I 
give 
an 
unconditional 
undertaking on behalf of the ANC that the organisation has 
the political will to make parliament work and to ensure 
effective oversight and accountability.   
Secretary General, Deputy Secretary General of the 
10 
ANC to visit parliament from time to time to liaise with ANC 
members of parliament in caucus meetings.  The Secretary 
General and Deputy General Secretary do not go to 
parliamentary 
portfolio committees, they talk 
to ANC 
caucus, that is the end of their space in parliament.   
The 
comrade 
in 
charge 
of 
ANC 
members 
in 
parliament is the Chief Whip of the party and decisions 
within parliament are made within the rules of the National 
Assembly and legislative framework specific to parliament. 
The ANC recommends that to enhance oversight and 
20 
accountability, parliament implements a number of the 
[indistinct] 09.03 referred to in the 209 oversight and  
accountability model but which are yet to be implemented.  
These include the [indistinct] 09.14 mechanisms, 
amendment of rules of National Assembly, an oversight 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 39 of 316 
 
[indistinct] 09.17 section, legislative reform to act as 
deterrent that deals corrupt activities, an early warning 
system to detect state capture and corruption, building our 
position on democracy and then seeing the oversight and 
accountability 
obligation 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee, 
upgrading, training and increase research capacity.   
Asset interest disclosure, asset interest disclosure 
laws and encouraging [indistinct] 09.55.  More details of 
these recommendation are set out in the affidavit of the 
Secretary General.   
10 
In 
the 
execution 
of 
their 
duties, 
members 
of 
parliament have to balance two opposing principles, their 
loyalty to the party, its manifesto and voters who voted for 
the party and remain faithful to their political moral 
principles and obligation to the constitution.   
As the ANC, we have stressed to our MPs that in the 
execution of their parliamentary responsibility, they should 
apply their minds to the purpose of their task in parliament 
to announce our development and agenda and not adopt a 
herd mentality by virtue of the ANC majority [indistinct – 
20 
dropping voice].  In short, they should be thinking MPs.  
That is emphasised.   
 
However, South Africa is a very young democracy 
and the ANC’s view is that we should tread with caution 
when making majority decision, such as the removal of a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 40 of 316 
 
sitting president without having a full appreciation of the 
consequences that such decision could have on the 
country, the party and threaten democracy.   
 
Recent events in the United States have really 
demonstrated how fragile democracy can be.  I would 
elaborate on this because I have an experience of a party 
removing two of its sitting presidents.  I can relate the 
stories of the consequences and one of those was the 
formation of Cope, you know, breakaway from the ANC and 
many people do not take that into account and the fact that 
10 
when you remove a president, for all intents and purposes 
the cabinet is removed and I can tell you that when the 
president was removed we received a long list of ministers 
resigning, basically collapsing government.  
 
And, therefore, when we deal with the removal of a 
president, it is not just a question of a vote of no 
confidence, whatever, we look into the consequences and 
take a party view on those issues.   
Impulsive action, I believe, would [indistinct] 12.30 
certain of process which would have a detrimental impact 
20 
on the democratic [indistinct – dropping voice] basically 
never take the sanction(?) [indistinct] 12.38 option.   
The [indistinct] 12.42 option, Chairperson, is when 
you get into a room, you pull the pillars, you collapse the 
system on top of all of us.  We do not take that option, we 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 41 of 316 
 
think it is a dangerous option, it is a fatal option.  This was 
their [indistinct] 12.59 comrade Jessie Duarte adopted in 
June 2017 when a motion of no confidence was proposed 
in President Zuma. 
So I am explaining the logic that we took and say it 
should not be done, we tread - we cannot a [indistinct] 
13.22 collapse the party, collapse the government and 
therefore create a crisis in the country. 
 
The removal of a president is a matter of party 
organisation discipline which should best be dealt within 
10 
the confines of the party.  All South African political parties 
operate caucus system in all spheres of government, 
national, provincial and local and as a governing party the 
ANC will endeavour to re-orientate the public [indistinct] 
13.52 
to 
appreciate 
the 
distinction 
and 
be 
able 
to 
differentiate between participation in a caucus for a static 
rule which may include participation of ministers and their 
constitutional obligation in terms of their oath of office to 
hold 
the 
same 
minister 
accountable 
in 
the 
portfolio 
committee in which other political parties participate.  
20 
Their participation both orally(?) have entirely different 
objectives, maintaining one, accountability to party and the 
public can be achieved by explaining to MPs that both 
roles are necessary to enhance the function of our 
democracy.

At the national general council meet and review 
later this year, the ANC will focus on two aspects of the 
[indistinct – dropping voice] where they will sit and 
produce elements of the constitution [indistinct] 14.53 
electoral system at national and provincial level whether 
the national, provincial and local government election 
should be synchronised and take place at the centre and 
this follows a judgment.   
There is a judgment that instructs us to have and 
undertake that decision and I am committing here, will 
10 
undertake that decision and in terms of reference of the 
Commission, place specific emphasis on the Gupta family.   
 
As Chairperson of the ANC I believe it is necessary 
to explain how relationship between the Gupta family and 
the ANC evolved.  Very important because hindsight is an 
exact science but if we take how it evolved it will help to a 
great extent. 
 
A few years after the arrival of [indistinct] 15.48 one 
of the Gupta brothers, Ajay Gupta, became a member of 
President Thabo Mbeki’s economic advisory, [indistinct] 
20 
15.57 
[dropping 
voice]. 
 
Around 
2010 
the 
family 
approached the ANC with a proposal to establish a 
newspaper and television channel.  At the time the ANC 
had an interest in the diversification of the media in the 
country.  On the basis the proposal was entertained, the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 43 of 316 
 
establishment of ANN7 and the New Age was, in our view, 
just such an opportunity.  In fact, the name of the 
newspaper, New Age, was proposed by the ANC official 
after a well-known struggle newspaper of the 1950’s.   
 
Once established both newspapers and television 
channel gave much needed coverage to programmes of the 
ANC and I can tell you, if you looked into the newspaper 
and the media today, when I buy newspapers on a Sunday, 
if I buy them I know what to expect from Independent 
Media, I know what to expect from the Sunday Times which 
10 
is something I do not understand and that informed our 
view that we needed diversity in the media stream.   
At this stage the ANC had no knowledge of other 
business interests of the Gupta family until much later.  So 
what we know today, we did not know then. 
 
Since 
2013, 
after 
the 
Integrity 
Commission 
recommended that former President Zuma to step down, 
the ANC has been undergoing a period of instability.   
A 
substantial 
part 
of 
that 
instability 
can 
be 
attributed to the allegation of involvement of the Gupta 
20 
family in the ANC politics, in particular, the perceived hold 
of that family had over the former President.   
Now any indication of this perceived hold arose 
when a private plane carrying guests to Gupta family 
wedding landed in Waterkloof Airforce base in 2013 and a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 44 of 316 
 
remark by Comrade Fikile Mbalula in a meeting of the NEC 
in June 2014 after the general election that he was told of 
his appointment to the executive by a member of the Gupta 
family.  I have no doubt that during this period [indistinct]  
18.32, many MPs felt leaderless(?) and this probably 
explains their [indistinct] 18.37 in the portfolio committee.   
However, no ANC member of parliament was told to 
stop thinking or not to execute their responsibility in 
parliament.   
 
In my affidavit I deal with the complexities of 
10 
modern(?) government and the lessons we can draw from 
the United Kingdom.  I am of the view that the manner in 
which parliamentary portfolio committee [indistinct] 19.03 
and support structure around them, is an urgent need of 
reform so that when we assess their performance, we are 
comparing apples and apples. 
 
Finally, I have been requested to comment on 55 
press reports which relate to former President Zuma’s 
relationship with the Gupta family, by the [indistinct] 19.31 
Gupta family plane saga issue of irregularity and trust that 
20 
parliament’s [indistinct] 19.40 with Gupta family, claims by 
Mr Mcebisi Jonas that Gupta family wanted to bribe him, 
evidence of Comrade Vytjie Mentor and Barbara Hogan and 
[indistinct] 19.57 of the [indistinct] 19.57, I will endeavour 
to comment on matters arising from these press reports 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 45 of 316 
 
sincerely and to the best of my ability.   
Thank you very much, Chairperson, we thought that 
we should give this context to our [indistinct – dropping 
voice].  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you very much, Mr Mantashe.  
There are a number of points that you have made in your 
opening statement which I have no doubt will be dealt with 
as you continue with your evidence.  I am particularly 
encouraged about – by some of the points made which 
commit the majority party in parliament to, as I understand 
10 
it, doing what it can to ensure that there is proper and 
effective oversight and accountability in the context of the 
parliamentary function.  So but I am sure that these points 
will be dealt with as we go along.  Thank you.  Mr Freund, 
you want to start? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair, I am in your 
hands as to time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There is a lot to get through today so 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine.  I must just 
indicate so that everyone knows what my thinking is and if 
anyone has a different thinking they can indicate in due 
course.  I have in mind that if by normal closing time, four 
o’clock, we are not done, we should continue with Mr 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 46 of 316 
 
Mantashe’s evidence and try and finish today but maybe 
we will finish before then. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just mention because I think there 
are lot of issues that might require proper discussion and 
ventilation so I just mention that if everybody – if nobody 
has a problem with that, then we can proceed on that basis 
and if there is a problem we can know in advance so that 
we pace ourselves appropriately. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Chair, I will 
10 
obviously endeavour to complete before four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But I do have concerns that we may 
not achieve that and we will have a better sense in that by 
mid afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine, I mean, I think 
it is very important that the issues that need to be dealt 
with be dealt with properly because it is the majority party 
that is here and it commits itself to fully cooperating and 
being party to solutions, to challenges that we have been 
20 
looking at and therefore the opportunity must be seized 
and used optimally. 
ADV FREUND SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 47 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Mantashe, if I could just start with 
the formalities.  Can you please turn to page 100.2 where 
you will find an index? 
MR MANTASHE:   Page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   100.2, which should be very early in 
your papers.  So on the top left you will see numbers with 
PO 01 and then 100.2. 
MR MANTASHE:   So you want me to open… 
ADV FREUND SC:   It will be very near the very beginning 
of your file but… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the index just before your affidavit. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Just turn the page.  Maybe just give it 
a …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   100.2. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If you go back one page, go back two 
pages from where you are.  Go backwards two pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh no, I think he is going beyond. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can you just over that page?  Is there 
not another page after that page please?  No, no.  No, no, 
20 
just turn it over this way, ja.  Is there not a page in 
between?  Yes, you missed that page.  That is the page I 
wanted to take you to.  I am sorry… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before you proceed, Mr Freund, I do 
not know whether the lighting there where Mr Mantashe is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 48 of 316 
 
is normal or whether it can be improved.  I know that we 
always do not have the best lighting there.  If the 
technicians can look into that?  But you are able to read 
from there, Mr Mantashe?  Mr Mantashe, are you able to 
read?  The lighting is fine? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Mantashe, the page that is now 
open in front of you at the top left, does it end with the 
number 100.2? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Now that is an index 
which helps us to get our bearings on all the different 
papers that are related to your evidence and you will see 
that firstly it refers to an affidavit by yourself dated the 12 
March 2021 and if you keep your finger there and go 
please to page 100.6, is that the beginning of your 
affidavit? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  And then if you turn to page 
20 
100.44, is that the end of your affidavit with your 
signature? 
MR MANTASHE:   144? 
ADV FREUND SC:   100.44. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 49 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  So I take it that that is the 
affidavit 
you 
had 
deposed 
and 
presented 
to 
the 
Commission and you can confirm that that is your affidavit? 
MR MANTASHE:   I confirm. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now secondly, if you can 
go back to that index page, at page 100.2 you will see that 
item 2 is a set of media articles starting at page 100.45 
and running all the way through down to on page 6 of that 
document, all the way through to page 100.418 and all I 
want to ask you is that you can confirm that you have 
10 
received those articles, you are aware of those articles. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, I did see them. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  And then thirdly, if you go in 
the index to page 100.5.2 you will see there is an item 3.  
It is paginated at the bottom of the page, page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what page, Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   100.5.2 and I have said to Mr 
Mantashe at the foot of that same page you will see the 
number 6 and you will see …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got 100.5, that is still the index. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, still in the index, then after .5 it 
goes 5.1 and then 5.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, after 100.5 I have got 100.6. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ja, well then your file is not in order 
and I apologise. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 50 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   I have got 1.5.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV FREUND SC:   yes, so Mr Mantashe’s file is the same 
as mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It means I was discriminated against. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You were discriminated against and we 
can only apologise for that.  But with your leave, if I may 
do this, Mr Chair, we can sort this out in the tea break 
shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tea break, ja, that is fine. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Because it is just a formality that I am 
trying to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And the witness has the correct 
papers.  I just want to confirm with you, Mr Mantashe, that 
what then is indexed and it is the documents that we find 
in the file from page 100.419 all the way through to the end 
are a set of documents that you, through Mr Naidoo, have 
furnished to the Commission and they have now been 
incorporated into this bundle, is that correct? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Now on that basis, Chair, may I 
move that the entirety of the affidavit, articles and further 
documents that I have just referred to, be admitted as 
evidence and they together form EXHIBIT ZZ1.10. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 51 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, firstly, the bundle we are using at 
the moment is Parliamentary Oversight bundle 1A. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct, as you have just said 
Chair it is going to be numbered one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, and then you have – then the 
first document under the index, after the index is Mr 
Magashule’s 
affidavit 
and 
thereafter 
the 
affidavits 
...[intervenes]     
ADV FREUND SC:    The first document ought to be not Mr 
Magashule but Mr Mantashe’s affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?  Well on mine the first affidavit is 
Mr Magashule’s one.   Mr Mantashe’s one comes later on 
mine. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct, for the moment I 
haven’t moved the admission of Mr Magashule’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   For the moment I am leading the 
admission of Mr Mantashe’s affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so what I am doing is try and 
establish which documents fall under what you refer to, 
you want me to admit as Exhibit ZZ1, so let’s start with Mr 
Mantashe’s 
affidavit 
and 
then 
the 
annexures 
plus 
...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 52 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Based on Mr Mantashe’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  To which I think there are no 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   They then continue with a set of fresh 
reports, but to find the – if I take you Chair to page 100.6 
as the beginning of the affidavit 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   We established all the rest of it, and it 
10 
runs all the way through to page 100.613. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is what I have covered with the 
witness and that is what I am for the moment moving the 
admission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now let’s start with the issue of 
whether 
there 
are 
any 
annexures 
to 
Mr 
Mantashe’s 
affidavit?   Now you have said that you think there are not, 
I know that he refers to some papers in his affidavit but 
does he not attach them? 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   He does not attach them and that is 
precisely  the reason why Chair in follow-up I have 
requested and was subsequently furnished with some of 
those papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 53 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And those fall into the third category. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   To documents recently furnished by Mr 
Mantashe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now from page 100.45, which is the 
page immediately after Mr Mantashe’s affidavit, are there 
documents that Mr Mantashe provided and then are there 
documents that you provided? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shouldn’t we separate the two and 
10 
maybe have one exhibit for those that he provided and 
another one for those that you provided? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well that is indeed what we are 
proposing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But all those has sub-sections so Mr 
Mantashe’s affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s start with Mr Mantashe’s affidavit. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If we regard Mr Mantashe’s evidence 
in totality as being Exhibit ZZ1.10 then we can divide that 
20 
exhibit ZZ1.10 into three parts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   The first part is his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   The second part is the press 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 54 of 316 
 
statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the third part is the additional 
documentation furnished. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that is already covered on the 
record with the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, that is fine.   Okay let’s 
start with his affidavit, you asked me to admit it as an 
Exhibit and to mark it as Exhibit what? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   ZZ1.10.1 will be the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Sampson Gwede 
Mantashe starting at page 100.6 is admitted as an exhibit 
and will be marked as Exhibit ZZ1.10.10, okay. 
AFFIDAVIT 
BY 
MR 
SAMPSON 
GWEDE 
MANTASHE 
HANDED UP AS EXHIBIT ZZ1.10.1 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then from page 100.45 is the 
beginning of the press statements, and if that could be, 
that bundle of press statements could be admitted as 
ZZ1.10.2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be from page 100.45 up to 
what page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I will give you the page.   It will be up 
to 100.418. 
CHAIRPERSON:   100.418, is that right? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 55 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe for convenience there could be a 
divider between the two sets of documents, between the 
affidavit and this one. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that Exhibit ZZ10.2 would basically 
be the document supplied by Mr Mantashe, is that right? 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, ZZ1.10.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is there a one before ten? 
ADV FREUND SC:   There is one before it yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sorry, that is starting from Mr 
Mantashe’s affidavit? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I just said 10. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is 1.10 because it is all part of the 
ANC affidavit which is ZZ1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am going to do a correction in 
relation to Mr Mantashe’s affidavit, it is not Exhibit ZZ10.1 
but it is Exhibit ZZ1.10.1. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct, thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we move to ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   The press statements would be – I am 
going to the page, it is at page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then at page 100.45 that will not be 
Exhibit 10.2 but Exhibit ZZ1.10.2. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 56 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that runs through Chair to 
100.418, I could tell you that that very page 100.418 is a 
special character but we will deal with that in the evidence 
in the course of the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but just for my own understanding, 
are those documents then from page 100.45 to page 
100.418, 
are 
those 
the 
documents 
supplied 
by 
Mr 
Mantashe? 
ADV FREUND SC:   No those are the documents supplied 
by the Commission to Mr Mantashe. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In order for him to be given an 
opportunity to comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and the ones we haven’t dealt with 
are those that he provided? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes which I will take you to very 
shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine, so I think therefore 
we could take these, namely from page 100.45 to page 
100.418 as a batch. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   As a batch yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As a batch ja.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, and that will be in your file if I 
may suggest, separately divided, so that you can clearly 
see ...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 57 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay.  So those documents 
therefore that start from page 100.45 to page 100.418 will 
be admitted and will be marked Exhibit ZZ1.10.2, but I am 
wondering whether you might end up with further page 
numbers for further documents or whether you would leave 
them like this and you have just referred to the overall 
pagination to identify which document. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, I don’t understand Chair, but I 
think it is manageable as it is 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is manageable without further sub-
10 
divisions, no that is fine. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, manageable it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then let’s go to the next batch. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then Chair from page 100.419 
onwards, all the way through to 100.614 is what I propose 
should become Exhibit ZZ1.10.3, those are all documents 
recently furnished to the Commission by the Mr Mantashe, 
including you will see the very first one is the opening 
statement which you have just heard, but including many 
other things that we will take you to in due course. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine.  Then the batch of 
documents starting from page 100.419 up to page 100.614 
will be admitted as Exhibit ZZ1.10.3. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 58 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And if I may then proceed, I want to 
start the examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine, but I think let us 
take the tea break now so you can start when we come 
back.  We are twenty past eleven, we will resume at twenty 
five to twelve. 
 
Let us adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we can proceed now. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mantashe I want to 
start on dealing with the issue of deployment that you have 
referred to in your introductory address and I think it might 
be convenient if we start at – at page 100.450 I think that 
has been opened for you in the interval.  Page 100.450 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You got that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether the – the noise of 
the aircon is going to interfere with the sound but they will 
20 
adjust it if we indicate that it is interfering.  Okay alright.  I 
have got 450 – 100.450. 
ADV FREUND SC:  It should be headed Supplementary 
Statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 59 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  May I then proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Mr Mantashe is it correct that after 
Barbara 
Hogan 
testified 
you 
furnished 
a 
brief 
initial 
statement 
and 
then 
after 
furnishing 
that 
brief 
initial 
statement this was in 2018 you then furnished this document 
that we have in front of us as a supplementary statement, is 
that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And this was in or about November of 
10 
2018.  The original statement was the 11t h of November and I 
think this supplementary statement came around about the 
end of November 2018, does that sound right to you? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes there was – there was supplementary 
00:02:09 statement. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  Now in this document you turn to 
paragraph 32 
MR MANTASHE:  Chairperson where are you? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Sorry just bear with me.  3.2 – 3.2 
MR MANTASHE:  Oh 2.12 yes. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:  Perhaps just to set the – the context.  Ms 
Hogan had made certain allegations which we will come back 
to – we will come back to much later today but they were 
allegations which raised the proper place of the ANC’s 
deployment committee and in answer to her allegations you 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 60 of 316 
 
put up a brief answer and then in this document you 
elaborated further on the question of the deployment 
committee. That was the purpose of this document as I 
understand it, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And in that supplementary statement that 
you furnished in 2018 at paragraph 3.2 you said the 
following: 
“Our immediate goal – the our is presumed the African 
National Congress is it? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is asking Mr Mantashe whether our 
immediate goal refers to the immediate goal of the ANC?  
Did you – can you hear me? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes I do not understand the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay he is referring to paragraph 3.2. 
MR MANTASHE:  I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And in paragraph 3.2 you say: 
“Our immediate goal.” 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   
“As set out in the Strategy and Tactics is to 
do certain things.” 
I am just trying to understand whose immediate goal is it?  I 
am putting to you that I think it must be a reference to the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 61 of 316 
 
African National Congress. 
MR MANTASHE:  It is the ANC Policy document. 
ADV FREUND SC:  It is the ANC yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Strategy and Tactics 00:04:23 support 
stream. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes.  So the ANC immediate goal as set 
out in strategy and tactics.  Now what is strategy and 
tactics? 
MR MANTASHE:  Sorry Chairperson a policy document of 
the ANC. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  It is an earlier policy document – when 
was it drawn up approximately? 
MR MANTASHE:  It is not earlier.  The first formal strategy 
and tactics was adopted in Morogoro in 1967 and it was a 
white and 00:04:53. 
ADV FREUND SC:  It is – sorry I could not hear you.  It 
was… 
MR MANTASHE:  It is revisited and revised. 
ADV FREUND SC:  It is revisited at every conference. 
MR MANTASHE:  Every conference. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  So at every conference the original 
strategy and tactics document gets revised in accordance. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  With provisions of presumably the 
resolutions of the Congress – of the conferences.  And you 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 62 of 316 
 
then continue. 
“Our immediate goal is to deepen the hold of 
the Liberation Movement over the levers of 
the state.” 
Now when you refer there to the levers of the state to what 
are you referring? 
MR MANTASHE:  Every world state is the 00:05:39 of 
unconstructed – every 00:05:42 where that is departments of 
state owned enterprises 00:05:48.  All of them 00:05:54 of 
unconstitutionally. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  And the strategy of the African National 
Congress as I understand you is to deepen its hold over the 
levers of state.  Correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now what does that mean to deepen its 
hold? 
MR MANTASHE:  The unashamedly they is the one to govern 
– what I – I do not understand too and therefore you cannot 
govern without the state.  That is why there is a distancing 
between state and government.  We are a government party 
20 
but they stayed with this continuous that state must be made 
ready to exit programmes of a government department. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Can 
I 
ask 
this 
question? 
 
Is 
my 
understanding 
of 
deepen 
the 
hold 
of 
the 
Liberation 
Movement over the levers of the state correct if I say it 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 63 of 316 
 
means to deepen the control of the Liberation Movement on 
the various levels of state and features of the state? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes it is entrenched. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is correct. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And clearly when you refer here to the 
Liberation Movement you must be referring to the African 
National Congress and presumably its alliance as well? 
MR MANTASHE:  That is the Liberation Movement. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes.  And when you talk about control 
over the leaders of state that presumably includes control 
over the Public Administration. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes if you are government you must have 
that. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And it includes control over the public 
service which is part of the public administration, you agree? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And it includes control over the state 
owned enterprises, agree? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes.  Those are tools in the hand of a 
government budget to execute. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now do you accept the principle that the 
public service is required to be non-partisan? 
MR MANTASHE:  We accept that. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 64 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  I beg your pardon. 
MR MANTASHE:  We accept that. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You accept that.  And I furnished to you 
and Chair you may find on your desk just an extract from the 
– the constitutional principles which form schedule 4 to the 
interim constitution.  They are numbered in roman numerals 
but if I can take you to the sixth… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  This sixth page of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 6? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Page 6 you will find Principle number 30 
which is XXX.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And I – I would assume Mr Mantashe 
please correct me if I am wrong but I would assume that you 
would be familiar with these principles that were principles 
that form part of the interim constitution, am I correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And you understand and know very well 
that the – the interim constitution provided for the – for the 
20 
establishment 
of what 
we now refer 
to as the final 
constitution but the final constitution had to comply with 
certain principles and that is the principles at which we are 
looking at the moment.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  And we accept them. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 65 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  And one of those principles that 
has to be incorporated and was incorporated in my view in 
any event into the – the so called final constitution the 
constitution of 1996 is that there shall be an efficient non-
partisan 
career 
orientated 
public 
service 
broadly 
representative of the South African Community functioning 
on the basis of fairness and shall serve all members of the 
public in an unbiased and impartial manner and it continues. 
 
And I am assuming that as Chairperson of the African 
National Congress you have no difficulty with this principle.  
10 
I think that is what you have already said to me, is that 
right? 
MR MANTASHE:  No 00:10:44. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  So the – one of the issues that I 
am going to be exploring with you in the course of the 
morning is what some might think is there is a tension 
between the principle that the Public Service being non-
partisan and what you have already told the Chair which is 
that it is the express policy of the African National Congress 
to control the Public Service. 
20 
Now do you see any tension or conflict there at all? 
MR MANTASHE:  No there is no tension the emphasis is on 
working with the Public Service that is not rebellious against 
the governing party that is the emphasis. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And I presume what you are referring to 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 66 of 316 
 
but correct me if I am wrong.  The African National Congress 
when it was first elected here in 1994 inherited as it were a 
state established by an apartheid government. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  With racists laws, with a predominantly 
white Public Service and you would accept that what I put to 
you, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So one of the challenges confronting the 
African National Congress after winning at least a first 
10 
election is to try to re-orientate the state structures so that 
they are no longer racist and so that the demographic 
makeup of that Public Service is more in line with the – with 
the demographic makeup of the country as a whole, is that 
correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Apparently so. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes.  But let me make clear that I have 
no difficulty with that I cannot imagine the commission can 
have any difficulty with that.  That is not in dispute in this 
matter.  We take that for granted.  We also take for granted – 
20 
or let me put it to you I am sure you will agree with this that 
the goal of the constitution is expressly to be transformative.  
You see? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And that embraces many things but 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 67 of 316 
 
amongst the things it embraces is a desire – a policy in fact 
an instruction to the nation to shake off the racist past and – 
and to firstly as it were create a non-racial society with no 
racial discrimination and – and providing for more equitable 
representation in organs of state on a racial basis.  I am 
sure you would accept all of that. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And again let me make clear that again 
there is no controversy between us I think the constitution is 
very clear on that.  And I think what you were referring to a 
10 
moment ago was that the ANC confronted a problem which 
was on assuming office which was that it has inherited state 
structures which were reflective of the apartheid past and 
the ANC was resolved to change that in accordance with the 
principles that I have just been referring to. Am I correct 
there? 
MR MANTASHE:  Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And again let me make clear that I can 
see no basis for criticising the ANC on that.  But the 
difficulty comes as it were further down the line you go and I 
20 
think that was one of the points that Ms Hogan was trying to 
make that there comes a stage at which the obligation to 
promote a non-partisan Public Service and a non-partisan 
set of state owned enterprises is intentionally with ANC 
deployment policy if the ANC deployment policy is to staff 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 68 of 316 
 
those structures with personnel who are cadres of the ANC 
committed to and accountable to the ANC. Do you take the 
view there is no tension there? 
MR MANTASHE:  Now that is why I clarified Mr Chairperson 
that the ANC does not have a cadres deployment policy.  It 
has a deployment committee.  That deployment committee if 
you go through those documents will explain to you that 
deployment is a recommend – is a recommending structure 
but everybody who goes to the state goes through the 
interviews and the selection process and gets elected on 
10 
merit.  That is why I reflect with the 65% as quantifying 
progress made up to now.  So 00:16:29 is not trying to 
deploy the people loyal to the ANC 00:16:31 is deploying 
competent people in the ANC but will have a broader 
understanding of the need to transform society. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now if I can take you back now for the 
first time to your own principle affidavit, your main affidavit 
before the commission.   Can I take you to page 100.16? 
MR MANTASHE:  100? 
ADV FREUND SC:  .16 – 16.  It is very early in the file.  Well 
20 
perhaps it would be better if I take you back to page 100.6 
just to get your bearing. 
MR MANTASHE:  100.16? 
ADV FREUND SC:  100 and then .6. 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay.  I have got that. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 69 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright so .6 I just want to indicate to you 
so that you understand what document you looking at is your 
affidavit to the commission submitted in the last month or 
two.  You understand what I am saying? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And in that affidavit you go to 100.16 and 
we look at paragraph 43.   
MR MANTASHE:  Point? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Paragraph 43 do you have it? 
MR MANTASHE:  4.3? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  No 43. 
MR MANTASHE:  What is here?  I do not have it. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Page – page 100. 
MR MANTASHE:  I have 43 here. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You have got it.  And you say this in your 
affidavit. 
“Strategic deployment of ANC cadres played 
an important role in the ANC taking control of 
the post Liberations state.” 
Now could you explain to us what you meant when you were 
20 
referring in that sentence to the deployment of ANC cadres? 
MR MANTASHE:  Now you will have to move back in history 
and 
understand 
that 
here 
is 
the 
ANC 
walking 
into 
government.  It inherit a state which is run by workmen, men 
of the masters.  The ANC had a duty to deploy people who 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 70 of 316 
 
understand the intention of the informative constitutionality 
and that is why I emphasise the point that people who were 
sent to school in various parts of the world to study and then 
brought back deployed to the state not out of the blue 
because they have gone to school, trained and therefore 
because of the 00:19:41 society was understood by both 
government and the state.  
ADV FREUND SC:  Now in your answer you said to me the 
ANC had to deploy persons to do certain things.  What did 
you mean the ANC had to deploy?  What does that term 
10 
deploy mean? 
MR MANTASHE:  Deploy means send people and give 
people responsibility.  That is what deploy means (inaudible) 
like will be sending me to be Minister I am deployed to be 
Minister.  It is not just being sent there I am given a 
responsibility to do the correct thing in that work. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now I understand that answer so if you 
want… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you proceed Mr Freund.  Two 
times Mr Mantashe you have emphasised that the ANC does 
20 
not have a cadres deployment policy. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has a deployment policy.  Now I am 
trying to understand what the point – what the important 
point is that you wanted to drive home when you said that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 71 of 316 
 
and I do know that you referred to what the DA I think says.  
But now I am thinking if your own affidavit talks about 
deployment of the ANC cadres in the context of deployment 
policy whether there is not much point to make because your 
own statement is talking about the deployment of ANC 
cadres.  Is there something I am missing. 
MR MANTASHE:  No the point that you will miss is that in 
that deployment it is not focussing on cadres it is focussing 
of deploying capabilities and competence.  Okay.  But 
equally emphasise that people must understand the policy of 
10 
a governing party.  If you want to understand this you will go 
to a province that has not 00:22:03.  That province will 
deploy people they have confidence in.  But they do not call 
it cadre development – cadre deployment.  But when they 
think to reconcile that and I must confess that because they 
do not look for cadres sometimes we will select a person that 
we think is competent and go to a responsibility and 
00:22:37 policy.  That is the point I am trying to emphasise.  
But 00:22:40 is that you work with a person who works 
against the policies and those policies are 00:22:47 that you 
20 
contested elections on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but I think I – in substance there is 
nothing wrong with referring with saying the ANC deploys its 
cadres in terms of its deployment policy in substance there 
is nothing wrong but you are saying when one says that one 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 72 of 316 
 
must not emphasise just the cadres one must look at the 
entire context. 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  You will have to refer to the 
submission of the leader of the opposition party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  That submission 00:23:43 specifically 
cadre deployment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  And because in its narrow interpretation 
the ANC does not look for competence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  It looks for cadres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  That is the emphasis that I use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no then I understand.  I think 
what you – what you are saying is a term that on its own 
should not be objectionable it may be used in a certain 
connotation negative connotation by other people and that is 
20 
the negative connotation that you reject. 
MR MANTASHE:  We do not have a problem with the term 
cadres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay because there is a clear definition. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 73 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Of whom a cadre is.  It is not just a 
member of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Chairperson was going through a process, 
developed, understand policies and can be trusted.  That is 
a cadre.  I have no problem with the term cadre. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  But deployment to positions we are not 
looking for cadres we would look for competence and people 
10 
who are competent to execute the task at hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So when you are talking about decisions 
and I am now not – I am now talking about decisions made 
by ANC structures.  I am not talking about decisions made by 
Ministers or DG’s or people appointing staff.  I am focussing 
on decisions made by ANC structures and there are various 
ANC deployment committees, am I correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  When those deployment committees are 
20 
making their deployment decisions I want to put to you that it 
seems logical to assume that the people they are seeking to 
deploy are indeed their cadres not necessarily cadres who 
lack skill or competence or training but it is in the nature of 
the exercise that you talking about the deployment of your 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 74 of 316 
 
cadres, are you not? 
MR MANTASHE:  You are cleaning me out of my affidavit 
because in the affidavit I emphasise the fact that a 
deployment committee does not employ it recommends. 
Sometimes a person who is recommended fails the selection 
process and that is where the big deal in the selection 
process a better candidate is found and that candidate is 
appointed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now you just said that the deployment 
committees do not deploy, did I hear that correctly? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  They do not employ. 
ADV FREUND SC: They do not employ? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But do they deploy? 
MR MANTASHE:  They deploy, they recommend. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And so that was going to be my next 
question.  By deploy you say that should be understood to 
mean recommend. 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  You are taking me to an English class.  
I am going finish it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember that it is important that the 
ANC’s position be made clear. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes.  Deployment is a collective effort to 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 75 of 316 
 
send people to tasks and give them tasks.  Employment is 
the actual process that takes place in government not in the 
ANC.  In the ANC we employ our people obviously they will 
employ cadre we will not employ prisoners and non-ANC 
members in the ANC but in government the government 
selection 
process 
is 
controlled 
by 
a 
department 
in 
government Public Service and Administration he has this 
policy 
therefore 
recommendation 
of 
the 
deployment 
committee are not automatic and I will give you example of 
many who were recommended and failed dismally.  The 
10 
reason for that 00:27:51 is that I am trying – I am a cadre of 
the ANC, I am recommended.  I assume that this is my 
position and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you do not prepare? 
MR MANTASHE:  I do not prepare I go there I become a 
disaster.  I do not get appointed, simple. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright let us now focus more clearly on 
the most significant documents of relevance to this debate.  
Can I take you to page 100.486 – 100.486.   
MR MANTASHE:  400? 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  486.  It should be the beginning of the 
50 th National Conference Resolution.   
MR MANTASHE:  480. 
ADV FREUND SC:  486.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Use the black numbers. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 76 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:  I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looking at the black numbers not the red 
numbers. 
MR MANTASHE:  I am there 480. 
CHAIRPERSON:  6. 
MR MANTASHE:  6. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right and that document runs through as 
you can see it is all marked up in yellow for some pages and 
can you confirm that this is the set of resolutions adopted by 
the ANC’s 50 th National Conference? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And that 50th National Conference if I am 
correct took place in 1997 it was the Mafikeng conference.  
It was the conference really in the first administration of an 
ANC government, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just make sure Mr Mantashe that you 
speak closer to the microphone so that your answer will be 
recorded. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes I – it was the conference which is 
20 
towards the end of the first administration. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Of the first administration.   
MR MANTASHE:   It was not the ANC administration unit.  
It was government of national unit.  [Speaker not clear] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 77 of 316 
 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 This 
was 
under 
the 
Mandela 
presidency. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   That was the Cabinet(?) ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   And as you say, towards the end of 
that? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  And if we can turn to page 491, 
we find the policy which was adopted.  And would it be 
10 
correct to say that this policy that were are going to look at 
now, it is over the next – over this page and the next page.  
This, really, is the foundation of the ANC’s deployment 
policy to this day? 
MR MANTASHE:   I would say yes and no because we 
should avoid mixing the ANC work and government work 
because if we are going to do that we are going cause 
confusion.  The ANC as a party and as an organisation has 
a responsibility to prepare itself to have capacity to 
govern.  Okay?  So this policy talks to the ANC internal 
20 
processes of preparing his people to have capacity to 
govern.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, but the question is whether this 
policy as adopted at this conference really stood as the 
dead-rock of the ANC’s own deployment policies to this 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 78 of 316 
 
day? 
MR MANTASHE:   I am worried about this.  Of what?  To 
locate a deployment to cadre.  I am worried about that.  
The ANC prepares it cadres.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Government of school.  I come back to 
...[indistinct] and I go back, go back to school. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is an internal ANC process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   So that if I am given a responsibility, I 
must have acquired the competence to execute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me ask this – ask the question 
this way.  I am not sure that you are – the two of you are 
on the same page.  You remember you said earlier on the 
ANC has a deployment policy? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And as I understood you, you said that 
deployment policy was started by the ANC some years ago.  
I cannot remember what year you have indicated.  And you 
20 
said every – at every conference that policy is revised.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is revisited. 
MR MANTASHE:   The Deployment Committee gets divided 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 79 of 316 
 
in the WC and NEC ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...on an ongoing basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Now Mr Freund’s question is 
whether this document that we are looking at which 
includes at page 100.491 a section that says Cadre Policy. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is asking whether this document 
contains still the foundation of the ANC Cadre Policy that 
has evolved over the years? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   No, Cadre Policy, it is about developing 
of individual cadres of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So you see Cadre Policy is 
not necessarily the Deployment Policy? 
MR MANTASHE:   It is not Deployment Policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
It 
is 
the 
silencing 
of 
cadres 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...to be ready.  If you do well and comply 
20 
with the prescriptions of the Cadre Policy, you would be 
ready for deployment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   Because you would have had acquired 
the skills. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 80 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  I hope that has clarified, 
Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I think it will become clearer as we go 
along, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There is a lot more to canvas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Now if we look at that Cadre Policy, 
that conferencing notes the importance of the process of 
transformation and the mass character of the ANC of 
10 
having – and these are the words I focus on – of having an 
army 
of 
conscious 
committed 
and 
properly 
deployed 
cadres.  That is fundamental policy that was then the 
fundamental policy of the ANC and the question I want to 
ask you is.  Does that remain the fundamental policy of the 
ANC? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, it remains fundamental(?). [Speaker 
is not clear.] 
ADV FREUND SC:   And if we look at the fourth bullet 
point, this is under Conference Notes, the critical role of 
20 
political leadership in the transition period and the need to 
deploy cadres to various organs of the state including the 
public service and to other centres of power in society, that 
remains the position of the African National Congress to 
this day.  Am I right? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 81 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  Yes, it remains. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So it would not be correct to say that 
Cadre Policy is purely about framing and enhancing the 
political skills and the political education cadres because, 
although that is correct, there is a second part to it.  And 
the second part to it is the policy of deploying those 
cadres.  Correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   The Cadre Policy prepares people for 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   For deployment? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   ...for deployment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  It is like – even if you call it or you 
do not call it deployment policy, you have kids, you send 
them 
to 
school, 
you 
are 
preparing 
them 
for 
bigger 
responsibilities 
in 
society. 
 
The 
ANC 
give 
that 
responsibility on its cadres.  That is why it is not an 
exception in the ANC to send an old person send back to 
school and he goes and study and come back because 
there is an ongoing process of preparing people to take 
20 
bigger responsibilities.  And therefore deployment, yes.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Let us move on to the next 
page.  After dealing with the topic of the development 
about cadres.  That is the foot of 491.  The resolution 
moves on to the question of its deployment and the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 82 of 316 
 
redeployment of cadres. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I think the question I keep coming 
back to is, what does this mean?  But in this context, in the 
context of this policy, when it says that conference 
resolves to put in place a deployment strategy.  What is 
meant by or that term a deployment strategy? 
MR MANTASHE:   A strategy to deploy people to resume(?) 
responsibility [Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV FREUND SC:   And does the – ordinary meaning of 
10 
the word deploy not denote, I think you used the word 
sending.  Sending your cadres to occupy positions that are 
the subject – that are the target of the Deployment Policy? 
MR MANTASHE:   No.  You deploy people to areas of 
responsibility and they are not targeted.  We want to have 
people who understand in all centres of the state.  So 
there is no specific jobs that are targeted.  We want them 
to be ready to take up responsibility in the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is deploy in that context – does 
deploy in that context means having prepared people for 
20 
rendering service to the country in different sectors?  You 
say now they are ready ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...whenever 
opportunities 
arise 
...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 83 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...they must either make themselves 
available to be considered or we as the party through 
whatever 
structure 
will 
recommend 
that 
those 
in 
government who have the power to appoint should consider 
them.  Would that fact ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   They are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you say? 
MR MANTASHE:   They are deployed(?) and encouraged to 
apply. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are encouraged to apply? 
MR MANTASHE:   They are encouraged to apply. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
So 
that 
they 
go 
through 
the 
comprehensive selection process of this thing(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  So are you saying that they 
are deployment, as it were, is subject to the overriding 
processes of government in the sense that in the end the 
processes 
of 
government 
relating 
to 
selection 
and 
appointment or employment must prevail ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...as to who get appointed? 
MR MANTASHE:   Agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you say? 
MR MANTASHE:   I agree. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 84 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as a party, you prepare them and 
make them ready and you satisfy yourself that they 
understand your policies and if given an opportunity they 
will make sure that the policies of the governing party are 
implemented. 
MR MANTASHE:   Probably(?).  That is what I am saying.   
Okay alright.  I do not know if that has clarified, Mr Freund 
but do what you need to do to make sure you understand 
what this meant. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can we take it back Mr Mantashe to 
10 
the previous page to 491?  You will see there, we got a 
whole section, there is a whole resolution.   
“Conference resolves on the development of 
our cadres to do various things...”   
 
I think one could paraphrase it to say to train, to 
educate, inculcate the values.  That is the development of 
cadres.  That is part of the focus of this resolution. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I have no difficulty with that at all but 
what I am focussing on is the second part.  The second 
20 
part that says: 
“Under deployment and redeployment of our 
cadres...” 
 
And I am putting to you that just reading the 
document, there is a difference between that part of the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 85 of 316 
 
ANC’s policy which is aimed at developing cadres and that 
part of the ANC’s policy which is aimed at actually 
effecting deployment of cadres.  If that was not the case, 
we would not have these two separate paragraphs.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Hang 
on 
Mr 
Freund. 
 
Before 
Mr Mantashe responds.  What page are you on? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I take you back to 100.491?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am there.  Yes? 
ADV FREUND SC:   And there you will see, Chair, on the 
deployment of our cadres. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under Cadre Policy? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, at the bottom of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at the bottom of the page. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Conference resolves.  So, Chair, you 
will see what happens here.  Conference notes, further 
notes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...Conference Results. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the first thing that Conference 
Results relates to the deployment – on the development of 
our cadres. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 86 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is the point I am stressing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I am not going to read into the 
record the next half page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But that next half page is all about 
developing cadres ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...in the manner which I accepts 
Mr Mantashe has described. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What I am putting to Mr Mantashe and 
I will put it again is that this very policy makes clear that 
the distinction has to be drawn between, on the one hand 
the development of the cadres, and on the other hand, the 
deployment of cadres. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Decisions on the deployment of cadres 
is a different thing to the process of training and preparing 
of cadres.  I think you accept that? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   No.  You see, if you read that 
proposition on deployment and redeployment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTASHE:   It says, such discretion of deployment of 
individual 
comrades 
they 
are 
dealt 
with 
a 
proper 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 87 of 316 
 
consultation with the cadre consignment.  In other words, 
you do not impose a deployment on a person.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   No, let me just finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Let me just finish, it then goes further to 
say and so capacity building to prepare comrades for 
deployment and redeployment in various fields.  That is the 
centre point of deployment that you deploy and you 
develop capacity.  Any consult you do, you do probative tax 
10 
in all developments and in general on appointment of them.  
So read that thing in totality because if you just read 
phrases you are going to be start with the policy.   
ADV FREUND SC:   But Mantashe, my question is simply 
this.  Is it not correct that we have to distinction between, 
on the one hand, the policy on the development of cadres 
and on the other hand, the policy under deployment and 
redeployment of cadres. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   They are two different things.  You 
20 
agree? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, that would right. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  So now what we are trying to 
engage what is the meaning of the second thing.   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 88 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Because the meaning of the second 
thing cannot be the saw me was the first thing.  The first 
thing is the training process.  The second issue is the 
deployment process.  So I am now trying to understand this 
deployment process.   
MR MANTASHE:   No, the first thing is about preparation of 
people.  The second one is to – deployment is about given 
them responsibility having gone through preparation.  So if 
you see them as separate policies or as one, that is not 
the issue.  The issue is.  You do not just take a person 
10 
because he is cadre who to deploy. You prepare that 
person, you sent that person to school and you must be 
ready 
for 
deployment. 
 
Then 
you 
give 
that 
person 
responsibility. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  I understand.  So the word 
you 
used 
is 
deployment 
is 
really 
giving 
them 
the 
responsibilities. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now those responsibilities are the 
responsibilities associated with the post to which they are 
20 
to be deployed. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So you, as the ANC, have a policy of 
giving cadres responsibilities in the various sector to which 
you wish to deploy them. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 89 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Can I help you understand this?   
ADV FREUND SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR MANTASHE:   At one point, Minister Trevor Manuel, the 
Minister of Finance, one of the things that we credited him 
for.  He sent all the MEC’s in the provinces to the London 
School of Economics.  That is why all the MEC’s of that 
time has master ’s in economics today.  That is the essence 
of preparation for responsibility.  I am giving that just as an 
example of preparing the cadre for a responsibility so that 
you do not take a person to a responsibility that does not 
10 
fit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the example you give suggest to 
me that in that context you are talking about giving 
responsibilities to somebody who is already in a position or 
maybe preparing or training or enhancing their ability to 
perform their responsibilities better when they are already 
in positions when you take about MEC’s that were sent at 
the time. 
MR MANTASHE:   The difficult with government and state, 
okay, is that the selection in the state is done at the end of 
20 
[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   In government you elect a party and the 
party put their cabinet.  And even – you saw that this 
process of developing a person does not at the point of 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 90 of 316 
 
appointment.  If you appoint this person to be an MEC or a 
minister for this and you see gaps, the value of that of the 
skills and capabilities continue.  That is the point I am 
making.   
 
So I am trying to emphasise the fact that 
deployment of cadres should not be reduced to just dealing 
with anything that you just put there(?). [Speaker is not 
clear.]  That is not.  There is a whole lot of ...[indistinct] on 
the development of the capacity and culpabilities of the 
capacity and capabilities of the individual. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   As I understand this and I do not think 
that any reasonable person could have any objection to 
that.  So the ANC is a party with a programme in a 
democracy wanting to explain and to educate and to 
enhance the skills of its members of its cadres or whatever 
term you want to use.  It is not a controversy as far as I 
can see.   
 
The controversy that we are starting to explore 
is the next step and the next step is what you have 
20 
described as being a process by which the Deployment 
Committee 
make 
recommendations 
to 
cadres 
as 
the 
positions for which they could apply and then it is left to 
somebody else to decide whether that application will be 
successful.  Do I understand that that is what you are 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 91 of 316 
 
telling us? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, to commence and the preparing the 
individual to apply. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now let us look at what the 
policy actually says. Not the policy, the resolution.  You 
say that – and this is the first bullet point under the 
heading, On the Deployment and Redeployment of our 
Cadres.  So this under the heading, Resolves.   
“Put in place a deployment strategy which 
focuses on the short, medium and long term 
10 
challenges, 
identifying 
the 
key-centres 
of 
power, our strategy to transform these centres 
and the attributes and skills we require from 
our cadres to be so effectively...” 
 
So we are going to come, shortly, to what 
happened three years after this in 1999, the development 
of a strategy but conferences resolving what you need to 
put in place a deployment strategy.  Correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Then it continues.   
20 
“Conference Resolves: 
The establishment of Deployment Committee in 
the NEC, PEC, REC and BEC...”   
 
That is the National, the Provincial, the Regional 
and the Branch Executive Committees.  Is that correct? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 92 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
“...in 
which 
implementing 
– 
which 
in 
the 
implementing the above strategy should: 
- Discuss the deployment of comrades to 
areas of work on behalf of the movement 
including the public service, parastatals, 
structures of the movement and the private 
sector...: 
 
Now the policy that was mandated by this 
10 
conference, as I understand it from what I read here, is 
that comrades once deployed are expected to work on 
behalf of the movement inter alia in the public service and 
in the parastatals.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   That is right, Chair... 
ADV FREUND SC:   But what has happened to our non-
partisan public service?  Surely, a non-partisan public 
service is not there to work on behalf of the party.  And let 
me call it by saying this.  Clearly, ever member of the 
public service is under a duty to loyally execute the 
20 
policies of the governing party.  There is no difficulty about 
that but the question is about accountability.  And is it 
accountability to the government or is it accountability to 
the party?  This seems to suggest that the party is one of 
the accountability to the party.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 93 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Your question assumes that there is no 
political system.  That is your assumption that is there is 
no political system and because there is no political 
system – parties that are involved in government must go 
home, sleep and assume that things will happen...  That is 
your assumption.  It is a wrong assumption.   
 
Any 
party 
that 
is 
involved 
in 
government 
prepares to be involved in government meaningfully and 
that is what the ANC is doing.  Now your assumption that 
non-partisanship 
means 
no 
ANC. 
 
It 
is 
a 
wrong 
10 
assumption... 
 
Again, the ANC member and a cadre but once 
they are deployed to a responsibility I – well, first I 
understand the fact that I fail(?) to be a party person.  I 
become a public representative.  That is where non-
partisanship kicks in.  Now this assumption that non-
partisanship means absence of the ANC.  It is a wrong 
assumption.   
ADV FREUND SC:   In fact, it is the contrary, is it not?  
The expectation of the resolution of the African National 
20 
Congress that we are examining is that those persons 
deployed, for example, to the public service, for example 
to public to parastatals must understand that they sit there 
on behalf of the movement of which I understand the ANC.  
Is that correct? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 94 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, yes.  But that understanding is.  I 
am deployed by the ANC by the minister.  I am not a 
minister deployed on the basis(?) of non-partisanship.  I 
am a minister deployed by the ANC but what once I assume 
the responsibility I am must be non-partisan in my 
approach.  I must to society because I am a public 
representative.   
 
I must elevate myself above the party.  But I 
want to submit that there is nothing in me appraising my 
party when they have a breakaway or they have a 
10 
conference of developments and instead when I come there 
and say we should improve these representatives when we 
read this report, we need to put a lot of emphasis on all of 
this.  [Speaker is not clear.]  There is nothing wrong with 
that.  That does not make me partisan.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now what this point of – we have 
already referred to this bullet – says is that the NEC, PEC, 
REC and BEC Deployment Committees should disclose the 
deployment of comrades with the affected individuals.  But 
then it continues in the final bullet point as follows: 
20 
“Decisions 
of 
the 
organisation, 
after 
appropriate consultation with the individual 
cadres, are final and the breach of this policy 
shall 
constitute 
a 
serious 
offence 
to 
be 
considered by the appropriate structure...” 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 95 of 316 
 
 
What does that mean? 
MR MANTASHE:   I have never been a member of another 
party.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR MANTASHE:   I have never been a member of another 
party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   I am a member of the ANC.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Neither should they regard to you they 
10 
have another party, the continuance(?).  [Speaker is not 
clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTASHE:   Let me tell you my assumption.  It is that 
everybody that is involved in governments will try to 
prepare 
its 
members 
to 
participate 
effectively 
in 
government and you expect them to come(?) to them what 
they are doing.  Now I am not sure it is a correct 
assumption to make to say it is an ANC issue.   
 
In the Conference Resolution of the African 
20 
National Congress a close conference of the ANC will bring 
it here, to the Commission now.  And as a result on how to 
make itself effective in government.  Now that ability of the 
institution, you do not have to - apply its mind when do we 
to find as partisan.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 96 of 316 
 
 
Now 
it 
is 
– 
what 
is 
done 
by 
everybody.  
Everybody.  One party will resolve that ...[indistinct].  We 
will 
discuss 
that 
in 
this 
conference 
and 
execute 
consistently to stop every at every city if that is the 
province(?) but in the institutions of state, they should a 
formula(?) of dealing with that.   
 
So the point I am making here is that we prepare 
our cadres, we train our members, we guide them, we sent 
them to school.  As I have said to specific schools.  In our 
submission, we talk of William(?) Phulani(?) from the UK.  
10 
Okay.  We will say.   
 
But the lot(?) of the matter is that from time to 
time we will go and look into the China system, why is that 
in China corruption and socialism(?) are an exception?  
Okay.   
 
We go and learn and come back and we will 
discuss that in the ANC conference.  We will not take it to 
the state.  When you come across those discussions, they 
are going to ask us:  Are you trained in China?  Then you 
should be partisan.  If our internal arrangements will be 
20 
prepare our cadres to meet the standards required of the 
task concerned.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now Mr Mantashe, I can see no basis 
upon which anybody could object to be ANC making its own 
decisions on the training and selection of what I  might call 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 97 of 316 
 
political office bearers.  People who are to be selected to 
go to Parliament and who will be selected to be in the 
Cabinet and other comparable situations.  But the focus of 
my examination is really very much on the public service 
and the SOE’s.  And as regard the public service and the 
SOE’s.   
 
I want to put to you that it is not correct, as you 
have said, that any party tries to place people on those 
structures, loyal to and accountable to them under a duty, 
as it were, to report to them, the party, rather than to the 
10 
organisation in which they are employed.  You disagree 
with that, do you? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, that assumption is very abstract.  It 
assumes that people who were in the apartheid system are 
not in the state and people went to exile and they are in 
the camps of the – are not in the state.  That assumption 
you are making.  And I am saying it is a very, very abstract 
assumption that does not work in real life.  And the reality 
of the matter is that Government, you also know that so 
and so and so and so and so was trained in other 
20 
countries, in DDR, in the Soviet Union and UK, in the 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
They are trained to play a role in the public service and we 
deployed them to the public service.   
If we did not give that that would not happened 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 98 of 316 
 
automatically.  They had to be managed to happen, that is 
why if you look at any research you find out that there is 
more progress in transformation giving space for black 
people to participate in such a position than it is in the 
private sector because government has control there and it 
is actively managing, it is slow in the private sector 
because the assumption is, you stick with what you know 
and trust and not move on and change does not happen 
that way and if we did not do that, I can tell you the state 
will be looking different today. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Let us move on.  What we 
have been discussing so far is a resolution of a national 
conference and the resolution was on the need to develop 
a policy.  Can I now take you to 100.501? 
MR MANTASHE:   501? 
CHAIRPERSON:   100.501. 
MR MANTASHE:   The letter. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It should be …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay, I have it now. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Is that the document headed: 
20 
“ANC cadre deployment and development policy” 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Incidentally, just in passing, I know it 
is cadre deployment, it is not just deployment, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 99 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And is it correct that this is really the 
outcome, the product that emerged from the resolution we 
were discussing a moment ago? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There would have been some sort of 
process – this is at a time, I am not sure if you were 
already Secretary General, I do not think you were yet, or 
were you, the time of the development of this policy? 
MR MANTASHE:   What year was that? 
ADV FREUND SC:   This is in 1999. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No. 
MR MANTASHE:   1999, Secretary General was [indistinct 
– dropping voice] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes and where were you in 1999, were 
you...? 
MR MANTASHE:   1999 I was the General Secretary of 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were? 
MR MANTASHE:   I was the General Secretary of the 
20 
National Union of Mineworkers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Another centre of development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 100 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   But in due course – and just please 
remind me when you became Secretary General? 
MR MANTASHE:   Come again? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Of the African National Congress? 
CHAIRPERSON:   December 2007. 
ADV FREUND SC:   December 2007.  So when you 
assumed responsibilities of the office of Secretary General 
in 2007, was this document that we look at at page 501 
through to 511 still the governing policy? 
MR MANTASHE:   Leadership is continuous, you do not 
10 
respect(?) new policies every time you elect a new leader.  
If this policy was in place, I took ownership of it as my 
policy. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, yes.  I am just checking, as I 
believe to be the case. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That when you took office you 
assumed this as policy. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is all I am trying to establish as a 
20 
matter of fact because, as a matter of fact, there is other 
evidence to show that this was adopted in 2009 when, as 
you correctly say, you were not there but …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   2009? 
CHAIRPERSON:   1999. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 101 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   1999, I am sorry, my mistake, 1999 
when you were not there but nonetheless this was a policy 
that you assumed. 
MR MANTASHE:   I was there, I was not Secretary 
General. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I was thinking exactly about 
that.  You may have been there but not as Secretary 
General. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay, because you will go to [indistinct] 
10 
04.34, I was a delegate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Stellenbosch, I am a delegate. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   You go to [indistinct] 04.39 1991, I am a 
delegate, I am not Secretary General. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, I understand. 
MR MANTASHE:   So I am there. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now we will talk about some further 
20 
documents later in the course of this evidence but I am not 
aware of another document that looks like this.  This looks 
to me like the only document that has been furnished to me 
as the ANC’s cadre deployment and development policy.  
Now my question to you is, whether you accept to the best 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 102 of 316 
 
of your knowledge that this remains the applicable policy 
or whether you believe there were subsequent policies 
adopted in writing on some later occasion? 
MR MANTASHE:   I would have to break and go through 
the document that [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, you have not had a chance to 
see whether it is …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   There are quite a number of documents 
submitted on the cadre deployment. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, well …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   On the deployment policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   So I do not know whether this is the last 
of it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Well, I understand that  
MR MANTASHE:   I will need a break for that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, may I make the suggestion, that 
there will be a lunch adjournment not long from now and 
over that luncheon adjournment you can look into that 
20 
question, 
you 
can 
tell 
us 
immediately 
after 
the 
adjournment.  Would that be in order?  Thanks, but 
…[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   But I can assure that even if they are 
related documents, they will not [indistinct] 06.05 this 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 103 of 316 
 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, a bit on it. 
MR MANTASHE:   They will add. 
ADV FREUND SC:  They will add to it, alright. 
MR MANTASHE:   But this document in the main remain at 
the thrust of deployment. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now what this document – if we look at 
paragraph 3 of this document, it says that: 
“The ANC used the first term of government to 
perfect its deployment system notably with: 
10 
 3.1     A deployments framework, and  
 
3.2    Guidelines on the relationship between the  
ANC 
constitutional 
structures 
and 
government executives.” 
It then talks about certain other issues which I am not 
going to focus on and then in paragraph 4 it deals with 
strategic deployment and then paragraph 5 it quotes what 
we have referred to, what happened at the 50 t h National 
Congress and at paragraph 8 we really find the beginning 
of the meat of this document and this is the deployment 
20 
framework, presumably, which is what is being referred to 
also in paragraph 3.1.  Are you with me?  If you look at 
3.1, you look at paragraph 8, you find that here we are 
dealing with this document or instrument which is what we 
mean by the deployment framework.  Do you agree?  You 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 104 of 316 
 
accept that I am understanding that what comes from 
paragraph 8 is the deployment framework? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Now again here, in paragraph 
9, we find a reference to a statement we had previously 
seen: 
“Our immediate goal as set out in the strategy and 
tactics is to deepen the hold of the liberation 
movement over the levers of the state.” 
And then in paragraph 10 the policy now identifies what 
10 
are these levers of state that we are interested in and it 
says: 
“The key centres of authority and responsibility 
within the stage that should be given priority are: 
10.1    The cabinet. 
10.2 
The entire civil service but most importantly 
from director level upwards.” 
And then certain other ones and I draw your attention to  
 
10.6  Pararastals. 
And  
 
20 
10.8  Which independent statutory commissions,  
         agencies, boards and institutes.” 
Now let us start with the entire civil service.  Your 
evidence earlier was the focus is only on Directors General 
and Deputy Directors General whereas this policy seems to 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 105 of 316 
 
indicate that it is from director level upwards.  Has there 
been a change or what is the explanation? 
MR MANTASHE:   Practice is that deployment committee 
had its comments at DDG level and DG only. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am sorry, I just did not hear you 
clearly? 
MR MANTASHE:   The deployment committee expressed 
views and comments only at the level of the Deputy 
Director General and Director General. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You are saying that that is a matter of 
10 
fact that you have knowledge of because you presumably – 
I mean, have you sat on the deployment …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   That is a point of fact, I am stating a 
fact. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes and I am just trying to understand 
how you know that fact.  Have you sat on the National 
Deployment Committee? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I have not.  Actually the practice in 
the ANC is that Secretary General does not sit on the 
deployment committee and the President does not sit in the 
20 
deployment committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But, as I understand it, the Deputy 
President of the party and also of the country and the 
Deputy Secretary General …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   That is right. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 106 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   …of the party and therefore the 
country – of the party serve as leader and secretariat to 
the national deployment committee, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But, of course, there is more than one 
deployment committee.  There are deployment committees, 
as I understand it, correct me if I am wrong, at provincial 
level, at regional level, at branch level, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So the concerns of deployment 
10 
committees are not limited to Directors General and above, 
they must be – they must focus on all sorts of offices at 
provincial, regional and municipal level, presumably. 
MR MANTASHE:   You must appreciate that there is 
something called provincial government.  We are not going 
to send a national deployment committee to deal with that.  
The provincial deployment committee deal at that level.  
There are districts and metros.  The regional deployment 
committees state ideas on that, okay?  Local executive is 
part of it, branches express a view.  That is it.  All that is 
20 
captured here is that they are not [indistinct] 11.24 
throughout.  Deployment committees deal with levels of 
government.  The national deployment committee deals 
with national government. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the provincial deployment 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 107 of 316 
 
committee deals with provincial government. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And in fact the whole of …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   If there is a complication.  Only in case 
of a complication can they refer a matter to a national 
level.   
ADV FREUND SC:   And the whole – the public service are 
employed at provincial level, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Not necessarily so, DGs are employed at 
national level. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, I think if we look at the 
constitution we will find that the power to appoint the 
public service rests in provincial structures. 
MR MANTASHE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Not?  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think those that will fall under 
provincial governments would be appointed to provincially 
those who fall under national departments would be 
appointed nationally. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No having identified the focal points 
20 
including the civil service, including parastatals, perhaps 
you could just explain to me, the reference to independent 
statutory commissions, agencies, boards and institutes, 
what do you understand that to be a reference to? 
MR MANTASHE:   There is a number of commissions that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 108 of 316 
 
are appointed from time to time, the agencies, boards and 
institutes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am interested in – in what are – 
these are independent commissions so what sort of 
commissions would be independent which nonetheless are 
the subject of this deployment policy? 
MR MANTASHE:   Now you see you have never been to a 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I did not hear that. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  No, he has never been a member 
10 
of a party.  He is a lawyer. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, in fact you are wrong, I have 
been a member of the African National Congress, be that 
as it may. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, no, maybe in [indistinct – dropping 
voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you cannot refute it, he says he 
has been a member of the African National Congress. 
ADV FREUND SC:   May I say a long time ago. 
MR MANTASHE:   But the reality of the matter is that he 
20 
really does not appreciate the work in the party, that is the 
point I am making.  If I am Secretary General for ten years, 
I was supposed to look in all these things and monitor 
where there is [indistinct – dropping voice] in all these 
issues.  That is my duty as a party head.  I am not in the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 109 of 316 
 
state, I am not in government, I must look into all these 
issues including internal organisation, I go to internal 
organisation I see [indistinct] 14.24 - I take an interest 
there, active interest there.  And that is why this list is 
inclusive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But his question was can you throw light 
on 
some 
of 
the 
so-called 
independent 
statutory 
commissions that the document is talking about?  I do not 
know, is the Public Service Commission one of those? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So would the Competition 
Commission be one of those? 
MR MANTASHE:   The…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Competition Commission. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Maybe that gives an 
example. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Thank you, I 
understand.  And those …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   And the reason that, Chairperson, we 
20 
declared openly the support of this Commission is because 
we are interested in the work of this Commission, it must 
work well, we must resist it, we must stop it, we support it.  
We have declared that over and over.  It is [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 110 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   But …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must just say that – but I think I 
did say it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You are not appointed by the 
deployment committee.  But you are invested in ensuring 
that this Commission works. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, I just wanted to say that 
the Commission has noted that the NEC of the governing 
party has repeatedly publicly made it clear that it supports 
the work of the Commission and that is important. 
10 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
Yes, 
even 
when 
there 
are 
disagreements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
But 
these 
agreements 
or 
no 
disagreements, we support the work of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Because we are interested in the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now in paragraphs 13 of this policy at 
page 504 we see that it says that: 
20 
“ANC structures should be responsible for final 
decisions with respect to deployment matters where 
possible.” 
What kind of final decisions are referred to there? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 111 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Deployment covers a range of areas that 
are interested(?) in the state.  When we deploy a 
councillor, 
that 
councillor 
must 
go 
through 
the 
infrastructure [indistinct – dropping voice] because the 
councillor [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Must go through? 
MR MANTASHE:   The structures of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   When you develop a list to parliament, it 
goes through the structures of the ANC  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So if the question to be considered is 
who is suitable to be appointed as the Chairman of the 
board of an SOE, is that the sort of thing on which 
decisions 
of 
the 
ANC 
should 
be 
regarded 
as 
final 
decisions? 
MR MANTASHE:   The deployment committee will express 
a view on it.  It will not necessarily appoint a Chairperson 
of a board.  Half the time it gets it gets disappointed on 
some [indistinct – dropping voice] and every time they get 
20 
disappointed.  Half the time, the [indistinct] 17.34 reflect 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think, Mr Freund wants to establish 
what it means to say those decisions are final.  In other 
words, I do not know what he has in mind but the question 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 112 of 316 
 
that arises from me is whether they are binding on 
anybody. 
MR MANTASHE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if so, who? 
MR MANTASHE:   That is why I saw on a range of areas.  
A decision of the ANC structures will not be binding on 
boards 
because 
those 
our 
creatures 
of 
[inaudible 
– 
background noise].  So it cannot be.  But when we appoint 
our own councillors, our MPs and so forth …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, political members. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Decisions on the ANC are final. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Political office bearers. 
MR MANTASHE:   Political office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But Mr Mantashe, if we can go back 
briefly to page 491. 
MR MANTASHE:   Page 491? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, 492.  100.492. 
MR MANTASHE:   Come again, come again, 4..? 
ADV FREUND SC:   492. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Towards the second last bullet point 
on that page: 
“Decisions of the organisation after appropriate 
consultation with individual cadres are final and a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 113 of 316 
 
breach of this policy shall constitute a serious 
offence.” 
So I do not understand your last answer that these 
decision are not binding on anyone. 
MR MANTASHE:   Can I give you an example?  I have 
experience of dealing with a situation where the ANC 
selects Mantashe to be a councillor, but those structures 
that break that and appoint Comrade Jessie Duarte as a 
councillor.  That is what is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, they say we do not want this one 
10 
who has been …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …decided by a certain structure. 
MR MANTASHE:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV FREUND SC:   So there is obviously no public interest 
outside of the ANC in how the ANC chooses its deployees 
in the sense that you are talking about. 
MR MANTASHE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In the sense of, for example, who is to 
be the councillor to be selected. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   I …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   But the deployment policy goes far 
beyond that, does it not, goes to very heart of the 
appointment 
process 
that 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
this 
Commission. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 114 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   No, no, no, no.  I hope you can give an 
example of a party that calls a referendum to selects its 
[indistinct – dropping voice].  If you do that I will be 
comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think, Mr Mantashe, Mr Freund’s 
question is directed more at whether this part of the 
document which says: 
“Decisions of the organisation after appropriate 
consultation with the individual cadres are final and 
a breach of the policy constitute a serious offence 
10 
are limited to the appointment of political officer 
bearers.” 
I think his question is …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   That is the point I made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are they limited to that? 
MR MANTASHE:   They are limited to that because it is not 
the ANC structures that appoint – let me give you one 
interesting point in a political office.  The appointment of 
cabinet minister is not discussed and [indistinct] 21.22 
decided, it is the prerogative of the president and he 
20 
consults the officials and whatever structure but he takes 
that decision because by law he has an obligation to 
actually appoint a cabinet, it is his prerogative.  But as a 
practice in a democratic organisation, he will say I have 
this [indistinct] 21.44.  The organisation will say we do not 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 115 of 316 
 
think that is a correct appointment, can you reconsider 
that?  He changes his mind as he likes [indistinct – 
dropping voice].  So that is limited to particular structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe the difficulty might simply be to 
anyone who reads it, who reads this part, that it seems to 
be wide.  You are saying it is aimed at the appointment of 
political office bearers but when one reads here, on the 
face of it, it does not seem to have that limitation but you 
give your understanding of it. 
MR MANTASHE:   It is a policy of the party in a party 
10 
conference.  It is now a document before the Commission.  
Okay, that is the contradiction.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Because the party in its conference is 
emphasising the importance of discipline among its cadres. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   You see/ 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   This is a conference document.  It is 
now before the Commission and it will either to a great 
20 
extent  distort the essence of the document which is a 
party internal document discussed in a party conference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now I just want to take 
you please to page 503, paragraph 10.2. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 116 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   500? 
ADV FREUND SC:   503. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Paragraph 10.2.  You will remember 
we have looked at this before.  This is the part that says 
that: 
“The key centres of authority include the entire civil 
service but most importantly from the director level 
upwards.” 
Remember we talked about that earlier. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now if I can take you to page 505, 
paragraph 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 505? 
ADV FREUND SC:   505, paragraph 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There you say, you being the ANC: 
“Our 
strategy 
should 
not 
only 
concentrate 
on 
deployment at the most senior level but at lateral 
entry levels as well.” 
20 
And it continues.  So what I am suggesting to you is that 
the document creates the impression that the ambition of 
the policy is far broader than what you have been saying.  
Been saying it really aims to do a little more than to make 
recommendations as to candidates who might apply for 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 117 of 316 
 
positions of DGs and DDGs.  I am suggesting the document 
itself on its terms makes clear that as part of this strategy 
to control the levers of the state that we talked about 
before, the deployment policy is for the party to have 
powerful influence and impact on who populates the civil 
service. 
MR MANTASHE:   The reality of the matter is that you can 
go to the deployment committee, they will not know the six 
directors interdepartmentally, they will have no clue but the 
point made in the document is to prevent situations where 
10 
deployed capable comrades to position, only find that they 
were completely surrounded by and locked into structure 
dominated by forces that not only do not share the same 
strategic objective but also sometimes even actively work 
to 
undermine 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
national 
democratic 
[indistinct – dropping voice].  Okay, so it does not talk 
about actual deployment, it looks into now the broader 
perspective that you can deploy a capable person to a 
department and further surrounded by people who are 
actually working against the policy.  That is what the 
20 
deployment started to say you must look for and avoid. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, I see it is one o’clock.  Is this a 
convenient time? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 118 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is one o’clock.  Okay, let us take 
the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay, let’s continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Mantashe could I 
take you to page 587, it is 100.587. 
MR MANTASHE:   587? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Incidentally just for the purposes of 
the Chair, we do have preceding in the preceding two 
pages, the conference resolution in December 2002 but it 
speaks for itself.  I am not going to ask Mr Mantashe 
questions about it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And we are dealing now with the next 
one, at 587, which is the 52 n d National Conference in 
December 
of 
2007. 
I 
think 
Mr 
Mantashe 
made 
the 
20 
observation to me that this is the conferences which he 
was elected as the Secretary General, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the issue of deployment of traders 
that we have been discussing this morning, is addressed at 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 119 of 316 
 
page 588 in paragraphs 55, 56 and 57, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And in paragraph 56, the conference 
instructs the incoming NEC to ensure the implementation of 
the 1997 resolution on deployment and strengthen the 
National Deployment Committee, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:    Yes.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And then I want to focus on paragraph 
57.  It is the first bullet point, it provides that the 
conference decided on the following specific approaches 
10 
with regards to deployments, as discussed at the National 
Policy Conference, that would have been the National 
Policy Conference, presumably two to three years before 
this is General National Conference, is that right? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, the National Conferences sits every 
five years.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, but we are looking at a National 
Conference and this is referring to a National Policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Policy conference. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
Oh, 
the 
National 
Policy 
20 
Conference…[intervene] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Would have been two or three years. 
MR MANTASHE:   Or even less because Policy Conference 
precedes the National Conference, yes the NTC is halfway. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 120 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   So it is closer to the National 
Conference. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would the Policy Conference between 
the NGC and the National Conference. 
MR MANTASHE:   Between the NGC and the National 
Conference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And what this paragraph of the 
resolution of the conference reflects is at the local 
10 
government level, the PEC should make recommendations 
of not more than three names of cadres in order of priority 
it should be considered for Mayorship and the PEC will 
make a final decision.  Now, many Mayorship’s are 
executive Mayorships’, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, many and others not. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, and this resolution applies, 
whether they are executive or not executive. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  
ADV FREUND SC:   In other words, what the resolution is 
20 
requiring is that the PEC will have the power to decide on 
executive Mayorship’s amongst others, agree? 
MR MANTASHE:   They decide on Mayors, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, and so effect was given to that 
resolution 
and 
although 
there 
is 
a 
whole 
statutory 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 121 of 316 
 
procedure for the appointment of executive Mayors.  The – 
in the Amatole District Municipality, the process, which is 
meant to be an objective process, weighing the candidates 
resulted in a proposal for candidate A that the REC had 
decided on candidate B, so candidate B was appointed and 
that matter went to Court, are you aware of that? 
MR MANTASHE:   It is more than that in the case of 
Amatole because district municipalities and metros this is 
also discussed with the NEC because we take them very 
seriously. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   So, in fact it was an NEC decision. 
MR MANTASHE:   Amatole should have been decided at 
NEC level. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, and what the Court held is that 
whole 
process 
was 
unlawful, 
that 
it 
was 
completely 
unlawful for the counsellors, vested with the power under 
the statute to make a decision as to who should be the 
Executive Mayor, to act under the dictates of the PEC.  Are 
you not aware of that? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, not really. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Just for the record, Chair, the case to 
which I am referring is Mlokoti v District Municipality for 
Amatole 2009 Volume 6 of the South African Law Reports.  
If I can read my own handwriting, I think it is P34 but it 
might be 534.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 122 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   2009? 
ADV FREUND SC:   2009, yes, which is of course three 
years after this 2007 resolution that we are looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which Court is that? 
ADV FREUND SC:   It was the judgment of Pickering, J as 
I recall and I think in one of the Eastern Cape Courts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the Eastern Cape Courts. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I cannot tell you Judge that I 
noted it up it's been cited with approval in the subsequent 
decision in the Supreme Court of Appeal.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But not directly on the same sort of 
facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, I want to put to you that that 
case, illustrates the problem of the conference resolutions 
and the policies we are talking about because there is a 
conflict between following the proper statutory appointment 
processes, which are essentially meant to be decisions 
made by other functionaries on their merits. 
20 
And on the other hand, the inevitable pressure that 
must arise from the policies that we've been talking about 
in terms of which the ANC under its own policies, considers 
it is appropriate to make these types of decisions.  Do you 
accept that or reject that? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 123 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I reject that.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And could you explain why? 
MR MANTASHE:   That the ANC must have a right to take a 
decision, in its structures about people who will play a role 
on making decisions, I cannot agree not unless you explain 
the unlawful aspect but the ANC must take a decision.  
That is why, if you read that resolution, it still reads what 
happened at all levels but it still talks to the ANC taking 
decisions.  So if what you are submitting is that it is 
unlawful for the ANC to take a decision about people who 
10 
serve in the structures of government on behalf of the 
ANC, I would not agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe, Mr Freund, you might wish 
to briefly tell me and Mr Mantashe more about the 
judgements so that one can appreciate its relevance. 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 
So 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
judgements…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also it is important to I guess to 
bear in mind or keep an eye on the decisions that Mr 
Mantashe may be talking about, because in regard to 
20 
certain deployments, we were talking about them before 
lunch.  
He was saying that the Deployment Committee, for 
example, makes recommendations as opposed to making 
decisions and leaves decisions to be made by the relevant 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 124 of 316 
 
government functionaries. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is important just to see, what are 
we talking about that was decided in the party and what 
are we talking about in terms of positions in government? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, to be clear about that this was 
not a case of a recommendation or the findings of the 
Court was, this was not a case about a recommendation. 
But it was also not a case about the sort of positions of Mr 
Mantashe has mainly been referring to…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Political office bearers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, because although a Mayor might 
be seen as a political office bearer when it comes to 
Executive Mayors who are full time employees of councils, 
then there are certain statutory provisions about who has 
the power to make that decision, how it should be made.  
And the evidence, which I do not even think was 
contested, but certainly as found by the Court was that the 
caucus at the municipal level, were instructed, presumably, 
pursuant to the provision of the policy, we just looked at 
20 
that that decision had been made at a higher level and 
they simply had to act under the dictates of that decision, 
and the Court held that to be unlawful.  
So it is a special case in the sense that it is an 
employee rather than, say, a Cabinet Minister or a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 125 of 316 
 
municipal councillor, fulfilling a normal municipal council 
role. But that is why I was at pains to take it to that 
particular decision about the PEC and the conference.  I do 
not 
know 
if 
there 
is 
s 
anything 
that 
Mr 
Mantashe…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to say anything Mr Mantashe? 
MR MANTASHE:   I think you should read that resolution 
but that resolution is clear that no PEC takes a decision on 
who should be a Mayor, that is the first thing. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So can you just refer to the page you 
10 
are looking at? 
MR MANTASHE:   In 57 under 580. 
ADV FREUND SC:   The page number I do not have it in 
front of me. 
MR MANTASHE:   It is 100 not 588, five eight, eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   588, thank you I will go back to that 
now.  
MR MANTASHE:   That resolution explains that what goes 
to the PEC originates from the region.  The region will 
have a discussion and it selects three names and say to 
20 
the PEC here are the three names, we think can be Mayor.  
The assumption that is taken all the time is that all of them 
are committed enough to be Mayor, then the PEC select a 
person. 
In the case of the province for a Premier of the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 126 of 316 
 
province select three names go to the NEC, and then 
proposing for Premiership and the NEC selects one and the 
PEC goes back with one name among the three it selected. 
So - I do not want to talk to the Amatole case, because I 
have no insight to that case but the process is that there is 
no PEC that appoints a Mayor and impose on the caucus.  
It starts there and it goes to the PEC and the PEC says out 
of the three names this is the name we think will should be 
Mayor. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, but the problem Mr Mantashe is 
10 
precisely that because the PEC under the resolution makes 
a final decision who will be a Mayor including an Executive 
Mayor, and the law prescribes otherwise. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, it is final in respect of ANC structure 
and they as a structure have a responsibility to go to the 
structures 
that 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
caucus 
of 
the 
municipality…[intervene] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Exactly. 
MR MANTASHE:   …and propose that they vote for it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that is precisely what the Court 
20 
held to be unlawful.  The Court held that it is unlawful for 
the councillors in the ANC caucus to act under the dictates 
of a party structure, a Deployment Committee, which would 
appear from what we read here must have been the PEC’s 
Deployment Committee. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 127 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   What I am making it clear in this case, I 
have no insight of.  
ADV FREUND SC:   I understand, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   But the point I would like to understand 
is that the DA appointed the Mayor of Cape Town.  Okay 
and there is no argument about that but then majority in 
Pretoria also go through - they get a Mayor.  Is it unlawful 
for the ANC to appoint a Mayor but it is lawful for 
everybody else to appoint Mayors where they are our 
10 
government, I do not understand that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright and as you say it is on facts 
that you are not aware about which appeared from the 
judgment in the interest of time I am going to move on.  
Can I take you now to page 450 just to get your bearings. 
MR MANTASHE:   450? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Four, five, zero ja 100.450. 
MR MANTASHE:   I got that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Do you remember this is your 
supplementary statement that we referred to this morning, 
20 
this is your 2018 supplementary statement. 
MR MANTASHE:    Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And now can I take you to page 460, 
four, six, zero.  So bear in mind what we are reading here 
is a statement that you drafted for consideration by this 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 128 of 316 
 
Commission and from the middle of page 460, you start to 
address and to refer to what we have just been looking at, 
what was required to be done as a consequence of the 52 n d 
National Conference, the NEC would need to attend to 
certain things.  
And then what interests me is, is at the foot of page 
460: 
“Deployment within each of the five pillars requires 
its own set of strategic discussions, for example, 
within the State sector, what principles.” 
10 
We talking about principles in relation to deployment and 
so forth. 
“What principles should inform the deployment of 
tenders to institutions with judicial or investigative 
functions.” 
So could you tell us, please, what type if any of 
deployment of cadres takes place to institutions with 
judicial functions? 
MR MANTASHE:   You are on page 460? 
ADV FREUND SC:   At the foot of 460 at the top of 461.  
20 
MR MANTASHE:   And so what principle sort? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The question is, what knowledge do 
you have of any deployment of cadres, which is to say ANC 
cadres to institutions with judicial function? 
MR MANTASHE:   The Judges are appointed by the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 129 of 316 
 
Judicial Commission, ne’? 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are appointed by the President on 
the advice of the Judicial Service Commission, if it is High 
Court Judges and Supreme Court of Appeal Judges they 
appointed by the President on the recommendation of the 
Judicial Service Commission, if it is Constitutional Court 
Judge, it is Deputy Chief Justice, yes the first is different, 
ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, and the ANC does not interfere with 
that process.  
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR MANTASHE:   What it will do is that if there are 
vacancies advertised, and experienced lawyers, they will 
advise them to avail themselves for that.   
That is why it is the role of the Deployment 
Committee in this case will not be mandated it will be said 
Deployment Committee you are experienced now, you are a 
senior counsel, you offer an advance of experience we 
thank you for applying to that committee, and then I get 
submitted to the process that everybody is subject to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is that what this is talking to?  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, I want to put to you that it just 
sounds inherently improbable that when an ANC - when the 
Secretary General of the African National Congress or the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 130 of 316 
 
former Secretary General submits to the Commission that 
the ANC Deployment Policy results in the deployment of 
cadres to institutions with judicial functions.  
It does not look at face value as benign as merely 
encouraging people thought to have qualifications to apply 
for judicial appointment.  The whole notion of deployment 
of cadres to institutions with judicial functions, carries with 
respect a far more sinister read that what you are 
suggesting. 
MR MANTASHE:   I think I am not sharing the analogy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MANTASHE:   I am not sharing the analogy to 
deployment.  I am not allergic to deployment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think what Mr…[intervene] 
MR MANTASHE:   The point – excuse me, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   The point I am making is that because 
we have an interest in the State, in the economy and 
organisation work, in a geological one that was the 
parameters 
of 
areas 
that 
we 
have 
an 
interest 
in.  
20 
Therefore, where it is political, we are directly involved.  
Where is an institution now we recommend, and 
people go through the process.  So we do not appoint 
Judges at any level, but we do encourage experience, legal 
practitioners to apply for position when vacancies appear 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 131 of 316 
 
and that is the end of what we can do.  We do not go and 
sit in the selection. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And when they do that, if they are 
cadres’ loyal cadres are they not bound by the policies that 
we have read in the resolutions that we have read, that 
they are accountable to the party? 
MR MANTASHE:   I must confess that in my 10 years I 
have never seen that that took place, I have no experience 
of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think this is the context of Mr 
10 
Freund’s 
question. You 
remember, 
before 
lunch, 
you 
explained to me what we should understand when the ANC 
talks about deployment what is involved.   
There 
is 
development 
of 
cadres, 
there 
is 
deployment of cadres.  We talked about that, okay, 
preparing cadres of the ANC to be ready for various 
responsibilities in society and it is that, okay.  
So I think what Mr Freund is saying is, if we are too 
attached to the word deployment as used in this sentence, 
the same meaning that you told us before lunch, it would 
20 
seem that it is more than just encouraging practitioners to 
apply who are senior enough and experienced enough.  
I think that is what he is saying, Mr Freund, is that 
what you are saying? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Indeed. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 132 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So - and he is suggesting that there is 
some uneasiness about that if you talk about people who 
are going to be Judges.  I think that is the suggestion I am 
reading. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   The root of the matter is that Judges are 
not born, Judge. They go through a particular career 
development, until at the apex of that process, they 
become Judges.  And the reason I am saying when I was 
10 
there for ten years I have never seen Judges accounting to 
me.  Actually I cannot remember a day where I had a 
discussion with a Judge on anything.  I may be a client of a 
Judge for my sins in society, that is it.  
But I have never seen Judges come to Luthuli 
House to account, because one of the things that the ANC 
appreciate and understand is the separation of power, we 
respect that, so we do not gamble with that, we do not get 
into that space but there is nothing that stops us to say, an 
advocate acts and do not do things you have been 
20 
practicing long enough to be a Judge, apply, because there 
are these vacancies that have emerged in the various 
Courts.  
Please go and apply because you have gone 
through this process.  It means that is at the tail end of a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 133 of 316 
 
proposal - to a young person to go into law and then say, 
you must go and practice and practice, why, and he grows 
in that process and there are vacancies, there is nothing 
that stops us to say that is a progressive child.  That will 
be a progressive child, please apply.  
Sometimes others do and they fail in the process 
and we have no recourse to deal with that because it is not 
our space, others succeed and they become Judges, others 
that are very progressive when we consider them become 
very harsh Judges in dealing with us and we do not hold 
10 
that against them, the Judges they do their work and 
therefore, I do not know what is it that is peculiar about 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, I get the impression from what 
you have just said that, as a matter of fact, and to your 
knowledge, ANC deployment structures have encouraged 
people to apply for judicial office, cadres apply for judicial 
office, is that is correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you made the point that when it 
comes, for example, to the Judicial Services Commission, 
the decision lies there subject to provisions that involve 
the President as well.  
The decision really lies there to a certain point, and 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 134 of 316 
 
is it not a fact that the ANC representatives on the Judicial 
Services Commission have the power to bring about any 
decision they choose, the way the Judicial Services 
Commission is structured? 
MR MANTASHE:   I have never served for the Judicial 
Services, I do not know how it works, I know I have been a 
Premier but my understanding is that there are various 
divisions of the High Court in various provinces. The 
involvement 
of 
those 
Premiers 
is 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
appointments 
in 
the 
division 
off 
their 
province, 
and 
10 
therefore I do not think there is a block vote by an ANC 
representative in the Judicial Services Council.  I do not 
think, I have no evidence of it, I have never served there, I 
cannot give evidence. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, can I take each of page 591 
100.591. 
MR MANTASHE:   Five? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Nine, one.  
MR MANTASHE:   I have got that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, just before I ask you about 
20 
that, what I did not ask you about the last document was 
about the bodies with investigative functions.  You – it 
refers to cadres, you would say, being encouraged to apply 
for appointment to investigative functions.  What do you 
have in mind there, what sort of bodies? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 135 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   I know, in 2021, the talk of apartheid is 
seen as taboo.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Okay.  
MR MANTASHE:   What we forget is that from 1994 
onwards all this including the investigators, you find that 
they were mainly dominated by investigators from the 
previous, it was in the interest of society, to deploy people 
to change the demographics of those institutions. 
ADV FREUND SC:   To change presuming not only the 
demographics as I understand your evidence, but to 
10 
change the political orientation to ensure that political 
orientation would include people who are loyal, disciplined, 
committed of the party.  
MR MANTASHE:   I do not know if you know that in the 
negotiations for this Constitution that we are having key on 
the Nationalist Party side was the intelligence service.  So 
it means that we were dealing with an investigative 
institution, which has political orientation.  
Therefore, you would not have just leave that like 
that, and have that orientation continue.  That is why it was 
20 
important to actually change the demographics, change the 
orientation, the right, change the orientation so that it 
becomes a nonpartisan, investigative unit.  
I do not know whether you are trying to be – on the first 
one, I do not know that.  But I am seeing orientation of 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 136 of 316 
 
those institutions was necessary, and it had to be effected 
that is why we had to integrate people with various 
backgrounds in the discipline to have a new [?] 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well the issue you raise is in fact raised 
by the next document which we wish to refer you can we go 
please to page 591. 
MR MANTASHE:  I am there. 
ADV FREUND SC:  This is a meeting of the NWC I see you 
were present at this meeting that was presumably chaired by 
the then President, President Jacob Zuma and at page 592 
10 
there is a report – minutes from an NWC report. 
MR MANTASHE:  Page? 
ADV FREUND SC:  592.   
ADV FREUND SC:  You see that? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  The item on the minutes dealing with the 
NWC report which you presented and you reported amongst 
others it would appear on deployment, ANC cadres and then 
the minutes note the comments.  And in the middle of page 
592 we find the comment: 
20 
“Deploys of the ANC should always be loyal 
to the organisation.” 
Now that is a principle that you – that you stand by as I 
understand it. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
Loyalty 
to 
the 
organisation 
if 
you 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 137 of 316 
 
remember of it is necessary why do we do this I am a 
member. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes so… 
MR MANTASHE:  All the 00:01:26. 
ADV FREUND SC:  All these institutions to which you are 
recommending 
that 
application 
should 
be 
made 
for 
appointment your intention if those persons are appointed is 
that once appointed they must always remain loyal to the 
organisation. 
MR MANTASHE:  Let me give you an example that is almost 
10 
irrelevant.  Now I am a mine worker okay when I went to the 
mines I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You used to be a mine worker Mr 
Mantashe. 
MR MANTASHE:  I am a mine worker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a light note – lighter note you used to 
be a mine worker. 
MR MANTASHE:  I am a mine worker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are – you are a Minister now. 
MR MANTASHE:  I am back to being a mine worker. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:  You know a blasting certificate was 
reserved for a scheduled blast – a blasting schedule 
meaning that blacks would not blast they are not allowed.  
When the system is open it cannot be a mistake to deploy 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 138 of 316 
 
people who understand the actions of trainees to allow that.  
That applies to all the institutions in South Africa because all 
of them were from an apartheid system which regarded 
people as less of human and therefore to consciously in 
avail in that level and trained orientation cannot be a 
mistake. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But the problem is I want to put to you 
that there is a conflict between the principles of a non-
partisan Public Service and a Public Service which as a 
matter of strategy is populated insofar as you can achieve 
10 
that by persons whose loyalty is to the party.  That is exact 
antithesis of non-partisan. 
MR MANTASHE:  We – we had cadres of our movement who 
went to London and studied.  Others went to the United 
States and all of that.  And they understand that when a 
Trump was kicked out of office and a Biden comes there 
there is no hesitation in changing all the 00:04:09 in 
question and replace them with people who 00:04:11 to a 
democratic party.   
If you go to the British systems as a party’s campaign 
20 
the state dealt with the manifesto and developed programs 
that I talked to those manifestos.  Once their party was they 
shred all theirs out and implement this 00: 04:30.   
Now if I understand the question directed to me 
properly it says the non-partisanship means ANC is sleeping 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 139 of 316 
 
and hold on for life and not have any interest in a person the 
direction of terms in society which will actually talk to the 
reconstitution of the state to what it should be serving 
everybody.  We are doing this in a state that has a long 
statement.   
You know I read Domineer Smith service for me it 
was describe the works of Dr Verwoerd very well.  He says 
Dr Verwoerd was instilling a system of apartheid which had 
so deep roots that it would be impossible for future 
government to change.   
10 
Until you get involved you do not realise the depths 
of those roots.  And the question directed at me is that do 
not give out those roots they will change automatically by 
being partner – non-partisan and the luck will befall you.   
I am saying deployment and deployment of people to 
institutions has a direct intention to say that every decision 
must be transformed to serve the interest of all the society. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I wonder whether this has got 
something to do to the question has something to do with – 
with this namely whether there is any difficulty with the 
20 
notion that out of the people that the party may have 
prepared 
for 
certain 
responsibilities 
those 
that 
gets 
appointed ultimately let us say properly to certain positions 
the party will not expect loyalty to them once they have been 
appointed to those positions but it will be content with the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 140 of 316 
 
knowledge that they are – they subscribe to certain values 
and because they subscribe to certain values what they will 
do there while in those positions will not be in conflict with 
the party.  Is that something that – that notion something 
that exists? 
MR MANTASHE:  The reality Chairperson is that there are 
many examples of disappointment – many of people getting 
into positions expect to facilitate terms instead they get 
subdued to the system.   
We have many examples of that.  And that is why the 
10 
on-going effort is important otherwise the change is not 
going to happen and that is it.  So there is something that 
once you are deployed there is no Secretary General or 
Deputy Secretary General of the ANC who stand over your 
shoulders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who monitor. 
MR MANTASHE:  And monitor you.  There is no such a thing.  
The assumption in good faith is that you will appreciate the 
urgency of the need for change.  But there are cases of 
disappointment where people get there senior enough, 
20 
knowledge of enough but when they get there they get 
00:08:49 to this thing.  They get assimilated.   
And those are examples of setbacks that we should 
deal with on an on-going basis.  So there is no expectation 
that a Judge is deployed to a particular court he will hear a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 141 of 316 
 
case and come to the ANC and say I had two cases and you 
know I – I ruled in favour of this guy – we do not want that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   There is no such a thing. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now I understand particularly in the 
South African context particularly given now that the ANC 
assumes power in state of a wholly offensive previous 
disposition and I can have no difficulty I am sure the 
commission can have no difficulty with obviously be it the 
transformational objectives of the constitution and the 
10 
policies 
of 
the African 
National 
Congress 
directed 
to 
achieving 
those 
transformational 
objectives 
of 
the 
constitution.   
I want to put to you that in Section 197 of the 
Constitution which governs the Public Service it says that 
the Public – the – it governs the public administration in 
which there is a public service.  If you have a copy it might 
be opportune to have a look at it.  197.1 oh you do not have 
it – I am sorry you do not.  I will read it.  So 197.1 under the 
heading Public Service says the following: 
20 
“Within pubic administration there is a public 
service for the Republic which must function 
and be structured 
in 
terms of National 
Legislation and which must loyally execute 
the lawful policies of the government of the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 142 of 316 
 
day.” 
So there can be no controversy that the public service and 
all members of the public service have a legal obligation and 
a constitutional obligation to execute the lawful policies of 
the government of the day.   
But to say that is not to say the same thing as to say 
all 
deployees 
must 
remain 
loyal 
to 
the 
organisation 
particularly when we see as we going to see that there is a – 
there is a tension between the party quo party and the 
government quo government even though it is appointed by 
10 
the party.  That is where the problem lies I want to put to you 
if this notion of all deployees must be loyal to the 
organisation. 
MR MANTASHE:  I 00:11:38 all I say and we are dealing with 
it every day of people expecting the ANC to go and contest 
elections when the governing party but expect it to forego 
the responsibility of government.  Give it to somebody else I 
think that is the problem – that is the nub of the problem.   
So the people expect the African National Congress 
not to have a responsibility in government and go back to the 
20 
next election or next election, win the election but when it 
must govern there is an assumption that it must be a free for 
all.   
It does not happen anywhere else in the world.  It is 
expected of the ANC here it does not happen anywhere in 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 143 of 316 
 
the world when you contest the election you win the majority 
you must govern and take responsibility of governing. 
ADV FREUND SC:  In governance the party or the 
government? 
MR MANTASHE:  It is the government but the party is a 
majority government.  That is why there is a distinction 
between government and state okay.  That distinction of 
government and state is very important if you understand it 
is classical.   
Government is elected every five years it governs it 
10 
is having a state that is a tool in the hands of that governing 
party to execute the problem that win the election.  Now – 
but in South Africa there is an expression that you will need 
governance to become a government do not tamper with the 
state, do not talk to the state because if you tamper with the 
state you want it to be like you.   
Even deployed by the ANC I mean the state I must do 
the best in the state because if I do not I am actually 
demotivating the importance of a governing party to come.  I 
must do what is correct and do it to the best of my ability.  
20 
And – and that cannot be foregone and will forego the 
responsibility that goes with being the governing party. 
ADV FREUND SC:  So this non-partisan public service finds 
expression I want to put to you in Section 197.3 of the 
constitution.  That section says: 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 144 of 316 
 
“No employee of the public service may be 
favoured or prejudiced only because that 
person supports a particular political party or 
cause.” 
But it seems to me that the policy of the African National 
Congress as you describe it intends and is effective in 
populating the state with its deployees for the purposes of 
having in those positions persons accountable to the party 
not merely responsible to the government and not merely 
responsible to their government superiors. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  No. 
ADV FREUND SC:  That is the tension. 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  There is no tension like official 
tension. You want to have people in strategic positions in the 
state who understand policies of the governing party and 
who will be loyal to executing.  That is all we are interested 
in and that is why in those strategic positions not everybody 
there is an ANC member.  Not everybody is an ANC member. 
But to relate to them normal like any other senior public 
service employee but intention is that do you understand the 
20 
policy, do you understand the problem, are you executing 
that?  Because you will find a situation where people actively 
work against the policies of a governing party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But policies of the governing party get 
translated quite often into legislation as well, is it not? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 145 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that policies of the governing 
party have been translated into legislation any person 
employed in a government department where that legislation 
must be implemented whether they were deployed by the 
ANC, whether they were members of the ANC or are 
members of the ANC or not, whether they are members of 
the DA, members of the EFF once they are appointed to 
those positions and in those positions they are required to 
ensure the implementation of that legislation that is what 
10 
they must do.  Is it not? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Why? 
MR MANTASHE:  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  That is what is expected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what is expected of them yes.  Why 
is it not enough for the governing party to take the position 
that says the President of this government is our deployee 
as the governing party?  The President of this government 
20 
has appointed Ministers who are our deployees.   
It is their job in those capacities to make sure that 
their departments and employees in their departments 
implement legislation that is based on our policies and we 
are not going to deal with the officials but we will deal with 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 146 of 316 
 
the President because he is or she is whoever it is you know 
our deployee and he or she is in charge of government so we 
are not going to say members, officials must be loyal to the 
party.  They must be loyal to the government and that is 
good enough because this is our government.  Why is that 
not good enough? 
MR MANTASHE:  In practice – in practice that is what has 
happened.  But when the party sits in this conference it goes 
into details on the nitty gritty of government.   
Now the difficulty that I am having here is that we are 
10 
putting ANC policies to the commission basically putting 
policies of the ANC on trial but these are policies that 
happened in the discussion in the ANC.  I can give you an 
example.  When we sit in a meeting with the ANC we will 
spend 
hours 
discussing 
the 
difference 
between 
white 
monopoly capital and monopoly capital and those will find 
their way to documents of the ANC.   
Then you take those documents you bring them to the 
commission then you are putting that conference before the 
commission therefore policies of the ANC are on trial and 
20 
that is the little bit of a – of a problem in this situation 
because these documents that I interrogated are internal 
discussion to the ANC.  
Now if you relate them to what is happening in 
practice what you explain is what happens?  You will not 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 147 of 316 
 
have one time here in this commission I think two Ministers 
came here and said that I reported corruption in my 
department her at Luthuli House and the 00:20:20 did 
nothing okay.   
Then when we read about this we call them and say 
what did you expect the ANC to do?  Did you expect the ANC 
to walk into a department and feel this corruption in your 
department when you have authority to deal with that in your 
department.   
So in practice what you are describing is what 
10 
happened in practice but that cannot stop the ANC from 
having a detailed 
discussion in its internal structural 
meetings and have a discussion on any issue including 
governance.   
And if you take what is said in those meetings 
internal to the ANC you bring them to a commission.  You 
take those commission – those policies you put them on trial 
then you interrogate them and that is what is happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you will appreciate that the 
reason 
why 
one 
is 
looking 
at 
– 
at 
them 
and 
their 
20 
implementation is that in part the commission is trying to say 
to the extent that certain wrong things happened how did 
they come about?  What are the – was there an environment 
that facilitated the happening of those wrong things?  What 
should be done in the future to make sure that the prospects 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 148 of 316 
 
of those wrong things happening again are minimised and 
when you want to do that you then say can we do that 
without looking at the governing party?  How – how does it 
deal with certain situations?  So that is the – that is the 
context I am sure you understand. 
MR MANTASHE:  No we have no problem with being looked 
at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  With the governing party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  The issue we are raising is that in doing so 
– when there are problems I can tell you that.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  We have 00:22:23 those problems closer 
than a proper hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  We were sitting there these things happen 
in our offices you must deal with them.  But it is a different 
issue when we take policies of the government quietly put 
them 
on 
trial 
because 
when 
you 
do 
that 
objectivity 
20 
disappears and it will ultimately make the situation more.   
My misdemeanour will be attributed to the party 
whereupon but here am I – I go and steal state resources it 
is not the party that is to blame it is me and that money I do 
not steal it for the party I steal it for myself.  But if we do not 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 149 of 316 
 
draw the distinction we will end up saying it is the ANC that 
has stolen XY and Z.  But that loot is not going Luthuli 
House okay.  It has gone somewhere in another area.   
All I am saying is that in practice that is what it is. 
We do not have public servants going to Luthuli House to 
account for their work unless for 00:23:47 for example if we 
discuss an economic policy there is nothing that stops us to 
from 
asking 
people 
who 
worked 
on 
the 
economic 
reconstruction and recovery plan to come and give us insight 
on what they did.  And then there is a 00:24:03 to debate 
10 
that issue but that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  I want to primary [?] one but on 
the same page where we were 592 the very next sentence 
after the one we have looked at about the police should 
always be loyal to the organisation reads as follows: 
“The ANC should begin to provide leadership 
on the deployment of comrades.” 
MR MANTASHE:  Where is that? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Sorry it is about fifteen lines from the 
20 
bottom of 592.  It starts “The ANC should begin.” 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   
“The ANC should begin to provide leadership 
on the deployment of comrades even if it 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 150 of 316 
 
means to direct intervention.” 
Now you were the Secretary General present at this meeting 
what 
does 
that 
mean? 
 
Even 
if 
it 
means 
to 
direct 
intervention. 
MR MANTASHE:  Let me give it a broad interpretation.  I am 
Secretary General would pick up failures in the deployment 
process.  It means I must take a walk, go to the deployment 
committee, have a discussion with them and say you are not 
making regular – you are not monitoring this place please 
step up your game.  That is what it means. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  So I am not sure that I understood or 
heard you properly.  Does it mean that if – if a cadre in – 
who 
has 
been 
deployed 
somewhere 
is 
not 
properly 
performing the duty they should be told to perform it properly 
or is it if the cadre – if the deployment committee is not 
being effective it should buck up its game?  I am not quite 
clear what you saying. 
MR MANTASHE:  No I am saying the deployment committee 
of which I am not a member is Secretary General as it were 
it means irregularity, it does not monitor the space does not 
20 
even monitor 00:26:04 I have a responsibility to go to the 
00:26:04 listen monitor the advert because if you do not you 
are not going to be able to recommend anybody.  That you 
cannot be responsible for. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 151 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:  But if a cadre is deployed he is not 
performing his duty it is somebody else’ responsibility in the 
line of duty. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now we were talking a little earlier about 
its perception of a tension in between party and government.  
I want to refer you to page 593 about six or seven lines down 
there is a sentence that reads as follows: 
“It is correct to have a strong centre at the 
level of the organisation that being Luthuli 
House.” 
10 
Now what does that mean?  What is the point being made 
there? 
MR MANTASHE:  The point that is made is that it is 
important to have functional organisation.  That is what it 
means.  It means that the ANC must be functional to fulfil its 
role. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Does it not also suggest that the 
intention of the speaker who has been noted here is that the 
real 
locus 
of 
power 
is 
Luthuli 
House 
and 
not 
the 
government?  Luthuli House determines what is to be done. 
20 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
No 
you 
are 
creating 
an 
artificial 
connotation. 
ADV FREUND SC:  That is why I am asking you. 
MR MANTASHE:  No let me explain it.  Luthuli House is the 
head office of the ANC.  The ANC is a party in government.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 152 of 316 
 
So I do not know where the connotation is because this party 
is in government you see in the ANC the Secretary General, 
Deputy Secretary General and Treasury General do not go to 
government they stay in the head office of the ANC because 
it is important to have a vibrant organisation because our 
ability to govern depend on the health of the organisation 
which is our vehicle to govern.  So there is not a 00:28:30 
between 
the 
party 
and 
the 
government. 
 
We 
are 
a 
government we are in present in government and for us to be 
effective the party itself must be effective.  If you read our 
10 
documents you going to find that almost every conference 
make time to talk about organisational renewal and unit 
organisational renewal and unit.  Whether we make progress 
on that or not because it is always important to have a 
healthy and a vibrant organisation called the ANC.  So it is 
not contradiction  It is not contesting government. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright. 
MR MANTASHE:  It is a government party. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I want to move on I am very conscious of 
time.  So the next document I want to refer you to starts at 
20 
page 594 unfortunately my copy page 594 is upside down but 
you will see that that is the cover page of the NWC meeting 
in July of 2009 and that having given your bearings if I can 
take you to page 598?  And here dealing with the report on 
the North West Province and in paragraph 2.3 it is reported 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 153 of 316 
 
the local government has become ...[indistinct – audio cut] of 
the municipalities.  And then the sentence that interests 
me.  The appointment of managers – and I stress the word 
appointment. 
“The 
appointment 
of 
manager 
in 
the 
municipalities is centralised in the office of the 
Provincial Secretary...” 
 
I suspect that is a party official.   
“Thereby making it a norm that incompetent 
but loyal individuals to the dominant faction 
10 
get appointed to all strategic positions...” 
 
Now my first question arising from this is.  Does 
this not show that the reality, whatever you may have been 
telling us, is that appointment decisions are made in this 
deployment process? 
MR MANTASHE:   No.  I think what you are doing, you are 
turning a diagnoses made by the ANC itself of a problem.  
You are turning it on this side and make it a desirable 
situation of the ANC.  The ANC diagnosis this as a problem 
and therefore it must deal with it.  It must deal with it 
20 
because the problem, you can centralised the appointment 
of managers in the municipalities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is part of the report of the North 
West Province about what was happening? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 154 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But am I correct in understanding your 
last answer to mean this?  That as a matter of fact, it came 
to your attention that the appointment of managers in 
municipalities was being made by the Provincial Secretary, 
a party official? 
MR MANTASHE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And now is the problem that was being 
identified. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I do not know if it came to my 
10 
attention as Secretary General. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes.   
MR MANTASHE:   It has gone to the National Working 
Committee of the ANC.  And in diagnosing problems in that 
province, it says one of the problems is this one.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, unfortunately, you know we 
stopped at page 4.  We do not know what happened at 
page 5 or page 6 but on – is this the only example that you 
ever heard of officials being appointed to party structures?  
Officials such as managers? 
20 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
No, 
our 
understanding 
is 
that 
appointment of officials to the municipalities are done by 
municipalities.  The closest a Deployment Committee ever 
can come would be having a view on Section 56 and 57, 
annexures.  Anything below that, it is a no-go area. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 155 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now just to... [Speaker moves away 
from microphone – unclear.] ...on this issue.  If I can take 
you to page 603?  Just to get your bearings here.  Again, 
my page is unfortunately upside down but we can read for 
ourselves. 
MR MANTASHE:   What is the number again? 
ADV FREUND SC:   603, 604, 605.  You can confirm that is 
the resolutions of relevance taken at the 53 r d National 
Conference.   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, there is an index.   
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then at page 613, likewise, we 
find an extract, the relevant part of the resolutions taken at 
the ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   203? 
ADV FREUND SC:   613...  613 and 614. 
MR MANTASHE:   613 is a picture.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes and if you turn over the page, you 
will see that – you are in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
see 
yourself 
there, 
Mr Mantashe? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   I see myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you will see that above the picture 
what we are looking at is a document that is the document 
summarising ...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 156 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...or recording the decisions taken by 
the 65 t h National Conference. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, the report.  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And on the question of Cadre 
Deployment, we can read for ourselves what we see at 
614.  You can confirm that those were the decisions taken? 
MR MANTASHE:   By the resolution of the conference, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I want to take you to something 
that I am sure that will be a lot more controversial.  Page 
10 
418, 100.418.   
MR MANTASHE:   418... 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said page 100.418? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
MR MANTASHE:   418? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  It is a document on an ANC 
Secretary General’s office letterhead. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, with no signature. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, with no signature.  Quite correct. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now Chair, you will recall that at the 
commencement this morning that I said to you that we had 
put together a bundle of media reports and then I said, the 
very last page is of a different character that has been 
included for convenience at that point in the record. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 157 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is obviously not a media report and 
– but it has a relevance to a media report because this was 
widely published in the media and there were a number of 
reports.  This is, approximately, in the middle of last year 
during 2020 or something, asserting that this was a 
document prepared in the office of – or in the Thule House.  
And the Thule House issued a denial.  They said this is a 
forgery.  There is no such document.   
 
But various journalists have asserted that five 
10 
different sources within the party confirmed that this is an 
authentic document.  And I want to make clear, I do not 
know who those people are.  I cannot vouch for the 
accuracy of it but I want to hear, if I may, from you what, if 
anything, you can tell us about this document? 
MR MANTASHE:   I will have difficulties to deal with 
sources and informants in the Commission.  My gut feel – it 
is a gut feel, what I call it, any document of the ANC that 
has no signature, is not an ANC document.  [Speaker is not 
clear.]  You may issue a directive to start this.  I write a 
20 
letter.  I sign that letter.  The evidence now, it is a little – I 
– my gut feel or my first impression(?) was that, it is a 
fake.   
ADV FREUND SC:   But let us look at the content of it.  I 
mean, it is admitted – and it is obviously not signed.  And 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 158 of 316 
 
one of the media reports suggested that it was a draft to 
be submitted to a meeting.  I do not know.  But let us look 
at the content of the report. 
MR MANTASHE:   My submission is that.  It is a document 
with no signature of anybody in the ANC.  We cannot pin 
anybody down and say what is your reason of this content 
because 
anybody 
who 
issue 
correspondence 
take 
responsibility for that correspondence.  We do not have 
that correspondence.  So if it is no content to date in 2021 
or 2020, it will be fake because anybody can craft a fake 
10 
document and circulate it and make it an ANC document.  
But if it had a signature, even if you want to call it a fake, 
we will find it difficult to make it a fake.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess it is strange that it does not 
even have the position of whoever would have written it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, indeed it does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But what I would like to explore with 
your leave, Chair, is not its authenticity but the correlation 
20 
between the content and what is the views of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If I may do that. 
MR MANTASHE:   I cannot talk to contents of a fake 
document.

ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 
Well, 
let 
me 
ask 
this 
then 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   ...to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, it may be that it is a question 
of how you tried to get the information that you want to get 
which you might get without reference to the document.  
[laughs] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let me ask you this Mr Mantashe.  Is it 
or it is not compatible with the deployment policies of the 
African National Congress ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MANTASHE:   What? 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...that the following procedure should 
be followed with regard to deployment of the following 
positions, director generals, Chairperson, CEO’s and all 
board of SOE’s and the procedure is that the office of the 
Deputy Secretary General should be informed of all such 
posts prior to them being advertised and be sent the 
advertisement once they have been published and that 
thereafter what is supposed to be presented to the...  Well, 
let me stop there.  Is any of that compatible with correct 
20 
policies and procedures? 
MR MANTASHE:   I do not have the right to refuse to 
answer questions but I think I need projection here where I 
am expected to answer questions on a fake document.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Are you saying under oath that this is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 160 of 316 
 
a fake document? 
MR MANTASHE:   I am saying nobody – there is no title, 
there is no date.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not know Mr Freund whether 
you want to make any reference to the document at all as 
opposed to simply asking questions with no reference to 
the document and see whether ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, I wish to do both, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I wish, firstly, to just confirm because I 
10 
do not know which further evidence may come before the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I would definitely wanted to 
establish as a matter of fact whether Mr Mantashe is telling 
us of his personal knowledge that he knows.  We know it is 
an unsigned document.  We know it is an unnamed 
document but I want to establish as a matter of fact 
whether he was saying to us that you know this is a fake or 
that you assuming and guessing it is a fake. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   From February 2018, I was deployed to 
government.  If it was directed to deploy cadres or declare 
a comrade, I would have read it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   I would have read it.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 161 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   So that is why I regarded it as fake. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   alright.  So what you can say from 
your personal knowledge is that as a cadre who had been 
deployed, you did not receive it? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  I understand that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I have not taken the Chair today 
10 
through some of the proposing(?) documents that we have 
been 
talking 
about, 
but 
I 
want 
to 
understand 
your 
testimony about how the processes should work under the 
ANC policy when the question arises as to the appointment 
of director generals, chairpersons, CEO’s and boards of 
SOE’s.  What is the procedure that should be followed in 
your opinion having regard to the policy documents that 
you are familiar with.   
MR MANTASHE:   I am a Minister today deployed by the 
ANC.  I have appointed few deputies.  I have appointed 
20 
boards of state entities in the portfolio...  What I do, you 
see, I inform the Deployment Committee.  We are going to 
advertise this board... because you know why I do that? 
 
I do not want them at the point of actually 
interviews to say here is a cadre...  We are looking for a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 162 of 316 
 
board to come to advertise it.  We advertise in all the 
newspapers.  Everybody read papers.  We received a long 
list of applicants. Whatever structure made the selection.   
 
The structure...  Make a shortlist.  Had access to 
me(?)  I go to the Deployment Committee(?) and say:   
Listen, we are not in a state of interviewing.  Here is the 
long list.  Here is the shortlist.  [Speaker is unclear.] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, I did not hear you.  You say you 
go to the Deployment Committee and say this? 
MR MANTASHE:   I go to the Deployment Committee. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  I understand.   
MR MANTASHE:   And do that as a Minister and then I go.  
Then I ran the process myself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry but I think you may be 
skipping something that in your mind you may have thought 
you said.  When you go to them there must a purpose.  
What is the purpose? 
MR MANTASHE:   The purpose is to inform them that that 
board that they it is being filled we are in the process of 
filling it now because – Chairperson, you are not... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja? 
MR MANTASHE:   In my quest for knowledge, I tried to 
study accountings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and what is that? 
MR MANTASHE:   It was not called accounting, it was 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 163 of 316 
 
called accountants then.  One principle that I hold so dear 
is that I was never an accountant.  I could not do it.  I 
thought – I formed(?) earlier that I am not accountant 
material. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
MR MANTASHE:   I am too restless to be an accountant.  I 
learnt that it is always better for any transaction not to be 
handled by one person from the beginning to the end.  
[Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to be handled by one person? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   By one person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   From ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   From beginning to end or I think 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   From the beginning to the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   It is always well for you to get other 
opinions from what you are doing and they do this to the 
Deployment Committee as a matter of believe that their 
20 
view will help me see what is on my prime spot.  And when 
I have done that, I go back.  Then I am covered.  I run with 
the process.  Panels, interview.  We appoint.  We go to the 
Cabinet for confirmation(?).  We do that as a matter of – all 
the time.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 164 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   So what I hear you to be saying is, 
wearing your hat as a Cabinet Minister is that what you do 
is a matter of practise, is you inform you the Deployment 
Committee ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, I do. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...of vacancies, the long lists, 
shortlists, and you then invite their views.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Can I repeat that Chairperson?  I rather 
repeat it and taking your word from you.  There is a 
board...  Hence we are going to be advertising vacancies 
10 
in the board(?).  Okay?  Then after we have done that.  We 
do not ask them whether they have sent anybody.  We do 
not ask that, okay.  We advertise, we receive application.  
We compile a list of them.   
 
Out of that a team selects a shortlist.  I go to the 
Deployment Committee and say to them:  Guys, we have 
now got what we have told you about(?).  We have 
advertised.  There were a thousand applications.  Out of 
those we are looking at these ten or at these six.  
Whatever the number.  And they look at it.   
20 
 
I will never form a situation where they normally 
say:  No, do not go ahead because we want to give you a 
name.  I do not have that experience(?).  I will hear the 
situation where and so they find – how they - they say it is 
fine, okay.  Because I am careful myself in the process.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 165 of 316 
 
Having had their views, I go back and then conduct 
interviews. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My understanding of your response, 
Mr Mantashe. 
MR MANTASHE:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It suggests that – your answer is or 
should be yes to Mr Freund’s question because his 
question was whether you invite their comments and from 
what you are saying is.  When you give it to them, you say 
you have never had experience of them saying no.  So I 
10 
think usually or all the time they say it is fine but I do not 
think that ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Chairperson, in the majority of the 
cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the majority of cases. 
MR MANTASHE:   Those people ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...are not cadres of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Professionals.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  The people on the list, you 
mean. 
MR MANTASHE:   People on the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Most(?) of them are professionals. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 166 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But what I am putting to you is that 
my understanding of what you are saying is that when you 
give it to the Deployment Committee you – if they comment 
that falls within the process, within your expectation.  So 
they might comment and say:  We do not think that 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   They will give ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...leave out so and so. 
MR MANTASHE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or they might say:  No, we are happy but 
10 
you will say you just want in case they tell you something 
that you missed. 
MR MANTASHE:   Let me give an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTASHE:   One time I go there and say here are the 
five names.  And they say to me but your five candidates 
are four men and one woman.  Okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Even before you go for your interviews, 
already you have a distorted(?) picture, okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTASHE:   When they say that I take that as a 
directive for me to go to that long list, try to add qualified 
women.  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 167 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   And that is how I can go.  Then I am 
sent back in.  I go and find a woman.  And I ask the 
question.  You want me to come back when I find?  They 
say:  No, find appropriate and qualified woman and add 
them so that the list is balanced.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So the process of you going to 
them contemplates that they may comment on the list? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I presume you do not get other 
10 
political parties and ask for their comments? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I do not.  I am not a member of 
other parties. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And one you, your department report 
to you that they have taken a view as to who is the suitable 
candidate for an appointment, in certain instances that has 
to go to Cabinet.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   I go to Cabinet as a matter of practise 
all the time.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  And you as a matter of practise 
20 
never reach the stage of then going to Cabinet without first 
having come to the Deployment Committee.  That is what I 
think you told us. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, the Cabinet does not call the 
Deployment Committee. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 168 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   No. 
MR MANTASHE:   I go to the Deployment Committee. 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
You 
as 
the 
Minister 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...go to the Deployment Committee and 
seek 
the 
Deployment 
Committee’s 
perspective 
on 
a 
decision before the matter goes to Cabinet. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.   
10 
MR MANTASHE:   And you ask me if I do go to other 
parties.  I have never been invited to any interview in the 
Western Cape or in Cape Town.  I was never there.  So you 
go and explore to go and take where the day is where - I 
do not understand this affair... [Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I wanted to raise something with 
you that relates to something you said.  You said 
something along the lines that you go to the Deployment 
Committee so that if there is something that was in your 
blind spot, something that you did not see, they can alert 
20 
you to it.   
 
So I wonder whether the reason is not more than 
that because you could achieve that by going to your 
colleagues to – in government in Cabinet, you know, 
talking to them or a subcommittee.  So I am wondering 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 169 of 316 
 
whether the purpose is not more than that, namely, you are 
the Deployment Committee of the governing party.   
 
The governing party is in government and I know 
that there is a deployment programme or policy in terms of 
which people who understand the policies of the governing 
party are made ready for certain responsibilities.   
 
I want you to have a look and comment within 
the context of your job as the Deployment Committee 
before I make the final decision or before whoever has the 
power to make the decision in government makes the 
10 
decision.  Would that be unfair to say? 
MR MANTASHE:   I do think your view and comment 
seriously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   I take them seriously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, okay.  But you accept the 
context that I am saying, I am understanding your evidence 
to include that it is not just for them to look at the blind 
spots.  It is also in the context of the work of the 
Deployment Committee. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   I am giving you the example of where 
they sent me back ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...because I had one woman in the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 170 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   I took that quite seriously because one 
of the things that I can tell you is that the views of the 
Deployment Committee is that black South Africans are 
educated.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTASHE:   Highly educated.  They have been 
deprived for a long time.  Today half the time, they are not 
affirmed.  They are appointed to positions where they 
qualify today.  But the narrative is that, we deployed them 
because we love them.  The reality of the matter is that...   
10 
 
You know, a few days ago I met a board of an 
entity in the department.  In that board of eight, not a 
single member of that board is a less than a master ’s 
degree qualification.  Not because – I look at them and 
they said h’m, huh?   
 
And that shows that the conscience management 
of change is beginning to give us concrete results because 
black South Africans are now educated.  They have 
accumulated 
experience. 
 
They 
are 
qualified 
to 
be 
appointed in positions, not as a favour because they 
20 
qualify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Mr Mantashe, you are familiar 
or at least with the evidence given by Ms Barbara Hogan 
before this Commission. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 171 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And Chair... [Speaker moves way from 
microphone – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not speak too far from the mic. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I have it as Exhibit L-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   L-1? 
MR MANTASHE:   Bundle what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR MANTASHE:   When I look this way, I am looking for 
10 
help.   
ADV FREUND SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR MANTASHE:   I am familiar with her ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, you are familiar with it.  I am 
obviously only going to take you to very brief portions of it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we going to come back to this 
bundle soon? 
ADV FREUND SC:   We are going to come back to that file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay.  What page do 
you...? 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   I want to start at page 4 of the file of 
Ms Hogan’s affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And just to get your bearings as to 
time, amongst other things.  If you look at paragraph 9 on 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 172 of 316 
 
page 4, you will see that Ms Hogan says that she was 
appointed as the Minister of Public Enterprises on the 
11 t h of May 2009 after serving in other capacities.   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then I want to take you to 
paragraph 22.  Ms Hogan says this.  She is referring to, in 
particular, the appointments of CEO’s of a variety of SOE’s 
and she refers to them in paragraph 21.  And she has 
previously described a process which she regards as an 
appropriate process that results in a provisional selection 
10 
of potential SOE’s. 
 
And then she says in paragraph 22 the following: 
“In practise, however, there were parallel 
behind the scene process. 
As the ruling party, the ANC had expectations 
that they would have influence over who were 
– 
who 
was 
appointed 
to 
boards 
via 
the 
Deployment Committee of the ANC...” 
 
Now let us just stop right there.  Do you dispute 
here evidence that the ANC had expectations that they 
20 
would have influence over who was appointed to boards by 
the Deployment Committee? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I before I dispute that.  Let me make 
a point that a beneficiary of the deployment process all 
decided see it as behind the scene process.  That is my 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 173 of 316 
 
problem 
because 
that 
deployment 
process 
deployed 
Barbara as a Minister.  Now all of a sudden you want to 
appropriate to herself as well.  I think that is a distortion of 
policy in my view.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Do you admit or deny that the ANC had 
expectations or they would have influence over who was 
appointed to board via the Deployment Committee of the 
ANC?  It is either yes or a no. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, you are asking me the same 
question again, there is a deployment committee in the 
10 
[indistinct – dropping voice].  We have gone into details 
explaining its role and how it works.  So what do you want 
me to say now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think, Mr Mantashe, you remember 
that – and I think you repeated that day that I think you had 
some – I think serious disagreement with some of Ms 
Hogan’s 
evidence 
about 
the 
work 
of 
the 
deployment 
committee of the ANC when she testified and you came and 
testified about it to put the side of the ANC as far as the 
deployment policy I think was concerned.  So I think what Mr 
20 
Freund is trying to establish, which parts of her evidence you 
have no problem with, which parts you have a problem with 
so that when I have to look at the matter I do not have to 
speculate whether this was disputed or was not disputed. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 174 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   No, Deputy Chief Justice, there is a 
detailed submission on Barbara Hogan’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MANTASHE:   Now if I am expected to give that 
evidence again… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   First thing, there is a [indistinct] 01.44 
begin to [indistinct] 01.48 that there is a trap in this.  They 
want to check if I am not going to say something different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Then I am accused of submitting a 
contradictory evidence to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no, I think it is fair to say to 
the extent that you have dealt with it, there is no need for us 
to deal with it again.  So, Mr Freund, I think you must just 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, I fully respect the spirit of that.  
The difficulty I have is that I was not present and I have not 
read that evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   So I am not in a position to know.  I 
have to be guided by you as to whether you feel it is 
unnecessary for me to explore this issue in full. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I – maybe what we should do it 
insofar as you wanted him to deal with Ms Hogan’s evidence 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 175 of 316 
 
as far as deployment is concerned …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is all I am interested in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe until you have had a chance to 
read that evidence maybe you should park that.  If 
necessary, he can come back to deal with it if there is 
something can clarify so that you can see where they have 
common cause and do not have common cause. 
MR MANTASHE:   It is quite an important. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   This is [indistinct] 03.03 because the 
10 
allegation about Gama and all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Which were responded to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   If we are expected to respond again today 
then we become nervous. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  There is a part which I do not think 
was dealt with then but I think if we are going to park it I 
would need to check whether it was not covered as well 
before we can look at it again, ja. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, the difficulty, with respect, is that 
it make it necessary to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Whereas the questions were confined to 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 176 of 316 
 
the deployment issue.  Now if you think it is unfair to the 
witness to be asked about the same issue twice then I will 
not do that but we do have to consider the consequence 
because the consequence may well be that we have to come 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, I do not think he will have a 
problem with coming back. 
MR MANTASHE:   I have no problem with coming back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, as long as …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   I am just expressing a sense of 
10 
nervousness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   In a case where you are called to the 
Commission, you give your evidence, you make your 
submission, you settle that issue, you close it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, that is fair enough. 
MR MANTASHE:   There is no matter arising out of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   But we are expected to rehash that 
submission.  That is where my nervousness comes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fair enough, I think 
…[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   Because to us there is a Commission, 
who was present when and who is present now is not an 
issue, there is one Commission …[intervenes] 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 177 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say the Chair was the same? 
MR MANTASHE:   The Chairperson was the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Let us to do that.  Mr 
Mantashe has indicated he will not have a problem to come 
back if it is necessary to deal with whatever may arise once 
you have checked and compared. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is fine, Chair, and then I will not 
need to deal with that file any further and I will go back to 
the file that we were in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I am now going to ask a very 
different line of examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I would like to take you firstly, 
please, to page 100.45. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we going to the other bundle? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The other bundle, the bundle 100. 
MR MANTASHE:   100. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Point 45, four five.  Really moving 
away, Chair, from the question of deployment, I am moving 
20 
back to the question of parliamentary oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is fine. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I might indicate both to you, Chair, 
and Mr Mantashe …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   45? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 178 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   45, yes.  It seems to me the question of 
parliamentary oversight, the question of ANC oversight 
intercept, they overlap, so I will be dealing with [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja, no, no.  I think they do 
because the ANC is the majority party in parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now according to this press report – 
now, Mr Mantashe, let me make clear, if I understand the 
press reports are not evidence on their own, proving the 
truth of what they are saying, they are simply pieces of 
10 
paper, recording what some journalist wrote down but 
sometimes, quite often, what they say may well be true and 
so I am going to take you through a number of these reports 
in order for you to tell us to what extent you can confirm or 
deny or comment on a number of things we see in these 
press reports. 
 
And the first press report that I want to refer you to 
is this one which is dated 22 May 2009. 
MR MANTASHE:   What page is that? 
ADV FREUND SC:   At 45, 100.45.  It is headed ANC 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The page that he mentioned at the 
beginning, Mr Mantashe, I think that is the one you should 
be having in front of you, page 100.45.  She will assist you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Mantashe, if you look at that report 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 179 of 316 
 
you will see it is dated the 22 May 2009.  Do you see that? 
MR MANTASHE:   May...? 
ADV FREUND SC:   May 22, 2009. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Because what I am going to try and do 
is I am going to try and move chronologically.  So this is very 
early point in this series of years we are going to go through 
but this is a convenient starting point and the report quotes 
you as saying that – because this is the beginning of the new 
parliament in 2009 and quote you as saying that – well, it 
10 
says this: 
“The ANC has given its MPs strict instructions to be 
robust and not to be afraid of holding cabinet 
ministers to account for their actions.” 
It says the names of Chairpersons of the National Assembly 
were announced and then it says that: 
“Party Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said MPs 
and Committee Chairpersons had been told to keep 
cabinet ministers on their toes.  The committees were 
given a simple message, we are expecting an activist 
20 
parliament, a parliament that is robust with its 
oversight role, a parliament that will force the 
executives to account, a parliament that will not wait 
for the opposition to raise issues.” 
So my first question to you is, are you correctly quoted?  Is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 180 of 316 
 
that what you said? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, I am correctly quoted. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now what prompted you to feel the 
need to make that kind of statement?  Did you have a 
perception that perhaps in the past it had not been as good 
as that or what was the context that gave rise to these 
comments? 
MR MANTASHE:   I was the Secretary General of the ANC 
during a phase that is regarded as a young democracy.  In 
that process we will observe a number of things.  Sometimes 
10 
MPs want to comply for the sake of complying and we 
thought that a parliament must be an activist parliament.  
That is still haunting me up to today because it can mean 
anything and many things to the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
But what we wanted to do was to have a parliament that is 
robust and activist in its approach including oversight, that 
was what prompted us.  We intend to re-orientate parliament 
and have a different orientation and you will notice that we 
also changed the Chief Whip.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   You will notice that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You also changed what? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The Chief Whip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the Chief Whips, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Changed the Chief Whip. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 181 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Because we wanted a leader who would 
whip the parliamentarians into activity. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And who was that new Chief Whip at 
that time? 
MR MANTASHE:   Jackson Mthembu. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Jackson Mthembu.  This is in 2009? 
MR MANTASHE:   I will think so. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, I think Jackson Mthembu became 
Chief Whip in about 2017 unless he served two terms. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may be wrong, I am under the 
impression too that he did not start to be Chief Whip that 
early. 
MR MANTASHE:   But not 2017. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, but if I can assist you.  There may 
be things I do not know but what I do know is that in about 
March of 2016 Mr Jackson Mthembu was appointed as Chief 
Whip and that of course was at a time, we are going to come 
to it later, that was a time of deep national controversy about 
state capture but the time that we are talking about here, is 
20 
long before that. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay, let me withdraw that [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   That culmination of change of the Chief 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 182 of 316 
 
Whip was part of this process. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Of changing parliament into an activist 
parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, we are out of sequence but since 
you mention it and to avoid me forgetting it, I would like to 
just explore what you are telling us now.  I hear you to be 
saying that at a certain moment – and I suspect it was at a 
moment that the allegations about state capture would be 
becoming quite widely publicised, are you saying there was a 
10 
deliberate decision to change the Chief Whip and to 
introduce as the Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu? 
MR MANTASHE:   The decision was to change the 
orientation of parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Change the orientation? 
MR MANTASHE:   You can actually deal with issues and not 
shy away from issues. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I am interested in when that would 
be because if my information is correct, and other evidence 
has been led on this, Mr Jackson Mthembu became Chief 
20 
Whip in or about March of 2016. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay, leave that but the concept of an 
activist parliament come much earlier. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, yes and no.  You are quite right 
that your own statement that I have quoted here, which is a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 183 of 316 
 
2009 statement, is what you could call an activist parliament 
statement.  I accept that.   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But you will be aware, I am sure, that 
there has been some controversy in the evidence before this 
Commission about whether in a period later than this 
parliament vigorously did what it should have done and I am 
very interested in what you have been telling us.  You 
volunteered it a moment ago that there was, as it were, a 
decision, a conscious decision to make parliament more 
10 
activist and I think, if I understood you correctly, but you will 
correct me if I am wrong, I got the impression that at a stage 
when the state capture allegations were quite clamant, a lot 
of people were making a lot of noise about it, I understood 
you to say at that time there was a conscious decision which 
coincided with the appointment of Jackson Mthembu as Chief 
Whip to make parliament more activist.  Now I do not want to 
put words in your mouth, if that is not correct, you must 
please correct me. 
MR MANTASHE:   No.  You see, because now we are 
20 
dealing with the media statement.  It is very difficult to be 
chronological, with simply a statement.  Is that we take a 
conscious 
decision 
to 
make 
parliament 
more 
activist 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2009. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 184 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   2009 and I would say it was an 
orientation of the new term which started 2008 and that 
orientation was intended to activate parliamentarians not to 
be docile and be unresponsive to issues and that process 
took its time and later on the appointment of Jackson 
Mthembu was part of a long process. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  And, I mean, it is fair enough that 
you take me back to 2009 because that is where I am simply 
going to start but let us just try and orientate ourselves 
politically.  This is early in the Jacob Zuma presidency and it 
10 
is part of a transformation that is happening at that time, am 
I right? 
MR MANTASHE:   Without the allegations against Jacob 
Zuma, he had two terms, okay, he had two terms.  As the 
Secretary General at the time, I regard the first term as 
successful, which will include 2009.   
 
He effected a number of changes which were 
positive.  One of those was to restructure education, split 
into two because it was two [indistinct] 16.10 department 
including introducing the [indistinct] 16.18 programme in the 
20 
state, we got very aggressive.  He made many things that 
were positive.  That first term, in my own view, was quite 
active first term.  That is why we could talk of an activist 
parliament and by 2009 there was no call for state capture. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ja, that is correct but it did not take 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 185 of 316 
 
long to come, as we are going to get to.  Now perhaps I 
should try to move on.  Can I take you to page 100.48?   
MR MANTASHE:   48? 
ADV FREUND SC:   48. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund, maybe let me just 
ask this question, Mr Mantashe, with reference to what you 
had in mind when you talk about an activist parliament, when 
you talk about in this quotation where you talked about 
members of parliament who would be robust and hold the 
executive account.  Would I be correct to understand that to 
10 
mean they should not have an attitude that says because 
this is an ANC minister and I am ANC member of 
parliament I must not take up issues in terms of oversight 
and accountability even if he is going to be upset with me, 
he is going to be angry with me as long as I am doing my 
job? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, Chair, I do not think the issue should 
be bad attitude.  The attitude is to say there is the 
executive, they have responsibilities, they have duties, they 
must do them to the best of their abilities.  There is 
20 
parliament, parliament must not be restrained because 
ministers happen to come from a party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Those parliamentarians should do their 
work. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 186 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The way they are supposed to do it. 
MR MANTASHE:   The way they are supposed to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   And, if you remember, I made a point 
that says there is a contradictory situation where ANC 
parliamentary sits in study(?) of the ANC.  The minister 
goes and joins them.  Tomorrow they go to the portfolio 
committee.  It was not compromised then that they were in 
the study group together.  When they go to the portfolio 
committee they must execute their work to the best of their 
10 
ability.  That was the orientation what we were starting to 
work on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
ADV FREUND SC:   But that implies, does it not, that if in 
the judgment of the ANC MP of a portfolio committee there 
is something going wrong in the department for which the 
minister is accountable for, the duty of the MP is to take 
that up with the minister, to consider the minister ’s 
response and if the minister ’s response is regarding as 
unsatisfactory, 
to 
indicate 
that 
it 
is 
regarded 
as 
20 
unsatisfactory.  Would you accept that? 
MR MANTASHE:   That is the duty of the portfolio 
committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  And the duty of the portfolio 
committee would go further.  If they are not getting – if the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 187 of 316 
 
portfolio committee members experience that concerns that 
they are raising with the minister or with the DG are not 
being satisfactorily addressed, their duty as MPs and as a 
portfolio committee is to take that further, is it not?  
Presumably that the first instance to take it to the National 
Assembly, bring it to the attention of the full parliament.  
Would you agree? 
MR MANTASHE:   My short experience in parliament, I do 
not have depths of experiences, I am more a party head 
than a parliamentarian. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   I would never dare to accuse you of 
that. 
MR MANTASHE:   Come again? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I would never dare to accuse you of 
that. 
MR MANTASHE:   I am a party head than a parliamentarian.  
So 
my 
experience, 
short 
experience 
is 
that 
portfolio 
committees do their work, they bring reports to the – there 
are periods in parliament where they report on findings on 
various issues and that should be normal. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   And it would not be wrong for portfolio 
committees to in their reports indicate what is wrong and 
what in their view should be done to correct it.  Do you agree 
with that? 
MR MANTASHE:   Let me agree with you, qualify my 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 188 of 316 
 
agreement as follows.  One of the things that I think is not 
helpful 
is 
a 
hostile 
relationship 
between 
a 
portfolio 
committee and a minister.  It is not working.  Actually it 
collapses, the work of that portfolio.  It is important for the 
portfolio committee to be robust, rough, hard but seek to get 
solutions to problems and try to nudge that member of the 
executive to execute the task in a way that will give results 
and if we can find that – we do not normally find that, we 
sometimes get it right, sometimes we do not get it right but 
that would be optimal for parliament. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I understand – I think what your 
answer amounts to is there will be nothing wrong with that 
because it should be a job. 
MR MANTASHE:   There is nothing wrong with a portfolio 
committee that is harsh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   On a minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is my point. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   But I am qualifying it by saying do not 
destroy relations because destruction of relations destroy 
the work of the portfolio. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Of course I guess that allied 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 189 of 316 
 
to what you are saying would be when members of the 
portfolio committee are robust and maybe are critical of the 
minister 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
minister ’s 
department, 
the 
minister, if he or she has the right attitude, that they are 
just doing their job, there should not be a problem with that 
but there would be a problem of course if the minister 
takes the view that but you are ANC, why are you behaving 
like the opposition and therefore thinks that it is improper 
for members of the committee who are members of the ANC 
to be robust. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   I can tell you that the experiences that 
witness were the attitude is not with the ministers, you find 
a chairperson of a portfolio committee who just talks down 
to a minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   That we have oversight, like over you,  
how shall I do this, that we wanted [indistinct – dropping 
voice]. 
 All 
those, 
whether 
the 
attitude 
is 
from 
the 
chairperson of the portfolio committee or the minister, a 
hostile relationship …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does not assist. 
MR MANTASHE:   Make that portfolio to be supportive. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I presume the same principles 
apply, for example, where a DG or a similar functionary is 
part of the process of accountability to the portfolio 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 190 of 316 
 
committee.  Your view would be the committee should, where 
appropriate, take up issues of concern, if necessary – 
stress, if necessary, they may have to be confrontational but 
in first instance they should try to cooperate to resolve 
problems. 
MR MANTASHE:   The DG or the officials of the department 
go to the portfolio committee on the work happening in the 
department.  The primary relation is with the minister.  When 
the minister is not available, then the officials are sent to 
the portfolio committee or when issues are technical, the 
10 
minister takes the technical [indistinct] 25.22 to the portfolio 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   And to me, it should be a relationship 
with the institution rather than a DG or a minister.  The 
primary relationship should be anchored(?) with the minister. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Because the minister is ultimately 
accountable. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the minister is accountable, the 
20 
government 
is 
accountable 
through 
the 
minister 
to 
parliament. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course if the portfolio committee 
had a meeting with the DG of the department or a series of 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 191 of 316 
 
meetings to discuss and deal with various issues and they 
are not satisfied, there are immediate remedies to talk to the 
minister to say we are not happy with the answers we are 
getting from your DG. 
MR MANTASHE:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  So there does not 
seem to be very little difference between us at this stage on 
the principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes but I think at some stage – I 
10 
hope at some stage we can talk about to what extent this 
approach, as you articulated as quoted in these reports in 
2009, of what the ANC expected of members of parliament., 
to what extent was it implemented. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is the position that it may have been 
implemented up to a certain point and at a certain point 
something else happened which did not reflect this?  So at 
some stage I think it will be important that we do that 
because on the face of it, what you are saying, Mr Mantashe, 
20 
in terms of what you expect as the ANC from your members 
of parliament in terms of oversight and accountability 
appears to be what one expects but the question will be, to 
what extent has it been happening over the years.  But we 
are at four o’clock and we should one, take an adjournment, 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 192 of 316 
 
but also have some discussion so that we are all on the 
same page about how much more time we are going to take, 
so …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, can I indicate? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Firstly, that I have established that the 
latest flight that leaves for Cape Town is at twenty past 
seven or something like that, which would mean I would 
need to be at airport, if I was going to catch a flight today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   At about twenty past six, which would 
mean I need to finish by about five or something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I do not think that it is likely that we 
will finish that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What I have no objection to doing and 
this has been discussed with Mr Mantashe, is therefore 
going quite late and then I would maybe catch an 
aeroplane in the morning but I do want to caution in this 
20 
respect, that the very question you have just raised as an 
abstract general question is a long and complicated issue 
and that in addition I still have in mind to go through parts 
of Mr Mantashe’s principal affidavit and Mr Magashule’s 
principal affidavit.  In other words, what I am saying is, I 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 193 of 316 
 
am personally prepared to work as late as you like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But we do need to stare in the face the 
possibility that no matter how we go we may not finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand that.  For me it is quite 
important that the issues – these issues be dealt with properly 
because to the extent that there may have been failures – and 
I am not saying that there were, to the extent that there may 
have been failures in terms of oversight and holding the 
executive accountable by parliament and that is why certain 
10 
things happened which should not have happened, it will be 
important to see what measures should be put in place or I 
should recommend should be put in place to avoid a repeat 
of those things and the majority are critical because if they 
are on board on saying we recognise that there were certain 
challenges and this is what we would like to – I would like 
to see oversight function performed and it is an acceptable 
way, if they are on board there is a good chance that 
whatever recommendations are made, if accepted, it would 
work because then they would actively support.  I am not 
20 
saying that I would not recommend something that they do 
not like but certainly the idea would be, if it is possible to 
reach a point where they are on board with what the 
problem was, how it can be solved, what measures can be 
put in place, that could go a long way to assist. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 194 of 316 
 
 
So, Mr Mantashe, in terms of your time, how is your 
situation? 
MR MANTASHE:   Today? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, today. 
MR MANTASHE:   It ends at 12 midnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Okay, no then I am 
happy.  So in that event then I think we should take a ten 
minutes adjournment and then we will come back.  I 
suspect that in the light of that answer and your saying 
that there is still quite a lot to cover, we must work on the 
10 
basis that we are going to sit for quite some time. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Quite some time, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.  Let us take ten 
minutes break.  It is ten past – no, it is five past.  We will 
resume at quarter past four.  Okay, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Chair I think I have 
established during the break that it is not correct that Mr 
20 
Mantashe has previously testified in response to Ms 
Hogan’s evidence, and I am only interested in evidence in 
respect of Cadre Deployment.   It is correct that in 2018 he 
sent two documents containing as it were his version, his 
evidence, but to the best of my knowledge he has never 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 195 of 316 
 
testified and that means we could leave it over if you wish 
or we can go back and deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think he did testify in response to 
Ms Barbara Hogan, or was it only in writing?  Oh, okay, 
okay, so I am wrong.  I seem to have a picture of him 
sitting there giving evidence in the previous venue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, he did that, but he didn’t do that 
on this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was it in regard to ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   The banks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The banks, oh that was in regard to the 
banks, not in regard to Ms Barbara Hogan. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, and your memory is not faulty in 
the sense that you would have read his version you would 
have known what he says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But the only point that I make, is that 
he hasn’t testified orally on that and I leave it to your 
discretion as to whether you think it’s necessary and 
appropriate…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no if he’s ready to – is able to 
deal with questions that might relate to that we can deal 
with it.  If he – he is not because he didn’t think it would 
be covered then we can look at another day, Mr Mantashe, 
you’ll  be able to…[intervenes]. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 196 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   I’m happy to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I’m still hoping we’re going to finish 
tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So, can I take you back then, Chair, 
and Mr Mantashe, back to that file with Ms Hogan’s 
evidence which is Exhibit L1…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t know why, Mr Mantashe, I seem 
to have a picture of you sitting on the witness chair and 
10 
talking about the deployment policy and so on, so – but 
there is no way you would forget if you covered that part of 
the …[intervenes]. 
MR MANTASHE:   I doubt so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, Mr Mantashe, you will recall in 
this file that I have already asked you a question about, 
paragraph 22 at page 6, I’m not going to repeat that but 
what I’d like to do is take you to paragraph 35 at page 
10…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Bundle we are looking at is the 
one written Exhibit L1 evidence Bundle of Ms Barbara 
Hogan? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   File 1 of 2, okay, alright. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 197 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, I want to try to deal with this 
extremely briefly because I understand – I’ve seen Ms 
Hogan’s version, I’ve read your version, I don’t want to 
spend a lot of time on this, but I do think we need to 
explore this, just a bit.  You will be aware that Ms Hogan 
was critical about the pressure that she felt she came 
under in relation to appointments of Board’s and CEO’s 
and the like of SOE’s and some of her evidence relates to 
her relationship with the President, there’s no need for me 
to deal with that now but some of her evidence relates to 
10 
the very issue of deployment – National Deployment 
Committee and deployment committees and Deployment 
Policies and so, what Ms Hogan says, is, as I mentioned 
before the adjournment, that her perception was the ANC 
expected that her influence over who was appointed to the 
Boards, that’s not the same thing as saying, expected to 
have an opportunity to encourage candidates to apply.  
She’s alleging that there were expectations to have 
influence through the Deployment Committee on what these 
appointments would be and – I don’t remember but I think 
20 
you didn’t really want to answer that question, the time 
that I first asked it, so could you just, for the record, just 
remind me what your view is on that point? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, not my own view, the relationship 
between the Minister and the Deployment Committee, is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 198 of 316 
 
the same there was nothing new and unique in how the 
committee related to Ms Hogan. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, and I think she would agree with 
you on that but where she differs from you is what that 
relationship is.  Her allegation is that the relationship is 
not 
one, 
as 
you 
say 
of 
merely 
training 
and 
then 
encouraging persons to apply but was one of pressurising 
the persons responsible for making the decisions, do you 
dispute that? 
MR MANTASHE:   I dispute that, I think we can deal with 
10 
that more appropriately when we go to the Gama case, 
which is – she signs as a case in point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, let’s do exactly that if I can take 
you to paragraph 35. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Page 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 10. 
MR MANTASHE:   Page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Page 10 paragraph 35.  Now, I don’t 
20 
want to, laboriously go through the detail of her affidavit 
but in brief summary, what I understand her to say is this.  
There was a properly structured process by the Transnet 
Board, 
the 
object 
of 
which, 
was 
to 
select 
suitable 
candidates. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 199 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chief Executive Officer if I recall 
correctly.  A judgement call that she thought to be correct.  
There was, on the other hand, the potential candidacy of 
Mr Gama.  Mr Gama, as I understand it and from what I 
read, a Senior Executive of a Transnet subsidiary, at that 
very time facing disciplinary charges which, in due course, 
were found to have sufficient substance to justify his 
dismissal and Ms Hogan thought, in those circumstances, 
the proper thing to do is to go with the appointment view of 
10 
the Board, the selection decision of the Board.  That’s the 
context in which we read what we see at paragraph 
35…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you proceed Mr Freund, 
just to make sure that the context is accurate, I don’t think 
it’s going to make a difference to – it should make a 
difference to the answer.  To the extent that you want to 
ask Mr Mantashe about alleged pressure that certain 
persons, including Mr Mantashe were alleged to have made 
or reported to have made with regard to saying Mr Gama 
20 
should be appointed as Group CEO of Transnet.  As I 
recall, that happened at a time when he was not yet facing 
disciplinary inquiries but there were investigations which 
could lead to disciplinary process, of course, later on there 
was a disciplinary hearing and he was dismissed. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 200 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   I stand corrected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, at the time the position was that Mr 
Gama 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
candidates 
that 
were 
interviewed and there were a number of other candidates 
and the Board of Transnet had chosen a candidate that 
was not Gama and I think Gama was dissatisfied but I 
think, just to contextualise that, ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Fair comment, I’ll accept that without 
reservation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, with that qualification, that’s the 
background, I just want to take you to paragraph 35. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, the root is that on this issue Ms 
Hogan is mistaken, I was not …[intervenes]. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Speak into the microphone. 
MR MANTASHE:   I was not in the Deployment Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   I was not in the Deployment Committee 
that is number one.  Ms Hogan came voluntarily to brief 
officials of the ANC of the processes in Transnet.  In the 
20 
course of that brief, what she calls pressure is a question 
on my part that what makes Mr Gama not to qualify for 
CEO of Transnet.  He has been a CEO of Portnet, he 
turned it around from red to black.  He was transferred to 
Spoornet, he turned it around from red to black.  What 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 201 of 316 
 
would require a young professional to be confirmed to be 
Group CEO, that was a question.  It was a painful question 
I would imagine because we were conscious of this issue 
of being given a white candidate.  One would think that 
there’s an opportunity to appoint a black candidate and we 
didn’t put any pressure, we asked those questions and 
those questions stood for a long time, Gama was not 
appointed by then and the later charges and cases have 
nothing to do with this issue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No,  I hear you and I’m not in a 
10 
position to dispute anything you say but what I find 
puzzling is that you say this is a process outside of the – 
consulting the Deployment Committee, this is a process of 
consulting yourself as Secretary General and I don’t know, 
who else…[intervenes]. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, officials, she came to the meeting of 
the officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the top six. 
MR MANTASHE:   Top six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Officials are the top six. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   She was not invited or present to come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   She offered to come, I would imagine – 
I’m now assuming that she wanted to get to the top six to 
take off the pressure that she thought she was under. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 202 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, well maybe let me say this, Mr 
Mantashe because it becomes important.  You said that the 
question that you put to her as officials of the ANC related 
to what it is going to be a young, I think, black professional 
to be eligible or qualified to take CEO position as opposed 
to a white professional.  Now, that’s quite important in this 
question because you may be having in mind or you may, 
as officials of the ANC then have been working on the 
basis that it was the Board had preferred a white candidate 
but in terms of the evidence that she gave, that is Ms 
10 
Hogan, it was at a time where the Board had referred a 
black candidate to Mr Gama.  Were the officials aware of 
that 
because 
that’s 
part 
of 
what 
I 
was 
concerned 
about…[intervenes]. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is part of the confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   Because at the time there was a white 
candidate, that tried to ask the DFC to …[indistinct] to 
…[indistinct] we can’t have …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we can – that candidate was an 
20 
acting CEO, I think that you are talking about. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Welsh. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, and we were worried about that and 
we asked the question.  The question that there was 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 203 of 316 
 
another 
black 
candidate 
who 
emerged 
was 
a 
later 
development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well it’s important that, ultimately, 
one knows exactly what was known to the officials or not 
because the process was – happened in two phases.  
There was a recruitment process conducted by the Board, 
where Mr Gama was one of the candidates for the position 
of Group CEO and another candidate was Mr Pravin 
Gordhan and there were other candidates.  The candidate 
that the Board wanted there was Mr Gordhan, but he 
10 
withdrew at an early stage, early in 2009 and the Board 
was allowed to start the process afresh.  So, it didn’t go 
back to the candidates who had not been successful, but it 
allowed that they could apply.  Then there was a second 
phase and Mr Gama were also a candidate in that second 
phase and that second phase, the candidate that the Board 
preferred and recommended was a black candidate it was 
not Mr Gama and Ms Barbara Hogan said she supported 
that decision of the Board to recommend that one, but she 
said, if I recall correctly, she said in the media there were 
20 
all kinds of pressures for Gama and so on.  Does that 
accord with your – the officials understanding at the time? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I’m remembering this question 
because I personally asked it, that’s why she sends me a 
mail including the Secretariat General Gwede Mantashe. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 204 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   He is specifically the reason …[indistinct 
– dropping voice] because I asked this question which, 
until I could see the gaps of this agreement, I thought it 
was an innocent and logical question.  Here is this young 
professional 
working 
for 
Transnet 
he’s 
given 
a 
responsibility by Transnet to turn around Portnet and it did 
turn around because there was a Spoornet that was 
struggling, he is sent to Spoornet to turn it around and he 
turns it around and they ask them what is it that is required 
10 
of a black candidate to be confirmed to be Group CEO of 
Spoornet.  To me that question has never been answered 
up to today, leave that it was a pressure on Ms Hogan, but 
to me that question was never answered and it’s a very 
important question in the sense that our power as Minister 
– I can say our now I’m a Minister to actually have a 
particular dislike of individual people who are potential, 
who are a good in what they are doing, to not like them.  I 
think it’s something that should be watched very closely, I 
think this is a case in point because it can be a question of 
20 
like or dislike.  Black excellence must be recognised, I 
insist on that then, I insist on that today that black 
excellence and black capability must be recognised, and I 
asked the question that was based on the capability and 
the proven performance.  How that became a pressure on 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 205 of 316 
 
Ms Hogan, is still an issue that has not been told to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my – am I correct to say your 
concern was more in terms of giving opportunities to black 
professionals as opposed to – it’s just Gama, if it was 
another black person…[intervenes]. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
I 
would 
have 
raised 
that 
question…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have raised the same 
question? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because that leads me to the question, 
one of the things that was of concern to me when I listened 
to the evidence and looked at the documentation, there are 
also newspaper cuttings that you would have come across 
in the file, was did the people who were reported to be 
pushing for Mr Gama to be the one to be appointed, have 
any issue with a black candidate that the Board had 
recommended and there seems to be nobody saying there’s 
any problem with that candidate. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is a later development. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is a later development but think of 
this, 
Chairperson, 
let’s 
say 
the 
selection 
process, 
[indistinct], 
is 
number 
one, 
Gama 
number 
two 
and…[intervenes]. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 206 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No actually, he was not number two in 
terms of the Board’s list, we have got that evidence. 
MR MANTASHE:   No on the three first submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the first one as well. 
MR MANTASHE:   He was number two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, on the evidence, I don’t know 
outside of the evidence.  The Chairperson of that Board 
was a Mr Frederick Maswana, he is now – because the 
Commission made the investigation, he now lives, I 
understand, in Denmark or something.  We pursued to find 
10 
out from him, exactly what the position is and one of the 
points he made in his affidavit, which the Commission has, 
is that there was this idea that Mr Gama was number two, 
there was no such thing, he was not number two. 
MR MANTASHE:   So, you could imagine if there was that 
confusion in all that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   With even that confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   But the question I asked, specifically to 
20 
Ms Hogan, which is captured here as pressure is, what 
does it take for a black professional to qualify to be a 
Group CEO of Transnet if he has turned two subsidiaries 
around and the answer to that question has not been given 
to me and I won’t pursue it with anybody now and many 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 207 of 316 
 
things that have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m I can also mention this, for what it’s 
worth.  The documentation that is in the possession of the 
Commission, and it’s not evidence that Ms Barbara Hogan 
gave, reveals that Mr Weltz was acting CEO at the time put 
in his application for this position but it lasted only for a 
few days, I think he withdrew it, that is in the first phase.  
So, for a long time as the process was going on it seems 
that he was no longer a candidate because he felt that he 
was being accused that he was pushing a disciplinary 
10 
process against Mr Gama because he wanted him – to 
disqualify him from competing with him for the position.  
The documentation that I’ve seen suggested his application 
was there only for a few days and he withdrew it but of 
course, you know, one doesn’t know how much of this was 
known to those who may have said, Mr Gama should be the 
one appointed, Okay, alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If I may ask a question that follows 
from your observation? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Because I have no personal knowledge 
about this but from what I’m hearing the obvious question 
seems to be the following.  There was no reason for you to 
assume that the alternative candidate under consideration 
was not black and yet if you had no such reason, I have 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 208 of 316 
 
difficulty with why there’s such – on her version, and I 
think even on your own version, such adamant support for 
Mr Gama, it raises a question. 
MR MANTASHE:   Mr Chairman, it raises no question, you 
see, that there was a black candidate is something new to 
me, okay, something new to me.  At the time when we 
raised that questions, we were already aware that racism is 
in the subconscious mind, it’s a prejudice and therefore it 
must be highlighted everywhere its showed inside.  This 
side, this thing of Pravin and another black candidate is 
10 
new to me and the reason that we’re not given the details, 
I would imagine, is because we’re not the Deployment 
Committee, we’re not in the selection process we were 
briefed and we asked questions because maybe, in the 
other processes there was already a pressure that was 
mounted when we saw there, added our question to the 
pressure she was under but the reality of the matter was 
that we’re asking a question in relation to racism being 
sub-conscious and being prejudicial and therefore ask the 
question.  Here is a young professional who is doing well, 
20 
why is he not given the opportunity, that was the question, 
and that question was never answered.  I picked it up later, 
that was a big issue out there and Ms Hogan thought that I 
added pressure on her and all that, but the issue is that we 
– I personally asked that question that’s why my name is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 209 of 316 
 
mentioned, specifically because I asked that question and I 
will 
ask 
that 
question 
in 
respect 
of 
another 
young 
professional who I think  is not treated fairly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, was your attitude, as reflected 
in that question that you put to Ms Barbara Hogan when 
she met the officials of the ANC reflective of the attitude of 
the officials.  In other words, is that how you all thought or, 
as far as you can recall? 
MR MANTASHE:   If you come to the meeting of the 
officials, you present whatever report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Actually, in the majority of cases on this 
issue officials note it, they express no view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   They ask questions, and you leave, you 
don’t follow up because you are not part of the selection 
process but if you take your time, you come to conclusions, 
well ask these questions, if they put pressure on you, then 
sorry, we feel sorry for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well for what it’s worth I just want to 
20 
say, just in case you might not know this, the evidence of 
Ms Barbara Hogan was that she informed the then 
President, Mr Zuma, of the Board’s recommendation of this 
black candidate and that President Zuma’s attitude was 
that he wanted Gama and his choice was Gama and nobody 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 210 of 316 
 
else. 
 
Of 
course 
when 
Mr 
Zuma 
came 
before 
the 
Commission he denied that he said that, he said that he 
could not have said that because his  preoccupation was 
whether processes were followed but that was the evidence 
of both of them but one of the things that Ms Barbara 
Hogan said was that – I mean when she became – she was 
appointed Minister of Public Enterprises in May 2009, this 
process of filling the position of Group CEO was underway 
and it was in 2009 when she was talking to President Zuma 
about this but she says, one of the things that President 
10 
Zuma said when she said, but Mr Gama may be the subject 
of some investigation and there might be disciplinary 
processes, she says, he said, well then the position should 
not be filled until those processes have been finalised.  
The position remained unfilled until 2011. Ms Barbara 
Hogan, in October 2010 was removed from Cabinet.  So, - 
2009 the position was vacant, 2010 the position was 
vacant, and Ms Barbara Hogan says the candidate who had 
been preferred by the Board and that she was supporting, 
and she says, it was a credible candidate had to pull out 
20 
because of this delay and that candidate was later to be 
appointed to another State owned entity but I’m just 
mentioning that for what it’s worth, you might not wish to 
say anything. 
MR MANTASHE:   No. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 211 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   The issue is, when you are guilty by 
association it’s very difficult, I think to – I think if there 
were irritations in the action between Cabinet Minister 
Barbara Hogan and the President, J Zuma, that will not be 
extended to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no – well…[intervenes]. 
MR MANTASHE:  No, let me, I’m saying that because while 
you say there was pressure put on me, by me …[indistinct 
– dropping voice] including Gwede Mantashe and I know 
10 
that I never went to Barbara ...[indistinct – word cut] and 
say please take garments off it never did that.  I asked this 
specific question in a meeting it voluntarily came to which 
was not a necessary meeting for the selection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Because also as I understand it is not a 
meeting of the deployment committee it was the meeting with 
the Top 6. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I understand.  So I do not want to take 
20 
the Hogan issue with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I want to go back to where we were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And so you can dispose of the Hogan 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 212 of 316 
 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Go back to the first file and I was about 
when we took the last adjournment to refer Mr Mantashe to 
page 100.48. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes that is where I am. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now I want try to deal with this 
reasonably crisply the difficulty is there is a lot of detail.  
What I want to indicate to you your relation to this 
newspaper report is that as early as January 2011 the 
10 
newspapers were reporting allegations of improper Gupta 
family pressure on government decisions and on – and on 
appointment decisions and I – I – the first thing I want to 
establish is whether those reports came to your attention – I 
am sure they must have. 
MR MANTASHE:  I do not know which reports you are 
referring to. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well I refer for example to the report at 
page 48 – 100.48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must just take Mr Freund what report it 
20 
is it seems to be a Sunday Times report. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright then I will have to deal with it.  It 
is a Sunday Times report on the 30th of January 2011 the 
fourth last paragraph and bear in mind that the – the heading 
is “Gupta Influence Is Remarkable.”  The fourth last 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 213 of 316 
 
paragraph: 
“According to decision makers in government 
it is becoming common to receive a directive 
from this family or is it perhaps from people 
pretending to be members of this family with 
the stern message that it comes from the 
very top. This is just said as on occasion led 
to some questionable decisions being taken.” 
Now I understand that this is not the strongest of evidence 
but there is a series of such reports that we are going to go 
10 
to.  Maybe I can take you immediately before you even 
comment on that report to the report at page 63.  This is a 
report a month later in February of 2011 in the Sunday Times 
under the headline “Ministers shiver when summoned to 
family’s home” and the sting of this is an allegation for 
example we read this in the fourth or fifth paragraph: 
“A member of the working committee who 
attended the most recent meeting said:  The 
concern is that these people – the Gupta’s 
now have influence in the appointment of 
20 
CEO’s and Chairman of state owned entities 
which then means the ANC has lost its way 
and 
its 
influence 
in 
these 
crucial 
deployments.” 
Again it quotes: 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 214 of 316 
 
“Other 
sources 
were 
alleged 
that 
three 
Deputy Ministers were phoned and told that 
they were to be promoted days before the 
cabinet reshuffle was announced. Several 
Ministers were – were phoned by them to 
assure them that their jobs were secure.  
Bragging about public officials coming to 
meet them at their home.  Pressure to 
support the New Age.” 
And then on the next page at 64 in the middle of the page. 
10 
“A member of the working committee claimed 
Ministers feared for the – feared the family 
believing they had too much influence over 
Zuma.  People are scared of them and they 
are called to their house all the time.  The 
Gupta’s are known to be the President’s 
people 
and 
that 
is 
why 
even 
Ministers 
shiver.” 
Another top ANC leader said: 
“You must see the way they treat Ministers.” 
20 
And on it goes.  Now the first thing I want to establish is 
whether reports at this time came to your attention? 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  In my opening statement I gave you a 
brief summary of how the relationship between the Gupta 
family and the ANC evolved.  I stand by that submission.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 215 of 316 
 
Okay.  As I said there was no pressure mounted on the ANC 
on the Gupta family during the first term.  There were signs 
that were beginning to show that something is going wrong 
but the real pressure of the Gupta family 00:05:13 on the 
first time was nothing.  For example the question of the 
newspapers and the TV station we supported that because 
we wanted diversity in the media and that came about until 
things go wrong. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well what is the answer to my question?  
Did the report of these allegations come to your attention in 
10 
about February of 2011? 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  Newspapers do not report to me.  I 
read newspapers so if Sunday Times report about Gupta’s 
does not report to me. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Of course it is not a report to you but it 
is a report in a national newspaper which gained a huge 
amount of attention in the country are you – are you telling 
the commission that you were unaware of these allegations? 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  You are wanting me to answer a 
question that I should not be answering.  I am saying in the 
20 
first term there were no reports of Gupta influencing the 
Zuma Presidency.  Then later in the term many things began 
to emerge.  Actually as I said there were serious incidents 
that actually opened our eyes was the landing of that plane 
in Waterkloof military airplane. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 216 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was 2013. 
MR MANTASHE:  (Inaudible)  Come again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was 2013 April if I am not mistaken. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  That was the first thing that opened our 
eyes and we – we came up 00:07:02 and in 2014 Mbalula 
made a confession in the NEC of this.  Those were the 
earlier signs of this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think just to make sure that you – you 
10 
understand the question I think what Mr Freund is asking is 
to the extent that in 2011 there were newspaper articles 
suggesting something that could be improper that while may 
have been done by the Gupta’s in terms of government or in 
terms of President Zuma do you recall that you were aware 
of some of those allegations in the media? 
MR MANTASHE:  I am saying in 2011 there were no reports 
that came to us.  If they are in newspapers they are in 
newspapers.  Let me tell you how newspapers 00:08:13 
because if you can be working as a party on the face of 
20 
newspaper reports we will not exist by now.  We will be out – 
we will be dead by now because newspaper reports raise 
issues that we ask each other what is this – anything and we 
would take our time to try to understand this.  You know. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Mr Mantashe. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 217 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:  So the serious attention brought to us was 
the landing of that plane at Waterkloof. 
ADV FREUND SC:  We will come to that report that clearly 
was a serious report.  It was entertained by you but I am 
trying to deal with an earlier period.  I am trying to deal with 
2011 and I am not clear in my own mind what your evidence 
is. I think your evidence is that you deny that these 
allegations ever came to your attention in 2011. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes they did not.  I am saying that again. 
ADV FREUND SC:  That cannot possibly be correct can it?  
10 
If I take you to page 100.77. 
MR MANTASHE:  100? 
ADV FREUND SC:  77.   
MR MANTASHE:  100.77. 
ADV FREUND SC:  100 and then 77. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You are quoted there – let us just see if 
you are quoted correctly. 
“As dismissing criticism of the Gupta family’s 
political influence.” 
20 
Is it correct that you rejected that criticism? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes I did. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well if you rejected the criticism you 
must have been aware of the criticism, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  No.  I am saying I dismissed the criticism 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 218 of 316 
 
at the time. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I accept that you dismissed the criticism. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You dismissed the criticism according to 
this report in March 2011 which means a matter of 
ineluctable logic that you were aware of the criticism before 
the 8 th of March 2011, you accept that? 
MR MANTASHE:  The criticism comes from Mail and 
Guardian.  
ADV FREUND SC:  And other – and other reports? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  And other newspapers. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes were you aware of that? 
MR MANTASHE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let… 
MR MANTASHE:   I think it is an unfair question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me try and put it this way. 
MR MANTASHE:  I think it is an unfair question because I 
am expected to take newspapers reports as reports to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is… 
MR MANTASHE:  The Secretary General. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me… 
MR MANTASHE:  And  you are saying they are not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me put the question in my own way 
maybe that is going to make a difference. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 219 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once you accept that you dismissed 
certain criticisms that as I understand the position may have 
come from certain newspapers about what the Gupta family 
was alleged to be doing or whatever obviously it means that 
you were aware that there were allegations being made that 
the Gupta family was doing ABCD and you were then 
rejecting that criticism of whatever it was alleged they were 
doing. 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that?  You accept that it must 
10 
mean – you would not dismiss criticism that you were not 
aware of. 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay let me allow that question to pass 
and say let me wait for the follow up question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MANTASHE:  Because I do not want to accept that if the 
newspaper reports those reports are reports 00:12:25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no, no maybe the word reports – 
20 
maybe the word reports is causing confusion.  Maybe we 
should say articles. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Articles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Newspaper articles. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Quite happy to use the word articles. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 220 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  In other words the question was a 
much earlier question whether you were aware of newspaper 
articles that made certain allegations against the Gupta 
family? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes there are – there were in the 
newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think maybe the reports that 
was creating problems. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes okay well I will change the word to 
articles because to me they are synonyms. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  You can call it a newspaper reports that it 
is the same. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright but I will call them articles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  To avoid any possible ambiguity.  I now 
understand you to accept that you were aware that there 
were newspaper articles making allegations at the time that I 
have just summarised and read out, am I correct?  You were 
aware of those articles? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it is some of them. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay I – articles yes, reports to me. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  I do not know. 
ADV FREUND SC:  No I am not – I am not suggesting… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no let us just say articles at least part 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 221 of 316 
 
of the report is maybe causing confusion.  You would have 
been aware of certain articles in the media. 
MR MANTASHE:  That is why I responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why you responded yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes.  Now the next question is once we 
accept as we must that you were aware that there were 
newspaper articles making allegations of these type I 
assume that you would accept that if the allegations were 
true they were a matter of the utmost seriousness. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  Come again. 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
If 
the 
allegations 
made 
in 
the 
newspapers or the newspaper reports to which we have 
referred were true if they were true they would be matters of 
the most utmost seriousness allegations of this kind of 
influence over the President and the appointment processes 
and Cabinet Ministers you must surely accept that too? 
MR MANTASHE:  I should have accepted that. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You should accept that that is a serious 
matter.  It would be – if they were true I know they are 
20 
allegations but if the allegations are true the allegations are 
a matter of extreme seriousness. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes but the reaction at the time on the 
basis of the analysis we did.  In terms of the information at 
our 
disposal 
was 
that 
we 
actually 
dismissed 
those 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 222 of 316 
 
allegations. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes so they were serious allegations and 
they needed to be investigated, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes which I am not an investigator. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But they are allegations which to you as 
the Secretary General of the party and to the leadership of 
the party should have been a matter of the most serious 
concern.  I understand that if the allegations are false there 
is nothing to be worried about but the allegations exist and if 
the allegations are true then these are matters of the highest 
10 
seriousness which require to be investigated, you agree? 
MR MANTASHE:  At the time we did our analysis and we 
came to a conclusion of what this is racist stance with that 
newspaper and that in itself was the project of analysis we 
made at the time. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and when you say analysis that you 
made would this be analysis that was made by a structure of 
the ANC or you talking about yourself a certain functionary? 
MR MANTASHE:  No the ANC – the ANC is an organisation.  
20 
It has its operational structure which runs day to day affairs 
of the ANC.  It does not work for the meeting of the officials, 
the meeting of a government.  That operational structure is 
the structure that is in Luthuli House and when we sit at the 
00:16:47 of that structure. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 223 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so – the analysis would have been 
done in so to speak in the office of the Secretary General? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Or 
by 
people 
working, 
assisting 
or 
supporting the Secretary General. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes by… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  For example deportment of information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  So certain analysis had 
been done and it was on the basis of that analysis. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the criticism was dismissed. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And it was not only rejected it was 
labelled to be the – an expression of racial prejudice that 
was an allegation you made, correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  I am saying there is an allegation on the 
newspaper we do not call meetings of structures every time 
there is a newspaper article.  We analyse it with our 
20 
department in head office.  We came to this conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the allegation I am – I was just looking 
at the article – the allegation really was against the Gupta’s 
was that the Gupta family was that they were having undue 
political influence on government or on President Zuma, is 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 224 of 316 
 
that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And in particular undue influence on the 
appointment of the CEO’s and chairmen of state owned 
entities that would have been a matter of considerable 
concern to you given the evidence you have been giving us 
all day. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes but you can only take decision on the 
basis of information at your disposal. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Indeed.  But it becomes a matter of 
extreme importance therefore if you are going to investigate 
the issue that is important which if it is true has serious 
consequences that you do such an investigation thoroughly 
and you get access to all the necessary information, not so? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes you know if we do that every day there 
is a newspaper article with the right to them actually we 
would be sitting here in the commission with a different 
investigation on us on how we try to interfere with 
newspapers. 
20 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
It 
is 
not 
about 
interfering 
with 
newspapers. If you had investigated thoroughly at the time 
the probabilities I want to you is we would not be having this 
commission.  This commission is in part a consequence of 
the fact that when these allegations were first made when 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 225 of 316 
 
they were first made in 2011 which you say is the successful 
period of the Jacob Zuma Presidency. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  They were not taken seriously.  We are 
all paying the price. 
MR MANTASHE:  I am not sure if we can say the commission 
is a consequence of that. There are many things that are 
involved in the state capture and I can tell you when you are 
in Luthuli House one of them you have a sense of – when 
you are in government you come across 00:20:02.  And if 
10 
you can only limit this commission to the incident of the 
Gupta’s then you will only scratch the surface and I am sure 
the commission is 00:20:21 now. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now the newspaper reports to which we 
have just referred quote you as saying: 
“That 
the 
matter 
was 
not 
raised 
for 
discussion at the NWC meeting but then 
quote the NEC as saying that the issue had 
been disposed of by the NWC and therefore 
the NEC would not investigate or take the 
20 
issue any further.” 
Is that also correct? 
MR MANTASHE:  I – I cannot remember in that sequence but 
all I am saying newspaper reports are not items of the NWC 
or the NEC.  Newspaper reports we analyse them as we go 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 226 of 316 
 
that is why we have a DIP in the head office to do that on-
going analysis. 
ADV FREUND SC:  But let us look at this.  Deputy Ministers 
are being told allegedly of their appointments by the Gupta’s 
weeks before this has been decided or being announced.  
Ministers are being assured that they are safe and – and 
there is the concern about the abuse of – or the undue 
influence over – over the appointments of SOE’s.  I have 
great difficulty Mr Mantashe understanding on what basis 
these allegations are treated so flippantly and on what basis 
10 
the conclusion is reached that this nothing other than racial 
prejudice. 
MR MANTASHE:  Well the ruling that we made particular 
analysis and come to certain conclusion is that the focus 
would be biased to a particular kind of company established 
companies that are actually benefitting from state are not 
investigated. Even up to this day and my argument is when 
that happens in an organisation like the ANC which come 
from the background of a Liberation Movement it pays 
attention to that fact that newspapers will raise issues about 
20 
companies of a particular kind and close eyes to companies 
of a different kind. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now one of the allegations that was 
made in the report was of Ministers and Deputy Ministers 
being told by the Gupta’s not members of government about 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 227 of 316 
 
their appointments as Ministers weeks before any official 
announcement is made.  You say that the information 
available to you when this was dismissed by you in March of 
2011 did not substantiate that  Let us leave that there.  Later 
that very year in 2011 is it correct that Mr Fikile Mbalula at a 
NEC meeting said directly to the President that he himself 
had been told that – of his appointment by the Gupta’s I do 
not know the exact period but I think a couple of weeks 
before the announcement was made is that correct factually? 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes and that is why I said earlier two 
10 
incidents brought this issue to our serious attention was the 
landing of the plane at Waterkloof and the incident of 
Mbalula in the NEC. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright now let us get the timing straight.  
The Mbalula allegation is made in 2011 at a NEC meeting. 
MR MANTASHE:  Is this 2011? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Are you comfortable with that or do you 
want me to show you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I was also wondering because I thought 
when he gave evidence Mr Mbalula said it was 2011 but 
20 
when you said it was 2014 I became confused because my 
recollection is that when Mr Mbalula made – confronted the 
President or raised the issue in the NEC he had been told 
about a promotion from being Deputy Minister to Minister 
and I was thinking well I am not sure whether before 2009 he 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 228 of 316 
 
was Deputy Minister or not. 
MR MANTASHE:  Obviously I will have to check that. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well let me take you on the dates up to 
three media reports. The first is at page 100.82.  This is a 
report dated the 28th of August 2011.  It does not name Mr 
Mbalula I will come to that later.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what page?  What page?  382? 
ADV FREUND SC:  No 1 – I said 182 but it is in fact 183.  It 
is headed “Zuma wins NEC battle but war goes on 
underground”  Do you have that Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is – that is page 100.183. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   Business Day – Business Day? 
ADV FREUND SC:  No, no Sunday Times.  Let me just 
check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 100.183. 
ADV FREUND SC:  No at page – let me just check.  It is at 
page 100 – sorry let me just start again.  100.83. 
CHAIRPERSON:  .83. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes.  Sorry did I say 183?  If I said that it 
20 
was a mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine.  Sunday Times articles. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Sunday Times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Have you got it Mr Mantashe? 
ADV FREUND SC:  And what – do you have the page Mr 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 229 of 316 
 
Mantashe? 
MR MANTASHE:  I have got the page. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right now I accept that this does not 
mention a name yet but if you look at – if you look at about 
the fifth paragraph it says: 
“A cabinet minister for instance told the 
meeting which is a reference to the August 
NEC meeting in Zuma’s President – in 
Zuma’s presence that it was true that the 
Gupta brothers had known beforehand of the 
10 
President’s plan to reshuffle his cabinet in 
October last year.  He told of how one of the 
brothers 
had 
informed 
him 
days 
before 
changes were announced that Zuma would 
promote someone who was Deputy Minister 
at 
the 
time 
to 
a 
full 
Ministerial 
post.  
According to NEC members etcetera.” 
So there is a reference to this allegation at this meeting.  
Now I agree this is just part of jigsaw puzzle.  Let me now 
take you to page 182 – well let me take me to page – so 
20 
100.83.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where you were reading from. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Let us go to .90. 
MR MANTASHE:  90? 
ADV FREUND SC:  90.  Well let me go to – this is at 90 I 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 230 of 316 
 
just got to check that.  I have to tell you that I am working 
through papers that are differently paginated from yours.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well 90… 
ADV FREUND SC:  So .91. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  It is the article that is headed there – it 
starts at 100.91.  And you will see near the foot of the page 
there: 
“The Mail and Guardian reported last week 
that during the same meeting Mbalula has..” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about are you reading on the page? 
ADV FREUND SC:  I am on the second last paragraph at 
page 91. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Starting the Mail and Guardian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And we reading a report in the Sunday 
World in September 2011 and we see that the Sunday World 
reports that the Mail and Guardian reported last week that 
during the same meeting it is the NEC meeting we have been 
20 
referring to: 
“Mbalula accused the President of allowing 
outside forces such as the Gupta family to 
run the ANC and the government on his 
behalf.  Mbalula allegedly told Zuma he i.e. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 231 of 316 
 
Mbulala knew about his appointment as 
Minister of Sports and Recreation through 
the Gupta’s two weeks before Zuma made 
the announcement.” 
So I say to myself well where is this Mail and Guardian 
report?  I now take you to 100.414.  We find the Mail & 
Guardian report dated the 26 t h of August 2011.  If I take 
you to page 416 the third last paragraph.  100.461. 
MR MANTASHE:   414 and then 413 ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   Oh, 414 is where the article starts, 
10 
right? 
MR MANTASHE:   Oh. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  It is just so that you can see 
the date of it and where it comes from.  It comes from the 
Mail & Guardian on the 26 t h of August and at 416 it is 
reported by the Mail & Guardian that Mr Mbalula accused 
the President of allowing outside forces such as the Gupta 
family to run the ANC and the government on his behalf.  
And Mbalula said or complaint that he first learnt of his 
appointment as the Sports Minister from the Gupta rather 
20 
than from Zuma himself.   
 
Now the point I am trying to make is not that 
these articles established the truth of this having happened 
but the point I am trying to make is that if we want to 
identify when this incident happened.  What we see is that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 232 of 316 
 
this incident happened in August of 2011 and not as what 
has otherwise been thought in 2014.  Do you follow my 
logic? 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just remember to speak into the 
microphone Mr Mantashe.   
R MANTASHE:   I am listening to this, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   I am listening.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No I just wanted the okay to be 
10 
captured.  [laughs]   
MR MANTASHE:   [laughs]   
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV FREUND SC:   And the point of that is this.  In 
January and February allegations are reported which is 
true for the series but your investigation in March says 
there is nothing to support this.  We do not accept these 
are true.  But at an MEC meeting, only a few months later, 
Mr Mbalula says to the President to his face:  This is what 
20 
happened. 
MR MANTASHE:   Oh, no.  You say I said – in what report 
did I say there is nothing to support it.  What are you 
referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 233 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am referring to your evidence about 
ten minutes ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The analysis.  He is referring to your 
evidence when you said.  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Within the SG’s office ...[intervenes]   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the allegations against the Gupta’s 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...were 
analysed 
and 
they 
were 
dismissed. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay.  Okay.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I do not want to read through this 
what happened in March but I want to ask you.  What, if 
anything, the leadership structures of the ANC did when 
Mr Mbalula made this allegation?  Were they investigated?  
Were they believed? 
MR MANTASHE:   Mbalula in the NSA.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
It 
was 
an 
outburst 
by 
Mbalula 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...in the MEC(?). 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 234 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTASHE:   It was an outburst which required us to 
talk to Mbalula and try to get the sense of what he had 
made his allegations which I can – and that depended more 
on ...[indistinct] to give that evidence to us, and that is 
why we said a further admission we made here was, two 
incidents made it more serious to us that there should be a 
fire under that smoke, it was the plane and Mbalula 
incident. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, but I want to put to you for your 
comment that really there is real fault to be attributed to 
both the ANC as a party and to Parliament also for not 
pursuing 
these 
allegations 
when 
they 
first 
made 
particularly when they appeared on face value to be 
supported by what was openly said at an MEC meeting in 
2011.   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, I go to an MEC meeting, I make a 
statement.  We need to follow that with the person who 
20 
made the statement first.  Now his willingness to give 
evidence that lead us to a discretion becomes critical.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, did you attempt to get that 
confirmation from him? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 235 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   In 2011? 
MR MANTASHE:   I do talk to Mbalula(?) after every MEC if 
he makes that statement.  He made many of those 
statements.  I talk to him every time but sometimes to 
make... meeting, refused to talk outside of the meeting 
which makes it difficult for any official of the ANC to follow 
[Speaker is unclear.] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  And you say or you do not say 
but what implicitly what you say is that you do not have the 
power to compel somebody to come and answer questions.  
10 
You rely on people to voluntarily give you information. 
MR MANTASHE:   I would say I get the powers of the 
Commission to summon... 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   [laughs]   
ADV FREUND SC:   But of course, Parliament does have 
that power isn’t it? 
MR MANTASHE:   Come again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV FREUND SC:   Parliament does have that power 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   ...and Parliament(?) committees have 
that power. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I am not giving evidence on behalf 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374

of Parliament.  I was not at  a parliamentarian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought, Mr Mantashe, I thought 
maybe when people were summonsed by the SG, not 
formally, to the SG’s office, they would take it seriously? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, people do come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   And whether they come and be prepared 
to give you the evidence is another matter(?).  I do not 
remember when you say, well, call somebody he does not 
come.  People do come.  But if it comes to the evidence, 
10 
you will see further down until you come to that where 
these 
people 
make 
these 
allegations(?) 
No 
one 
is 
confiscating(?) it.  [Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay.  Yes, we will come to that.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I do want you to, if you can, to 
tell me as far as your recollection – as far as you are able 
to recall what the response was, generally speaking, of 
other members of the MEC when Mr Mbalula made this 
20 
statement ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Ja.  Let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because you said when he was 
testifying, if I recall correctly, generally speaking – maybe I 
should not say that.  At least some people in the MEC were 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 237 of 316 
 
liking shooting him down, if I am not mistaken.   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so on. 
MR MANTASHE:   And that is the dynamic that the 
Commission... protects(?) fully.  [Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Of... in an organisation that is divided. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   And we try to keep it together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   That dynamic will not be understood 
fully by the Commission.  The Commission may come to a 
conclusion that says you are reckless and so forth but the 
reality of the matter, when you the General of the ANC you 
need to move with a necessary(?) slow speed so that you 
do not rush into things and actually create a bigger crisis.  
You are running an organisation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I can tell you, Mr Mantashe, that I 
need to understand in whatever evidence that tells me if 
there was a certain environment that make it difficult to 
20 
take certain action or make certain decisions because of 
maybe something such as the one you are talking about 
because one appreciates that one is not a member of the 
ANC, does not attend ANC meetings.   
 
So people who were part of that needs to be 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 238 of 316 
 
able to share with the Commission, to say these were the 
dynamics, these were the challenges.  Maybe when you sit 
here you could think that we could easily have done A, B, 
C, D but we who were there on the spot were faced with 
these challenges and might not have been founded – might 
not have founded ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   I can do that in brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   But you sit there.  You have a group of 
members of the MEC who stand up and then they say – and 
10 
say to the President who must resign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Thereabout.  And the majority of the 
members say:  No, that is not how it is done.  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   When that happens, your duty as the 
Secretary General is to navigate through that stormy 
weather with care because there is an organisation to 
protect.  And you will have noticed the period between 
2011 and the time when – where the time – to the time 
20 
when ultimately the MEC’s are not Parliament.  The 
...[indistinct]  is President.   
 
And to me that period(?) of time reflect to 
everybody who cares to look into.  But we are navigating 
through a turbulent weather with care.  The fact that we 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 239 of 316 
 
came out of it with an organisation together, in itself is a 
big achievement.  But people who are outside and 
spectators can go on the merit who will say we are 
reckless, we did not do that.  Because they in the – they 
counter pose the ANC as a party and the ANC in 
Parliament.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   The methodology(?) that Parliament 
played overrules – makes certain intervention.  The ANC 
moved in a particular way up to a point. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Now you have already 
referred to the Waterkloof incident.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe.  Mr Mantashe, I just want to 
– if I should say, for what it is worth, that you know that 
there was that article, one of the articles that Mr Freund 
referred us to when he was putting one of the questions to 
you. It is a March 2011 article about the Gupta’s.  I just 
want to say that that was – that article was about a month 
after Mr Themba Maseko had been removed from his 
20 
position as DG or CEO of the Communications Department 
in government.   
 
You will recall he gave evidence about that.  And 
he was saying that based on what Mr Archie Gupta had 
said to him earlier and what he was told by Minister 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 240 of 316 
 
Thabane before he was removed.  Or he was told by 
Minister Thabane that it was Mr Zuma as President who 
said he should be removed.  So I am just saying that that 
article came about a month after that development.  And of 
course, you might not, at that stage, had been aware of it. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is why it is important to always 
appreciate the dynamics of a party of the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   I must comment Mr Maseko in that after 
we started the process of investigating the thing of the 
10 
Gupta’s.  He was the only person who gave us a written 
submission.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   Everybody refused.  That is why we 
referred to an independent institution and had to make a 
supported(?) information of this Commission because it 
was clear to us that people fear to incriminate themselves 
within the party structures.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
And 
the 
party’s(?) 
independent 
20 
structures.  It is because I comment Mr Maseko for it(?) 
because he gave us a written submission.  The only one 
out of eight people that did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I do propose to come to that but I am 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 241 of 316 
 
trying to get there in a chronological sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So, if I can take you back then to 
March of 2013 at 100.104?   
MR MANTASHE:   At 100...? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Dot one, o, four. 
MR MANTASHE:   One, o, four. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am going to – I think I will just use – 
I will not say a hundred every time.  I will just use the 
number after the dot.  You will know what I am talking 
10 
about.  So let us call this page 104.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is an article in The Star? 
ADV FREUND SC:   In Star in May of 2013. 
MR MANTASHE:   Wait, wait, wait.  104? 
ADV FREUND SC:   104. An article in The Star. 
MR MANTASHE:   One... 
ADV FREUND SC:   One hundred and four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One, zero, four.  So you remember he 
said he is not going to mention one hundred anymore.  He 
will just say 104.   
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  I just want to help you to get 
your 
bearings 
here. 
 
You 
will 
see 
this 
is 
the 
3 r d  of May 2013.  You will see it is about the use of the 
Waterkloof Airbase in relation to the Gupta wedding.  I am 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 242 of 316 
 
not going to take you into the details of that.  It all very 
well-known.  But what I want to take you to is comments 
attributed to you in this article.  So not directly quoting 
you.  Third hand sources claiming that you ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Here are your sources. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  So let us – you are the 
source.  I want ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To clear that ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   I want to hear from you whether these 
are true or not. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   You hear it from.  Here are your sources. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  You will see here in about the 
fifth last paragraph.  It says:  According to a well-placed 
source.  Do you see that? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Mantashe... 
“Dr(?) Zuma he had allowed the Gupta’s in the 
kitchen 
cabinet 
too 
much 
influencing 
in 
government to the expense of the party and its 
20 
leadership.  He said that the ANC Secretary 
General 
felt 
marginalised 
when 
Zuma 
appointed the Limpopo ANC and the ANC 
Youth League Task Teams...” 
 
And then the part that really interests me. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 243 of 316 
 
“Mantashe allegedly went to so far as to tell 
some ministers to have the backbone and to 
refuse to take instructions from the Gupta’s...” 
 
Now my question is whether it is true that the 
comments that you allegedly made, reflected your attitude 
at the time? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, except that it is prefaced(?) with a 
term that there was a fallout. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright. Let us leave the fallout aside. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, no, no.  Allow me to respond. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, of course.  Of course. 
MR MANTASHE:   Allow me to respond.  It says with a 
fallout.  Yes, so.  Factually it cannot be true.  Let me 
explain why it cannot be true.  Because my relation with 
the President of the ANC is always a professional one, not 
a personal one.  We will not become buddy-buddy.  So 
when you are the Secretary General you raise the issues.  
You do not look over your shoulders to say how does the 
President feel on the issue.  You comment on this issue on 
behalf of the African National Congress.   
20 
 
Now, the things that I have said I have said by 
sources.  Let me say.  That was the beginning of saying do 
not comply with instruction if they are not legitimate.  We 
did that with the Cabinet ministers who would resist if you 
say it now in English, begin to resist.  And it became to 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 244 of 316 
 
agreement many ...[indistinct]  [Speaker is unclear.] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, that is a very important thing you 
have just told us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV 
FREUND 
SC: 
 
 And 
I 
would 
like 
understand 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I have missed that last 
sentence. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or something. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   I said – we said:  Please, do not do what 
is not legitimate on instruction(?).  And I said many began 
to do that and many paid the price for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So it is implied from what you are 
saying that you had received, maybe over a certain period 
of time, reports that were suggesting that ministers were 
being given instructions by the Gupta family and that is 
why you would have given that instruction or warning, to 
20 
say do not comply with illegitimate instructions.  Would 
that be a fair conclusion from what you are saying? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  Let me read you from this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MANTASHE:    
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 245 of 316 
 
“Nthembo dismisses a suggestion that Zuma and 
Mantashe had fallen out is an old bullshit - an old 
bullshit...that’s it by people who wanted to sow 
dilution amongst ANC leaders.  And he confirmed 
that.  Now they had met ...[indistinct] regards to 
...[indistinct]”  
 
All I am trying to say is that the issue that they 
prefaced here with a fallout is quite important because – 
and that is what determines our relationship with the 
newspapers.  Sometimes they report issues but they 
10 
phrase it in a way that are actually plan(?) to intent to 
divide the African National Congress.   
 
When that happens, you do not take the media 
report as a report.  You take it as an effort of part of 
packing the lies and words driving amongst leaders of the 
ANC.  So this was one of that examples and therefore – I 
just had words(?) to talk to ministers who begin to start 
resisting and that was the beginning of a process of 
appreciating that this must be stopped... 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  And you put that in 2013? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I heard you.  If you could just repeat 
that ...[indistinct]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Now you have also said 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 246 of 316 
 
something this morning that took me a little bit by surprise.  
If I can take you to page 100.432 or let us just call it 432.   
MR MANTASHE:   432? 
ADV FREUND SC:   432.  This is your opening statement 
this morning. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  It took you by surprise? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, the – one detail in it took me by 
surprise.   
MR MANTASHE:   Okay? 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am not saying that it may not also 
10 
appear in your affidavit.  It had.  But the point is.  I had 
never – it has never run the bell that it now rings.   
MR MANTASHE:   I have got it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   At the foot of page 432, paragraph 61. 
Do you have that?  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You say there: 
“Since 2013... [which is the time we are now 
talking about] ...after the Integrity Commission 
recommended that the former President Zuma 
20 
should 
step 
down, 
the 
ANC 
has 
been 
undergoing a period of instability...” 
 
And my question is one of fact.  What can you 
tell 
me 
about 
a 
recommendation 
by 
the 
Integrity 
Commission and when was it made? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 247 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Since 2013, we say so, after the 
Integrity Commission recommended. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So are you saying that there was an 
Integrity Commission recommendation in 2013? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That President Zuma should step 
down? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Do you know on what basis that 
recommendation was made? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   On what basis? 
ADV FREUND SC:   They made that recommendation.  If 
this 
is 
an 
Integrity 
Commission 
recommending 
the 
President should stand down. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   What was it that they relied upon? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I cannot be able to give details of 
the Integrity Commission.  I am not a member of hearing 
the hearing with somebody who is not myself, who was not 
there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what Mr Freund is looking at is 
whether you having being the Secretary General of the 
ANC at the time, you are aware whether the Integrity 
Commission’s recommendation that President Zuma should 
step down or – ja, step down.  I see there, yes, it says step 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 248 of 316 
 
down not step aside.  Step down.  The recommendation 
that President Zuma should step down was connected in 
any way with the allegations of the friends of the Gupta 
family ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was connected? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And just remind us ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   He did not ask that question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MANTASHE:   He did not ask that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  [laughs]  Alright.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, but I will take all the help that I 
can get.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Mantashe, this is an important 
picture we are now dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is very important. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is not something that I personally 
20 
was aware of and I do not know whether the Commission 
was aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, I was not.  If you ask me 
whether the Integrity Commission of the ANC was there in 
2013, I was likely to think that no it was not there at that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 249 of 316 
 
time but obviously you know that it was there and it made a 
recommendation. 
MR MANTASHE:   It was there. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ja. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
Very 
active, 
chaired 
by Andrew 
Mlangeni(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chaired by? 
MR MANTASHE:   Andrew Mlangeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Andrew Mlangeni. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mlangeni.  And staffed by its senior in 
respect of members of the African National Congress.  
When I say start, the personnel of the Integrity Commission 
will fall into that category. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And in fact, I speak now just from my 
general recollection as a citizen reading newspapers, the 
very creation of the institution of the Integrity Commission 
was the product, presumably, of conflict resolution which 
saw this as a proper device to address allegations of 
20 
malfeasance and misconduct.  Would that be right? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So you have now got a serious 
problem.  You got an Integrity Commission which is 
recommending that the president of your organisation and 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 250 of 316 
 
the President of the country must step down.  That would 
obviously been a matter of very great personal concern to 
you what to do about this problem.  Correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja, relatively(?) we were all worried.  
[Speaker is unclear.] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Not individually. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not individually? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Collectively ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Not individually, collectively. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   We get this report. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Can 
I 
just 
ask 
whether 
that 
recommendation was made after the Waterkloof landing?   
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or do you not ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, it was after the Waterkloof 
...[indistinct]  [Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   So it was after the Waterkloof landing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja. 
FREUND SC:   And I understand that you were not a 
member of that committee.  I understand that you would 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 251 of 316 
 
not have attended and heard the evidence.  But my 
common sense tells me that on the probabilities, if the 
Integrity Commission was recommending that the President 
should 
stand 
down, 
they 
would 
have 
had 
at 
least 
summarised the reasons for which they were making that 
recommendation.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja, they would have submitted a report. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  And to the best of your 
recollection, what were those reasons? 
MR MANTASHE:   I cannot recollect except that it was 
10 
connected to the Gupta influence. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I do not know whether you have 
authority to answer this question but would you have any 
difficulty 
in 
making 
that 
report 
available 
to 
this 
Commission? 
MR MANTASHE:   I am not Secretary General. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
MR MANTASHE:   I am not keeping records of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think the Deputy Secretary 
General is here.  [laughs]   
20 
MR MANTASHE:   No, he is not here.  He is not here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well, let me say that if the ANC 
could make that record available to the Commission, that 
would be appreciated.   
MR MANTASHE:   Ja...  Except that Deputy Chief Justice, 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 252 of 316 
 
the problem in converting the Commission into an inquiry 
into the ANC rather than the state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no.   
MR MANTASHE:   The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is quite ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...in the ANC that the time you fail(?) in 
a sense that the Commission is actually trying the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   So a number of documents that are here, 
internal 
ANC 
documents 
that 
were 
brought 
to 
the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   I was even shocked to see ...[indistinct] 
you have ...[indistinct] meanings of the NWC.  They gave 
the report so ...[intervenes] [Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not even aware that ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...about that ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   So the point I am making is that it is an 
issue that I will have to refer to the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine.  That is fine. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 253 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Because there is a lot of disquietness in 
the organisation 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
That 
we 
must 
not 
convert 
the 
Commission into a trial of the African National Congress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   It must do what is in the Terms of 
Reference of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  No, I think what certainly the 
Commission does is to say in order to establish what 
10 
happened, how it happened and what may need to be 
recommended in order to make sure it does not happen 
again.  You cannot leave a governing party outside.  You 
have got to look at what was its role in regard to A, B, C, 
D.   
 
But when you do that, I accept that or I think 
that it does not mean you go all the way.  You cannot keep 
them out but maybe you can go too far.  So it might be the 
striking of that balance.  I think earlier on you did say you 
do not have a problem in the Commission looking at the 
20 
ruling party.  So it is question of how far goes, I think.   
MR MANTASHE:   That is why we here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   And that is why the President ruled to 
come here. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 254 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   We want to work with the Commission. 
Cooperate with the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
But 
sometimes 
our 
cooperation 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   ...almost get used to strip the ANC 
naked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughs]   
10 
MR MANTASHE:   In public.  Yes.  Strip the ANC naked in 
public.  You want document that are... to the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   And... 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think for now, I am – I think I am happy 
with your response that says that you will revert to the 
right authorities. 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you will look at it and then we will 
hear from somebody.  Ja.  Okay. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Perhaps I can explain, Mr Mantashe, 
from my particular advantage point, why I start to ask 
these questions because the Deputy Chief Justice asked 
me to examine the question of Parliamentary oversight.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 255 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   In respect of allegations of state 
capture and corruption.  And the evidence that has been 
led on that question, as it were, forces one to ask 
themselves, why did the parliamentary caucus act as the 
parliamentary caucus at certain moments?   
 
And in order to understand that, it seems to me 
one has to understand what is the position with the African 
National Congress more generally because you cannot 
understand ANC and peace(?) without understanding the 
10 
organisation context in which they are operating.   
 
So if I can give you my personal assurance that 
the purpose of my questions is not to attack the African 
National Congress but to unpack the problem of state 
capture. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   ...causes of state capture and more 
importantly, the persistence of the alleged state capture 
and why problems were not addressed satisfactorily more 
early as far as spending much time talking now about 2011 
20 
and 2013, when we all know that in 2017 there were 
certain developments and so forth.  Because this question 
of time and response is, it seems to me with respect, to be 
within the terms of the Commission. 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 256 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   So, and I want to give you an 
opportunity to comment on that very proposition I put to 
you is whether you accept that that is a legitimate inquiry? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, to the other members of the ANC, 
they normally come to me.  I am an elder member now.  
And they would say to me that the ANC is very slow to take 
decisions.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   I always remind them of incidents of the 
evolution of the African National Congress.  It is a 109-
10 
years-old.  I give them this example all the time.  You 
know, in 1969, it take a political(?) decision.  Not all 
members in the league of the ANC agree with it.  They 
resisted and caused chaos in the organisation.  It took the 
ANC years to expel them.   
 
Do you know why it took so long?  Because the 
ANC believes that there is nobody who cannot be corrected 
and be helped.  That is the ANC for you.  When the ANC 
takes the last step of pushing their personnel, you must 
know that it has tried and tried and tried.  So the question 
20 
you will be asking that why did it take so long.   
 
The evidence we are giving you show you the 
evolution of the efforts that there was this operation(?) of 
the effort from the time when we dismissed this allegation 
to a time when we were starting to pay... until to a point.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 257 of 316 
 
So the ANC involved with this decision because there is 
nobody who is a member of the ANC who is incorrigible(?).  
No member of the ANC is incorrigible(?)  So the ANC is 
patient in dealing with its members.  [Speaker is unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is just ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   And that was the question:  Why does it 
take so long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must say Mr Mantashe and you 
will tell me if my understanding is wrong.  My reading of 
your affidavit as well as your statement, your evidence you 
10 
have been today is that the ANC’s approach to the issues 
that this Commission is investigating, is to say we want 
this Commission to do its job correctly.  We want this 
Commission to be able to tell us what happened, why it 
happened, who was involved in what happened.   
 
And what is it that made it possible for these 
things and we want to be part of the solution of saying, 
what needs to be done to make sure that we do not – the 
country does not find itself having these challenges again.  
So my understanding is that that is where the organisation 
20 
– that is the approach of the organisation through your 
evidence that it wants to be part of the solution.   
MR MANTASHE:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is why we say, ourselves since 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 258 of 316 
 
2013 after the Integrity Commission recommended that that 
former President Zuma should step down, the ANC has 
been undergoing a period of instability and we go on and 
on.  We have already given this information to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   To try and paint the picture to the 
Commission that dealing with this problem, evolved over a 
period of time.  Now the question is.  Give us the report of 
that and give it to the Commission.  Now we went through a 
very painful process the whole morning where we deal with 
10 
the resolution of ANC conferences and tried to tear them 
apart.   
 
And that is why I am saying.  There is no other 
party, I would imagine, that has given this Commission 
internal 
documents 
of 
its 
proceedings 
except 
the 
agreements that are promised.  [Speaker is unclear.]  And 
we do that because we want to walk the talk and be part of 
this.  But I am saying, if we stretch that to the limit, we are 
going to be stripping the ANC naked because it has 
cooperated.  [Speaker is unclear.] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MANTASHE:   And that is our part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
We 
will 
take 
this 
thing 
to 
the 
...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 259 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And may well be that if there are thing, I 
do not know, if there are things that are sensitive and has 
nothing to do with what we are looking at in the reports, it 
may well be that an affidavit by somebody who has read 
the report and says as far as this which the Commission is 
interested in, this is the information that ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTASHE:   Okay, question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that could be looked at. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay we take it like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am going to leave that issue there.  I 
am going to move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I am also going to move on, quite 
rapidly, in respect of a couple of years.  We are in 2013.  I 
am not going to deal with 2014.  I am not going to deal 
with 2015.  I just want to indicate the sorts of things that 
were happening in that period.   
20 
 
Allegations in relation to the Gupta influence, 
the Gupta benefits, the connection with the President’s 
family, apropos of Transnet, apropos of SAA and so forth.   
 
All sorts of allegations are out there but I am 
just going to skip over that and I am going to fast-forward 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 260 of 316 
 
to early 2016 because early 2016 is a moment of crisis, as 
I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Freund before you proceed  We 
are five minutes before six o’clock.  We intend to take a 
ten minutes’ break after every two hours or so.  It may be 
that we take the ten minutes’ break before you start on 
that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That should be fine.  I think that will 
make a lot of sense.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Because I am going to spend some 
time focussing on early 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Let us take a ten 
minutes’ adjournment.  We will be back at about – okay let 
us make it a little bit more than that.  Let us make it up to 
ten past six.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  I know that Mr Mantashe 
you did say earlier on you are ready we can go up to 12 
midnight but I just want to say if, as we go on, you feel that 
you are exhausted or anything, feel free to mention that. 
MR MANTASHE:   Okay. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 261 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR MANTASHE:   Concentration levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. Ja, no, no, no, ja, so we accept that, 
I mean you are only one being questioned, he is the only one 
standing, we are all seated so from his side, on his side, he 
must tell me when his legs do not allow him to continue 
standing.  So okay, let us continue and then we will see. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mantashe, will 
you turn to page 166 please? 
MR MANTASHE:   There is nothing there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   166. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   Nothing there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mantashe, says there is nothing at 
166. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Oh sorry, let me just check that?  
Alright, then it must be 167. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he is right.  167? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, 167. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a Sowetan article of 17 February 
2016, nè? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct.  Chair, perhaps I should 
explain to you why I have these pagination difficulties and 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 262 of 316 
 
that is that I have had to work the last set of pagination until 
last night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I see. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I had preliminary set of pagination on an 
index but I actually had paginated papers and so I am 
struggling to find my way about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  The air con has been 
switched on, it is noisy, but I do not know, sometimes I am 
told that it is hot that side. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am alright. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I do not want it to be switched off in 
case you are all boiling.  Okay, at least maybe if they can 
just turn it down a bit.  Yes, okay, continue? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now, Mr Mantashe, we dealt 
with the events of 2013 and the problems that that created, 
the investigation of the Integrity Commission, the views they 
took.  I said I am going to jump over 2014, I am going to 
jump over 2014 and I want to pick up the thread in early 
2016 and this newspaper report claims that a meeting took 
place attended by yourself, amongst others, with the Gupta 
20 
family representatives on this issue of undue influence and 
the third paragraph of this newspaper article says that a 
report had been compiled of all the allegations of how the 
family influenced ANC leaders to get business, an accusation 
they have denied.  And then the newspaper article suggests 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 263 of 316 
 
that these accusations were put and answered at the 
meeting.  Is all of that factually correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   It is factually correct that there was a 
meeting.  If you follow that newspaper article, I said we did 
not met the family, we met the company.  That distinction 
was quite important for us because we were dealing with a 
company that was threatening to retrench workers and we 
met them.  Actually that happened. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the company that was threatening 
to retrench workers, is this now related to the Eskom coal 
10 
mines and what is that, Oakbay or…?  This is not material 
that I am terribly familiar with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am interested to know if they were 
meeting a company, what was the name of the company they 
were meeting? 
MR MANTASHE:   We met, I would imagine, it was Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tegeta. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Tegeta. 
MR MANTASHE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   But the reality was that we had all the 
Gupta companies almost closing down so wanted understand 
what was the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was this after the banks had started 
closing the accounts? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 264 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Okay.  And again I am going to ask you 
a question similar to one I asked you before where I accept 
that you may not have authority to answer the question but 
you will see there is a reference here to a report that had 
been compiled of all the allegations of how the family 
influenced ANC leaders to get business.   
So my first question, which I think you are authorised 
to answer, is whether there was such a report. 
10 
 
My second question is, if there was such a report is 
there any prospect of that being made available? 
MR MANTASHE:   I am sure parliamentary people would be 
in a position to answer  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, have they got it? 
MR MANTASHE:   They drafted the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was a report drafted by parliament? 
MR MANTASHE:   Very certainly. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, that may be correct but certainly I 
am totally unaware of it and I do not think there has been 
20 
any evidence before this Commission of such a report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to indicate what structure in 
parliament or particular committee or…? 
MR MANTASHE:   Sowetan confirmed that family business – 
okay, there is the Guptas… 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 265 of 316 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   I think the only reference to the report 
that I am aware of is in that third paragraph itself. 
MR MANTASHE:   In the…? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That a report had been compiled and 
…[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   In which paragraph is that? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The third paragraph.  So the first 
paragraph: 
“ANC leaders…” 
The second paragraph: 
10 
“The Sowetan can confirm…” 
The third paragraph says: 
“A report had been compiled of all the allegations of 
how the family influenced ANC leaders to get 
business.” 
MR MANTASHE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am asking about …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   There was no such a report. 
ADV FREUND SC:   There was no such report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no such report? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   There was no such report compiled in the 
ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you have indicated that the context 
was the banks issue and Gupta companies closing down.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 266 of 316 
 
Was that really the subject matter or was the subject matter 
the allegations of Gupta influence over appointments and the 
like?  Because they seem to be very different issues. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, I do not think we could meet Guptas 
about the influence on the ministers at the department, could 
not do that, but we could meet them on the question of them 
closing business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because of potential job losses? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I want to refer to another feature of 
this report.  The 10 th paragraph starting with the words last 
month.  Do you see that paragraph? 
MR MANTASHE:   Last month, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  Now this is a report in February in 
the Sowetan referring to a report in the Sowetan the 
previous month which would be in January 2016. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I have not found such a report but I 
have not tried very hard to find it. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Which report is that? 
ADV FREUND SC:   The January 2016 report.  But what I 
want to just put to you for your comment is that the Sowetan 
alleges that you had stated that you had told that newspaper, 
the Sowetan, that the Guptas had captured individual ANC 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 267 of 316 
 
leaders and not the party itself.  Is it correct that you said 
that. 
MR MANTASHE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, the obvious question is, which 
ANC leaders? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, answered that way it means if a 
Gwede Mantashe have dealings with the Guptas and goes to 
the compound, Gwede Mantashe goes to the compound, if 
10 
the ANC is captured, Luthuli House, 6 th floor, will be the 
home of the Guptas because the people in the 6t h floor of the 
Luthuli House will spend a lot of time with the Guptas, then 
the party will be captured and we make that distinction 
because the operational floor of the ANC is the 6th floor, we 
stayed there and we made it our responsibility to protect it 
as a centre. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And is that the 6 th floor of Luthuli House 
you are referring to? 
MR MANTASHE:   That is the Secretary General’s floor. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Secretary General’s floor. 
MR MANTASHE:   And the DSG. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  And I understand and accept the 
distinction you draw between capture of individual ANC 
leaders and capture of the ANC.  I have no difficulty with that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 268 of 316 
 
distinction but nonetheless, I am going to put the question 
again, I do not know if you are willing to answer it or not and 
the question is, when you told the Sowetan that the Guptas 
had captured individual ANC leaders, which ANC leaders did 
you have in mind? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, there were quite a number of reports 
about this leader and that leader.  I will start with Fikile 
Mbalula who had confessed himself.  The others have not 
confirmed.  All I am saying is if any individual leaders of the 
ANC have found it comfortable to be captured by the Guptas, 
10 
those individual members were captured, not the African 
National Congress. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But that is if, that is not that you know 
that it is the case, it is just that if it is so, it does not mean 
that the ANC itself has been captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Switch on your mic. 
MR MANTASHE:   The ANC was not captured.  That I know, I 
can give evidence under oath that the ANC was not 
captured.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, but while you are still giving 
20 
evidence under oath, I want to know whether there is a 
Secretary General in February of 2016 whether you were 
aware that there were individual ANC leaders who had been 
captured.  There were stories around about individual ANC 
leaders having been captured. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 269 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess what you are saying is there 
were stories that certain individuals were captured. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But whether or not that was factually 
correct you know or you do not know. 
MR MANTASHE:   And we made that statement on that basis 
that if they were captured, so and so went to the compound 
and came with a bag of money or so and so slept in the 
compound or whatever.  That was not the ANC.  And in the 
operational floor of the ANC, Guptas did not stay there and 
10 
they had no dealings with us there. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  But perhaps they did not need – 
and I am not making any prejudgment of whether there was 
state capture or corruption but assuming for the purposes of 
argument that there was, perhaps they did not need to 
capture the ANC as an organisation.  If they were to capture 
senior leaders of the ANC, that might be all that was 
necessary to achieve their purposes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Stories about a number of leaders of the 
ANC captured were flying all over, okay, more worrying was 
20 
the story about the closeness of that family to the President 
but the officials of the ANC, in the top six, who had nothing 
to do with the Guptas. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ja.  Now I am very interested in what 
you have just told us, that stories were flying all over the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 270 of 316 
 
place by February 2016 of capture of the ANC leaders.  That 
has huge implications for the question that I am particularly 
interested in which is the adequacy of the manner in which 
parliament dealt with the issues that they should have dealt 
with.  Now those stories that were flying around, are those 
stories that you believe would of the probabilities have come 
to the attention of MPs who were members of portfolio 
committees of relevance, for example, the Public Enterprises 
portfolio committee, Transport committee and others?  These 
are things that you were aware of and presumably they 
10 
should have been aware of. 
MR MANTASHE:   One of the issues that we are careful 
about, we do not want to pretend to be running parliament, 
we are not running parliament and that is why when an 
allegation 
is 
made 
that 
portfolio 
committees 
were 
dysfunctional and all that, we know that there were portfolio 
committees that were very effective throughout.  Many, after 
they were a the majority, but there were portfolio committees 
that fell flat during that process and that was where the 
focus was and the same would apply to this one.  Parliament 
20 
would be aware of stories, what they do about it is another 
issue 
but 
further 
down, 
we 
began 
to 
saw 
portfolio 
committees taking up action in that regard. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Further down.  But I want to just go 
back to a comment you made a moment ago, that – I do not 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 271 of 316 
 
remember your words but it was to the effect of we, Luthuli 
House, the administration section of the African National 
Congress, we did not control parliament and parliamentary 
oversight.  Now if we accept that, the question that has arise 
is, from where do the ANC caucus get their instructions as to 
what positions to adopt on the controversial issues of the 
day? 
MR MANTASHE:   They discuss that in caucus and take 
decisions in caucus. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Are you suggesting that they are free as 
10 
a caucus without any pressure or instruction from the party 
to do whatever they deem to be appropriate. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, you had distracted my… 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is why I put to you, so you can 
correct me if I am wrong. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes.  Caucus takes decision.  If the head 
office of the ANC thinks that it must communicate a message 
to caucus, it will go to caucus. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, I did not hear you, if somebody 
wanted to go – if who wants to go? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   If the head of the office of the ANC want 
to communicate a view to caucus, it has no choice but to go 
to caucus because caucus must take that decision. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, so that would include your then 
office, the office of Secretary General? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 272 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Would from time to time go to caucus to 
convey, as it were, the position of the party which the 
…[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, I have only one office in parliament 
that I have access to, if the office of the Chief Whip of the 
party.  I do not go to the Speaker and anybody else, I have 
access to the office of the Chief Whip. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   And I want to talk to caucus, I 
10 
communicate with the Chief Whip and then go to caucus. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  And when you do that, I know you 
were then personally the Secretary General but would you do 
that because you, as Secretary General thought it was the 
appropriate thing or would you do that because you are 
actually yourself under instructions from some organ of the 
party that says you must go and talk to the caucus. 
MR MANTASHE:   I will get the sometimes directive from the 
structure of the ANC to communicate this message to the 
caucus.  I will do that, it is part of the job of the Secretary 
20 
General to do that.  But sometimes there were delegates that 
will say to the Chairperson of the ANC or sometimes the 
Deputy President, there is this important message for the 
caucus, convey it, because [indistinct] 18.32. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But those structures, would that 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 273 of 316 
 
typically be – I do not know, who would it be, would it be the 
NEC the [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MANTASHE:   Can be the ANC, it can be a NWC, it can 
be a subcommittee of the MEC dealing with a particular 
issue which may be the top six of the …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:   The top six, alright.  And there has been 
evidence of a committee which I think is referred to as the 
parliamentary committee which I – I am talking from memory 
now, I have read somewhere is a subcommittee of the NEC.  
Is that right?  Have I got that right? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   I do not know what you are talking about. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Is there a subcommittee of which you 
are aware to function, is to give political direction to 
members of parliament on controversial issues? 
MR MANTASHE:   It is not a subcommittee of the NEC, there 
is a committee in parliament of senior members of cabinet 
and the presiding officers who coordinate political work in 
parliament.  It is not a subcommittee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I think it is the political committee, is it? 
MR MANTASHE:   The political committee, yes. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  Political committee is what I meant to 
say when I said parliamentary committee. It is the political 
committee and that political committee, does it comprise 
exclusively persons who are members of parliament or does 
it include other ANC …[intervenes] 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 274 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   It is only parliamentary members. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Parliamentary members but including 
senior leadership members in parliament. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, it is chaired by the Deputy President. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chaired by the Deputy President.  And 
in the period from 2016, which we are now starting to deal 
with, that would have been the then Deputy President Cyril 
Ramaphosa, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   It is always chaired by the Deputy 
President. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Always chaired by the Deputy President. 
MR MANTASHE:   Whoever the Deputy President is. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you proceed, Mr Freund, I 
missed the part that says what this committee does. What is 
its function? 
MR MANTASHE:   That committee coordinate political work 
in parliament, that is why it is called political committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But does it do so as a structure of the 
ANC or it is a parliamentary… 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes and ANC political committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, in parliament. 
MR MANTASHE:   In parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   And it only deals with ANC issues and 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 275 of 316 
 
structures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  And I want to just recover this 
ground, I think it is important and I want there to be no room 
for misunderstanding between us.  The political committee, I 
understand you to have told us, is a committee comprising 
only members of parliament but those would include very 
senior people and would be chaired by the Deputy President 
of the party.  Am I correct so far? 
MR MANTASHE:   I do not know what you describe as 
10 
senior, there will be members of the ANC who sit on that 
committee.  Most of them would have rose in parliament.  
Your Presiding Officer in that committee, Whips in that 
committee and other members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, well I wanted to say do they go into – 
do they become eligible to be part of that committee by 
virtue of certain positions they hold in parliament? 
MR MANTASHE:   No, the ANC decides who sits in the 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   But others are eligible because of the 
roles.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR MANTASHE:   You cannot have a political committee that 
does not involve Presiding Officer. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 276 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  But the political committee would 
be chaired by the Deputy President and amongst its other 
members would be ministers, is that correct? 
MR MANTASHE:   Others are ministers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Some would be ministers.  Would some 
of them be chairs of portfolio committees? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I think you have mentioned the 
Chief Whip. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:   The Chief – the whips and the Presiding 
Officers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And the presenting (sic) officers, I will 
come back to that in a moment.  The DCJ just asked about 
the Speaker, would the Speaker also be party to that or not? 
MR MANTASHE:   That is the Presiding Officer. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is the presenting officer.  Now if you 
could explain to me …[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   Well the job of Presiding Officer is job of 
the Speakers and MA and Chairperson of the NCOP. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  So the Speaker of the National 
Assembly or the Chair of the NCOP would be regarded as 
presenting officers to the political committee. 
MR MANTASHE:   They are not Presiding Officers to the 
political committee. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 277 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they are [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR MANTASHE:   They are Presiding Officers in parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the Speaker presides in proceedings 
of the National Assembly. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why she is calling Presiding 
Officer. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Chair of the NCOP presides in 
10 
proceedings of the NCOP. 
MR MANTASHE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the two houses form parliament. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore the two officers are called 
Presiding Officers of parliament. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, I am sorry, I misheard you, I 
thought you said presenting officers, I now realise you said 
Presiding Officers, is that correct? 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   Presiding Officers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  So they would also be members 
of this political committee. 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And what I also wanted to clarify is this, 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 278 of 316 
 
that that committee on issues of political controversy would 
be 
the 
structure 
that 
would 
be 
giving 
guidance 
or 
instructions or advice at least as to what positions the 
caucus should adopt and the MPs should adopt, is that right 
or is that wrong? 
MR MANTASHE:   Politics are controversial by their nature 
so I do not know what you will regard as controversy. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, let me take the controversial out. 
MR MANTASHE:  Politics are controversial generally. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let me accept that a lot of politics is 
10 
controversial but I am trying to characterise the role of this 
committee. 
MR MANTASHE:   It coordinates political work of the ANC in 
parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, now what does that mean? 
MR MANTASHE:   Including intervening on issues of conflict 
in parliament so that not all the time when there are issues 
they will run to Luthuli House.  Parliament must deal with its 
problems there in parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Including taking decisions on 
20 
what should happen in certain parliamentary structures. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, those decisions are taken by either 
structures of the ANC or by caucus. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So would be an example of the sort of 
issue that would go to the political committee? 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 279 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there is tension between the Speaker 
and Chair of the NCOP would that be the kind of issue? 
MR MANTASHE:   The cabinet will intervene in that 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Facilitate a resolution. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, but I asked for an example. 
MR MANTASHE:   I want you to ask what you want to ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there was to be – if there was a political 
issue or debate that is maybe national, that is attracting the 
10 
attention of a large section of the nation or the nation and it 
appeared as if maybe different people or members of 
parliament are speaking in the media about this issue in 
different ways and would that be the kind of thing that the 
political committee would say look, come here all of you, on 
this issue, this is the line, or what? 
MR MANTASHE:   That problem, if government members, 
cabinet 
members, 
talk 
at 
cross 
purposes, 
that 
is 
a 
presidential issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   It is the cabinet of the President who must 
deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But if it were to be an ANC 
issue, then it could. 
MR MANTASHE:   It depends where it happens. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 280 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   If it happens in parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   Government would have responsibility 
over it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:   If it is a general ANC problem, the ANC 
structures here have the responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, let me ask this question.  We have 
10 
started to deal – and we are going to deal in more detail 
shortly with the ever-increasing crescendo of allegations in 
relation to Guptas, state capture, improper influence and we 
are going to be looking, not only through your evidence but 
the Commission more generally, at the way in which 
parliament responded to that.  Now is that the sort of issue 
in your judgment that you would expect to be taken to and 
considered and addressed and resolved by the political 
committee or not? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, if there is something happening in 
20 
energy, the portfolio committee on energy will deal with it.  If 
it happens on transport, the portfolio committee on transport 
will deal with it.  It is a parliament issue, it is not an ANC 
issue. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  But if the political issue of the day 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 281 of 316 
 
is allegations that people outside of state structures are 
exercising improper influence over leadership figures inside 
state structures in order corruptly to benefit themselves – I 
mean, this is a political issue of the utmost importance and I 
am trying to understand how the ANC decision-making 
process would take place on the question of how to address 
and in particular from the perspective of parliament. 
MR MANTASHE:   The decision-making process of the ANC 
are very clear, they go to the NWC, go to the NEC and the 
NEC take decisions. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And can you tell us whether in the first 
quarter of 2016 either the NWC or the NEC considered and 
addressed the allegations of state capture which were then 
widely circulated? 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And what did they, if anything, do 
about that? 
MR MANTASHE:   The first thing was to do investigation 
and the Secretariat’s office was given that responsibility.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   That will open that, they will come 
forward, let us have a discussion, what are the issues.  I 
am saying we had a total of eight submissions, and those 
submissions, we said give us in writing, people did not give 
us in writing only Mr Masako gave it to us in writing.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 282 of 316 
 
Then we resolved that listen, quite clearly there is 
suspicion in the ANC people do not want to do anything 
that is career limiting, or they fear being persecuted, they 
do not want to give submissions.  Then we said we are 
giving you the right to go to an independent and seek 
questions of State. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, let us just place on the record 
the facts that a well-known and put this conversation we 
are having in context.  Now BC Jonas's statements, where 
he claims to be offered rights by the Gupta’s to do certain 
10 
things if he accepted a certain position, it is allegations of 
bribery.  
Barbara Hogan’s public statements, that what was 
now being alleged and surprise, for reasons which she then 
gave.  Those were allegations made by senior members of 
the ANC structures, and they were allegations of serious 
consequence if they were true, do you agree? 
MR MANTASHE:   One of the things that was sensitive 
between the ANC is to have a description of senior and 
junior to leaders of the ANC, we do not do that because it 
20 
pays false superiority, let us start from there. 
Of the eight, Jonas was one of them he did not give 
us a written statement. He came to the Commission, we 
welcome 
that 
because 
we 
said 
go 
to 
independent 
institutions 
and 
he 
chose 
the 
Commission 
and 
we 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 283 of 316 
 
welcomed 
that, 
because 
there 
was 
no 
faith 
in 
the 
processes in the ANC for him as a senior member of the 
ANC. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, you have told the Commission 
earlier this morning, maybe early this afternoon, that you 
lack powers to compel testimony and I am sure that your 
right when you say that.  You cannot subpoena people, you 
cannot force them to testify, you cannot subject them to 
interrogation unless they consent to it.  But that is not true 
of Parliament, is it?  Parliament has those powers.  
10 
MR MANTASHE:   Yes, when I was Secretary General I was 
not 
running 
Parliament, 
Parliament 
has 
all 
these 
institutional mechanisms of forcing people to do things to 
summon people and all that.  In the ANC, we are a 
voluntary organisation we do not have those powers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, I understand that but there have 
been suggestions and allegations in the evidence before 
this Commission.  That within the caucus of the ANC, in 
this period there was amongst a significant number of the 
MP’s apprehension and concern that if they were to pursue 
20 
investigations in relation to these allegations through the 
Portfolio Committees, for example, they would be seen as 
disloyal 
to 
the 
party, 
and 
they 
would 
be 
exposing 
themselves to career prejudice.  
Would that be a legitimate position for them to hold 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 284 of 316 
 
or not?  
MR MANTASHE:   No, actually what you want me to do is 
to figure out the feeling of a colleague, I cannot figure that 
out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think, I am not sure if that is what 
he seeks to establish Mr Mantashe, but I think he may be 
asking whether to the extent that they may have been ANC 
MP’s who felt like that, whether you would think that they 
had proper grounds to feel like that. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, the reason I cannot imagine their 
10 
feelings it is because there were no such a directive from 
the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is important, ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   So on the basis of that fear that it will 
be seen as is something that, I must battle to assume 
because there is no such a directive in the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you saying the ANC had not done 
anything or said anything that should have made anybody 
feel like that. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, no, the ANC has not done anything 
20 
and told nobody to fear anything.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Were you aware that a motion was put 
in Parliament in September of 2016 by an opposition party, 
that there should be an ad hoc Committee to investigate 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 285 of 316 
 
these 
allegations 
of 
State 
Capture 
and 
corruption, 
specifically linked to Gupta’s, the need to summons them 
and other related persons and that on mass, the entire 
ANC caucus voted against that. 
MR MANTASHE:   A motion is put by the opposition and it 
was voted by the ANC caucus. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It was opposed by the ANC caucus.  In 
other words, there is an opportunity for the exercise of the 
Parliamentary powers that the ANC caucus says, no. 
MR MANTASHE:   I want to understand this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, a motion of – a certain motion, note 
of no confidence, a certain motion is put before the 
National Assembly, to say the National Assembly should 
resolve that an inquiry…[intervene] 
ADV FREUND SC:   An ad hoc Committee should be 
appointed to do an inquiry to these allegations. 
 CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, an ad hoc Committee should be 
established of Parliament to investigate certain allegations 
relating to the Gupta’s and when the voting takes place on 
that motion almost all members of the ANC vote against 
20 
that motion.  I think that is what he is talking about. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is what I am talking about, I am 
asking whether you even knew of that. 
MR MANTASHE:   I do not know if I knew about that 
because processes in Parliament were not run from Luthuli 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 286 of 316 
 
House where I was stationed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, yes and no, when there was a 
vote of no confidence motion you very much interfered or 
very much influenced that. 
MR MANTASHE:   Coming to that, ask a direct and I will 
answer to it.  The vote of no confidence come to it directly 
so that I can give you an appropriate answer.  Parliament 
take decisions in caucus, they execute them.  They do not 
phone Luthuli House can we do this, they discuss and 
assess the risks themselves, take decisions themselves. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, I apologise if I interrupted you a 
moment ago. 
MR MANTASHE:   I will come to the vote of no confidence 
if you want that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am coming to that, there were a 
series of votes of no confidence, I think some eight that 
were put in President Zuma, not all of which were pushed 
all the way. We have all the details, dates, and so forth but 
in the circumstances, I do not think it is necessary to go 
through all of that.  
20 
And 
my 
personal 
impression 
as 
an 
outsider 
watching this, is that initially, they really had very little 
prospect of being taken seriously but as time went by, 
particularly as one moved into 2016 and 2017 there was 
more and more political pressure.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 287 of 316 
 
But from the South African public frankly for these 
votes of no confidence to be seriously considered on their 
merits, because many people took the view that there was 
substance in the complaints that were being raised.  
Now my question to you arising from that is whether 
you agree that that was factually correct and if you do 
agree, why was it that you felt it appropriate, essentially to 
instruct 
caucus 
not 
to 
support 
such 
votes 
of 
no 
confidence? 
MR MANTASHE:   I deal with that in my introductory 
10 
comments, that removal of a certain President of the ANC 
is very serious matter.  Some party called ATM has two 
members in Parliament is having a vote of no confidence 
against Cyril Ramaphosa, the sitting President.  
That is what we are dealing with every day. That 
was they simply think that they can put a motion of no 
confidence, we will go for an assumption option, we will 
pull the polls over the ANC, kill it, and hope that things will 
go well in future. Our attitude is that the issue of a sitting 
President is a political matter, it is a party matter because 
20 
if you destroy that pillar of the organisation and of the 
government, you are going to find many issues you will 
deal with as consequences.  
I told you that one time the ANC itself recalled a 
President and all the Ministers had resignation letters in 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 288 of 316 
 
their hands because that President appointed then to 
cabinet until the incoming President had to say stay put, 
well let us have a discussion and re-appointed them.  
So we take it serious the issue that we can just by 
vote of no confidence by the opposition fire a sitting 
President and have no options to look at.  We take it 
serious, but it is one area that within that it is mischief that 
we should resist all the time.  
And I went to Parliament and told members of the 
ANC do not vote for a removal of a sitting President, nine 
10 
ANC members voted with the opposition, nine of them. Who 
they are we do not know, know only one, Makotsi Kotze.  
The only reason that we know that she did that is 
because after doing that she went public in the media that 
I voted against the ANC, which was ill-discipline in itself, 
because it is a secret ballot that will go ahead and nine 
voted with the opposition.  We did not go to investigate 
who that nine is because we said okay.  There is only one 
instance, where members of the ANC were allowed to 
follow their conscience in voting. It was when we had three 
20 
Parliamentarians who voted against abortion in legislation, 
they were allowed by the ANC to follow their conscience on 
the basis of religious consciousness and understanding 
they were allowed. 
In things like this, of removing a President, the ANC 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 289 of 316 
 
will do everything in his power not to split this process, 
because we're going campaign to go to parliament on a list 
of the ANC.  Now everyone that arrive there they become 
individuals will have no party.  If a person thinks that he is 
bigger than the ANC, that person must feel to leave the 
ANC, we fill that list because we are a party in party 
political system. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I understand the political 
problems that can arise of a vote of no confidence in a 
President.  The first and most obvious one is that that 
10 
President must set aside.  The second is that when the 
vote of no confidence is in the President, it follows that the 
cabinet must resign.  
But what then follows, of course, is the governing 
party, the ruling party selects another President and that 
President appoints a cabinet.  So it is not an impossible 
situation.  I accept it is a serious situation not to be 
unlikely but surely, if there are substantial grounds, it is an 
if - there are substantial grounds that justify the concerns 
about the President, it is the appropriate thing to do. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:   The ANC has the experience more than 
any party they removed two certain presidents out of its 
own followship because there were issues, so that let’s 
take that decision.   The difference is that when the ANC 
does that it looks into all the consequences and the 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 290 of 316 
 
realities, talk to that President and absorb the tensions 
and go ahead and do that and understand what we are 
going to do.  But if we can open Presidents of the ANC to 
be sitting ducks that opposition party must come with a 
vote of no confidence and therefore they are gone.  I can 
assure you Mr Chairperson if there is another vote of no 
confidence now I will go to Parliament and say it is 
unacceptable to remove your own president on the basis of 
a vote of no confidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s talk about that Mr Mantashe.  
10 
Do you see no tension as the party when for argument sake 
let us say the – an opposition party that has put forward a 
motion of no confidence in the president of the country, 
who is President of the ANC, has advanced, let us say for 
argument sake and for now I am not talking about any 
particular person or any particular president just think for 
argument sake has put in grounds for that motion that a 
plausible, you see no attention in the instruction from the 
ANC to a member of the ANC who is a member of 
parliament to say thou shall no vote in support of this 
20 
motion.   In circumstances where that member may believe 
or believes that it is in the interest of the country, the 
Republic, remember the oath of office that they take, that 
now in the light of all the grounds that had been put 
forward leave out that they have been put forward by an 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 291 of 316 
 
opposition party, I believe there are two that this President 
should be voted out of office, you believe that there is no 
attention between that instruction and the oath of office? 
MR MANTASHE:   As the Secretary General who runs a 
party I will know that we allow a free vote on a vote of no 
confidence we will deal with a crises immediately, that is 
what we will be hunting for.   
 
Let me give you the behaviour of political activists.   
If the majority of the ANC members go and vote for the 
removal of their president it does not fall logically that they 
10 
can put another one and have a president, it doesn’t follow 
logically, because it will create tensions in the party, such 
that an opposition may nominate somebody in retaliation 
...[indistinct] of that opposition and have an opposition 
president.  All those consequences are analysed in the 
party, because we are running a party and the party 
contest elections and the party goes to government and 
that party elects a president who is voted in Parliament by 
its members and other members but any call for the ANC to 
fire its second President because ...[indistinct] call them 
20 
ANC because when those opposition parties do not remove 
their leaders who are nowhere to be seen even in 
Parliament, but they have a guts of saying to the ANC fire 
your president. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what if ...[intervenes]  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 292 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:   It is a political issue Mr Chairperson I 
am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:   It is not just a superficial technical legal 
issue, it is a political issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   You collapse your party and hope that it 
will survive, that’s the option of your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that.   Notionally it ought to 
be possible to have a situation even with the context of a 
10 
motion of no confidence in the President to have a 
situation where what is in the interest of the ruling party or 
government party, the majority party, might not be in the 
interest of the Republic, based on your – based on your 
answer it seems to me that you may be saying it will 
always be against the interest of the governing party or its 
members to vote on the basis of how they see the interest 
of the Republic in that context. 
MR MANTASHE:   That – you know that question has been 
put to us 101 times. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:   Is it the ANC first or the country first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  And I am saying it is the country but we 
are in that government of the country to the ANC when I 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 293 of 316 
 
am standing ...[indistinct] I have a responsibility to keep 
the ANC intact for it to have the vibrancy and the capacity 
to govern. 
 
Now you can take it that it is not in the interest of 
the country to just destroy the ANC now and you ask me to 
cooperate in that because it is in the interest of the 
country to destroy the ANC, obviously it will be a huge call 
for any ANC member to destroy the ANC because he thinks 
it is in the interest of the country.   You are exercising your 
right in government through the ANC, until what the 
10 
judgment has given us, the constituency system and other 
things 
maybe 
at 
that 
point 
there 
may 
be 
serious 
consideration, but at this point in time we are having a 
political system that is a party political system. 
 
Now if you say the ANC, and I am sure this call will 
never be made to any other party, it can only be made to 
the ANC, and you say to the ANC go and break your pillars, 
kill yourself, you will wake up again, you are a strong 
party.  We will know that is not real and that is why we go 
to the election every five years to test if we still have that 
20 
support, but we go to those elections every five years, 
once we are elected people will oppose that and they 
come, they tell us that listen fire this president of yours 
and collapse your structures and you agree to that 
politically it will be a disaster. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 294 of 316 
 
 
That is why the alternative is that when there is a 
big ...[indistinct] the ANC must be able to take a decision 
to recall its president. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  No that I think up to a certain 
point I can understand a situation where the ruling party 
says if there is a feeling amongst members of Parliament, 
whether it is only opposition party members or a mix the 
person should go if they are voted no confidence.  We are 
reluctant that a president of the ruling party who is 
president of the country should be removed in that way at 
10 
the insistence of an opposition party, but that would – the 
difficulty would be mitigated if the party would then put in 
motion a process to establish whether there are real 
grounds on the basis of which the President should be 
removed, in which case then if its own processes show that 
there are proper grounds and it can either do that 
internally or it can itself if it were to see fit, put in the 
motion so that the motion doesn’t come from the opposition 
party, in which case it has done its own work, it knows that 
removing the president is not going to cost any huge 
20 
problems in the party.   I am saying ...[intervenes] 
MR MANTASHE:   No, even when the party does it, it 
causes 
problems, 
you 
know 
when 
we 
removed 
the 
President for the first time we had 37 ...[indistinct] in 
Parliament of a party called COPE reflecting disagreement 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 295 of 316 
 
on that action, and we had 37 sets in Parliament that were 
not in the ANC, that was the first massive decline of the 
ANC in Parliament.  We did it for the second time and 
those ...[indistinct] happened but ructions within the party 
is reflective of the importance of a certain president being 
removed, I can tell you with my eyes closed you allow an 
opposition party to say remove your president and you 
remove that president there will be a massive split in the 
ANC and collapse, it is ...[indistinct] option and I am 
saying it is bad of the ANC to take the ...[indistinct] option, 
10 
it may have been good for ...[indistinct] to collapse those 
pillars because it was in the hands of the enemy but to 
collapse pillars around yourself deliberately is a disastrous 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see as I see it then your 
difficult, or the position you take the problems that you say 
would arise if the President of the country, the President of 
the ANC is removed when an opposition party has put in a 
motion of no confidence and that is supported by the ANC 
would still occur even if the ANC removes that President 
20 
without – outside of Parliament and without an opposition 
party, just as you say it happened when you – the ANC 
removed this for the first time there was COPE, you say 
the second time there was no party that was created, but 
the problem would still arise even if there is no opposition 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 296 of 316 
 
party involved and the question that arises for me is your 
concern as the ruling party about the challenges that are 
going to – that may arise if the president is removed, even 
if he is removed or she is removed by the party itself, 
those problems might put the party in a situation where it 
cannot act against actions or wrongdoing that it should act 
against because it is scared that those problems will arise 
and as long as the party is seen by its own members that it 
cannot act because it is scared of a splinter party and what 
else, then those who might be involved in wrongdoing feel 
10 
that they are not under any pressure. 
MR MANTASHE:   No, ...[indistinct] Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR 
MANTASHE: 
 
 
We 
will 
...[indistinct] 
that 
price 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  And with experience, we understand what 
we are encouraged to do, I hope this Commission is not 
doing that, is that leaders of the ANC must be at the mercy 
of anybody, and therefore we do not have an ANC, and I 
20 
am saying as a party head in my bigger part of my life 
taking that decision will be cutting your nose to spite – to 
spite your face.    
 
That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Those who know English will tell us. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 297 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes you are telling the world that we are 
holier than thou, we are good, you are correct and the 
consequences of that you will destroy your party.  Now and I 
am saying that advice we take it with a pinch of salt from 
whoever it comes from because difficulties of dealing with 
leadership of the ANC I was telling somebody I said if the 
ANC would charge me today [indistinct] a decision [?] but if 
you 
go 
and 
cheat 
the 
President 
of 
the 
ANC 
the 
consequences will tell you that you have committed suicide 
so you committed suicide.   
10 
The difference when the ANC does it at least there is 
an internal discussion in the ANC on the reason for that 
action.  When people are not convinced you see a hope.  
When people understand even if they say ja nee they limp on 
but problems creep into the organisation.  So any advice that 
says we must allow the opposition to just take a resolution 
that we are going to compare them on the principle the ANC 
via him.  If you say we must accept that as normal policy I 
can tell you now it is a bad advice you will be given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if it – for me it is – this discussion is 
20 
very important. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mantashe so because it is important for 
one to understand what the challenges are within the ANC 
when people who are outside may be expecting it to deal 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 298 of 316 
 
with certain situations in a necessary manner.   
But let me ask that attitude on the part of the party to 
say members of the ANC must not vote in support of a 
motion of no confidence put in by – tabled by an opposition 
party because of the challenges that you have identified it 
does not apply – does it apply – it does not apply I assume 
to other decisions it is just the issue of the motion of no 
confidence in the President?  Or maybe also motion of no 
confidence in the Cabinet because I think the constitution 
applies it. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  In many decisions as the MP’s are allowed 
to think and take decisions but there are decisions that are 
actually cutting at the cut of the butter.  Those decisions are 
political and the party must take political decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so is my understanding then of your 
evidence correct that you are saying a motion of no 
confidence in the President or any decision in Parliament 
that would result in the removal of the President or it could 
be an impeachment as opposed to motion of no confidence 
that is something special on that the political party will 
20 
intervene saying this is the direction insofar as voting is 
concerned for its members but for other decisions generally 
speaking the party leaves that to its MP’s to think, apply 
their minds and make decisions? 
MR MANTASHE:  In [indistinct] in applying their mind. That 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 299 of 316 
 
is where the importance of a caucus is.  That ANC members 
must pursued each other to a particular direction.  And agree 
on a decision – I am agreeing on the decision.   
That is important if you run a party in the system that 
we are having of a political party system because if your 
political party is falling apart you will not make the impact in 
the system. So you have a responsibility as Secretary 
General to ensure that that party is kept intact if there are 
contradictions deal with those contradictions within the 
structures of the party.   
10 
But if you take contradictions out and you play with 
00:04:55 that is why the worst thing that can happen is that 
always happens with the ANC is when ANC members go out 
public and attack each other in public.  It is the worst thing 
that happens with the ANC because we know that when that 
happens it has no chance of strengthening the ANC.   
It will only weaken the ANC and splinter it into small 
factions and can collapse and the opposition that is 
encouraging us to take the [indistinct] option will smile from 
end to end. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to follow up on when you say – when 
you talk about the discussion at caucus in the caucus among 
ANC members and where you say there is members of the 
ANC must try to pursued one other and agree you are not 
saying are you that for example members of the ANC in 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 300 of 316 
 
different political – in different portfolio committees are 
obliged to only articulate in their respective political – 
portfolio committees decisions as taken at caucus and they 
are not free to take their own views or are you saying it 
depends on the issues? 
MR MANTASHE:  Chairperson the ANC is a political party. It 
has policies.  It develops them over a long period in a very 
long process.  People who go to Parliament on the ANC list 
first and foremost understand those policies.  They go there 
on the basis of executing at the implementation of those 
10 
policies.  That is the first thing. 
 
And therefore on policies matters as policies of the 
ANC that have gone through the policies and you are a 
Parliamentarian to promote this policy because that is what 
is in your manifesto. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  That is the policy that you use to win 
votes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Therefore that the point is that MP’s must 
20 
understand the portfolio [indistinct] first of the ANC they 
must understand policies of the ANC and those policies must 
guide Parliamentarians.  If there is something unique out of 
this world that comes they have a duty to go to caucus and 
discuss and actually try to get views on a number of issues.  
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 301 of 316 
 
And I can give you many examples of those issues that come 
and almost divide us and we have to intervene and say no 
engage and one day you must just wear something that will 
not make worse or recognise you go to the caucus of the 
ANC and you see how robust that caucus is because that 
caucus is not a question of just brushing each other, force 
each other to do those things.  It is robust, people engage, 
people think and people pursued and that is what we are 
saying is the starting point.  But these free votes on certain 
issues maybe yes but I am saying … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
On 
policy 
matters 
the 
position 
is 
(inaudible) 
MR MANTASHE:  To the policy of the ANC you see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
 MR MANTASHE:  On political matters that affect directly the 
heart of the ANC we cannot allow a free for all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But certainly I would imagine I guess – I 
guess the policy of the ANC is clear on corruption – no 
corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is clear. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore there should be no debates 
about any member of the ANC in their portfolio committees 
taking a strong stand against anything that looks like 
corruption. 
MR MANTASHE:  Yes. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 302 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  I do not want to take this 
particular debate much further but just a few points arising.  
Mr Mantashe are there not situations where there can be a 
conflict between the interest and the party and interest of the 
nation?   
Put it differently when a MP takes an oath of office to 
respect and promote the constitutional values and interests 
of the nation and I am paraphrasing is it not so that that MP 
actually is duty bound to apply that MP’s own mind to where 
10 
do the interests of the nation lie?  And are there not 
situations in a corruption scenario where if the party is not 
removing the President it is quite appropriate to say my 
judgment call is that the interests of the nation and the 
constitutional values require me to support such a vote.  Do 
you – do you wholly reject that argument? 
MR MANTASHE:  Mr Chairperson I am in Parliament now for 
three years – for three years yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not very long experience compared 
to others. 
20 
MR MANTASHE:  That is a very short experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  But I am looking forward to a day where 
any opposition party displays its roots.  I never had that 
experience even on straight forward issues where there is a 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 303 of 316 
 
budget vote that has been agreed in the portfolio committee.  
Budget changes that will vote against that budget vote and 
opposite party without fail vote against that budget vote.  
That is why we will sometimes have a sense that there is an 
effort to divide the ANC instead of towing to principles that 
must apply across the board.   
Why should it be ANC MP’s were encouraged to vote 
as they like but I have never seen even when I was SG 
[indistinct gradually was to open channel 8 to Parliament I 
have never seen opposition parties splitting their votes.   
10 
And my own is that if you talk about those principles 
let us talk about principles that cut across and not have 
principles and policies that are directed at a government but 
there must be principles that cut across. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think in terms of logic Mr 
Mantashe I think you would agree in terms of logic that there 
must be situations where the opinion of one or more 
members of Parliament let us leave out whether they are 
ANC or what they are might be that the interests of the 
Republic dictate that they should vote in a certain way on a 
20 
certain matter and voting in a certain way or voting in that 
way might not be what the party from which they come would 
like or might not be seen by the party bosses as being in the 
interest of the party.  I – talking out about the principle 
leaving out whether it is ANC or whatever party my thinking 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 304 of 316 
 
is that you would accept that proposition. 
MR MANTASHE:  The – in principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  That is why when there were nine members 
of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  That voted for the removal of the 
President. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  Would they investigate, would they… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTASHE:  We only suspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  Which would be so and so and so and so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  
MR MANTASHE:  So it has happened to the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  It has happened to the ANC 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MANTASHE:  But the point I am making is that how do 
you come to that determination on the issue because I think 
we should demystify the feeling that what is in the interest of 
the ANC is against the interest of the state?  Who must… 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 305 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You state or nation or Republic or – ja. 
MR MANTASHE:  Ja you must demystify that.  But the ANC 
has no interests of the Republic it has its own interest.  I 
think we must demystify that.  That is why coming to that 
determination even on issues that has been in the interest of 
the state it should come through a process of discussion in 
the party as other parties will do.  Now the point I am making 
is that I think there can be no assumption made that 
anything that is needed by the ANC is understated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no.  It cannot be. 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It cannot be.  But I think because you 
answered the question the way you answer it in terms of the 
principle positively that should enable Mr Freund to see if he 
wants to take it further. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well Chair given the time of night I was 
really proposing to move to a different question but of course 
once there is – once the principle is established. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Then the legitimacy of a party member 
20 
voting in accordance with that party’s – with that member’s 
assessment of the interest of the nation I want to put to you 
for your comment is not as you called it the worse betrayal 
but in fact the execution of the member’s duty – duty to the 
country, duty as a Parliamentarian, duty in terms of the oath 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 306 of 316 
 
of office of a Parliamentarian. 
MR MANTASHE:  I agree on an ANC list you have a duty to 
strengthen that ANC that you are in the list of.  You are not a 
free rider or a – in a free range that because you are in 
Parliament there [indistinct] of the nation if you are a free 
rider you can do as you wish.  You are on a party list. I know 
of parties in Parliament that fires its MP’s at the slightest 
provocation if they do not do what the party says.  I know of 
them.   
We are not going to bring them here but there are a 
10 
few instances where we saw good Parliamentarians kicked 
out of Parliament because they defy a party on a frivolous 
matter.   
All I am saying is that as you do that you must 
appreciate that you on the ANC list, you are in Parliament, 
you are expected to respect the constitution and all the 
obligations that go with that as a MP but you are not a free 
rider.   
You are not in a free range where you do as you like 
otherwise if that advocates will help us we would not have 
20 
caucuses.  Political parties have caucuses because they 
appreciate the political party system that puts them together 
into that Parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair I do not propose to take that line of 
questioning any further. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 307 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Unless you wish me to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is fine.   
ADV FREUND SC:  I want to try and wrap up on this present 
line of questioning which as it were a chronological line of 
questioning.  And I want to just explain to you certain 
evidence that the commission has heard and then I am going 
to ask you to comment on it.   
 
The commission has heard evidence that certain 
opposition members attempted to pursued certain portfolio 
10 
committees, investigate certain allegations, corruption, state 
capture and the like and could not get the – could not get 
those committees to agree to investigate so it is alleged.   
 
Secondly there has been evidence that we referred to 
earlier today of an attempt in the National Assembly to ask a 
motion to establish an ad-hoc committee to investigate these 
allegations of state capture rejected. 
 
That takes us to about September of 2016.  In June 
of 2017 Mr Frolick who was the Chair of Chairs in Parliament 
wrote letters to four portfolio committee Chairs saying these 
20 
allegations should now be investigated in your committees 
as a matter of urgency.  That is the background that I want to 
explain to you. 
 
Now the question is this do you have any knowledge 
as to why having resisted up until September 2017 – 2016 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 308 of 316 
 
Parliamentary efforts to investigate these things all of a 
sudden in May and June of 2017 there is an about face – 
there is whole new position adopted within ANC members of 
Parliament, do you have any insight into that? 
MR MANTASHE:  I can only answer that question by 
describing it.  That hence you do not go and instruct portfolio 
committee to do things other than to take decision.  But if 
the opposition party moves a motion if there is no [indistinct] 
to pursue anybody the ANC must instruct its members in 
portfolio committees to support that motion.  That is my 
10 
understanding of the essence (inaudible) the opposition 
move a motion that they must (inaudible) insight.  I do not 
know the things. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes but let us assume for the purposes 
of the question we accept that the ANC until a certain 
position – oh sorry are you still answering?  I have 
interrupted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can continue. 
MR MANTASHE:  I want to say Chairperson (speaking in 
vernacular). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have to say that in English so Mr 
Freund hears. 
MR MANTASHE:  (Speaking in vernacular) that means you 
sit on mouth as I talk. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I am sorry. I apologise. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 309 of 316 
 
MR MANTASHE:  You see the point I am making is that we 
have taken MP’s in portfolio committees they come across 
various issues, they apply their minds, they take decisions 
okay.  Now it does not follow automatically that if opposition 
moves 
a 
motion 
it 
must 
be 
supported. 
Members 
of 
Parliament where as that portfolio committee will meet and 
think and take it a decision.  It is ironical that there is an 
experience that the [indistinct] to start them to accept that 
notion.   
But the ANC must not tell its MP’s not to vote in a 
10 
particular way that is a – that is a contradiction in terms – 
serious contradiction in terms.   
My understanding of how the policy works I think all 
opposition parties pays Jackson Mthembo and how we are 
related to them.   For only one reason he understood the 
value of walking, go to political party and explain a 
proposition and then move to the next one and try to 
reconcile decision.   
Opposition parties do not have that opportunity they 
do not do that.  Even if there is a good motion they are 
20 
hoping to [indistinct] to supporting that.  There – it does not 
work that way they must get out of their offices, go to other 
political parties including the ANC to speak to them that 
listen we have this motion, this is the purpose of this motion 
and convince the ANC.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 310 of 316 
 
By the time there is a formal motion you have done 
your work.  Jackson Mthembu may his soul rest in peace was 
a master of that you see and in that way he made a lot of 
progress in difficult areas because outside of the formal 
processes he went to [indistinct] and pursued them to 
support a position.  Opposition parties must appreciate their 
responsibility to pursue other parties to their position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well based on what you have said except 
in respect of a motion of no confidence in the President.  
Based on what you have said in regard to portfolio 
10 
committees and how members of the ANC are supposed to 
take part and vote I am getting the impression that you are 
saying that members of the ANC must apply their minds to 
what is before them and take decisions on the basis of the 
merits or demerits of what is before them.  So I ask the 
question whether it is seen as a bad thing within the ANC for 
an ANC member of Parliament to in a portfolio committee for 
example to go along with proposals from an opposition party 
if he or she thinks they have merits. 
MR MANTASHE:  ANC MP’s have agreed with opposition 
20 
parties on [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:  But the tendency is when they happen to 
disagree with a particular motion then the voice goes up loud 
of the ANC this ANC that. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 311 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Using his security. 
MR MANTASHE:  Because with his almost blackmailing the 
ANC into accepting anything that comes from the opposition 
without applying its mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MANTASHE:  And I think if that can change we will have 
a happy life in Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I think you may have misunderstood what 
I was trying to enquire about when I contrasted the position 
10 
in September 2016 with the position in mid-2017.  I am not 
focussing on ANC suggestions – I mean on retracted I am 
not focussing on opposition, proposals or motions or 
anything of the like because the decision to start these 
investigations in Parliament in June of 2017 did not come 
from the opposition it came from the ruling party.   
It came according to the evidence of Mr Frolick from 
instructions that he received which I am not entirely sure 
who was party to the creation of those instructions but they – 
he said included the then Speaker Baleka Mbete the then 
20 
Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu but I have the impression and 
others as well so the evidence that we have from an ANC MP 
who actually issued this – these sets of letters says I was 
told that I should now convey to these portfolio committee – 
yes they should commence these investigations.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 312 of 316 
 
This is quite alike what had happened before that in 
2012/2013/2016 nothing like that had ever happened before.  
But in mid-2017 the ruling party seems to have taken the 
initiative to say we need through Parliament to investigate 
these allegations and they are not new allegations they are 
allegations that have been around a long time.   
My question to you is whether you have any 
knowledge that explains why at that time the ruling party 
took that initiative and if you do why it did not take a similar 
initiative much earlier? 
10 
MR MANTASHE:  I was not part of that decision.  I can only 
make an assumption that earlier it looked into the question 
and came to a different conclusion.  Then they may – life 
evolved and conditions developed and made an analysis 
came to a different conclusion.  Now it is an assumption. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I hear you it is an assumption. 
MR MANTASHE:  I have no facts, I do not know what you are 
talking about but if you take a particular decision and later 
you take another decision life has evolved and therefore the 
situation is in front of you have changed and you come to a 
20 
different conclusion. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair that completes that line of 
examination.  What remains to be traversed is the content of 
Mr Magashule’s affidavit which has been adopted by Mr 
Mantashe and then expanded upon on certain issues by Mr 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 313 of 316 
 
Mantashe.   
Those issues are of fairly considerable importance 
and they are not all simple issues.  Now I am in your hands 
as to how you wish to deal with that.  I can try to deal with it 
fairly quickly this evening or we can recognise that perhaps 
we are tired and that we need to set aside an evening or 
whatever on another occasion or I could start it and see how 
far I get but I am just indicating to you now at ten to eight 
that I am now going to turn to that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got an estimate of how much 
10 
time they would need if they were to be done properly? 
ADV FREUND SC:  You know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or fairly properly. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I can only answer this way.  When… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Taking into account my own interventions. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Leaving that aside Chair.  When this 
particular 
session 
was 
first 
contemplated 
it 
was 
contemplated to deal only with one question which was the 
considered position of the leadership of the African National 
Congress as represented by our senior office bearer on – to 
20 
what 
extent 
it 
was 
accepted, 
there 
were 
need 
for 
improvements on parliamentary oversight and what would 
be best forms for that type of improvement to be.  And of 
course, there are some related issues which are things, 
like, close lists and constituencies and there are all sorts

of other related issues.  And when that was contemplated, I 
personally thought that would be day’s evidence.  So one 
answer to your question is, it is a day’s evidence.   
 
One might take a different view.  One might say, 
actually, these documents speaks for themselves because 
we have explored with other witnesses many, but not all, of 
the issues and if we have the affidavits and we have them 
and they are confirmed under oath by Mr Mantashe, he may 
take a view it is not necessary but your question, I am 
afraid, is a bit like the question, how long is the stream? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I could easily take a day but if you tell 
me I have got ten minutes, I will do it in ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I know you have been standing 
there for a long time and I know that Mr Mantashe has 
been dealing with questions the whole day.  Maybe what 
we should do...  Well, I would imagine that it should be 
possible to do justice to them without going beyond two 
hours.  Is my assessment ...[intervenes]  
ADV FREUND SC:   I think that can be done. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let me put it the other way around. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   If you say to me:  Mr Freund, do it in 
two hours. 
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374 
 
Page 315 of 316 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Do what you can in two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I will take two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I am thinking that maybe we 
should adjourned and then we try and find an evening 
during April because I want to try and avoid oral evidence 
that goes into May.  I have already allowed the President 
to 
go into 
May.  
So if 
we find 
an 
evening 
when 
Mr Mantashe comes.  If he came at five o’clock, we should 
10 
be done by seven o’clock.  Then we are done. 
ADV FREUND SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think that is what we should do.  
Mr Mantashe, does that sound fine with you? 
MR MANTASHE:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.   
ADV FREUND SC:   I certainly have no difficulties.  I 
support this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay.  No, I think let us do it 
that way.  So let us adjourn then for the day.  Thank you, 
20 
Mr Mantashe and thank you to the ANC’s legal team and 
thank you Mr Freund and your team and the staff of the 
Commission and the technicians that we have been able to 
work right into the evening to try and finish the work of the 
Commission.   
14 APRIL 2021 – DAY 374

For the benefit of the public, I must just mention 
that tomorrow I will hear evidence from Mr Nkwinti, the 
former Minister.  That is the witness for tomorrow.  So, 
otherwise then, an arrangement will be made for when 
Mr Mantashe will come back to complete his evidence.  
Thank you.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 15 APRIL 2021
